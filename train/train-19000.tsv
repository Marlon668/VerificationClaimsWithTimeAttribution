pomt-13960	"He leant his name to a bill, did little or nothing three years ago to try to get it passed, (and) since then has done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/15/katie-mcginty/pat-toomeys-gun-control-bill-and-katie-mcgintys-po/	Republican Sen. Pat Toomey won praise from Democrats (yes, you read that right) in 2013 when he put his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks after 26 people, including 20 children, were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The bill would have required a background check on all gun sales, including at gun shows and on the Internet with an exemption for sales between family and friends. But despite support from Toomey, the conservative from Pennsylvania, the bill narrowly failed the Senate in April 2013 as families from Newtown, Conn. looked on. Now, Toomey’s up for re-election and his Democratic opponent is hammering him on gun safety legislation after the weekend massacre in Orlando, the largest mass shooting in American history. Katie McGinty has slammed Toomey on his record and implied over the last two days that his support of expanding background checks in 2013 was hollow. "He leant his name to a bill, did little or nothing three years ago to try to get it passed, (and) since then has done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation," she told The Inquirer in a story published Monday. Toomey’s name was on the bill that was pushed three years ago to expand background checks -- it was literally known as the Toomey-Manchin amendment -- yet he hasn’t committed to re-introducing since it failed. But "disavow" is a pretty strong word. And it didn’t appear he had out-right denied support for it. So we decided to check the claim. Toomey signs on Following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, Sen. Joe Manchin, D- W. Va., began drafting legislation that would strengthen background checks and began searching for a Republican to co-sponsor his amendment to the larger Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Manchin began working with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Wy., but his involvement fizzled out by March 2013. Manchin’s next partner for the legislation? Pat Toomey, who was also getting pressure from a political ad circulating in Pennsylvania that was run by Mayors Against Illegal Guns urging him to support gun control legislation. By the end of March, Toomey was on board and an official announcement was made shortly later. He and Manchin made media appearances and held meetings with senators on both sides of the aisle. A spokeswoman from Everytown, a national gun violence prevention group, said her organization at the time worked directly with Toomey on the legislation. He also appeared with Manchin on the Senate floor to push for its passage and, after his approval, enough Republicans voted to make it essentially filibuster-proof, a move Democrats rallied around. Other Republicans, not so much. "While all of us like and respect Sen. Toomey," Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told The Hill at the time, "there wasn’t an outpouring of support for his amendment." Toomey’s name was on the bill for about two weeks before it was brought up for a vote, when it was ultimately defeated 54-46. Five Democrats opposed the bill, but the following four Republicans voted in favor: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona and Toomey. The three Republicans besides Toomey who voted in favor of the amendment? They all had previously expressed support for expanding background checks on gun sales before Toomey’s involvement. What did he accomplish? McGinty’s campaign argues Toomey accomplished little with regard to moving the background checks legislation forward and, since it failed in 2013, hasn’t re-introduced it. After it was struck down in the Senate, he told Politico "it’s time to move on." The amendment was brought up again by Manchin in 2015, and Toomey didn’t speak out in favor of passing it, though he did vote for it. It was again defeated. "Since the bill expired at the end of 2013, Senator Toomey has had a full year and a half to copy and paste the language from his 2013 bill and simply re-introduce it. He just hasn't done it," McGinty’s spokesman Sean Coit said. "On top of that, he's made it very clear... that he's not interested in the bill anymore and is done working to address gun violence." So does Toomey still support legislation that would expand background checks though he hasn’t reintroduced his own amendment? Or, as McGinty says, has he "disavow[ed] any attempt to move on the legislation?" His Senate office wouldn’t commit to re-introducing the bill -- and The (Allentown) Morning Call reported a gun rights group said Toomey’s office told them last year that it wouldn’t be brought up again. His office disputed that account and spokeswoman E.R. Anderson said this week that Toomey "continues to strongly support this measure, as well as others, to make it harder for terrorists, criminals, and mentally ill people to obtain guns." Toomey’s campaign for re-election says the senator was heavily praised following his support of the amendment, including being formally honored by Sandy Hook families at a ceremony last year. "There are few senators who have done more than Pat Toomey to reach across the aisle and attempt to forge a real bipartisan consensus on critical gun safety legislation," spokesman Ted Kwong said in a statement. Democrats take issue with that statement, pointing out that Toomey has rarely brought up the legislation on the Senate floor since it was defeated in 2013 and that he was critical this year of President Obama using executive orders to tighten gun regulations. McGinty again hit Toomey during a press conference Tuesday on gun safety, calling on him to pass legislation that would make it harder for suspected terrorists to buy guns. Last year, Toomey voted against a measure that would have made it illegal for those on the no-fly list to buy guns and instead favored a GOP bill that would have allowed the attorney general to stop a suspected terrorist from buying a gun, but the attorney general would have to do so within 72 hours unless the courts stepped in. Toomey’s contended the Republican bill that was voted on and defeated was a viable option; McGinty this week called it "toothless." Our ruling This claim was two-fold, with McGinty claiming 1. That Toomey "did little or nothing" to attempt to get the Toomey-Manchin amendment passed and 2. That he has "done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation" after it was shot down by the Senate. Toomey signed onto the amendment very late in the game and a vote took place just weeks after his name was added to it. It’s also true that no additional Republicans signed on to vote in favor of the legislation after Toomey added in his support. If McGinty would have said Toomey accomplished little, she would have been right. But to say he "did little or nothing" to advance the bill isn’t supported by the facts. The senator also hasn’t re-introduced the legislation since it was shot down and hasn’t indicated that he plans to. But the definition of "disavow" is to deny complete responsibility for, and Toomey isn’t against the legislation itself, saying he still supports the measure -- and indeed, he voted for it again. For now, he just won’t be the one to re-introduce it.

pomt-08916	"I remember one of [Curt Schilling's] teammates said he painted his sock, the bloody sock."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/27/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-schilling-faked-bloody-sock/	Call it New England Politics 101. When you're running for office in Red Sox Nation, you don't take a Red Sox player's name in vain. Especially not the one who shed blood as he helped end that soul-crushing 86-year drought. But that's exactly what independent gubernatorial candidate Lincoln Chafee did in speaking about former Red Sox ace Curt Schilling in an interview on WPRO's The John DePetro show Tuesday. "I just remember his own teammates didn't like him," Chafee said of Schilling. "They thought he was a bit of a salesman. I remember one of his teammates said he painted his sock, the bloody sock, that he painted it. Kevin Millar I think said that. I don't know if I trust Curt Schilling." He was talking about the larger issue of Schilling's role in a controversial state economic development deal that will give Schilling's video game company, 38 Studios, a $75-million loan guarantee if he moves it to Rhode Island from Massachusetts. Chafee criticized the Schilling agreement for encumbering more than half of a new state loan guarantee program and risking it "on one company that's never had a penny of revenue yet." But what many will remember is that Chafee criticized the guy who got the Sox a win when they needed it most: Game 6 of the 2004 playoff series against the Yankees. Not to mention he maligned the sock that has since been enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Put it up there with failed Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley, who famously referred to Schilling as a Yankee fan and poked fun at her opponent, Scott Brown, for standing outside Fenway Park shaking hands. Diehard fans never forgave her. And Scott Brown is now Senator Brown. The Chafee camp was quick to retract the talk radio comment, sending The Providence Journal this statement by late morning: "Senator Chafee regrets that what he intended as an off-hand reference to published reports about the bloody sock has deflected attention from the crux of this issue." He went on to say: "Senator Chafee respects Curt Schilling's achievements as a professional athlete and his support of charitable causes. At the end of the day, however, his first concern is to protect the interest of Rhode Island taxpayers, on whose shoulders the burden of a 75 million dollar loan default would ultimately fall." We here at PolitiFact don't typically check one-time shots from the hip, so we considered ignoring this flap. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the Chafee gaffe made national news and readers urged us to jump on it, we decided to take at look at the rumor that's been swirling for years. It appears by all credible accounts that Chafee is, in fact, wrong. The story begins with an ankle injury Schilling suffered in a playoff series against the Angels. Team doctors temporarily fixed a ruptured and dislocated tendon in his right ankle to keep it from moving, allowing him to pitch in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees. Here's what The Providence Journal story about that October 2004 game said: "Schilling, who apparently was bleeding through his sock, was pitching through discomfort. TV cameras caught him wincing as he followed the flight of Miguel Cairo's two-out double to left-center in the third inning, the first Yankee hit of the game." Ah yes, it's coming back now, chills and all. You know the ending. Schilling kept pitching, helping to vault the Sox past the Yankees to capture the American League title and then win the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Fast forward three years. The rumor that the blood on the sock was in fact red paint seems to have been started in 2007 by Baltimore Orioles TV announcer Gary Thorne, who said on air that Boston's then-backup catcher Doug Mirabelli told him it was a hoax. (That's Mirabelli, not Kevin Millar, as Chafee cited). Thorne later apologized, saying that Mirabelli told him in a later conversation that he was just joking. After much buzz on blogs and television, the report ended there. It's been brought up again from time to time, but never with much traction. We emailed Schilling Tuesday to get his reaction to the accusation, but we never heard back. For now, all indications are that the blood was real and that Chafee is wrong, a fact that he admits and apologizes for. In a follow-up phone call Tuesday night, a Chafee campaign spokesman said it best: "Some candidates shoot themselves in the foot. We shot ourselves in the sock." The Truth-O-Meter gives Chafee a false, and scores him a big error in the public relations department.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2010-07-27T19:45:56	2010-07-27	['Curt_Schilling']
pomt-03347	"Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/19/facebook-posts/gop-stoppers-say-texas-ranks-poorly-worker-deaths-/	A "Rick Perry 2016" image popped up on Facebook accompanied by warnings about the state he’s led since late 2000: "Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients." The June 13, 2013, post by the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, which also has a web page highlighting political items, was accompanied by a message signed "Veruca": "True. Google it." Referring to the Republican governor’s possibly renewed presidential aspirations, the comment closed: "Just think if he makes good on his threat to run again, he can do for the whole country what he's done for Texas." Mindful that we’ve previously explored claims about each of these topics, we asked the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, whose posts play off of the novel and movie "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," how it reached its Texas rankings. Worker deaths "Veruca Salt" (who did not provide her real name), a co-founder of the group, replied via Facebook message and pointed out an April 1, 2013, commentary by a state legislator, a Sept. 15, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article and a Sept. 21, 2011, news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each of them indicating that in 2010, Texas was tops in some kind of worker fatalities. The commentary by Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, said: "Texas still leads the country in the rate of construction worker fatalities." The Sept. 15, 2012, News’ story said that Texas led the nation with 461 total worker deaths in 2010, a tally attributed to the bureau, whose news release said Texas had 456 "fatal work injuries" in 2010, according to a preliminary count, which was down 26 from 2009. Some 134 of the deaths were highway-related, according to the release, with workplace homicides and falls accounting for 48 and 45 deaths, respectively. The release does not say Texas led the nation in workplace deaths. In May 2013, we rated as Half True a claim that Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents. Drawing on statistics compiled by the federal bureau, we found that according to preliminary figures for 2011, Texas ranked No. 1 in five of six types of event or exposure tabbed by Austin advocate Jim Marston as "industrial accident categories" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Texas, the nation’s second-most populous state, had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of the four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Seeking a way to account for population differences among states, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the "worst" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. "Worst" among the states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). "Worst" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). During our look into the Everlasting GOP Stoppers’ claim, a bureau spokeswoman, Cheryl Abbot, responded to our inquiry about worker deaths in general by emailing us a federal document showing 2011 workplace fatality rates state by state. That year, according to the document, Texas had a rate of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. That tied the state for 22nd with Alabama. North Dakota ranked first with a fatality rate of 12.4, according to the document, with Wyoming second (11.6) followed by Montana (11.2), Alaska (11.1), Arkansas (8.0), South Dakota (6.7) and New Mexico (6.6). Among the 10 most populous states, Texas ranked second to Ohio, which had a 5.5 fatality rate, according to the document. Carbon emissions "Salt" pointed us toward a May 14, 2013, blog post in a trade publication, Environmental Leader, stating: "Texas still led the U.S. states in CO2 emissions from energy with 663 million metric tons in 2010, followed by California and Pennsylvania." The post, like a May 29, 2013, online post by the Environmental Defense Fund, attributed the conclusion to figures posted by the federal Energy Information Administration. The post said too, however, that Wyoming had the nation’s greatest per-resident emissions, 118.5 metric tons per capita. In February 2013, we found a similar contrast; by far, Texas topped other states in carbon emissions except when those emissions were adjusted for population. A Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article said that according to federal data released that day, Texas was releasing far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continued: "Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show." The story said the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It said the agency "collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said." To our inquiries at that time, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: "Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well." Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed a distant second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions, though it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.In per-capita emissions, less populous states led the nation, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. High school graduates On Texas ranking last in high school graduates, "Salt" cited the March 2013 edition of a report by a Texas House caucus, the Legislative Study Group, on how Texas ranks compared to other states. "Texas is dead last in percentage of high school graduates," the report said, a conclusion attributed to the "Texas Fact Book" published in 2012 by the Legislative Budget Board, which said that in 2009, 79.9 percent of Texans had graduated from high school, placing the state 50th. By email, a staff spokesman for the budget board, John Barton, told us that ranking was based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, which indicates Texas trailed Mississippi, at 80.4 percent, and California, 80.6 percent. More up-to-date information was available before the group made its post about Perry. In the bureau’s 2011 survey, Texas, Mississippi and California tied for last among the states, with 81.1 percent of adults having high school degrees. Louisiana was fourth, at 82.5 percent. We suppose the group’s Facebook post could be read as saying Texas is last in current high school graduation rates. That was not what we found in January 2013 when we rated as Mostly True a Perry claim that Texas graduation rates were at an all-time high and third-highest in the nation. Texas had tied with five states for the third-highest graduation rate in 2011, of 86 percent, we found. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Mental health spending "Salt" offered news articles and blog posts from 2011 and 2012 indicating Texas ranked 50th in per-resident spending on mental health care. Most drew on an annual analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In February 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim that Texas is "last in mental health expenditures," after noting that the foundation’s latest review indicated that another state spent less per resident than Texas in fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. The state’s per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. In raw dollars, then, Texas spent more on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after trailing all other states for several years. Our ruling The Facebook post said: "Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients." This post takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures, in each case stressing the result that makes Texas look worst. Still, two of the declared ranks seem fairly solid. Texas tied with Mississippi in 2011 for the greatest share of adults lacking high school degrees and it was second to last in per-person mental health spending in 2010. In contrast, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its 2011 worker fatality rate and while the state had the most carbon emissions in 2010, it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population. We rate this claim as Half True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2013-07-19T12:00:00	2013-06-13	['Texas']

pomt-15023	Number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade: 24. Number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade: 280,024.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/05/viral-image/fact-checking-comparison-gun-deaths-and-terrorism-/	In the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama tasked the media to put the number of gun violence-related deaths into perspective. "Have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports," he said in his address on the shooting. "We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?" Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics have pointed out that cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data. Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media. The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns. While NowThis’ numbers aren’t perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks. Walking through the math Let’s start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad. Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it’s more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison. The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation’s count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings. According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015. There are, however, a few issues with these numbers. For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher. According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That’s a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism. If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here’s a breakdown: Our ruling A viral image says the number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade is 24, while the number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade is 280,024. NowThis, the creators of the image, told us they only counted lives lost to domestic jihadist attacks, though the image doesn’t specify that. If we look at deaths due to all extremist attacks on U.S. soil, the number goes up to 71. A more accurate count for gun deaths between 2005 and 2015 is 301,797. Though the image’s numbers are slightly off, that doesn’t undercut the point: guns have claimed many more lives than terrorist attacks. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12866	Says the Department of Homeland Security didn't request any hours of aerial surveillance for the U.S.-Mexico border from the Department of Defense for 2017.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/jan/31/john-cornyn/texans-led-john-cornyn-claim-obama-administration-/	Last year, Texas officials including Sen. John Cornyn charged the federal government with surprisingly not requesting continued aerial checks of the U.S.-Mexico border as of January 2017. At issue: An element of Operation Phalanx, a border surveillance program launched in 2010 in which National Guard officers assist U.S. agents monitoring the border. Cornyn, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said in a Nov. 22, 2016, letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: "It has come to our attention that for calendar year 2017 the Department of Homeland Security has not requested any flight hours for Operation Phalanx from the Department of Defense." Their letter, which came to our attention thanks to a reader inquiry, went on: "Given the continuing surge of migrants along the Southern Border beyond the FY15 numbers and a large uptick in apprehensions already for the month of November 2016, we believe DHS should be requesting more surveillance and security resources, not less." Also, the letter called the described cut "extremely imprudent." Some history: President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2010 authorizing 1,200 soldiers and airmen to join Customs and Border Protection efforts along the southwest border. According to a May 2011 U.S. Army web post, the Army National Guard then established Operation Phalanx in July 2010, with soldiers working to spot border intrusions and providing technical support. In 2012, notably, the mission switched from ground operations to "aviation focused support," according to the Texas Military Department, which is part of Texas state government. So, did the Obama administration not request additional flight hours just before 2017? In the end, we found, this claim didn’t pan out. Along the way, too, neither the Texans who sent the letter nor federal officials came through with what we’d consider to-the-point factual replies. Over several weeks, neither Cornyn nor Cuellar offered confirmable evidence for their declaration that no flight hours were requested. Cornyn deferred to Cuellar, who told us by phone that he’d heard about the move not to request more flight hours from a Texas official involved in the operation--someone we subsequently couldn’t reach. Customs and Border Patrol letter Meantime, Cuellar brought to our attention a letter sent by a border security official indicating support for the operation. Cuellar’s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, emailed us a copy of the letter, which was dated six days before the Texas officials leveled their claim, The letter from R. Gil Kerlikowske, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, to Brian McKeon, who was a Department of Defense undersecretary, opened: "This letter serves to identify those Department of Defense activities most critical to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Border Security Operations." "Over the last decade," the letter continued, "Congress has consistently appropriated" DoD "funds to the Army National Guard and other supporting elements for the express purposes of assisting" CBP "in securing the Southwest border." Kerlikowske went on: "I believe this support, whether under Operation Jump Start or Operation Phalanx, or other DoD activities, has continued to provide tangible benefits to border security both in countering illegal immigration and in preventing the flow of drugs and other illicit goods." Next, Kelikowske wrote that with Congress likely to continue such funding for fiscal 2017, which began in October 2016, he wanted to "provide you with a general prioritization of those rotary-wing assets that have proven most critical to supporting our operations." That term, "rotary-wing asset," refers to helicopters. "Specifically," the letter continued, "the allocation of appropriated resources for rotary wing operation in the following manner will most positively impact our operations," Kerlikowske wrote, including a prioritized list of areas he thought most important to focus on, with the Laredo sector prioritized, the Rio Grande Valley sector ranked second and the Tucson sector set third. Our initial attempts to verify the claim resulted in email circularity: After emailing Cornyn’s press secretary, since the senator’s name was listed first on the letter, we were told to check with Cuellar’s office for factual backup of the claim. Cuellar’s press secretary, Benavides, first emailed us contact information for a director with the Texas National Guard, Malcolm Warbrick, who would "verify Operation Phalanx is shutting down due to a lack of request for support hours from DHS." When we emailed the director, though, we heard back by email from a National Guard spokeswoman, Laura Lopez, who told us to contact Homeland Security as "Operation Phalanx is a federal mission under their direct control." Otherwise, Daniel Hetlage, a CBP spokesman, also referred to Kerlikowske’s letter, saying: "This support is important, the commissioner has indicated such, and U.S. Customs & Border Protection will take any hours the Department of Defense can provide." Our calls to the Department of Defense for information on requested flight hours didn’t draw replies. By phone on Dec. 16, 2016, Cuellar responded to our requests for backup by describing what he said he’d heard. On Nov. 14, 2016, Cuellar said, Warbrick, director of government affairs for the Texas Military Department, which is based at Camp Mabry in Austin, told Ryan Ehly, legislative director for Cuellar’s office, about the lack of hours requested for aerial surveillance during a meeting in Washington. Cuellar’s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, provided contact information for Warbrick, but our attempts to email and call Warbrick didn’t yield factual fruit. Next, Cuellar told us, Brig. Gen. Patrick M. Hamilton, a commander of the Domestic Operations Task Force of the Texas Military Department, told Cuellar in a Dec. 7, 2016 meeting that Operation Phalanx was being discontinued since no 2017 flight hours had been requested from the National Guard. Precisely, Cuellar said, Hamilton told him "that the program was going to go away," despite the fact that Congress had approved funding for the program in its Fiscal Year 2016 budget. Cuellar also brought up the mid-November Kerlikowske letter though Cuellar said the letter of support wasn’t high-level enough to serve as a request for additional flight hours. That is, Cuellar maintained, such a letter needs to come from a secretary to a secretary to be meaningful. Cuellar told us he November letter, from a commissioner to an undersecretary, was "just a feel-good request" that wouldn’t result in more flight hours. December 2016 letter While we were checking this claim, Benavides told us that Cornyn, Cuellar and Abbott had gotten a reply from Kerlikowske on Dec. 21, 2016. In that letter, Kerlikowske said he was writing on Johnson’s behalf and that "CBP welcomes the opportunity to maintain DoD (Department of Defense) aviation and associated support capabilities should funding be made available. We value our strong relationship with DoD and wish to continue our efforts in order to maximize the impact of any appropriations or any other DoD activities along the Southwest border." By email, Benavides told us that this response also didn’t add up to a request for additional hours in the air. "No official request for flight hours has been made that we are aware of," Benavides said. Our ruling Cornyn, Cuellar and Abbott said the federal government didn’t seek any 2017 flight hours to surveil the Texas-Mexico border via Operation Phalanx. Neither Cornyn or Cuellar provided factual documentation for this claim, which Cuellar otherwise attributed to a Texas official who didn’t respond to our inquiries. Separately when we asked, federal authorities didn’t document a specific request for 2017 surveillance hours. Regardless, the CBP commissioner’s letter to a Defense Department underling, sent before the Texans leveled their claim, endorsed continued flights over the border, even specifying priority sectors. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:41 p.m., Jan. 31, 2017: After we posted this fact check, Drew Brandewie of Cornyn’s office emailed to say Cuellar initiated the letter--a characterization echoed by Victoria Glynn, a Cuellar spokeswoman. We then amended our headline and story to make more clear the claim wasn’t Cornyn’s alone. These changes didn’t affect our ruling. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91c159e1-66b1-4738-9598-502444bfe949	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2017-01-31T11:00:00	2016-11-22	['Mexico–United_States_border']

pomt-10308	On using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/05/barack-obama/emergency-now-but-not-then/	Sen. Barack Obama's new energy plan released on Aug. 4, 2008, includes a curious short-term attempt to relieve high gas prices by tapping into the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's curious because a month ago Obama balked at just such a proposal. "I do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point," Obama said in a news conference in St. Louis on July 7. "The strategic oil reserve, I think, has to be reserved for a genuine emergency. You have a situation, let's say, where there was a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts, and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market. We wouldn't just be seeing $4-a-gallon oil. We could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all. And that's what the strategic oil reserve has to be for." The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-74. According to the Department of Energy Web site, the SPR's stockpile of 707-million barrels of oil — kept in subterranean caverns in Texas and Louisiana — "provides the president with a powerful response option should a disruption in commercial oil supplies threaten the U.S. economy." It was last tapped after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In his "New Energy for America" speech at Michigan State University on Aug. 4, Obama talked at length about his long-term plan to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, but as one of his short-term solutions, he said, "We should sell 70-million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for less expensive crude, which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks." In the eight-page written platform that accompanied his speech, the plan is described as "releasing light oil from the SPR now and replacing it later with heavier crude more suited to our long-term needs." "This is similar to the approach that President Clinton and Secretary Richardson took in 2000, when their swap helped bring down the price of oil by 18.7 percent," said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor. "It is distinct from a straight sale of oil from the SPR, which is limited under current law to a 5-million barrel test sale and emergency or 'anticipatory' emergency instances of supply disruption." Vietor told PolitiFact that Obama's belief has always been "that the president should retain his discretionary authority to conduct exchanges or swaps from the SPR as warranted by circumstances." So what are those circumstances? According to the campaign, "Barack Obama believes the doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of Americans and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries, many of them hostile to our interests, is a threat to our national security." The McCain campaign quickly accused Obama of election-year pandering, saying nothing had changed since Obama rejected the idea a month earlier. Indeed, the McCain campaign is correct that there is a hole in Obama's logic that gas prices have recently caused such an emergency. The price of gas was actually substantially higher on July 7 when Obama dismissed the idea of tapping the reserve. Then, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4.108, less than a penny off the all-time high of $4.114 on July 14. Back on July 7, Obama set the bar at "genuine emergency," and then cited an example of a catastrophic disruption in supply. Obama is now describing the high price of gas as a crisis and a threat to national security. But we fail to see how that's any different than was the case a month ago — when the price of gas was 24 cents a gallon higher — when Obama dismissed it. We rate Obama's proposal a Full Flop.

pomt-10660	"He's a good man but he's a pro-life liberal. He's right on the pro-life part, but he's a liberal."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/fred-thompson/the-liberal-label-doesnt-quite-stick-to-huckabee/	If you take away his religious-conservative views, is Mike Huckabee a liberal? Fred Thompson, competing fiercely against Huckabee for the social conservatives' vote in the Republican primaries, is using the "liberal" label, a favorite derogatory term at least since the Barry Goldwater presidential campaign of 1964. After using the label in an interview with Nashville talk-radio host Steve Gill, Thompson elaborated in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Nov. 18: "That means he's pro-life, but he's liberal on everything else." It's not exactly a factual allegation, but Politifact decided to rise to the challenge: Can you declare a label to be true or false? "He's not a liberal," says former Arkansas Republican Party chairman Gilbert Baker, a state senator from Conway who is supporting Huckabee. Baker notes that the Arkansas legislature is heavily Democratic. "Did he get things accomplished – that's the question you have to ask." Baker says Huckabee was driven by a "holistic approach" to economic development – not just tax breaks and low taxes for businesses, but also "energy, schools, higher education. He made a great effort to improve the economic development climate here." "The labels liberal and conservative just don't work for Mike Huckabee," says Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution in Washington, a widely respected political scientist who studies federal politics and government. "He appears to be a bad fit with all of the dominant interests in the Republican party except for the religious conservatives." Huckabee's religious beliefs also produce some policies not considered conservative. Huckabee has said he believes in being "a good steward of the earth." Political consultant Dick Morris, who advised Bill Clinton's presidential campaign as well as Huckabee's runs for lieutenant governor in 1993 and 1996, recalls Huckabee's response to a question about parole for felons. "The Christian concept of forgiveness requires that we allow parole. We just have to use it wisely." "Governor Huckabee has consistently supported and initiated measures that increase government's interference in markets, thereby impeding economic growth," says the Club for Growth, which on Nov. 13 complained of "his liberal economic record." The club's indictment says he raised the minimum wage in Arkansas from the federal $5.15 an hour to $6.25, threatened an investigation of price-gouging if gas prices went up after 9/11, and ordered regulators to investigate price-gouging in nursing homes. In 1997, he "signed a bill into law that would prevent companies from raising their prices a mere 10% ahead of a natural disaster," with roof repair and tree removal among the targets. Huckabee has touted his "Property Taxpayers' Bill of Rights and cuts in income taxes and capital gains taxes in the early years of his administration. But the Club for Growth says Huckabee's "substantial tax hikes far surpassed his modest tax cuts." The anti-tax Cato Institute gave Huckabee a "D" for his tenure as governor. They're a tough bunch to please. Even conservative icon Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida during the last eight years Huckabee was governor of Arkansas, earned no better than a lifetime "B," and a "C" for his final year. (Mitt Romney earned a lifetime "C.") Does all that render one a liberal? If you are not consistently "conservative," are you liberal? Can you oppose withdrawal from Iraq, as Huckabee does, and still be liberal? Can you support a flat sales tax in place of a progressive income tax and still be liberal? Maybe a later Republican label fits: "compassionate conservative." George W. Bush used that one in his 2000 campaign. Cato's director of health and welfare studies, Michael Tanner, says unflatteringly that Huckabee resembles Bush in his "big-government conservatism." But "pro-life liberal"? Pro-life seems an intentionally narrow description of Huckabee's strong "values" positions. And "liberal" is a clear exaggeration, especially if it means "on everything else," though you can't deny liberal elements in his populism. Keeping in mind the subjective nature of the term, we rate Thompson's "pro-life liberal" label as no better than half-true.	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-12-31T00:00:00	2007-11-07	['None']

pomt-09463	"Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/03/charlie-crist/crist-claims-highest-graduation-rate-ever/	In this final State of the State address on March 2, 2010, Gov. Charlie Crist highlighted Florida's progress in many areas. In addition to lower crime rates and money to restore the Everglades, Crist devoted a significant portion of his speech to education. Among other statistics, Crist made this superlative claim: "Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been." We figured this statement came with an unspoken asterisk similar to weather records ("since official records began") or baseball statistics ("the Modern Era"). There probably was a graduation rate in 1845 when Florida became a state, but it makes little sense to compare it to today's rate. Despite the statistical obstacles, we wanted to know: Is Florida's graduation rate at its highest point ever? Starting in 1975, there are three years with higher graduation rates than the current year. But previous calculations varied widely and comparing those rates with those from the Modern Era simply isn't valid. Now, the Modern Era of Florida's graduation rate began in the 1998-99 school year, when the state began tracking groups of students instead of simply dividing the number of diplomas by the freshman class four years earlier. Previous formulas did not account for transfer students and also counted more groups of students as earning diplomas. The More Accurate Modern Era began in 2004-05, when a new measure stopped including GEDs in the rate. So "ever" in Crist's quote means five years, or at best 10. In addition, there are several groups that measure graduation rates. The conservative Manhattan Institute think tank publishes one. Education Week's rate is oft-quoted in the media. Both of those rates, though, use federal data to estimate freshman class sizes and then compare those numbers to diplomas awarded four years later. From 1998 until 2009, Florida used a method considered more accurate that tracks groups of freshman students, or "cohorts," throughout high school. The U.S. Department of Education will require all states to move to a standard system by next school year. For the transition, Florida has moved to a similar "cohort" rate developed by the National Governors Association in 2005. Unlike the 1998 rate, it only counts diplomas and does not include students who earned a GED. Okay, enough about the methodology. On to the numbers! Under the 1998 rubric, Florida's graduation rate has steadily increased every year, except for a dip in 2005-06. It rose from 60.2 percent to 78.6 percent in 2008-09 -- the highest under that formula. For the NGA calculation -- which is the figure trumpeted by Crist's office in December 2009 as the "highest ever" -- Florida's rate has increased from 69.7 percent in 2004-05 to 76.3 percent last year. Again, that topped the mercury level on the graduation rate thermometer. "Which sounds pretty good," said University of South Florida professor Sherman Dorn. "But there's a caveat." Dorn says the increased graduation rate corresponds closely with an increase in students who received a diploma even after failing the FCAT three times. Such students can replace their FCAT scores with SAT scores of 410 for reading and 370 for math. (The number of those degrees jumped from 569 in 2004-05 to 9,410 last year.) Without those degrees included, last year's rate falls to 71.2 percent. It's still the highest ever, Dorn says, "by about a hair." State Department of Education spokesman Tom Bulter defended keeping those students in the count. Under state law, they received standard diplomas. "It really is a process of law," he said. In his speech to lawmakers, Crist claimed the state's graduation rate is "the highest it's ever been." And several formulas say that's true -- to varying degrees. But Joe Citizen doesn't think of "ever" as beginning in 2005, or even 1999. We understand that accurate statistics only go back so far, but Crist could have been more clear. We rate his statement Mostly True. Update: This item was updated on March 4, 2010, to clarify University of South Florida professor Sherman Dorn's position on graduation rates.

pomt-02284	Says Michelle Obama waved "red communist flags" on her trip to China.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/chain-email/chain-email-says-michelle-obama-waved-communist-fl/	The activities of Barack and Michelle Obama provide endless fodder for chain emails critical of the first family. A reader recently sent us one based on an event that occurred on Michelle Obama’s March 2014 trip to China. The email features a meme that’s based on a photo of the first lady. It shows her energetically waving two red flags, one in each hand. A superimposed caption reads, "Michelle Obama waves red communist flags on her taxpayer-funded visit to China. Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?" The meme includes a Web address for Tea Party Nation, a Facebook-style social media website for conservatives. The reader sent us the email wanting to know whether it is accurate, so we took a look. (Snopes.com beat us to the punch with a fact-check here.) Was Obama waving "red communist flags"? No, it was simply a bit of audience participation during a folk dancing exhibition. It came as Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were visiting an ancient wall in the former capital city of Xi’an. The exhibit "began with a breathtaking display of drumming and music by performers dressed in colorful traditional costumes," Michelle Obama wrote in her trip diary, which was later posted on the White House website. Later that day, the family and its entourage watched a second group of drummers and folk dancers. "They did a lovely dance number for us (and my daughters and I joined in for some dancing at the end)," Obama wrote. A White House press pool report said Michelle Obama and Malia were "swaying to the music, mostly drums." Photographs -- posted at the White House website and also in various media outlets, such as the Guardian and NBC News -- confirm that the flags in question are not the Chinese flag. The national flag of China features five gold stars on a solid red field. Instead, Michelle Obama is clearly holding much longer banners that were used during one of the folk-dancing celebrations. The dancers are wearing and carrying a variety of colors other than red, including shades of purple, yellow and green. "Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?" Our online photo search pulled up at least one image of Michelle Obama waving a flag, taken while she was cheering on United States swimmers at the 2012 London Olympics. We also found ample evidence that Obama appears to enjoy displays of red-white-and-blue patriotism. For instance, on the eve of the London Olympics, Obama attended a sendoff for Team USA by wearing "a bright red peplum top and a white and red jacket that basically looked like a retro American flag," according to a Huffington Post account. "Standing against a navy backdrop, Michelle Obama would have made Betsy Ross proud." In addition, Mrs. O -- a now-defunct blog "dedicated to chronicling the fashion and style of First Lady Michelle Obama" -- noted that when the Obamas celebrated July 4, 2012, on the South Lawn of the White House, Michelle Obama wore "a red and blue striped shell paired with a pleated, side button white skirt. The president did his part on the fashion front, sporting a patriotic red, white and blue cowboy hat." And during a 2011 trip to Botswana, Obama was photographed looking thrilled when she was welcomed by 25 schoolchildren waving American flags. Our ruling The chain email said Michelle Obama waved "red communist flags" on her trip to China. In reality, she didn’t wave the national flag of China or any other "communist" flag -- she was simply waving long red banners during a folk-dancing exhibition. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14086	"There are more than twice as many (crisis pregnancy centers) as there are legitimate abortion providers in the United States."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/may/17/vicki-saporta/tallies-are-too-sketchy-say-anti-abortion-centers-/	Georgia is in the news after joining other states in passing legislation to fund crisis pregnancy centers as an alternative to Planned Parenthood. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee on TBS explored these centers, which may offer some pregnancy services but not abortion, in its May 9 edition. The segment argued that the centers, run by groups opposed to abortion, often try to set up shop near existing abortion clinics and promise to give clients information about their pregnancy and help dealing with it. Some offer to give women information on abortion, leading pregnant women to believe that the center offers the procedure. Once inside, the Full Frontal segment said, women who ask about abortion are falsely told that if they have one, they won't be able to have more children, they will suffer from psychological problems and they will face a higher risk of breast cancer. Some offer ultrasound, not necessarily as a diagnostic tool, but as a way to discourage abortion. "They create the illusion that they're an abortion clinic by adapting names that are similar to abortion clinics, adapting the same logos and fonts," said Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, in the segment. At the end of the segment, Saporta threw out an interesting statistic: "There are more than twice as many fake clinics as there are legitimate abortion providers in the United States." We wondered if Saporta's ratio was correct and whether pregnant women seeking an abortion were really twice as likely to come across one of these centers than a clinic that offers abortion. Saporta uses "fake clinics" to describe crisis pregnancy centers. Any count of these centers is complicated by the fact that most of them don't explicitly say they offer abortions when they try to get clients. Some may promise information about abortion, even if their goal is to discourage them. Others may not mention abortion at all until someone comes through the door or the pregnant woman brings it up. Saporta's sources We contacted the federation to ask for its sources. For the tally of abortion providers, spokeswoman Alissa Manzoeillo offered data from the Guttmacher Institute, which studies sexual and reproductive health, and supports abortion rights. Its latest survey, done in 2011, found 1,720 abortion providers in the United States, including 839 that do more than 400 abortions per year. The 1,720 total includes those clinics, doctor's offices where abortions are performed, and hospitals, which usually perform abortions for serious cases and only provide about 4 percent of all such procedures. As far as the "fake clinics," Manzoeillo sent us media reports with a variety of estimates including 2,500 to 4,000 (from a 2003 Mother Jones article) and "at least 3,000" (a 2015 Cosmopolitan article). The federation also cited a Salon article reporting that the crisis pregnancy centers now outnumber abortion clinics "by an estimated 3 to 1." Some of those permutations support Saporta's claim. Some don't. And there are some flaws in both counts. Reliable estimates are tough to come by Getting a reliable count of crisis pregnancy centers "is really hard because they are not licensed. They are not in anybody's database," said Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues associate at Guttmacher. She said she's seen estimates of 3,000 to 8,000. The lists of the three major chains "do not include the more local chains or the individual centers that might be run out of a church basement or something like that." We contacted some of the chains affiliated with the centers and asked them for their best count. One of them, Heartbeat International, said it counts 2,573 total pregnancy center locations, including 1,145 that offer medical services such as ultrasounds and testing and/or treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Heartbeat spokesman Jay Hobbs cautioned, however, that "organizations need not affiliate with a national organization such as Heartbeat International or Care Net (another group) to open their doors to clients." "Much like local churches, pregnancy-help organizations are stand-alone non-profit entities overseen at the local level by a board of directors," Hobbs said. Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which opposes abortion, said his organization counts 2,643 centers nationwide, 1,231 of which have medical personnel and services on the site. The others may offer just information and counseling. That's a conservative figure, he said, because adoption service agencies, hotlines, social service agencies with anti-abortion views, and maternity homes could also be included, Donovan said. "Over the last 10 years, I’ve seen numbers ranging from 1,800 to 4,000, however, these numbers were typically offered in both mainstream and Christian media without any indication of how the author arrived at a particular number," said Kimberly Kelly, a sociologist at Mississippi State University, who studies religion and reproductive politics. "There are no definitive data sources," but most centers are affiliated with Care Net or Heartbeat International, she said. There's a lingering question over how effective these centers are at ultimately discouraging abortion. Earlier this month, the online news website Rewire, which covers sexual and reproductive health issues, reported that data from an anti-abortion Texas software company used by 1,200 crisis pregnancy centers to track clients, found that fewer than 4 percent of women are dissuaded from having an abortion. Most come in for the free services, never having planned to seek an abortion in the first place. Abortion provider figure may also be lower It's worth noting that the 2011 Guttmacher count totaling 1,720 abortion providers is likely a bit out of date. Today the number of clinics is probably lower because states such as Texas and Ohio have aggressively tried to shut down clinics that provide abortion while diverting money to crisis pregnancy centers. On March 25, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cut off all state funding for preventive health service clinics that provide abortion. Our ruling Saporta said, "There are more than twice as many fake clinics as there are legitimate abortion providers in the United States." The last count of the number of abortion providers, around 1,720, is probably a bit high. Meanwhile, the number of crisis pregnancy centers run the gamut from 1,800 to 8,000. There's no widely recognized tally. Saporta's claim only holds up if you accept the higher estimates.

pomt-05811	Says Mitt Romney supports a plan "to slowly and gradually raise the retirement age of Social Security."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/22/chris-redfern/ohio-dem-chair-chris-redfern-says-mitt-romney-plan/	Ohio Democrats have a two-tier approach when discussing the looming Super Tuesday Republican presidential primary. They delight in the roller coaster nature of the Republican nominating race, and would really like to see Rick Santorum win because they think he would be an easier opponent against President Barack Obama in the fall But they think that Mitt Romney is more likely to wind up as the eventual nominee, and they see Romney as tougher in the November election. So even while Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, has been riding high in the polls, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern has been sending email targeting Romney. Urging Democrats to share his messages on Facebook and Twitter, Redfern uses this headline: "Stuff Mitt Romney Supports." One of those things that Romney supports, Redfern said in an email to Ohio Democrats on Feb. 15, is raising the eligibility age for collecting Social Security. Redfern cited a Romney quote from Feb. 10, when the former Massachusetts governor addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Washington: "We are going to slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security" Did Romney really say he would raise the retirement age? PolitiFact Ohio took a look. On the retirement age, Redfern is mostly accurate. Romney has said a number of times, in speeches and position papers, that he would deal with eventual Social Security viability issues by slowly and gradually raising the age at which a senior could collect the retirement benefit. He also has said he would not support increasing taxes as part of the solution. And he has said that high-income retirees might not see the same growth in their benefits as other retirees would. But he has said as clearly as can be that current seniors would not be affected. We watched a video replay of Romney’s CPAC speech and read the full transcript. We read his campaign’s economic plan. We exchanged email with a campaign spokesman to see if there was more. Here is an example of how Romney has described his intentions, from his "Plan to Turn Around the Federal Government," issued on Nov. 4: "Social Security: No one at or near the retirement age will see any changes and tax hikes cannot be on the table. Instead, Social Security can be placed on a sustainable trajectory with commonsense reforms: Gradually raise the retirement age to reflect increases in longevity Slow the growth in benefits for higher-income retirees" And here is what Romney told CPAC: "Under my plan, no one near retirement age or currently retired will see any of the changes I’m going to describe. But people in their 20s and 30s and 40s and early 50s are going to see some changes. "And by the way, tax hikes are off the table. "We’re going to slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security and we’ll slow the growth rate in benefits for higher-income retirees." Everything we have reviewed shows that Romney would, as Redfern says, raise the Social Security retirement age. Knowing, though, that present day seniors would be unaffected is important, though. Elsewhere in his note, Redfern quips: "Here’s just five (words) that almost every Ohio senior knows: ‘Hands off my Social Security.’ So, good luck with that, Governor." Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman said in an email, "It was already implied by the words ‘slowly and gradually’ of the quoted statement that Governor Romney was referring to raising the retirement age for future retirees, and we did not mean to suggest otherwise. The point here is that Social Security is a critical issue to Ohio’s seniors – both present and future – and tinkering with Social Security benefits is a threat to their economic security." Bringman added, "We raise this point because Social Security is a compact between the federal government and Americans that if they work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules, they’ll have something to fall back on when they retire. We have to honor that compact and stop the threats to the program that so many rely on today and so many others will rely on in the future." Bringman’s explanation goes beyond even his boss’s words, let alone Romney’s words. Romney talked of protecting current seniors’ benefits. Yet Redfern invoked a spell known to every political pro: Scare the seniors and you lose their votes. It’s why Social Security is called the third rail of American politics. Redfern’s claim about Romney is accurate. Romney has said repeatedly that he would gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security. But that Romney specifically has excluded people already retired and those near retirement age is additional information that helps clarify the statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, Redfern’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2012-02-22T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['None']
pomt-01856	U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston voted for the "Cash for Clunkers" program.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/14/david-perdue/perdue-omits-detail-cash-clunkers-claim/	Some Republican candidates are having to fend off criticism in this year’s elections for backing one or more of President Barack Obama’s more controversial initiatives. That’s true in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race, where Jack Kingston, a 22-year veteran of the U.S. House, is vying in the July 22 primary runoff to be the Republican nominee to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Kingston’s runoff opponent, wealthy businessman David Perdue, has attacked Kingston on YouTube and in television ads for voting for Obama’s "Cash for Clunkers" program. Each man is billing himself as the "true conservative" in the race. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out whether Kingston voted for Cash for Clunkers and, if so, whether that makes him less of a fiscal conservative. .The Car Allowance Rebate System, commonly referred to as Cash for Clunkers, was a federal voucher program that encouraged consumers to replace less-fuel-efficient vehicles with newer, more-fuel-efficient models. Officials said the goal was to boost auto sales and stimulate the economy while the program ran from July 1, 2009, to Aug. 24, 2009. It makes sense that Perdue would criticize a vote for Cash for Clunkers. Though the program was touted as a means to bolster Detroit’s carmakers, it unintentionally increased the market share for Japanese and Korean automakers, according to a Reuters report in 2009. An October analysis by the Brookings Institute’s Ted Gayer and Emily Parker found that the program provided a short-term boost in vehicle sales but was extremely inefficient in increasing jobs and decreasing total emissions. Georgia residents requested $70 million in vouchers under the program, the 13th-highest participation rate in the nation, according to the Brookings Institute report. Congress originally appropriated $1 billion to the program but added an additional $2 billion when it ran out of money within a month. And Cash for Clunkers became a good-intentioned but runaway government program that conservatives love to rail on. But did Kingston vote for Cash for Clunkers? It’s more complicated than a straight yes or no answer. It’s No. And yes. Kingston did not vote to fund Cash for Clunkers initially, according to the legislative tracking service GovTrack. He cast "No" votes on bills on June 9 and June 16 that carried the framework of the program in 2009. But he voted in favor of putting the extra $2 billion into the program a month later when it was clearly foundering. We asked Greg Dolan, a spokesman for Kingston, for an explanation. "Once the program was authorized, Rep. Kingston approved moving funds from the grant program that spawned Solyndra to the slightly-less-wasteful Cash-for-Clunkers," Dolan wrote in an email. Solyndra was a solar energy company that drew public ire after going bankrupt despite taking a $535 million loan guarantee under the president’s 2009 stimulus program for "commercially available technologies," according to FactCheck.org. The $2 billion increase in Cash for Clunkers came from the same pot of money that had previously funded Solyndra — the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. So from Kingston’s perspective, he was voting to move money from one fiscal evil to a lesser evil. Dolan added in another email that there was no House vote that would have allowed the money to return to the general fund or go to a more efficient program. In summary: Kingston, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, did vote to provide $2 billion to Cash for Clunkers after it ran through $1 billion in its first month. But Kingston did not vote for the program initially. His office says that the decision to further fund Cash for Clunker was made to cut funds from a more wasteful government program. We rate Perdue’s statement that Kingston voted for "Obama’s Cash for Clunkers" as Half True.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-07-14T00:00:00	2014-05-17	['United_States']
pomt-11800	"Earlier this year, Dan Patrick and Republican leadership snatched millions of dollars in benefits from retired teachers."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/nov/17/mike-collier/mike-collier-leaves-out-context-claim-dan-patrick-/	In a Halloween email blast, a Democrat hoping to deny Dan Patrick a second term as Texas lieutenant governor charged Patrick and his fellow Republicans with harming Texas teachers. Mike Collier of Houston said: "Earlier this year, Dan Patrick and Republican leadership snatched millions of dollars in benefits from retired teachers, claiming that they couldn't afford to pay for the benefits they'd promised." Were millions in benefits taken away? We asked Collier for his factual backup. By email, a campaign adviser, Chaille Jolink, pointed to news stories describing actions by the 2017 Texas Legislature expected to leave more than 260,000 retired educators and dependents with fewer health plan choices and greater out-of-pocket costs. That result--fewer health plan choices and higher costs starting in January 2018--remains undisputed, we found. Before the legislative actions, for instance, retiree health care premiums, deductibles and other benefits had been frozen, at legislative direction, since 2005. A June 2017 Houston Chronicle news story quoted state Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, saying, "There's no getting around that there's an increased cost to the retirees. I can only say that we'll continue to watch it and continue to hope there's a solution that will drive down the costs." Then again, lawmakers did not take back any benefits in place for all of 2017 and the spending and other steps they ultimately approved, by bipartisan unanimous votes and with the backing of a group representing retirees, may have spared the TRS-Care program from shuttering for lack of funds. Interim report warned of collapse Before lawmakers came together in 2017, an interim Senate-House committee said inaction wasn’t a reasonable option. The panel’s November 2016 report noted that several times since the 1985 Legislature created state-supported health coverage for public school retirees, legislators had shored up TRS-Care. The health plans, overseen by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, draw funding from retiree premiums and percentages of active-employee payrolls contributed by the state, school districts and existing school employees. The interim report went on to say lawmakers had yet to find a permanent way to sustain the health care benefits in the face of escalating medical costs and the addition of about 20,000 participants a year--including more costly retirees not yet 65 and eligible for Medicare. "As of April 2016, the TRS-Care shortfall is projected to be from $1.3 (billion) to $1.5 billion for the 2018-2019 biennium," the report said. "Even more alarming, the shortfall for the following biennium is expected to range from $4 (billion) to $6 billion. Absent "drastic" steps, the report said, the TRS board would be forced to cover the projected shortfalls by driving up retiree premiums, copayments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses--moves likely to lead retirees to flock to the system’s zero-premium catastrophic health plan, which had 28,964 enrollees as of December 2016. The report said that such a shift in enrollment, in turn, would reduce needed revenues and ultimately lead the TRS board to close the TRS-Care plan and start phasing out participants. Retirement system confirms risks of inaction In November 2017, we asked the TRS if a shutdown of TRS-Care seemed likely in the event of legislative inaction. By email, Merita Zoga told us the system had testified as much with nearly all presentations indicating that without legislated changes or additional funding, TRS-Care "would have quickly become unsustainable." Zoga pointed us to a January 2017 TRS presentation to legislators showing possible cost ripples for retirees if legislators didn’t act. For a retiree alone, that chart suggests, monthly premiums for two TRS-Care plans offering more than basic coverage would escalate by 43 percent to 337 percent. Some greater increases are indicated for a retiree and spouse; a retiree and child; or a retiree and family. SOURCE: Presentation to Texas Senate Finance Committee, Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Jan. 24, 2017 (received by email from Merita Zoga, director of governmental relations, TRS, Nov. 14, 2017) Zoga said TRS did not project other out-of-pocket expenses (such as deductibles and copayments) because actual expenditures would depend on how often a person draws on the coverage. Legislators spent more, authorized insurance changes Next, legislators in the 2017 regular session agreed to spend more on TRS-Care in the state budget, Senate Bill 1, in part by inching up the state’s contribution to the program to 1.25 percent of active school workers’ payroll and school districts’ contribution to 0.75 percent of active employees’ payroll. The budget also includes another $182.6 million in what’s described as a one-time appropriation to shore up the program. Together, the streams of funding generated $483.9 million in additional TRS-Care funding for 2018-19. Members also advanced, by unanimous floor votes, House Bill 3976, also signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. In part, that measure ended the longstanding requirement that TRS offer retirees the zero-premium basic catastrophic health plan known as TRS-Care 1. It also directed the system to start offering a high-deductible plan for retirees not yet 65. The action further enabled TRS to pare available health care plans from three plans to one for each age group--retirees 65 or older and retirees younger than 65. Legislators softened increases ahead After the session, the predicted higher costs for reduced offerings touched off an outcry from retirees, perhaps leading Abbott to fold improved TRS-Care benefits into his July 20, 2017, expansion of the agenda of a summer special session. Legislators subsequently sent for Abbott’s signature two measures, HB 21 and HB 30. The measures provided another $212 million in 2018-19 supplemental funding intended, in part, to reduce the TRS-Care cost hikes for retirees, including spending on premiums, deductibles and prescription drugs set in motion during the regular session. One upshot, TRS said, is the 2019 Legislature could face a projected 2020-21 TRS-Care shortfall of $500 million to $700 million. By all accounts, the summer actions lessened the pending pinch on retirees. According to a fall 2017 TRS presentation to retirees, the legislative intent was to reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs from what they would have been through 2019. An example from the presentation: Retirees not on Medicare would newly face an annual deductible for family coverage of $3,000, compared to $6,000 before the summer session, while such retirees would face maximum out-of-pocket deductibles of $11,300 compared to $13,300 before the actions. A chart in the presentation shows retiree premium costs before the changes and after (the middle column revealing expected premiums before legislators acted in the special session): SOURCE: Presentation to Texas Retired Teachers Association fall meeting, Teacher Retirement System of Texas, undated (accessed Nov. 14, 2017) Consulting a retired teachers advocate To our inquiry about Collier's claim, Tim Lee of the retired teachers association told us by phone that he hadn’t characterized any benefits as "snatched" but also didn’t know if that’s the wrong descriptive. "These are benefits these people had before that are not there now," Lee said, adding by email that " "the benefits went down, the costs went up, and the plan is still on shaky ground." Lee also said the group endorsed the legislative actions and remains grateful that a state-supported health plan will survive. Gauging effects for retirees not yet 65 Asked to be specific, Lee said by email that retirees not yet 65 would no longer have a zero-premium plan. Zoga, of the TRS, confirmed that contrast, though she noted by email that the zero-premium plan that’s soon to be history carries a $5,250 deductible; as of 2018, retirees not yet 65 will pay a $200 monthly premium and have a $1,500 deductible. Lee said too that retirees younger than 65 have counted on traditional benefits including copays for medical and pharmaceutical coverage. Zoga agreed copays will no longer be offered though she said that once such a retiree fulfills her or his deductible, the plan will pay 80 percent of subsequent costs, the retiree 20 percent. Checking effects for retirees 65 and older Retirees 65 and older, Lee wrote, "have lost access to a traditional Medicare supplement plan under TRS. They will now have access to a Medicare Advantage plan only." Lee called the new offering a reasonable plan though he said it will impose "markedly higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs." Zoga confirmed that most retirees will see an increase in premiums though she said a few will pay less than before. Retirees in one of the current TRS-Care plans, she said, would see an $800 decrease in their deductible for 2018 to $500. Lee also told us that many medical providers say they’ll refuse to accept the new plan and retirees are weighing whether to commit to the new TRS plan or shop for a plan accepted by their provider. Zoga didn’t confirm that many doctors have said they won’t take the new plan. By one analysis, she said, 96 percent of existing TRS-Care providers had at least already billed the insurer that will be providing the new plan. In addition, Lee said, retirees 65 or older are seeing costs for coverage for spouses nearly doubling. "Many retirees simply cannot afford the $394/month for spousal coverage," Lee wrote. "Again, the Legislature’s actions in the special session did provide more help to these retirees by lowering the new premium amounts (about a $50 reduction for spousal premium)," a figure confirmed by Zoga. Still, Lee said, "these amounts are still a heavy burden as the average TRS pension is $2,000/month. And, many do not receive any Social Security." Zoga advised that 95 percent of retired Texas school workers didn’t qualify for Social Security retirement checks. What was Dan Patrick’s role? Lee, asked about Patrick’s role in driving the changes, said: "During the special session, he took a strong personal interest in trying to make the situation better." We also shared Collier’s claim with Patrick, who oversees the Texas Senate, and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Collier said Patrick and Republican leadership this year "snatched millions of dollars in benefits from retired teachers." Benefits are shrinking: Starting in 2018, retirees enrolled in TRS-Care will have access to fewer health plans and they’ll mostly face greater costs. But this claim leaves out details and vital context. That is, legislators agreed to this course across party lines. In addition, inaction could have left TRS to phase out retiree health plans entirely. Meantime, TRS forecasts another funding shortfall likely demanding legislative attention in 2019. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-04929	"The White House has three staff calligraphers making between $86,000 and $97,000 each, and just one National Security Director. She makes $55,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/30/mike-huckabee/calligraphers-make-more-national-security-director/	Every year, the White House releases a list of its employees and their salaries. When the 2012 list came out, Mike Huckabee found fodder there to take a jab at the Obama administration. Huckabee, a former presidential candidate and now a talk show host, wrote on on his Facebook page, "If you want a good job, you should’ve gone into government." He noted that the total White House payroll went up $700,000 from the year before; it now stands at $37.8 million. Then, commenting on the timing of the administration’s data dump -- late on a Friday afternoon -- he wrote, "Maybe they just didn’t want to explain their priorities, considering that we now know the White House has three staff calligraphers making between $86,000 and 97,000 dollars each, and just one National Security Director. She makes $55,000." That seemed curious. For this fact check, we’re looking into whether the White House puts penmanship above managing foreign affairs. Huckabee’s post was recommended over 4,500 times and got over 5,100 Likes. On top of that, the same comparison showed up on a number of other blogs and Facebook pages. We downloaded the salary spreadsheet from the White House website and found that Huckabee has his numbers right. There are three calligraphers and just one National Security Director, and they make what he said they make. There is, however, an important issue about the job description for the National Security Director. Through Huckabee’s website we asked what he thought the National Security Director did. We did not get a response. We did get a description from the White House. The National Security Director basically helps with human resources for the national security staff. The person in that job is Kinsey Casey. Casey makes sure that open positions are filled, which includes vetting and interviewing applicants. She helps new staffers transition and generally takes care of the details of personnel management. In short, she does administrative work. Prior to this job, Casey had a mid-level position during the presidential inauguration managing credentials for participants and guests. During the 2008 primary, she was the Northeast Regional Political Director for the John Edwards campaign. Huckabee might have confused the National Security Director with the National Security Adviser. This is a high-profile position currently held by Thomas Donilon, a lawyer who was once chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Clinton administration. Donilon helps shape strategy on major international issues such as the civil war in Syria, Iran’s nuclear program, and North Korea. He is part of a trio of advisers, one of whom focuses on preventing violent extremism in the U.S., and the other who deals with international economics. All three advisers make $172,200 a year, nearly twice the salaries of the calligraphers. Before the Huckabee Facebook post, we hadn’t given much thought to the White House calligraphers. It turns out they’ve been part of the staff for decades. They design and handletter the menus, invitations, and ceremonial declarations for formal events. C-SPAN profiled them in 2008. The Huckabee post notes that the staff payroll rose $700,000 since last year. That is accurate but it’s also true that it is $1.3 million less than 2009, Obama’s first year in office. For the record, the median salary around the White House is about $65,700. Our ruling Huckabee said that the National Security Director makes less than the three White House calligraphers. That’s accurate, but the statement would have us believe that this particular national security job has a lot to do with policy. That is wrong. It is an administrative position and to suggest otherwise is misleading. Also, Huckabee singles out the Obama administration for having misplaced priorities when the White House has employed calligraphers for decades under both Republican and Democratic presidents. It doesn't mean the White House places penmanship above national security. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2012-07-30T15:06:47	2012-07-05	['White_House']

pomt-10430	"The pastor McCain calls his 'spiritual guide,' Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a 'false religion.' "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/15/moveon/parsley-and-mccain-relationship-appears-political-/	Note to readers: An update was posted to this item on May 23, 2008, to reflect new information. See note at the end of this story. In an e-mail to supporters, the liberal group MoveOn.org attacked Sen. John McCain for his ties to leaders of the religious right. "McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his 'spiritual guide,' Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a 'false religion.'" It's true that Parsley has endorsed McCain, and Parsley has made strident statements about Islam. Parsley is an Ohio minister who heads the World Harvest Church and an affiliated Bible college based in Columbus. He hosts a nationally syndicated television show and has authored books including Silent No More , a collection of Parsley's opinions on political and moral issues, and Culturally Incorrect , which urges Christians toward greater civic and political involvement. An advocacy group he founded, the Center for Moral Clarity, promotes his opinions on conservative social issues. The MoveOn e-mail quotes Parsley's words from Silent No More : "I cannot tell you how important it is that we understand the true nature of Islam, that we see it for what it really is. In fact, I will tell you this: I do not believe our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand our historical conflict with Islam. I know this statement sounds extreme, but I do not shrink from its implications. The fact is that America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed, and I believe that Sept. 11, 2001, was a generational call to arms that we can no longer ignore." The book further explains that the Allah who inspired Mohammed was a demon spirit, that Islam enslaves women, and that it converts people by deception. (Needless to say, many Muslims would disagree with this description, and these charges are not what we're fact-checking here.) A spokesman for Parsley said MoveOn took his words out of context and pointed to a Frequently Asked Questions page on the Web site of Parsley's Center for Moral Clarity. "Q. Does Pastor Parsley hate Muslims?" "Pastor Parsley loves people and hates the belief systems that keep them from the truth. Islam is a false, dangerous religion. Peace-loving Muslims need the full support of all Christians. "There are two divisions of Muslims in the world – peace-loving and radical Muslim extremists. In fact, many peace-loving Muslims are appalled at what is being done in the name of their religion. They were horrified by the events of September 11, 2001, and they are appalled by the actions of suicide bombers across the world. Christians must provide understanding, cooperation, support, and friendship to peace-loving Muslims throughout the world who share our desire for democracy and peace." McCain, called Parsley "a spiritual guide" -- not his spiritual guide -- while onstage at a campaign event in Cincinnati on Feb. 26, 2008. McCain was welcoming some of the dignitaries who were on stage with him when he said, "I'm very honored today to have one of the truly great leaders in America, a moral compass, a spiritual guide, Pastor Rod Parsley." McCain's campaign said soon after that event that McCain does not meet regularly with Parsley, and a spokesman for Parsley said McCain has never attended services at World Harvest Church. Given that context, it seems likely that McCain meant he and Parsley shared similar values rather than Parsley personally advised him. People who read MoveOn's e-mail would probably think Parsley advises McCain on spiritual matters, and we find no evidence that that is the case. Rather, it seems more like a garden-variety political endorsement. Also, Parsley wrote that America was founded in part to see Islam destroyed, and MoveOn doesn't mention that caveat. MoveOn is right that Parsley has strong views opposing the religion. When we balance these facts against each other, we come to the conclusion that MoveOn's statement is Half-True. UPDATE: On May 22, 2008, McCain rejected Parsley's endorsement at the same time he rejected the endorsement of another minister, John Hagee. (For details on the Hagee controversy, see our statement update here .) A report from ABC News about Parsley had aired that morning discussing Parsley's views on Islam. "I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America," McCain said of Parsley.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2008-05-15T00:00:00	2008-04-05	['Islam', 'United_States', 'John_McCain']

pomt-08498	Rand Paul "wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/08/jack-conway/jack-conway-says-rand-paul-backs-2000-deductible-m/	During this election season, Republicans have been hammering Democrats over cuts they say were made to Medicare as part of the health care bill. Now, in a television ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democrat Jack Conway is turning the tables, attacking Republican Rand Paul over Medicare deductibles. Here's the transcript of the ad, released Sept. 28, 2010: Narrator: "More from Rand Paul." Footage of Rand Paul: "The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible." Man: "A $2,000 deductible?" Man: "Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?" Woman: "That's crazy." Woman: "I can't afford that." Footage of Rand Paul: "The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible." Man: "I don't know what planet he's from." Woman: "Rand Paul is off the wall with the $2,000 deductible." Man: "He knows we can't afford that." Woman: "The more we hear about Rand Paul, the worse it gets." Conway: "I'm Jack Conway, and I approved this message." The grainy footage of Paul is real. It comes from a talk that Paul, an ophthalmologist and longtime libertarian, gave to the Center-Right Coalition, a conservative group, in Lexington, Ky., on June 19, 2009. A longer excerpt from Paul's talk has been posted on YouTube. To see whether Conway's ad takes Paul's remarks out of context, we transcribed the portion of his speech in which he talks about Medicare. "What's the problem in medicine?" Paul began. "No price fluctuation. If you're over 65 and go to a doctor in this country, you pay the exact same price with every doctor in the whole country. So when they want to blame ... that on capitalism, we have to be smart enough and say, 'We don't have capitalism. We already have socialism.'" He continued, "Medicare is socialized medicine. People are afraid of that because, 'Oh, you'll say you're against Medicare.' No, I say we have to do something different. We can't just eliminate Medicare. But we have to figure out how to get more to a market-based system. It's counter-intuitive to a lot of people, but you have to pay for things if you want prices to come down. So you really need higher deductibles. And the real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible, but try selling that one in an election. But that's the real answer is, you have to pay for things. And when you do, but you also get rid of price controls. So you raise the deductible, you get rid of price controls, and you allow more competition. And you may have to allow more competition from other parties. Nurse practitioners, we already have some. Pharmacists. There have to be ways to allow medicine to come down." His comment was no one-time slip of the tongue. The Conway campaign released another ad with footage of at least five other occasions in which Paul spoke publicly about his preference for high deductibles for Medicare, sometimes even invoking the same $2,000 figure. Indeed, Paul has been caught on camera being open about the political hazards of making such a proposal. In the Lexington talk featured in the first ad, Paul immediately followed his mention of the $2,000 figure with the addendum, "but try selling that one in an election." And in the follow-up ad, a clip shows him acknowledging the political risk with striking frankness. "The hard part," he said, "is how do you present this on national TV? I mean, what's going to happen to me in a statewide race if I tell people I think the Medicare deductible is going to be higher? Am I going to be booted out of the room? I don't know. I'm willing to take a risk because I think it's the right thing to do, and because the other answer is to become just like Canada." We did not receive a response from the Paul campaign for this article, but the campaign has responded through TV ads. On Oct. 7, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published a side-by-side comparison of the Paul campaign's two response ads and found subtle but noteworthy differences. In the first, the Paul campaign says that Paul "never supported higher Medicare deductibles." In the second, the ad was changed to say that Paul "doesn't support higher Medicare deductibles." Had they stuck with the first ad, it would have been undermined by a half-dozen film clips. Paul refined his policy toward Medicare during an appearance on Fox News on Oct. 6. Paul said that he did not want to impose deductibles on current Medicare beneficiaries but rather on future beneficiaries, possibly starting with those who are currently 55 or younger. So even Paul now acknowledges that he thinks Medicare deductibles are worth considering. But does Conway's ad fairly portray the views Paul had espoused at the time? They come close, but we do offer one caveat. We think that the general impression Conway's ad gives -- and in particular the line where the man says, "Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?" -- is that what Paul wants to do is slap seniors with a $2,000 deductible, even though his plan is much more comprehensive. Paul's ideas for Medicare may be good or bad, but the ad is somewhat misleading when it reduces them to a simple $2,000 deductible. That said, we see it as a relatively minor exaggeration. Paul has advocated for a $2,000 deductible in multiple settings, and on balance we rate the ad Mostly True.	None	Jack Conway	None	None	None	2010-10-08T14:20:59	2010-09-28	['Medicare_(United_States)']

pomt-11968	"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2017/oct/03/sarah-huckabee-sanders/chicago-toughest-gun-control-claim-shot-full-holes/	Facing questions from reporters on Oct. 2 about whether the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history would stir action on gun control, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called up a page straight from the campaign playbook of her boss. "I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there," Sanders said. "So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact." Sanders’ statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago. During his third debate with Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Donald Trump used Chicago to bolster his belief in the folly of fighting gun crime with stricter gun laws. "In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city," Trump said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump was correct that Chicago’s gun violence led the nation. But a check by PolitiFact Illinois revealed that he was wrong by a long shot about the city having "the toughest gun laws in the United States." Just about anyone who follows crime trends and gun regulations in the U.S. with any degree of seriousness knows by now that the "Chicago-as-gun-law-Mecca" charge is a canard that lost its last vestige of credibility more than four years ago, when Illinois became the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of firearms. Trump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as "proof" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sanders took Trump’s illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago’s handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can’t be prevented with legal restrictions. Here’s why Sanders and all of those who continue to repeat her statement on social media and elsewhere are wrong about Chicago’s gun laws. Ban banished Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. When the U.S. Supreme Court’s District of Columbia vs. Heller decision in 2008 struck down a similar ban in the District of Columbia, Chicago was the only major city left with a blanket handgun prohibition. The distinction didn’t last long. In 2010, the high court followed up Heller with a ruling in McDonald vs. City of Chicago which nullified Chicago’s ban. At that, the concealed carry of firearms was still outlawed in Chicago as it was throughout all of Illinois. Two years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry. As we noted last year in fact-checking Trump’s Chicago-bashing: With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. We also noted last year that the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun laws, found Illinois’ firearm laws too lenient in several ways, all of which still apply: Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its "Smart Gun Laws" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Seven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings. Update In last year’s fact-check, we noted that Trump’s statement also could have been interpreted as Chicago having strict gun laws because it imposed strict penalties on those who violate them or use guns in crimes. Even staunch gun rights advocates have argued that this approach can be an effective crime deterrent where restrictions on lawful gun ownership are both unconstitutional and ineffective. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had for several years pushed unsuccessfully for a new state law containing harsher penalties for repeat gun offenders. A 2014 report by the Chicago Sun-Times found that lenient sentencing for gun offenders was a factor in repeat offenses. That was where things stood when Trump made his statement in 2016. That changed on June 23, when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that, among other things, increased the minimum sentence for repeat gun offenders from three to seven years. Thus even the argument that Chicago favors getting tough on lawful gun owners over cracking down on gun criminals no longer applies. Our ruling Sanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. "I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country," she said. "That certainly hasn’t helped there," There was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.’s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago’s still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities. In the thick of 2016 presidential campaign, we rated a nearly identical statement from then candidate Trump as Mostly False. Since then, similar claims have been uttered frequently by others and repeatedly debunked. Sanders therefore has had ample opportunity to learn her boss had been flat wrong when making the same claim on the campaign trail. Her revival of the claim, made in the midst of the debate raging over the Las Vegas massacre, is at best intellectually lazy and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead. There’s no mitigating factor or missing context here. Sanders’ statement earns our lowest credibility rating, Pants on Fire.

pomt-12581	"We’ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/09/ben-cardin/did-senate-republicans-filibuster-obama-court-nomi/	Republicans changed Senate rules to break a Democratic filibuster and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, and blamed Democrats for necessitating the change along the way. Democrats, as you might imagine, saw it differently. In a post-mortem on the Senate showdown, Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., whether the Democrats’ made a strategic mistake deciding to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. Cardin said both parties are to blame, noting that Republicans engaged in the same type of action during President Barack Obama’s first term, when Republicans held up Obama’s judicial nominees. "We’ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate," Cardin said April 9. "Both sides have blame here." We heard a similar claim on ABC’s This Week. Former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell "who blocked more of President Obama's nominees than have been blocked in history." Is that so? Defining, counting filibusters Cardin used the term "filibuster," but measuring filibusters is troublesome, experts say, because it has an overly broad meaning. Senators tend to consider any type of obstruction to scheduling a nomination or measure as a filibuster, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. "The whole use of the term filibuster is problematic, given its evolution over the years," added University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis. "It ends up being a regular event, used all the more frequently in more partisan Congresses." As a result, experts say a way to approximate — but not entirely count — filibusters is to count the number of times the Senate attempts to break a filibuster by forcing an up-or-down vote through a process called cloture. In recent years, a cloture motion required the approval of 60 senators. But in 2013, Democrats changed the rules so that a simple majority could invoke cloture for presidential appointments and lower court nominees. The 60-vote threshold stood for legislation and the Supreme Court. To confirm Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. It remains in place for legislation. What the research shows Cardin’s claim stems from a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. The document, along with a subsequent memorandum on the report, lists every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was filed through Nov. 20, 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules. According to the Congressional Research Service, senators sought attempted cloture action on judicial nominations approximately 86 times between 1967 and the end of 2013. (Pre-1967, the Congressional Research Service lists no cloture attempts -- so "history" as Cardin put it, is relatively short.) Of those, 50 were made before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and 36 were made between 2009 and when the Senate changed its rules in 2013. Miguel A. Estrada, a judge nominated in 2001 to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saw seven cloture attempts to break a logjam by Senate Democrats before withdrawing his nomination in 2003. So through that prism, Cardin is off. Cardin is closer if you look at individual judicial nominees who were subject to a cloture filing (because nominees like Estrada were subject to a cloture filing multiple times). Pre-Obama, 36 judicial nominees were subject to a cloture filing, we found. From 2009-2013, it was the same -- 36 judicial nominees. To put that in perspective, and to see Cardin's point, look at it this way: Less than one nominee per year was subject to a cloture filing in the 40 years before Obama took office. From 2009-13, the number of nominees subject to a cloture filing jumped to over seven per year. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was much closer to being correct when he said, "In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents." His figure included non-judicial nominees. As part of that fact-check we noted that "By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147." Senate Democrats made that same point in a tweet April 6. (Cardin's team said Sen. Chuck Schumer's inquiry on the Senate floor was the basis of Cardin's claim.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Cardin said, "We’ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate." Cardin used an imprecise term, "filibuster," to describe a precise Senate parliamentary procedure, "cloture." As far as cloture data kept by the Congressional Research Service, Cardin would be on safer ground if he avoided focusing on "judicial" nominees. By our count, cloture was filed on 36 judicial nominations during the first five years of Obama's presidency, the same total as the previous 40 years combined. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08321	Sen. Harry Reid voted "against declaring English our national language, twice."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/29/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-says-se-harry-reid-twice-voted-again/	The Sharron Angle campaign calls its ad"The Wave." But you may know it as the ad that prompted Joy Behar of ABC's The View to say: "I'd like to see her do this ad in the south Bronx. Come here, b----. Come to New York and do it." Condemned in some Democratic and Hispanic circles as"racist,"the ad portrays Angle's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Harry Reid, as a friend to illegal immigrants. Here's the text of the ad: "Waves of illegal aliens streaming across our border joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear. And what is Harry Reid doing about it? Voting to give illegal aliens Social Security benefits, tax breaks and college tuition, voting against declaring English our national language twice and even siding with Obama and the president of Mexico to block Arizona's tough new immigration law. Harry Reid....it's clear whose side he's on, and it's not yours." In a fact-check of a previouscampaign ad, we dealt with Angle's claims that Reid voted to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits (Barely True) and special tax breaks (False). Here, we're checking the claim that Reid voted against "declaring English our national language, twice." During a big push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.4064) "to declare English as the national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective U.S. citizens." The amendment would have required all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English. It also sought to establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Arguing for the amendment, Inhofe said providing multilingual assistance costs the government more than $1 billion per year. Under the Inhofe's proposal, immigrants seeking to become permanent legal residents would have had to prove they had learned English. Reid made an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on May 18, 2006, denouncing the bill as "racist" and "divisive." Here's a sampling of some of his comments to give you a flavor of Reid's position: -- "While the intent may not be there, I really believe this amendment is racist. I think it is directed basically to people who speak Spanish." -- "I think we should make sure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to somebody who can speak Spanish." -- "Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. We want people to integrate, to learn English, but they need tools to do this no matter what their native language. This amendment takes some of those tools away, and we need all of those tools." -- "The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is English as a second language. This will slow that down. This amendment impacts English speakers, reporting of crimes, reporting of diseases, involvement in commerce. Next, is it going to impact upon the right to vote?" -- "This amendment is divisive. We should be here to unify our country, not divide it by ethnicity or language differences. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Everyone who speaks with an accent knows that they need to learn English as fast as they can. Success in America means the ability to speak English. That is the way it is now. We don’t need this amendment. Speaking English is critical to the functioning of anyone in our country. It is the language of our government, of our nation, and as I have indicated before, air traffic controllers and diplomacy. This amendment, I believe, is unconstitutional. It raises serious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their rights." -- "This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of federal law, I believe, that guarantee the right of non-English-speaking students to learn English in our public schools." -- "This amendment conflicts with provisions of federal law that require language materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas of non-English languages, where there is evidence of educational discrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration turnout." -- "There has been substantial evidence of harassment, intimidation, even violence against language minority voters. This provision makes a blatant violation of the 14th and 15th amendments and criminal provisions of the Voting Rights Act more likely to occur." -- "By the very terms of this amendment, persons accused of crimes would be denied the ability, I believe, to receive information material in their native language to assist in their own defense. This clearly violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment of our Constitution." -- "I have talked about public health. This amendment will stand in the way of efforts made to facilitate the transmission of vital information necessary for the receipt of health care and public safety, including informed consent by non-English-speaking patients." -- "I hope we reject this amendment. It is bad policy. It is un-American. It turns back the clock on the substantial gains that language minority citizens have made. I hope that there will be a resounding vote against this. I have no problem going home today and telling the people of the State of Nevada: English is the language of America. We are not going to change that with this amendment. This is divisive, it is mean spirited. I think it is the wrong way to go." So tell us how you really feel about the amendment, Senator. Needless to say, Reid voted against it, but with the help of 11 Democrats, the amendment passed 62-35. Interestingly, the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment (S.AMDT.4073) proposed by then Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., "to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language." Reid voted for that amendment, which passed by a vote of 58 to 39. The immigration reform bill did not pass that year, however, and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007, Inhofe again proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.1151) "to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States, and for other purposes." Reid again voted against it, though the measure passed 64-33. But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either. To this day, no "official language" exists at the federal level. The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to "declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States," even as he voted for an amendment "to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States." The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language. Reid not only voted against the bills, he was quite vocal in his opposition. We rate the ad's claim True.

pomt-06590	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "is denying Democrats the right to vote."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/25/democratic-governors-association/democrats-group-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-de/	Critics ranging from the AFL-CIO to talk show host Al Sharpton to the Wisconsin Democratic Party have accused Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker of voter suppression efforts. Perhaps none has been as blunt as the Democratic Governors Association. In an online ad that encourages readers to sign a petition, the group says flatly: "Gov. Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote." Wisconsin’s Republican governor is stopping Democrats from voting? Is that even possible? DGA’s outrage is based on the state’s new photo ID law for voting, which Walker signed in May 2011. Under the law, nearly all voters -- with exceptions for nursing home residents, military personnel voting absentee and others -- will have to present photo identification beginning with the 2012 presidential primary election. Free ID cards are available from the state. Voters without a photo ID could cast a provisional ballot that would be counted if they showed photo ID to an election clerk by the Friday after the election. We rated as True a claim that an early version of the bill was the most restrictive in the nation, primarily because relatively few types of identification would have been allowed for voting. But the final version added more types of IDs and made it easier to cast provisional ballots, something we also looked at in the past. In any case, the law makes no distinction about voters with any particular party affiliation. The requirements apply to every eligible voter. We asked DGA spokesman Mark Giangreco for evidence to back the statement in the ad, which he said began running in May 2011 and will continue running indefinitely. He said it’s clear Walker’s actions "make it more difficult for traditionally Democratic constituencies to cast a ballot." But that’s not what the ad says. It says Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote. The group cited four points as evidence: Photo ID law discourages voting The group said the law would discourage traditionally Democratic voters from voting. DGA cited two news articles about Walker signing the legislation. One quoted Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate as saying the law would have the most impact on "the elderly, students, shut-ins, African-Americans, Latinos and other groups that tend to vote Democratic," from voting. Another said no colleges in the state use IDs that meet the law’s requirements. DGA also cited a statement by state Sen. Bob Jauch, D-Poplar, that 175,000 state residents over 65 don’t have driver's licenses. Democrats argue that making voting more difficult through the bill will discourage traditionally Democratic voters from casting a ballot. It’s certainly true that some residents don’t have driver’s licenses, but free IDs are available; and, since the law was signed, a state agency has made it possible for colleges to add a sticker to student IDs to allow them to be used for voting. Regardless, adding a requirement that applies across the board does not deny Democrats -- specifically -- the right to vote any more than the requirement that voters be 18 and register to vote. Passage of law was rushed The DGA said photo ID was adopted too quickly. Giangreco cited a quote from Kevin Kennedy, head of the state Government Accountability Board, who said before the law was signed: "There has been no time for the careful evaluation and vetting needed to ensure the best options for voters and election officials is enacted." But that statement says nothing about denying any voting rights. Lack of photo IDs DGA said many voters don’t have photo IDs. The association cited an opinion article by the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. It noted a 2006 Brennan report that said 11 percent of voting-age American citizens -- and a greater percentage of African-American, low-income and older citizens -- do not have current and valid government-issued photo IDs. The article also cited other studies, although none was specific to Wisconsin. That essentially repeats the earlier point about some residents needing to obtain a photo ID. But that’s different than denying someone the right to vote. Lack of access to photo IDs The DGA said voters in some Democratic areas of the state would find it more difficult to obtain a photo ID if a plan by Walker to close some state Division of Motor Vehicles offices was adopted. The association cited a news article published two months after the DGA began running its ad. The article reported that a Democratic state lawmaker said the Walker administration’s plan to close DMV offices in traditionally Democratic areas, while expanding operation hours of DMV offices in Republican districts, seemed to be based on politics. The administration said closures would be based on economics, but dropped the plan in August 2011. So, this evidence surfaced after the ad began running and is no longer even on the table. We see a pattern here. The DGA’s evidence essentially amounts to a prediction that the photo ID law would cause some voters who tend to back Democrats to stop voting. Giangreco replied by saying: "I think that the (photo ID) law is tantamount to denying people the right to vote." That’s arguable -- and it’s not what is claimed in the ad. Our conclusion The Democratic Governors Association said Walker "is denying Democrats the right to vote." It can be argued that Wisconsin’s photo ID law will lead some people who tend to vote for Democrats to stop voting. It’s certainly true that most Wisconsin residents who don’t have a photo ID will have to get one in order to vote. But words matter. The association goes too far in saying Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote. That is simply not the case. We rate the claim as Pants on Fire.

pomt-11541	The "FBI was actively investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server" on Sept. 2, 2016.	false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/12/matt-gaetz/fbi-not-actively-investigating-clinton-emails/	Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., jumped to conclusions about former President Barack Obama’s involvement in the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server following the release of a tranche of FBI messages. In one of the texts messages released in a report of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton emails by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., FBI lawyer Lisa Page told Peter Strzok, an FBI agent with whom she was romantically involved, that Obama wanted "to know everything we’re doing," on Sept. 1, 2016. The unspecified subject Obama wanted to know everything about spurred Republican speculation. Gaetz said in a since-deleted tweet that the message referenced the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email address while serving as secretary of state. "On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton’s use of a private email server, #Page said that ‘POTUS wants to know everything we’re doing.’ This assertion raises alarming questions about the extent of Obama’s involvement with FBI investigations." But the Wall Street Journal reported that associates of Strzok and Page said the texts were about Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, which they were then investigating. We won’t speculate as to whether the Clinton emails were the subject of this text message. Instead, we were curious about the timeline of events at the FBI. Was the bureau "actively investigating" Clinton’s emails on Sept. 2, 2016, as Gaetz said? We found no indication of that. Gaetz’s office did not respond to our initial requests for evidence, and then deleted the tweet. They later told us they had been referring to the State Department, not the FBI. The FBI declined to comment, and the State Department did not respond to our request for comment. Timeline On July 5, 2016, then-FBI director James Comey announced of the Clinton email server investigation that, "After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision." "Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case," Comey said. On Oct. 28, 2016, Comey made an unexpected announcement in a letter to several members of Congress. "In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation," Comey wrote. "I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation." Comey was referring to messages found on Anthony Weiner’s seized computer, where investigators were looking into whether Weiner had committed a crime by sexting a teenage girl. They discovered that Huma Abedin, Clinton’s top aide and Weiner’s wife, also used that laptop to communicate with Clinton, so they decided to investigate whether there was any classified information in them. Re-opened? Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chaired the House Committee on Oversight in 2016, tweeted, "FBI Dir just informed me, ‘The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.’ Case reopened." But Comey never used the word reopened because, as NBC News’ Pete Williams reported, the case had never been officially closed. But that doesn’t mean the case was being actively investigated. "FBI officials told us that as a technical matter, it had not been closed," Williams told PolitiFact. "As I recall, some of the evidence had yet to be returned to the owners, for example, and there were other administrative issues. It would have been incorrect, we were told at the time, to say that the investigation had been ‘closed,’ which is something of a term of art at the FBI." "But that is not to say that the email matter was still being ‘actively investigated’ when the emails were discovered," Williams added. "Just because it wasn’t formally closed didn’t mean it was being actively investigated. It wasn’t an either/or." "Comey’s July announcement would mean that whatever those agents were doing, it was not working towards making the decision of whether or not to file charges," said Artin Afkhami, an associate editor at Just Security. "The key point here, in other words, is not that Comey is ‘reopening’ a closed matter because of some bombshell," Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare, wrote at the time. "It is that he is amending his public testimony to Congress that the FBI is done while the bureau examines new material that may or may not have implications for investigative conclusions previously reached." State Department Gaetz’s office told us that after taking a closer look at our request for evidence, they deleted the tweet and corrected the statement to say the State Department, not the FBI, had been actively investigating the server on Sept. 2, 2016. In that case, Gaetz’s office would be correct. The State Department reopened their investigation of Clinton’s emails on July 7, 2016, following a pause as the FBI investigated. We found no evidence they had finished their investigation at the time of the text message. Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, said it would not make sense for FBI agents to have been texting about the State Department investigation. "The State Department and the FBI conduct separate investigations," Mariotti said. "The State Department has different personnel, different records and different reports. In other words, if an agent was assigned to the State Department investigation, their evidence and reports would be distinct from the FBI." Our ruling Gaetz tweeted, "On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton’s use of a private email server, #Page said that ‘POTUS wants to know everything we’re doing.’" We found no evidence the FBI was actively investigating Clinton’s server on Sept. 2, 2016. The case had not been officially closed, but reporting indicates the investigation had ceased until the Weiner emails were discovered through a separate FBI investigation. Gaetz’s office since deleted the tweet and said they meant the State Department, not the FBI. The State Department investigation was active then, but it would have been strange for FBI agents to discuss a separate agency’s investigation. We rate this statement False.

pomt-05749	Says Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur "actually lives" in "a fancy condo in the Washington, D.C. suburbs."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/02/campaign-primary-accountability/texas-based-pac-says-marcy-kaptur-really-lives-fan/	Redistricting chewed up Rep. Dennis Kucinich’s old 10th Congressional District and him in the same new 9th Congressional House District as Rep. Marcy Kaptur. The two now are pit against each other in the March 6 Democratic primary. The location of their Ohio residency doesn’t actually matter legally. Members of the House are not constitutionally required to live in the districts they represent -- only to be an "inhabitant" of the that state. An ad from a Texas-based political action committee, though, trys to turn residency into an issue against Kaptur. A 30-second cable TV ad paid by the Campaign for Primary Accountability says the congresswoman "actually lives" in a "fancy condo in the Washington, D.C., suburbs" valued at $488,000. It dings her for saying in her own campaign ad that she lives in the same Toledo house where she grew up, and says she was late paying her property taxes in Ohio nine times. In support of its claims, the Campaign for Primary Accountability provided a copy of Kaptur's property assessment by the city of Alexandria, Va., and copies of site-search data from the Lucas County auditor in Ohio. Kaptur's campaign disputed the context but not the specific claims to PolitiFact Ohio and other reporters. "She does not live there (in Alexandria)," spokesman Steve Fought said. "She has a place where she stays. When the gavel falls and the (House) session ends, she is out of there like a rocket and back home with her brother. "Marcy Kaptur lives in the house where she grew up, which she inherited from her parents, with her brother, who is disabled." The house and property are valued at $68,800 by the Lucas County auditor. That house serves as her voting residence for the Lucas County Board of Elections. Kaptur's campaign acknowledged that she has paid a total of $295.20 in late fees on property taxes going back to 2006. Five instances involved three rental properties in her neighborhood. "She has always paid her taxes on her home and rental properties within 10 days of the due date except in one instance, when she was six weeks overdue and paid the penalty," spokesman Matthew Klempner said. He said the congresswoman is "fully current" on real estate taxes. The average condominium in Alexandria valued below Kaptur's at $266,919, according to the city budget director. The average value for all homes there was $632,958. Kaptur's campaign noted that the PAC ad does not mention that Kucinich bought a blighted, foreclosed house in Washington, D.C., in 2009, and that it has a current assessed value of $404,910. What does it add up to? First, we note that Washington area real estate values are not the same as those found in northern Ohio, so that the assessed values are much higher should not be a surprise. We also note that members of Congress do have to have a place to stay while serving in Washington. But that doesn’t mean that their permanent legal residence moves with them. In that regard, the ad’s claim is inaccurate. Kaptur does spend at least part of her year, when Congress is in session, in a condo in suburban Washington. By asserting that she "actually lives" there, however, the ad suggests that is her permanent residence, a claim that Kaptur disputes and that is not supported by her voter registration and her property tax payments in Ohio. Following that rationale, she would be ineligible to run for her seat from Ohio. And the same argument could be applied to virtually every other member of Congress. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.	None	Campaign for Primary Accountability	None	None	None	2012-03-02T06:00:00	2012-03-28	['Marcy_Kaptur', 'Washington,_D.C.', 'Ohio']
pomt-10596	"The average American is working through the month of May just to pay off the government."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/25/mike-huckabee/it-all-depends-what-you-consider-average/	Arguing for his Fair Tax plan — which calls for replacing all income tax with sales tax — Mike Huckabee trotted out a familiar arrow in the quiver of IRS bashers. "When you include the built-in tax, the embedded tax in the products we buy, that corporations build in, the average American is paying 33 percent in his or her taxes," Huckabee said at the Jan. 24, 2008, Republican debates in Boca Raton. "The average American is working through the month of May just to pay off the government." In citing the figure, Huckabee stepped squarely into the middle of an annual debate about the burden of taxation on average Americans. An organization called the Tax Foundation releases a report every year on the projected "Tax Freedom Day," the purported day at which an American pays off federal, local and state taxes. Tax Freedom Day is calculated by dividing the official government tally of all taxes collected in each year by the official government tally of all income earned in each year. Last year, that day was April 30 (two days later than in 2006, and five days later than 2000). According to the Tax Foundation, that means Americans worked for four months, from January 1 to April 30, before they earned enough money to pay their 2007 tax obligations. Every year, as reliably as the Tax Foundation puts out its Tax Freedom Day press release, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issues a competing press release that calls the Tax Foundation's numbers highly misleading. It's the word "average" that irks the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The United States has a progressive tax system, which means people who earn more pay a higher tax rate. Essentially, the wealthy shoulder a larger part of the tax burden. So while the Tax Foundation reports that Americans paid an average of 18.6 percent of their income in federal taxes in 2004, the Center would like you to consider an average taxpayer, someone in the middle fifth of the income distribution. In 2004, that segment of people paid an average of only 13.9 percent of their income in taxes. So, the Center would argue, Huckabee's claim that the "average American" works until May to pay off his or her taxes is an exaggeration. The "typical" American, they say, would pay off taxes much sooner. It's overstated every year, the Center says. Both sides are right here. The Tax Foundation provides an accurate overall average. And the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities accurately says that figure overstates the impact on an average American. Bottom line, it's mostly a debate over the term average. Had he said "Americans on average are paying ...," Huckabee would have been on more solid ground than "the average American is paying..." You follow? We can only give him a Half True.

pomt-00616	If you count United States airstrikes against ISIS, "75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/28/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-75-airstrike-missions-against-isi/	As the United States struggles with how best to respond militarily to Islamic State advances in Iraq, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a bit of context about how airstrikes in the region are proceeding. On the May 24, 2015, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, McCain -- a leading Republican voice on military matters -- was asked by host Bob Schieffer, "You have called this strategy a disaster. But what can, what should we be doing about this?" McCain responded that the first thing to do is to stop arguing that the United States is making significant progress against ISIS (also known as ISIL, the Islamic State or DAESH). "We need to have a robust strategy," McCain said. "We need more troops on the ground. We need forward air controllers. But just referring to airstrikes, do you know that 75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon? It’s because we don’t have somebody on the ground who can identify … a moving target. ... We found in Vietnam that if you don’t have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect." We wondered whether it’s correct that "75 percent" of combat airstrike missions "return to base without having fired a weapon." When we checked with the senator’s staff, they said that McCain -- who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee -- was basing his claim on data he was given by the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, the part of the military that oversees activities the region where the airstrikes are being carried out. The data McCain’s staff had at the time of his appearance on Face the Nation showed that through the end of March, there had been 2,950 strikes out of 12,121 strike-sorties, or 24 percent. That leaves 75 percent of sorties that had no strikes. (Strike-sorties do not include support flights, such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings.) We double-checked with the Pentagon, and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right. As of May 27, 2015, the United States had flown approximately 15,600 strike-sorties resulting in approximately 4,198 strikes, said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That works out to 27 percent -- slightly higher than the data McCain had, but close enough for our purposes. Pentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio. "The fact that aircraft go on missions and don't strike anything is not out of the norm," said Air Force Capt. Andrew "Ender" Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs. Despite U.S. strikes being "the most precise in the history of warfare," Caulk said, "conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges. We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk. However, the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment. This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades." Caulk added that if the United States engaged "the way some of these 'critics' want us to, we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk. The bottom line: We will not stoop to the level of our enemy and put civilians more in harm's way than absolutely necessary." Our ruling McCain said that if you count United States airstrikes against ISIS, "75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon." Statistics from the Pentagon back that up. We won’t wade into the debate over whether the current approach is right or needs adjusting, but on the specific data point McCain mentioned, we find no fault. We rate the claim True.

pomt-08100	"Toledo … is fourth in the nation behind much bigger cities — Miami, Las Vegas, Portland — in number of human trafficking arrests and rescues."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/14/teresa-fedor/state-sen-teresa-foder-laments-seriousness-human-t/	Ohio lawmakers were notorious this legislative session for not being able to agree on much. The state’s budget required several weeks of overtime before passage and both chambers combined to set a new modern-day collective low in the number of bills passed. That makes Senate Bill 235 — the state’s stab at cracking down on human trafficking — all the more noteworthy as it sailed through both the Ohio House and Senate by unanimous votes this December. And Gov. Ted Strickland is expected to sign it. The driving force behind passage of the bill was state Sen. Teresa Fedor, a Toledo Democrat, who began working on the legislation in 2005. During the Ohio Senate’s floor debate on Dec. 1, Fedor gave a passionate speech comparing human trafficking, which often is a feature of prostitution rings involving juveniles, to the slavery trade. As Fedor made her case for the legislation, she mentioned the frequent crackdowns on human trafficking that have taken place in recent years in her hometown of Toledo before uttering a startling statistic. "Sadly, in Ohio, Toledo, in my district is fourth in the nation behind much bigger cities — Miami, Las Vegas, Portland (Ore.) — in number of human trafficking arrests and rescues," Fedor said. Undoubtedly, human trafficking is a problem in Ohio. We certainly are home to our share of teenage runaways, pimps and the problems that come with it. But could Toledo, the 60th largest city in the country with about 316,000 residents, really be fourth worst in the whole country? Sounded like a case for PolitiFact Ohio. Asked for research to back up the ranking, Fedor’s office punted to Celia Williamson, a University of Toledo professor who chaired a special Research and Analysis Subcommittee of the Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission formed by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office. Williamson said Toledo’s No. 4 status comes from statistics compiled by the Northwest Ohio Innocence Lost Task Force, an FBI task force that was one of 39 created in 2004 across the country to crack down on human trafficking. The commission’s report listed Miami, Portland and Las Vegas as Nos. 1, 2 and 3. However, the Northwest Ohio task force’s statistics actually show that Toledo is fourth in the nation in the number of human trafficking arrests, investigations and rescues that involve minors, Williamson clarified. But she said she thinks the ranking is more of a reflection of heightened awareness of the problem in Toledo — rather than the problem truly being worse in Toledo than most other places in America. "My personal opinion is that Cleveland is worse," she said. "Cincinnati, Columbus and Youngstown all have a problem that is equal to Toledo, but they don’t have the resources in place to respond. Toledo is not unique at all, and soon we will not have that title. We just have a better response." While the Toledo FBI office didn’t return calls, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson said that the No. 4 ranking attributed to the Northwest Ohio Innocence Lost Task Force ranking comes from comparing the statistics from a pair of intense three-day sweeps made simultaneously in 2009 by all 39 task forces. The results of those sweeps showed Toledo as having the fourth-highest number of juveniles arrested, investigated and rescued over a pair of three-day periods in 2009 among the 39 cities in the United States where these FBI task forces exist. And while Wilson called Toledo "a city of origin" with "generational pimps," he also said he didn’t think the problem in Toledo was any worse than any other major metropolitan city. "Was Toledo way up there statistically in kids we recovered? Absolutely," Wilson said. "Is there more child prostitution in Toledo than in other major metropolitan areas? Maybe not." Wilson said more than 80 children had been rescued away from Toledo prostitution rings since 2004, but that the No. 4 ranking is still probably misleading. "I don’t know if that’s (number four ranking) completely accurate," said Wilson. "We do know that we had a problem in Toledo, we know that it’s a city of origin and we know we’re making progress there." So let’s review what we found out: Toledo did rank No. 4 in the number of human trafficking and arrests and rescues in a 2009 report comparing the statistics from a pair of intense three-day sweeps across the country, but those were cases that involved minors. Toledo’s foremost civilian authority on the issue, Professor Celia Williamson, the authority Fedor’s staff referred us to, doubts Toledo’s juvenile human trafficking problem is even the worst in Ohio. The FBI office in Cleveland says the No. 4 ranking comes from adding up those busted in a pair of sweeps made in 2009. But it agrees that ranking most likely isn’t accurate and doesn’t mean that Toledo really has the fourth-worst human trafficking problem in the country. There is a small element of truth behind Fedor’s statement; the 2009 report did have Toledo at No. 4 among 39 cities across the country that had arrest sweeps. But Fedor mischaracterized the statistic, omitting the word "minor" in her speech on the Senate floor. And both the state’s top expert and the FBI suspect the statistic is misleading. That’s why we rate her claim as Barely True -- but just barely. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Teresa Fedor	None	None	None	2010-12-14T06:00:00	2010-12-01	['Las_Vegas', 'Miami', 'Portland,_Oregon']

pomt-14545	On the Iraq war, "I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-early-opposition-iraq-war-wa/	In one of the most heated and personal back-and-forths from a debate this cycle, Donald Trump eviscerated former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for supporting his brother’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Trump stood by his comment in 2008 that Democrats should have impeached President George W. Bush over the invasion when asked about it in the Feb. 13 CBS debate in South Carolina. Trump vigorously refuted Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio’s statements hailing the former president’s leadership, saying, "The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe." Again, Trump said he was against the war from the very beginning. "I'm the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,’ " Trump said. "Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, ‘You'll destabilize the Middle East.’ " Trump often repeats this line, and we’ve rated a similar Trump claim Mostly False, because he didn’t appear to take any public position on the war until after the March 2003 invasion. In this more recent version of the statement, he also said he stated his opposition to the war "loud and clear." But the public record of his positions is thin. Let’s revisit the facts. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003, during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments We only found one instance where Trump discussed the war before it started. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would "destabilize the Middle East." A single, squishy comment about the looming war does not qualify as "loud and clear" opposition. The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. A week later Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, "I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out." Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place, or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the Middle East. Our ruling On the Iraq war, Trump said, "I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.' " Maybe Trump felt this way privately, but he made no publicly reported comments in the lead-up to the Iraq War that reflect this sentiment. He certainly did not say it "loud and clear." We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion, and he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. He only started publicly denouncing the war after it started.

pomt-15150	Says Russ Feingold cast the "deciding vote" for the "largest tax increase" in history	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/31/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republican-group-says-russ-feingold-cast-deciding-/	In recent years, when Republicans have thrown around the phrase "biggest tax increase in history," they’re usually talking about the Affordable Care Act. Not this time. An Aug. 7, 2015, news release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- its weekly "Feingold Flashback" -- said Democrat Russ Feingold had cast the "deciding vote for (the) ‘largest tax increase’ in history." Feingold, of course, is in a 2016 rematch with U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who defeated him in 2010. The claim carries two key elements. Was this tax increase the largest ever? And was Feingold the deciding vote? Biggest tax increase in history The tax increase in question was part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which sought to reduce the federal deficit by increasing taxes by $241 billion over five years and cutting federal spending. Feingold was in his first year in the Senate at the time. When asked to back up its claim, the NRSC pointed to a statement from the late Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan that called the bill "the largest tax increase in the history of public finance in the United States or anywhere else in the world." A spokesman from the NRSC said it was simply quoting Moynihan, but the largest-in-history message was clearly coming from the group. The quote was used in the headline and formed the central argument of its news release. In 2010, we checked a statement from the Republican Governors Association that said then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Barrett had voted for "the largest tax increase in history." Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, was a member of Congress when he backed the same law being cited now. We rated the claim Mostly False. The 1993 increase was the largest tax hike at the time in terms of raw dollars. But economists tend to prefer measuring such increases as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. This helps account for the growth in the size of government and -- importantly -- inflation over the years. As a percentage of GDP, the largest tax increase since 1940 was the Revenue Act of 1942, followed by the Revenue Act of 1941, which were used to pay for World War II. By the GDP measure, the 1993 increase was also smaller than Ronald Reagan’s Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Here’s an example of why using raw dollars is not the best measuring stick: In 1942, $100 had the same buying power as $1,460 has today. A dollar then was worth much more than today. But Feingold also voted for the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare. Could that have been the largest? On the high end of estimates, Obamacare could raise as much as $525 billion from its implementation to 2019. This would make Obamacare the largest increase in terms of raw dollars. But when measured as percentage of GDP, Obamacare is similar to the size of the 1993 tax increase. Deciding vote The second part of the claim is that Feingold was the "deciding vote" on the 1993 law. For backup, the NRSC pointed us to Russ Feingold's 2004 campaign website, where it claimed, "Russ cast the deciding vote in favor of the 1993 Deficit Reduction package." That’s a reference to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. And records show Feingold cast a vote in favor of both the bill and the conference report that accompanied it. While Feingold touted his own vote as decisive, it’s not that simple. When the Senate votes were tallied, it was a 50-50 deadlock. That meant then-Vice President Al Gore had to break the tie. So,without Feingold’s his support, the would not have gotten to Gore. But 49 other people could say the same thing. Indeed, Feingold said he was going to vote for the measure more than a week before it came up for a vote. When PolitiFact National looked into a "deciding vote" statement in 2010, it mentioned U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. as one of those who held off on a vote for the bill until the last minute. No mention of Feingold being a last-minute vote on the bill. Our rating In a news release, the National Republican Senatorial Committee said Russ Feingold cast the "deciding vote" for the largest tax increase in history. The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was the largest at the time in terms of raw dollars, but does not get the top spot by the measure preferred by economists. As for Feingold being the "deciding vote," the Democrat once declared that himself. But Gore’s vote was the real tiebreaker. Our definition for Mostly False is a statement that "contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here.

pomt-09330	"I don't answer hypotheticals."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-doesnt-answer-hypothetical-questio/	Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to answer a "what if?" question on ABC News' This Week, saying she didn't like those kinds of questions. Here's the exchange with interviewer Jake Tapper: Tapper: "President Obama officials say he's contemplating presenting a peace plan to help jump start the process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What advice do you give President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace plan?" Clinton: "Well, I never share advice that I give directly to any president." Tapper: "Well then, hypothetically?" Clinton: "Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations again to deal with these very difficult final status issues." We zeroed in Clinton's claim that she doesn't answer "hypotheticals." Politicians often say that, but they'll answer them when it's in their political interest. Such is the case with Clinton. Indeed, we found several instances of Clinton batting away hypothetical questions, just as she did with Tapper: • In an interview with the BBC last October, when asked about sanctions for Iran if it acquires a nuclear weapon, she said, "I don't want to get ahead of myself and I don't want to answer a hypothetical. I think it's important that we stay together, we keep moving together, and we stay committed to the same goal, which is to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons pile." • During a CNN interview a few weeks later on the same topic, she answered, "Well, I don't want to speculate or answer a hypothetical. I want this process to play out." • In June 2007, Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton about using military force to stop genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. "Well, but, we're not going to engage in these hypotheticals," she said. "I mean, one of the jobs of a president is being very reasoned in approaching these issues, and I don't think it's useful to be talking in these kind of abstract, hypothetical terms." • She protested hypotheticals again in a debate moderated by Tim Russert in February 2008, when Russert asked, if "al-Qaida resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?" Clinton answered, "You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals," before answering broadly, "You have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future." But every so often, Clinton will answer hypotheticals. We found a few examples in the presidential campaign where her answer allowed her to distinguish herself from then-Sen. Barack Obama, to emphasize her hard-line approach on foreign affairs. During an April 2008 debate, she answered a question about what U.S. policy should be if Iran were to attack Israel. "Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States, but I would do the same with other countries in the region," she said. A week later, in an interview with Keith Olbermann, she was asked what would constitute "massive retaliation." She didn't specifically answer his question, she didn't protest that it was hypothetical, either. Perhaps the most significant example we found was when Brian Williams asked candidates a stark hypothetical about terrorist attacks on the American homeland. He started with Obama. "Senator Obama, if, God forbid a thousand times, while we were gathered here tonight, we learned that two American cities had been hit simultaneously by terrorists, and we further learned beyond the shadow of a doubt it had been the work of al-Qaida, how would you change the U.S. military stance overseas as a result?" Williams asked. Obama talked about managing an effective emergency response and making sure the United States had high-quality intelligence on who had attacked. Clinton didn't quibble about the hypothetical in this case and emphasized she would make a strong and swift response. "Well, again, having been a senator during 9/11, I understand very well the extraordinary horror of that kind of an attack and the impact that it has far beyond those who are directly affected," she said. "I think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate. If we are attacked and we can determine who was behind that attack, and if there were nations that supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us, I believe we should quickly respond. Now, that doesn't mean we go looking for other fights. You know, I supported President Bush when he went after al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. And then when he decided to divert attention to Iraq, it was not a decision that I would have made had I been president, because we still haven't found bin Laden. So let's focus on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy them." The next day, the Clinton campaign even promoted her response to the hypothetical, saying Clinton "was the candidate who demonstrated that she would know how to respond if the country was attacked." So Clinton has a mixed record on hypothetical questions. She's dodged many, as she did with Tapper, but she's also answered a fair number -- particularly when it suited her political goals. So we rate her statement Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2010-04-13T15:03:48	2010-04-11	['None']

pomt-13913	Says Mark Zandi, who wrote a report criticizing Donald Trump’s economic proposals, is "one of Sen. John McCain's former economic advisers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-both-say-moodys-economist-others-tea/	When respected financial analysis group Moody’s published a blistering report critiquing Donald Trump’s economic proposals, Hillary Clinton jumped on it. "One of (Republican Sen.) John McCain’s former economic advisers actually calculated what would happen to our country if Trump gets his way. He described the results of a Trump recession. We would lose 3.5 million jobs. Incomes would stagnate. Debt would explode. And stock prices would plummet. And you know who would be hit the hardest? The people who had the hardest time getting back on their feet after the 2008 crisis," she said in a June 21 speech. Not so fast, Trump responded. Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist and the report’s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama. "Mark Zandi is an Obama adviser and Clinton donor," read the headline of a rapid response email from the Trump campaign. So who is this guy Mark Zandi? Zandi is a well-respected economist, one we have quoted as an expert in previous stories, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report is sharply critical of Trump’s policy proposals, but it is a serious, methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody’s says a similar report about Clinton’s proposals is forthcoming.) Though others might take issue with some aspects of Zandi’s findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of his Trump report or his work generally. Rather, Clinton is using Zandi’s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump’s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out she is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument — notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to her primary campaign. Beyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat. In the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain’s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity. Zandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is "eclectic" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated. After the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration. Zandi told us he wasn’t an adviser to Obama or the White House, as Trump claimed, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And Zandi was on Obama’s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn’t get the job. We asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats. "We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies," he said. "And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work." He also noted that one of the other three authors who worked on the report has donated to a Republican candidate this presidential cycle, though we were unable to confirm that point. Our ruling Clinton said that Mark Zandi, who wrote a report criticizing Trump’s economic proposals, is "one of John McCain's former economic advisers." Zandi was a donor and adviser to the McCain campaign, but that’s not the full picture of his political affiliations. As it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton’s primary campaign. Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years. But Clinton is invoking Zandi’s name to make the case that even Republicans oppose Trump’s economic proposals, and this argument is nearly hollow. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-14307	Says Donald Trump "wants us to pull out of NATO."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/01/hillary-clinton/donald-trump-wants-pull-us-out-nato-hillary-clinto/	Donald Trump’s calls for rethinking NATO and the United States’ involvement in it have, like so many of his ideas, stirred controversy. Given that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an institution relied on for security and peacekeeping, it’s no surprise that some reacted with alarm and condemnation. Among them was the Democratic frontrunner for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Campaigning in Milwaukee on March 28, 2016, Clinton declared that the Republican front runner "wants us to pull out of NATO." In recent days, Trump has repeatedly called NATO obsolete, saying it should be restructured. He has complained that the United States is paying too large a share of the organization’s costs. And, when pressed, he has said that if changes aren’t made if he is president, he might consider pulling the U.S. out of NATO. But is there evidence to back Clinton’s claim that Trump actually wants to pull out? NATO and its costs NATO was created in 1949, with the United States as one of the 12 founding members, largely to provide collective security against expansionism by the Soviet Union. The alliance, which now has 28 members, aims to protect freedom and security of its members through political and military means. Cost-sharing has been an issue. In 2014, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, now the speaker of the House, claimed that all 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense," but only Britain, Greece and the United States do so. We rated his statement Mostly True (Estonia also met that threshold.). Trump’s comments Clinton made her claim days after Trump made headlines with comments about NATO in separate interviews with major news organizations. The New York businessman told the Washington Post editorial board on March 21, 2016, that U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, the Post reported. "We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore," Trump said, adding later, "NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money." Later that week, Trump told New York Times reporters that NATO is "unfair, economically, to us," and said he was open to an alternative organization focused on counterterrorism. "So, NATO is something that at the time was excellent," he said. "Today, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of NATO." When pressed, as Clinton’s campaign pointed out, Trump has also indicated he would consider pulling the United States out of NATO. In a March 30, 2016, town hall event in Green Bay (where Trump said women who have abortions should be punished), moderator Chris Matthews twice tried to clarify with if Trump, as president, would "walk" if he couldn’t negotiate desired changes in NATO. "If we have to walk, we have to walk," Trump said. That statement came two days after Clinton made her claim, so it wasn’t evidence she could point to in making her statement. But even that is short of Trump saying he wants to pull the United States out of NATO. Our rating Clinton says Donald Trump "wants us to pull out of NATO." Trump certainly has opened the door to that possibility, suggesting that if reforms aren’t made to mission and cost sharing, he might consider pulling the United States out of the organization. But he hasn’t gone to say he wants to pull the United States out. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-01T09:45:00	2016-03-21	['NATO']

pomt-00983	Borrowing in my 2015-’17 state budget is less than half that in my predecessor’s last budget and "the lowest it has been in a decade."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-proposed-borrowing-lowest-de/	Even before he gave his 2015-’17 budget address, Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to borrow heavily for highways was under attack. So when he spoke before the Legislature on Feb. 3, 2015, Walker was ready for the critics -- including some fellow Republicans. "In my predecessor’s last budget, the total bonding level was $3.6 billion," Walker said. "In this budget, the total level of bonding is down to less than $1.6 billion. This is the lowest it has been in a decade." It’s not shocking to think borrowing was higher in 2009, amid the Great recession when many states turned to borrowing to fill budget gaps. Wisconsin, then led by Democrat Jim Doyle, was among them. But was borrowing $2 billion higher than in Walker’s 2015-’17 budget plan, covering a period more than six years after the recession officially ended? The independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau tracks new borrowing in each state budget: Here’s a look at budgets enacted since 2005 -- a decade ago -- and Walker’s new proposal: Year Governor Borrowing total 2005-’07 Jim Doyle $1.53 billion 2007-’09 Jim Doyle $2.76 billion 2009-’11 Jim Doyle $3.58 billion 2011-’13 Scott Walker $1.73 billion 2013-’15 Scott Walker $2.05 billion 2015-’17* Scott Walker $1.56 billion *Proposed The figures back up both parts of Walker’s claim. But there are important caveats. Walker is comparing the borrowing in his proposed budget, which still has to go through the Legislature, to the new borrowing in the final enacted version of the 2009-’11 budget. That makes the comparison a bit of apples-to-oranges. To illustrate, consider that in 2009, Doyle stood where Walker stood and unveiled a two-year budget with a proposed $1.5 billion in borrowing, reports from the fiscal bureau show. That’s actually a bit less than what Walker wants. As is typical later in the budget process, the State Building Commission -- controlled by the administration -- brought forth a capital budget to borrow for building construction on the University of Wisconsin campuses and elsewhere. It sought another $1.2 billion in new bonding above Doyle’s original proposal. Then the Legislature added in another $900 million and -- in the end -- Doyle signed off. That increased the total to the $3.6 billion. To be sure, more typically, the Legislature has reduced the borrowing sought by the executive branch. That could happen this year, too. Plus Walker says he will not propose any new borrowing in the capital budget that goes through the Building Commission. (Instead, he will use $858 million in previously authorized bonding authority and repurpose it for capital projects, but that tactic is not unusual, and those figures are not included in the Fiscal Bureau’s tracking of new borrowing.) Finally, another wildcard is the UW System, whose building projects typically make up a big chunk of state borrowing. If Walker’s plan to spin the system off under a new authority is approved, it could seek borrowing on its own, effectively removing that item from the state’s books. That makes a comparison to 2009 a bit sticky as well. Our rating Walker said his plan borrows $2 billion less than Doyle’s last budget and is the lowest borrowing level in a decade. It’s accurate if you compare the adopted budgets from that time to Walker’s proposed budget for 2015-’17 (which is all you can do right now). But the claim needs clarification because Walker’s comparing his early-stage proposal to a 2009 final enacted budget after lawmakers and Doyle pumped it up. We rate it Mostly True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-15148	"I released all my emails."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/31/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-has-released-all-his-emails/	As the other presidential candidate with a private email server, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to contrast himself with Democrat Hillary Clinton. "My email address, write it down, and send me your thoughts, jeb@jeb.org," he’s shown telling a crowd in an Aug. 27, 2015, campaign video (the clip is from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Aug. 14). "By the way, I just gave out my email address. It’s exactly what I did when I was governor of the state of Florida. I released all my emails; I’m writing an e-book about my emails." Bush and Clinton have drawn criticism from campaign rivals because they both used private email accounts and servers for their government jobs. But can Bush claim he’s released all of his emails as a way of drawing a distinction between himself and Clinton? No, in reality, he's done exactly what Clinton has done. Bush says he has turned over and made public all the emails he was required to. That's the same argument Clinton is making. And like Clinton, that means we may never know with 100 percent certainty if Bush left out any work-related emails. The email trail Clinton has faced mounting scrutiny first into whether she turned over all of her non-personal emails to the State Department, then questions about how she handled information that was eventually marked classified. Bush, meanwhile, has been very vocal about being open and transparent in his digital dealings. In December 2014, he announced the website jebbushemails.com, an archive of emails from the private email address he used as Florida’s governor, jeb@jeb.org. Bush used the private address on a private server every year between 1999 and 2007, corresponding with constituents and conducting state business while using a server he owned and kept at the governor’s office in Tallahassee. The archive site went live in February 2015 with a total message count his campaign has put at about 280,000. Now, that may sound like a lot, but they were by no means every email message Bush sent while he was governor, nor were they newly available to the public. The emails were already a part of the state archives, and could have been accessed by anyone who asked for them. That’s because under Florida’s Sunshine Law, an official has to turn over records and emails related to government business "at the expiration of his or her term of office." Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007. The last batch of emails was turned over in June 2014, raising a few eyebrows among critics for taking an unusually long time. The last batch of 25,000 emails was described as "Additional 2002-2003 emails." The American Democracy Legal Fund on Aug. 27 accused Bush of violating public records law for taking too long to turn over all his records. The group has asked the state attorney’s office in Leon County to fine Bush, although the rules on how long he could take are somewhat murky. So how many emails did Bush send as governor? We’ve asked the state archives to confirm the exact number they have from all accounts, but have not heard back. We’ll update this item if they let us know. The Bush campaign also did not confirm to us whether he meant he’d released all the emails from his private server, but it’s pretty clear he did not release every single one. We do know that during a 2007 interview, Bush said his private server had about 550,000 messages on it, a number his campaign has since declined to confirm to PolitiFact Florida. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told us in March that the number of emails on the server is "immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained." Bush also guessed he had gotten about 2.5 million more emails through a public email account run by the state. We aren’t really counting state account emails in this case, because the government was responsible for reviewing and archiving those. First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen has told PolitiFact that state workers would have seen and vetted messages from state government accounts, and not Bush’s private staff or lawyers. She thought most of the Bush emails from any official account had been retained and made public through the state archives. There also have been reports of a third account, jeb@gencom.net, which Bush’s campaign has denied having. The emails that Bush turned over from the private server, however, are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising, which the Sunshine Law allows him to do. So that means he didn’t literally release all his emails, just the ones he says he was required to give the state. There’s nothing in the law preventing him (or an authorized custodian) from editing them down the way he did, or from using a private account. But that also leaves room for doubt as to whether he left some messages out that should have been included in the public sweep. That is no different than points raised by Clinton’s detractors who have questioned whether she included all pertinent materials from her server. In short, we have to take Clinton’s word that she complied with the law. Same with Bush. Critics have pointed out there is a lack of correspondence among Bush’s released emails about subjects ranging from the 2000 election to Terri Schiavo (the case of a Florida woman on life support who Bush and lawmakers tried to intervene to save) to voter purges, although he did discuss Florida National Guard deployments via email after Sept. 11, 2001. In Florida, there are ways to investigate whether something that should have been included in public records isn’t available. Petersen said someone who thinks messages are missing from a records request can sue Bush in civil court and ask a judge to inspect the server. But there’s no evidence Bush has violated state law. No judge has asked for an inspection to see if any messages that should have been included are missing, either. Our ruling Bush said, "I released all my emails." In trying to draw a contrast to Hillary Clinton, Bush actually offered much of the same defense. In reality, Bush says he released all the emails he was required to under Florida law, in the same way Clinton says she turned over all the emails she was required to under federal law. But Bush hasn’t turned over every single email he sent as governor. While the state handled his public account’s emails, he was allowed to self-edit jeb@jeb.org correspondence from his private server. That amounted to 280,000 emails out of a half-million or more, which Bush repackaged on a website earlier this year. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09144	"Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/13/kevin-levitas/state-rep-says-georgia-sets-gold-standard-food-saf/	Note to readers: An update was posted to this item on June 29, 2010. Also, a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared July 7, 2010. See the note and letter at the end of this story. When we read a recent news release issued by state Rep. Kevin Levitas (D-DeKalb County), we thought back to a small town named Blakely. His announcement said that Gov. Sonny Perdue’s signing of the Sanitary Activity for Food-Processing Enterprises Act celebrated the strength of the state’s food-safety system: "Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety, and the SAFE Act continues our state’s long tradition of protecting the consuming public," Levitas said in the release. "An overwhelming majority of food processors in Georgia keep quality and safety as their primary concerns. The SAFE Act is intended to keep out the bad actors and punish the few who put profit over human life and safety." Georgia-produced peanut butter took a huge hit a few years back. The South Georgia town of Blakely was the home to a Peanut Corporation of America plant that helped spawn one of the biggest outbreaks of food-borne illness in the nation’s history. The salmonella outbreak in late 2008 sickened about 700 and was linked to nine deaths nationwide. Georgia Agriculture Department plant inspection reports showed grease and dirt buildup on equipment, unmarked chemical containers and gaps in doors large enough for rodents to scuttle through. One worker testified before Congress that she spotted roaches and rodents inside. Blakely came to symbolize Georgia’s lax culture of food-safety regulation. In 2007, salmonella from ConAgra Foods in Sylvester, the maker of Peter Pan peanut butter, made more than 600 people ill. That same year, botulism was found in canned chili from a plant in Augusta. It was the first outbreak of botulism from commercially canned foods in nearly four decades. Can a state that produced a tainted peanut butter that killed nine people set the "gold standard" for food safety? It’s hard to establish what a "gold standard" might be in the food safety arena. No ranking of state programs exists because it’s difficult to come up with a good way of scoring them. When we asked experts to name states with good systems, they cited Oregon, Minnesota and New York. Not Georgia. We asked Levitas for evidence backing his claim. He said that since the outbreak, the state Legislature has strengthened food-safety laws in two crucial ways: It created a requirement that food processors alert the state within 24 hours when tainted food is discovered, and it made it a felony for food processors to knowingly release contaminated products to the public. The reporting requirement is the result of 2009’s Senate Bill 80, which was passed in response to the peanut butter scare. Food processing safety experts we talked with had not heard of another state with a similar rule, so Georgia is unique in this regard. The problem is that the reporting rule applies to only a portion of food processors. A loophole allows food processors who submit a special "written food safety plan" to avoid being subject to the 24-hour reporting standard, according to the text of the bill, media coverage and interviews with experts. So while this requirement may be unusual, its impact is limited. This year’s House Bill 883 made the knowing release of tainted products to the public a felony in Georgia. Experts said this state law is unusual but the act is already a crime under federal law. Levitas said it was necessary to make releasing tainted food a crime on the state level to help local prosecutors. It’s easier to prosecute a bad food producer in court when there is a death of a consumer if it was the result of a state crime, he said. There are other ways to measure the strength of Georgia’s food-safety system. Some states are better than others at figuring out the cause of an outbreak. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group, Georgia had 283 tainted food outbreaks between 1998 and 2007. Ninety-nine were solved, said David Plunkett, a staff attorney for the group. "We’d say Georgia is fair to middling," Plunkett said. Another sign of a good food safety program is adherence to the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program, which was created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state food-safety regulators, said Joe Corby, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials and a respected food-safety expert. These standards, which Corby said are difficult to meet, establish requirements for inspector training, inspection, self-auditing and other procedures. Georgia is among 25 states implementing the program, according to the organization. That’s good, but not great. While Georgia legislators have passed new and sometimes unique food-safety regulations since the peanut butter scare, this state is far short of setting a gold standard. Georgia has a history of major food-safety lapses that have killed and debilitated consumers, and the laws passed in response are limited. We rate Levitas’ statement False. Update: A June 13 item on Rep. Kevin Levitas' statement that Georgia sets "the gold standard" on food safety contained a factual error. PolitiFact Georgia said that a new food safety law has a loophole that exempts some processors from having to report tainted food to the state within 24 hours. That's not the case. The loophole allows some processors to submit a special "written food safety plan" in lieu of following testing procedures set by the state but does not exempt those processors from the 24-hour rule. Our original ruling of "false" is unchanged. Had Rep. Levitas said the food safety laws in Georgia have gotten stronger, he would have been right, but the "gold standard" is clearly hyperbole. Letter to the Editor Published July 7, 2010 Newspaper's verbal nitpicking misses the point, misleads public As the AJC has now expressly acknowledged in its correction, the recently enacted SAFE Act has strengthened Georgia's food safety regulations. The act is a giant step by the Legislature toward achieving the "gold standard" that I proudly described. The AJC now portrays my effusive praise as "hyperbole." There is a vast difference between enthusiasm and falsity, as my statement was labeled. Divergences in characterizations do not reflect disparities in the truth. The AJC's focus on semantics, rather than on substantive benefits to Georgia consumers, does a disservice to its readers. Your paper demonstrated the same hyper-literalism when it scoffed at Roy Barnes's enthusiastic support for education by demeaning his allegoric suggestion that he would scrape gold from the Capitol dome, if need be, to improve education. In both cases, the AJC's verbal nitpicking missed the point entirely and misled the public. The important point was and is that the SAFE Act will move Georgia forward substantially in food-safety protection for Georgia consumers. Unfortunately, the AJC's ceding only about 200 words for my response to its 800-plus word attack devoted to my characterization precludes an adequate reply and prevents readers from having a fair forum in which to make up their own minds.

pomt-05822	"They're saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over [the Sakonnet River Bridge is from] out of state."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/20/john-g-edwards/state-rep-john-edwards-quoting-rhode-island-dot-sa/	State Rep. John "Jay" Edwards was a guest on WHJJ's Helen Glover show when the issue came up of requiring motorists to pay a toll to cross the Sakonnet River Bridge, which connects Portsmouth and Tiverton and is a main thoroughfare to and from Aquidneck Island. Edwards represents both towns. "It's just another tax on the people who live in East Bay," he said. "I'm sure there is going to be a split fare between the people who have a Rhode Island E-ZPass and those who do not. They're saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over that is [from] out of state." Glover expressed skepticism over that percentage. "I think that's mostly locals commuting for jobs," she said. It sounded like the perfect thing to track down. We called Edwards to find out precisely who "they" are. He told us he got the information from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and said he had his own doubts about the factoid. "I think they may be using it to make it sound more palatable," he said. When we contacted the DOT, spokesman Bryan Lucier, wrote us to say "The Director [Michael Lewis] has stated publicly that approximately 40 percent of the traffic is from out of state." Lucier said the percentage comes from a DOT study that tracked license plate numbers. He told us that 38.2 percent of the cars and trucks traveling southbound -- from Tiverton to Portsmouth -- had out-of-state plates and 31.4 percent going northbound. Average daily out-of-state volume was 35.1 percent, not 40. The traffic count was done on just two days in the middle of winter -- Jan. 26, a Thursday, and Jan. 28, a Saturday. And it was conducted only from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The afternoon rush hour was not included. Among the out-of-state vehicles, 90 percent had Massachusetts license plates, 2 percent were from Connecticut, and 1 percent were from New Hampshire, New York and New Jersey. The bridge currently has an 18-ton weight limit, which requires a lot of trucks to detour around it. Lucier said the expectation is that when the bridge is replaced, truck traffic will increase and that will increase the percentage of out-of-state vehicles using it. Our ruling Rep. John Edwards said, "They're saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over [the Sakonnet River Bridge is from] out of state." The DOT says Edwards is correctly quoting Michael Lewis, who has been saying "approximately 40 percent" and whose source is a two-day traffic study commissioned by the DOT that concludes that the actual percentage is 35. Clearly, when he was talking to Glover, Edwards was saying that the data wasn't his and he told us, after the fact, that he had doubts about its accuracy. It turns out, he may have reason for skepticism. We rate the statement made by Lewis and repeated by Edwards Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06833	"Illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/07/alison-littell-mchose/assemblywoman-mchose-says-illegal-immigration-cost/	New Jersey may be a small state, but it has big costs – especially for illegal immigration, according to Assemblywoman Alison Littell McHose. "Illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year," McHose claimed in a joint news release she issued on June 30 with fellow Republicans Sen. Steve Oroho and Assemblyman Gary Chiusano. Their districts cover Hunterdon, Morris and Sussex counties. "We must always be strengthening our laws concerning illegal immigration and finding ways to make New Jersey affordable for legal residents." The press release was about the lawmakers’ efforts to bring a program known as E-Verify to New Jersey. E-Verify certifies that people hired by companies can legally work in the United States. Oroho is the prime sponsor of New Jersey’s E-Verify legislation (S-2733) in the Senate. Chiusano and McHose are the prime sponsors of the Assembly version (A-189). Does New Jersey really spend more than $3 billion a year on illegal immigration costs? PolitiFact New Jersey checked the figures – provided by a group opposed to illegal immigration – and found that there is neither consensus on their accuracy, nor the methodology of how the group ascertained the costs. Louis Crescitelli, McHose’s chief of staff, said in an email that McHose used a figure provided by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The group, known as FAIR, opposes illegal immigration and wants existing immigration laws enforced. The group claims more than 250,000 members nationwide. McHose’s figure came from a July 2010 report by FAIR, "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers," which shows that illegal immigration costs (education, healthcare, insurance, social services, law enforcement and other expenses) total $3.47 billion in New Jersey. That’s nearly 10 percent of the state’s approximately $30 billion budget for fiscal year 2011-2012. We found that very few organizations dig into the costs of illegal immigration because it involves counting a population that often doesn’t want to be counted, and government agencies often don’t break out costs of providing services to legal residents versus undocumented ones. As a result, costs assigned to illegal immigration are often estimates based on assumptions -- and one reason why FAIR has been criticized in the past for its findings. FAIR’s report based its estimates on 13 million illegal immigrants in the country, broken down by state -- but there is no information in its report on how that breakdown was calculated. In looking at New Jersey, FAIR said it included 490,000 illegal immigrants and 96,000 of their American-born children, who are citizens by birth, in its data because those children would not be in the United States if their parents didn’t enter the country illegally. The report also assumes taxes are collected from 8 million illegal immigrant workers in the nation, half of whom are presumed to work in the "above-ground" economy, have two children and earn $31,200 annually. In New Jersey, FAIR said illegal immigrants cost $2.4 billion for education; $509 million for health care; $335 million for justice-related costs; and $193 million for welfare and other expenses. Jack Martin, a FAIR spokesman and an author of the report, said the figures are from part of 2008 and a larger part of 2009. Martin said it’s unlikely those figures have changed much in 2011. "The estimates of the illegal immigrant population are not just dreamt up," Martin said. "They are based on a methodology that looks at the change in size of the foreign-born population as measured by the U.S. census and shares that with data from Homeland Security. … It’s sort of a residual methodology of looking at the difference between those estimates, as well as people coming in from abroad for temporary work. The estimates are based on real numbers rather than plucked out of the air." At least one state has taken issue with FAIR’s methodology, challenging FAIR’s April 2005 report, "The Cost of Illegal Immigration to Texans." That report claimed Texans spent $4.5 billion on illegal immigration costs. The following year, the Texas State Comptroller’s Office released "Undocumented Immigrants In Texas: A Financial Analysis of the Impact to the State Budget and Economy," which found revenues generated by illegal immigrants -- $1.5 billion -- exceeded the $1.1 billion in costs. For fiscal year 2005, that amounted to $424 million in revenue for the Lone Star State. One significant difference in the methodology: FAIR included the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants in its calculations. The Texas Comptroller’s Office did not because the children are U.S. citizens. It’s worth noting that the New Jersey state Comptroller’s Office said it doesn’t track costs associated with illegal immigration. PolitiFact New Jersey contacted several think thanks in Washington, DC, seeking figures to verify FAIR’s numbers, but found none. "The problem with the undocumented population is they’re somewhat underground … there’s no way to say with any surety how much the undocumented population is costing one state," said Wendy Sefsaf, communications director for the pro-immigrant American Immigration Council, the parent organization of the Immigration Policy Council in Washington, DC. Experts with the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, the Pew Hispanic Center and a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, agree that there’s a net fiscal cost to governments for illegal immigration costs, but note there’s no accepted methodology to determine those expenses. Let’s review. McHose cites FAIR’s estimate that illegal immigrants cost New Jersey taxpayers more than $3 billion annually, but a number of experts say there’s really no accurate way to assess costs. The FAIR report also looks at estimated costs from parts of two different years -- not year over year, or a trend over several years. Still, experts agree that in most cases -- not including the Texas case we cited -- illegal immigration costs taxpayers more than what those immigrants pay into the economy. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07298	Says state lawmakers have voted to "spend virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times" since the fund’s creation.	true	/texas/statements/2011/may/20/rodney-ellis/rodney-ellis-says-lawmakers-have-voted-spend-virtu/	Appealing unsuccessfully to spend more money from the state’s so-called Rainy Day Fund, state Sen. Rodney Ellis hearkened to legislative history, saying in floor debate May 16: "Members, this legislature has voted to use virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times" since its creation in the late 1980s. "The sad truth is that Texans and the (fund) are being held hostage to politics." Back story: GOP Gov. Rick Perry has said he’s agreeable with taking about $3.1 billion from the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, to help cover the state budget that runs through August. But Perry and many Republicans oppose tapping the fund, which is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes, for the 2012-13 budget. Perry contends it needs to be protected in case of natural disasters. Democrats, noting the projected multi-billion-dollar shortfall in state revenue needed to maintain current programs, say the current dire circumstances justify taking more from the fund. And is Ellis correct about past legislatures voting four times to virtually empty the fund? Jeremy Warren, Ellis’s spokesman, said the senator relied on a report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for programs serving the poor. To help balance the 2012-13 budget, the center has urged lawmakers to use the fund, which is projected by State Comptroller Susan Combs to have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013, or about $6.6 billion if lawmakers stick with applying $3.1 billion from the fund to this year’s deficit . The center’s Feb. 21 report says: "In 1991, the Legislature spent the fund’s entire balance ($28.8 million) on public schools, and in 1993, spent the entire balance ($197 million) for criminal justice. "In 2003, to deal with the last economic downturn, the Legislature appropriated $1.3 billion from the Rainy Day Fund—almost every penny of the balance the (state) comptroller forecast through 2005," the report says. "Again in 2005, the Legislature appropriated $1.9 billion in Rainy Day funds, using roughly half for 2005 shortfalls, and the other half for 2006-07, spending almost all the $2 billion that was forecast to be available." Next, we confirmed the amounts of rainy-day money that lawmakers could have spent in each of these instances by reviewing biennial revenue forecasts made by respective state comptrollers. Finally, the Legislative Reference Library guided us to a Feb. 3 report by the House Research Organization, a non-partisan arm of the Texas House, specifying how much money the 1991, 1993, 2003 and 2005 Legislatures appropriated from the fund. Punch line: The center’s recap is accurate. We rate Ellis’s statement True.	None	Rodney Ellis	None	None	None	2011-05-20T06:00:00	2011-05-16	['None']
pomt-12454	"FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/may/10/sally-hernandez/sally-hernandez-says-cities-labeled-sanctuaries-ha/	Don’t force local police to double as immigration law enforcers, sheriffs including Sally Hernandez of Travis County unsuccessfully urged lawmakers in an April 2017 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman. Republican proponents tout Senate Bill 4, the measure signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on May 7, 2017, as once-and-for-all preventing local police and elected officials from shielding unauthorized immigrants from deportation. Violators could be fined or even removed from office. In opposition, Hernandez and four other sheriffs, fellow Democrats from Dallas, Harris, Bexar and El Paso counties, wrote that the proposal would "coerce" local law enforcement to divert scarce resources to enforcing federal immigration laws at a risk to public safety. As it is, the sheriffs went on, "FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides." Is that so? There's no such FBI report, we found, while PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., noted in a November 2016 fact check that a study published in August 2016 by researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found sanctuary policies did not affect crime rates either way. The study included analysis of violent crime, property crime and rape. Also, we’ve been fact-checking claims about so-called sanctuary cities for half a dozen years so we recognize that defining such a city can be slippery. In 2006, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service listed Houston and Austin among only 32 localities nationally that had sanctuary policies. Hernandez points to D.C. report To our inquiry, Kristen Dark, spokeswoman for the Travis County sheriff’s office, advised by email that the sheriffs drew their claim about less crime in sanctuary cities from a January 2017 report that considered more than 600 counties to be sanctuary locales. The report by the Washington-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy group, "The Effects of Sanctuary Policies on Crime and the Economy," states that crime in 2015 was significantly lower in 608 "sanctuary" counties than in counties where law officers were more compliant with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to detain locally-held suspects. Tom K. Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, wrote: "There are, on average, 35.5 fewer crimes committed per 10,000 people in sanctuary counties compared to non-sanctuary counties. Altogether, the data suggest that when local law enforcement focuses on keeping communities safe, rather than becoming entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts, communities are safer," the report says, plus there are other advantages such as stronger economies. "Large central metro sanctuary counties have 65.4 fewer crimes per 10,000 people than large central metro non-sanctuary counties," Wong wrote. "Noncore, rural sanctuary counties have 59.4 fewer crimes per 10,000 people than noncore, rural non-sanctuary counties." Counting 'sanctuary' counties The report doesn’t identify any counties. But to our inquiry, Wong provided his list of 608 "sanctuary" counties. Further, Wong said by email that he zeroed in on the counties based on information obtained from ICE by the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center; he forwarded what he described as an ICE spreadsheet with entries for 2,768 counties in 49 states plus other jurisdictions and said a column identifying individual counties as accepting or not accepting ICE detainer requests helped him single out the counties tallied as sanctuary counties. The spreadsheet shows the majority of the listed counties as going along with ICE detainer requests--including Travis County, a reminder the spreadsheet was put together before Hernandez, elected sheriff in 2016, implemented a policy in 2017 of not automatically granting ICE detainer requests, a move that spurred interest in SB 4 while leading Abbott to cut off millions of dollars in law enforcement grants to the county. It’s worth noting too that no federal law defines "sanctuary city." Different jurisdictions that use the term -- and even some that shy from it -- may have some policies in place that other cities don’t, and vice versa. But generally speaking, it means a community has policies limiting how much local law enforcement assists federal immigration authorities seeking to apprehend and deport people living in the country without authorization. The modern-day sanctuary concept stems from the 1980s when churches opened their doors to shelter Central Americans who fled violence in their countries and lived illegally in the United States, fearing deportation. Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, has estimated there are more than 500 counties and 38 cities with policies not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Yet when we asked Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors less immigration, to appraise Wong’s analysis, Vaughan said by email she’d classify a locale as a sanctuary only if it has a policy saying as much; a March 2017 CIS map pinpoints about 300 such places, including Travis County. Concentrated in west? Wong, answering our bid for more detail, emailed a chart showing he identified sanctuary counties in 29 states--with most such counties, we noticed, concentrated in a dozen states: South Dakota (62 counties); Colorado (56 counties); Minnesota (54 counties); California (53 counties); New York and North Dakota (50 counties each); Florida (43 counties); Washington (32 counties); Oregon (28 counties); New Mexico (26 counties); Iowa and Wyoming (23 counties each). Wong, we noticed, classified every Wyoming county as giving sanctuary. We wondered about that, spot-checking a couple by phone. Dick Blunt of the Sweetwater County sheriff’s office told us that county doesn’t hold anyone solely due to an ICE detainer request. In contrast, Michael Sorenson of the Laramie County sheriff’s department said that agency always accedes to ICE detainers. Sorenson, saying he’s been a department employee for 23 years, said: "I can’t ever remember us telling them no, we won’t accept their detainers." Crime rates Let’s turn next to crime rates. The report by Wong drew crime rates from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting system tallies for 2015. The report states: "Crime is defined here as the total number of violent crimes—murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults—and property crimes—burglaries, larceny, motor vehicle thefts, and arsons—per 10,000 people." We didn’t have the firepower/know-how to replicate Wong’s work. Still, we compared total 2015 crimes rates for a few counties considered sanctuary communities by Wong compared to counties not bestowed with that label--and got mixed results. In our sampling, an Oregon "sanctuary" county in the study had the lowest total crime rate for 2015, 93 per 10,000 residents. Yet next-lowest was an Arkansas likely "non-sanctuary county," which had a rate of 94 crimes per 10,000 residents. That pattern, a sanctuary county followed by a non-sanctuary county, mostly played out through the dozen counties we checked (see our work here). In the report, Wong said the statistical technique he applied, "coarsened exact matching," strengthened the cause-effect implication that sanctuary counties tend to have less crime. "CEM is a method for improving causal inferences that estimates the sample average treatment effect on the treated, or SATT," the report said. "In other words, CEM statistically matches sanctuary counties to comparable non-sanctuary counties; compares differences in outcomes between sanctuary counties and the matched non-sanctuary counties; allows us to evaluate these differences while controlling for differences in population, the foreign-born percentage of the population, and the percentage of the population that is Latino; and then uses the results of the analysis to estimate the effect that being a sanctuary county has on crime and the economy." Criminologists comment Experts on crime statistics who we queried told us Wong’s statistical work looked solid. They were less sold on reaching cause-effect conclusions. Tony Fabelo, an Austin-based researcher for the Council on State Governments, said by email: "You may assume that the theory behind the relationship between sanctuary cities and crime is that law enforcement practices are more effective in engaging the community, not alienating Latino, or immigrant communities, and, therefore, maybe this influences crime. "For example," Fabelo wrote, "if local law enforcement is not occupied by questioning and detaining suspected undocumented aliens, maybe their resources are better spent on usual crime fighting. Still," he said, "there are so many things not controlled here that can impact crime, that maybe the statement is a little stretched (sentencing practices, program resources to deal with drug treatment, mental health, security technologies in higher income places, and more importantly the number of police per capita in the community)." Bill King, a professor at Sam Houston State University, called Wong’s methodology rigorous. By phone, though, he said absolute causality is hard to nail. "The flip side is the takeaway: Being a sanctuary city does not make community residents unsafe--and that’s big," King said. King, Fabelo and Alfred Blumstein, a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, each said the study would have benefited by focusing on rates of specific crimes such as homicides and robberies. By email, Blumstein said the FBI’s total crime rates are overly influenced by the frequency of larceny. Separately, Fabelo said the total crime rate doesn’t capture many drug arrests and related crimes as well as lower-level crimes not tallied by the FBI. Fabelo said he’d be interested in tracking "what happens in cities that were sanctuary cities, that later were not, and see any improvement over time" in crime rates, which would control for unseen factors in the studied city, he suggested. Homicides Wong earlier pointed out that the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, with his help, made a run at analyzing just homicide rates before reporting in January 2017 that the typical sanctuary area saw one less homicide per 100,000 people in 2015 than the typical non-sanctuary area. "While the difference is small," the newspaper said, "Wong's statistical tests indicate it is highly significant." Wonkblog also said: "The data only shows correlation; Wong says more research needs to be done to determine whether a causal effect is at work here. But he said he suspects that, by becoming a sanctuary area and refusing to involve local authorities in deportation matters, a city or county may actually make itself safer. If immigrants who came to the United States illegally fear working with police will lead to deportation, they're less likely to report crimes and assist with investigations." We asked Wong if it could be happenstance that the identified sanctuary counties had lower overall crime rates than non-sanctuary counties. Happenstance, he emailed, is "too liberal a term in this case given the rigor of the analysis." Our ruling Hernandez said: "FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides." Any implication the FBI reached this conclusion is wrong; the agency has not aired such findings. Still, an outside analysis of 2015 FBI-collected crime statistics supports the idea that communities offering sanctuary to unauthorized residents have less total crime. Then again, that analysis didn't independently confirm the sanctuary status of each county nor did it fine-tune the crime statistics as much as criminologists would prefer before reaching cause-effect conclusions. On balance, we find the sheriff's statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-06076	Says the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal went from President Barack Obama's desk to "the garbage can."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-president-barack-obama-threw-def/	Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman suggested President Barack Obama damaged trust in the executive branch by ignoring a 2010 bipartisan proposal to chop the deficit. Huntsman, a Republican candidate for president, made the claim at an NBC-Facebook debate in Concord, N.H., on Jan. 8, 2012. "When the American people look at the political process play out, they hear all the spinning and all the doctrinaire language, and they still walk away with the belief that they're not being represented in Congress, that there's no trust in the executive branch," he said. "And the Simpson-Bowles bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of Barack Obama, and it lands in the garbage can." He was referring to a proposal that grew out of Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established in February 2010, and chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former Democratic White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles. In December 2010, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures. We wondered — did Obama discard the policy proposals suggested by the the deficit commission? We've checked similar claims before, and think there's better evidence they landed in a desk file than a round file. Claim: Obama failed 'to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a speech in September 2011 that Obama failed "to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission." Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey rated Christie's claim Mostly False. They found that the president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset but that Obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission. Even the commission’s co-chairs, Simpson and Bowles, said so. "We are encouraged that the president has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report," Bowles and Simpson said in an April 13, 2011, press release. Alice Rivlin, a member of the commission and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, told PolitiFact New Jersey she was disappointed that the president didn't endorse the commission's recommendations immediately but agreed that Obama later embraced some of its proposals. A former policy adviser to Clinton said Obama has "approached the report very carefully." "He's kept it at arms' length," Bill Galston, now a senior fellow at Brookings, told PolitiFact New Jersey. Obama is "not exactly rejecting it," Galston said, but "not exactly embracing it either." Claim: Obama 'took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas' In April 2011, John Boehner told ABC News that Obama, "took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one." PolitFact rated Boehner's claim False. PolitiFact looked at the commission’s final report, which was released in December 2010; the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which was released in February 2011; and a fact sheet released by the White House following Obama’s budget speech at George Washington University in April 2011. The commission’s report offered no shortage of recommendations for the White House to choose from -- more than 70, in fact. Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama had been included in the bipartisan commission’s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposals either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely. Here's an abbreviated version of what we found. (For more explanation, visit the original fact-check.) First are two recommendations by the commission that were included in the president’s budget proposal: • Allow the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to increase premiums. • Increase government authority and funding to reduce Medicare fraud. These two items by themselves show Boehner was wrong to say that none of the commission’s recommendations were included — and it was similarly inappropriate for Huntsman to declare the proposal went from Obama's desk in the garbage can. Next, we listed six of the commission’s recommendations that were included in the president’s budget with slight differences. • Eliminate "in-school subsidies" for the federal student loan program. • End the reliance on deficit spending to fund the transportation trust fund. • Freeze pay for federal workers and Defense Department civilians. • Overhaul the medical malpractice system. • Reform the corporate tax system. • Increase government efficiency. Finally, the White House "framework" on deficit reduction refers very generally to seven of the commission’s recommendations. In several of these examples, the White House proposal offers less detail than the commission’s. • Cut both security and non-security spending. • Implement structural tax reform. • Reform Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism. • Establish a long-term global budget for federal health care spending. • Eliminate state "gaming" of Medicaid. • Reduce agricultural subsidies. • Create a mechanism to enforce adherence to debt stabilization. We reached out to Huntsman's campaign for evidence for his claim but didn't hear back the day of the debate. Our ruling Huntsman used a metaphor to describe what happened to the deficit reduction proposal. "The Simpson-Bowles bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of Barack Obama, and it lands in the garbage can," he said. But our research shows that, while he didn't embrace the entire document, some of its ideas emerged in Obama's budget proposals released more than a month later. We rate Huntsman's claim False.

pomt-00320	Says Brett Kavanaugh’s mother presided over foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford’s parents, which fueled motivation for sexual assault accusation.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/20/blog-posting/kavanaughs-mother-dismissed-foreclosure-case/	A dismissed 1996 foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford’s parents has joined the heap of rumors swirling around Ford’s sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford, a California professor, went public with her accusations against Kavanaugh earlier this week, saying he sexually assaulted her at a party while the two were in high school in the early 1980s. "I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation," Kavanaugh said in a statement. "I did not do this back in high school or at any time." Blogs such as America First Media Group and The Gateway Pundit have speculated about her motives, highlighting the 1996 case involving Ford’s parents and Kavanaugh’s mother. "Christine Ford’s Parents Paula K Blasey and Ralph G Blasey were the Defendants in a foreclosure case in Maryland in 1996," The America First Media Group post said. "Guess who the Judge was America? None other than Brett Kavanaugh’s mother, Martha G Kavanaugh. You literally cannot make this up." The blog Pacific Pundit went even further. "Martha G. Kavanaugh, the mother of Brett Kavanaugh was a Maryland district judge in 1996. In an amazing coincidence, Martha Kavanaugh was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey-Ford’s parents were the defendants. Now it all becomes clear," the blog wrote. "Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh, not because of what he did in high school. Instead, Christine Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh out of spite and revenge for a case rulled (sic) on by Brett Kavanaugh mother. " This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the case information archived online, Brett Kavanaugh’s mother, Martha Kavanaugh, did preside over a foreclosure case in which Ford’s parents were defendants. However, according to the same documents, Martha Kavanaugh dismissed the case at the plaintiff’s request. The America First Media Group blog post includes screenshots of that same case information, which says the voluntary motion to dismiss the case was "granted with prejudice," meaning the plaintiff cannot sue over the same issue again. In addition to court records, CBS News found the same information when reporters went to the Montgomery County Court to look into the case. They found that the Blaseys settled with their mortgage lender, and the bank requested Martha Kavanaugh dismiss the case. She did. They found no evidence that the Blaseys appeared in her courtroom. The Gateway Pundit has since updated its story to include a tweet from a CBS reporter. The Gateway Pundit article now says, "The case was settled amicably and the Blaseys kept their house." In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers said she had "been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats." They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford’s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online. Our ruling Bloggers speculated that the reason Christine Blasey Ford went public with sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was because Kavanaugh’s mother presided over a foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford’s parents. This line of thinking has been debunked by the Washington Examiner, the New York Times, Snopes and now, PolitiFact. The facts don’t support the accusation. Kavanaugh’s mother simply executed a settlement made by the plaintiff — a mortgage lender — and Ford’s family. Put simply, Kavanaugh’s mother had no effect on the outcome of the case. A dismissed foreclosure case involving Ford’s parents is an incredibly unlikely basis for a revenge-motivated sexual assault accusation 22 years later. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04387	Says Connie Mack "is protecting Chevron oil from a multi-billion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rainforests."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/18/bill-nelson/nelson-connie-mack-protecting-chevron-big-ecuador-/	Allegations of political paybacks as filthy as an oil-polluted rainforest are at play in Florida’s U.S. Senate race. "Out-of-state billionaires and special interests have spent over $20 million to buy Connie Mack IV a Senate seat. Is it any wonder?" says a TV ad from Mack’s incumbent rival, Sen. Bill Nelson. "In Congress, Mack is protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests." Nelson repeated the charge during the first and only debate between the candidates on Oct. 17, 2012. Mack, he said, "has filed a resolution to void a court judgment for $18 million for the Chevron Corp., which by the way is one of his largest contributors." The Chevron claim gave us pause. It’s been two years since BP’s well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. Is Mack really protecting an oil company accused of polluting a rain forest? There’s a lot more to this story than Nelson lets on -- about five decades’ worth. Oil in the Jungle The origins of the ordeal are rooted in the 1960s, when Texaco launched oil drilling operations in undeveloped land in northeast Ecuador. Texaco worked in partnership with Ecuador’s national petroleum company, Petroecuador, with Texaco drilling the wells and digging pits for sludge-like oil runoff. Texaco wrapped up its operations in the early 1990s. It paid the government $40 million to clean up about 40 percent of the oil pits, and the government granted Texaco a release from future litigation. Meanwhile, a group of indigenous Ecuadorians -- calling themselves afectados, or "the affected ones" -- sued Texaco for rampant environmental neglect, blaming incidents of cancer, miscarriages and other health problems on oil pollution from the company's operations. A team of New York trial lawyers led a class-action suit originally filed in 1993 in U.S. court, but the case moved to Ecuador at Chevron’s urging. We have studied the complicated case and included links to detailed reports about it. Ultimately, Ecuadorian judges have ordered Chevron -- which bought Texaco in 2001 and inherited the suit -- to pay a whopping $19 billion award. Chevron has not paid the tab and says it doesn’t intend to, arguing the company did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway, because of the mid ’90s agreement Texaco reached with Ecuador about future litigation. Neither side is willing to bend, spawning international arbitration and dozens of court filings in Ecuador, the United States and even Canada and Brazil. Chevron is pursuing an extortion and racketeering case against the plaintiff’s lead attorney. Mack’s involvement So where does Connie Mack, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, fit in with this mammoth environmental case? In September 2012, Mack earned an eyebrow-raising headline from the Tampa Tribune: "Mack pushes legislation that aids political backers." The Tribune story connected a resolution Mack introduced about revoking Ecuador’s trade privileges with Chevron’s hefty political donations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has made attacking Nelson over the airwaves one of its biggest priorities this year. (Corporations cannot donate directly to candidates, and we did not find that any employees of Chevron donated money to Mack this campaign cycle.) Mack’s resolution lists the Chevron case as one of many reasons the U.S. should not renew a trade agreement with Ecuador next year. Other reasons include press censorship and intimidation, a politicized judicial system, a growing relationship with Iran, an uptick in Ecuadorians seeking asylum in the U.S., and a problem as a transit hub for illegal narcotics. Mack had harsh words for President Rafael Correa. "Preferences from the United States, including trade benefits, should not be utilized to bolster anti-democratic leaders," Mack said in a news release. "I hope that Congress recognizes the truth about Rafael Correa and declines the renewal of the U.S. trade preference program until democratic standards of freedom and security are restored in Ecuador." The exact wording of the Chevron segment: Whereas Ecuador has not complied with the interim award issued by an international arbitration tribunal convened under Article 6 of the United States-Ecuador BIT, which enjoins Ecuador `whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within or without Ecuador' of the $18,200,000,000 judgment by Ecuadoran courts against the Chevron Corporation. Mack’s resolution, co-sponsored by 31 House members, has not been heard in committee. Even if it were to pass, it would merely state the "disinclination" of Mack and the co-sponsors to renew the U.S.’s trade agreement with Ecuador; it would not by itself strip away Ecuador’s trade privileges. Nelson’s campaign threw us a slew of press clips about the Chevron case, including the Tribune story and a 2009 POLITICO story about Chevron’s lobbying efforts of Congress and the office of U.S. Trade Representative to strip Ecuador’s trade preferences. "The plaintiffs contend that Chevron botched the cleanup, but if the court were to recognize the agreement, it could essentially end the suit," POLITICO reported. Four Senate Democrats, not including Nelson, wrote the trade representative in 2009 and urged him not to intervene in the case. Then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2006 asked the previous trade representative not to use trade agreements as leverage. Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said the company did not ask Mack to include the language and does not see how it would protect Chevron. He said the case "boils down to the issue of contracts" between two private parties. "I don’t think it’s accurate to make the connection that’s being made right now," he said. We asked the Mack campaign why he listed Chevron as a reason for no longer supporting the trade agreement, and if he was trying to shield Chevron. A spokesman did not address those questions, writing instead that Mack "feels strongly about protecting the freedom, security and prosperity of the U.S. at home and abroad." "Ecuador currently benefits from one-way trade preferences from the U.S. as part of a program that incentivizes Ecuador to work productively with the United States," Mack spokesman David James wrote in an email. "Under Ecuador’s current President, Rafael Correa, that cooperation has dropped off. This is a timely matter given that these trade preferences expire next year and are currently under review." Is Mack protecting Chevron? It’s clear Mack’s resolution is meant to protect Chevron’s interests, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. "His new bill would inject Congress to try to strip Ecuador of its trade rights with the U.S. if the country doesn't void the judgment," McLaughlin said. We found a couple of experts who agree, including Judith Kimerling, a City University of New York-Queens College environmental policy professor who authored the 1991 book Amazon Crude, which is widely credited with inspiring the lawsuit. She represents a group of Huaorani people from Ecuador in a lawsuit against the Amazon Defense Front and plaintiff’s lawyers over how the award would be distributed. Asking lawmakers to withhold trade practices is part of a multipronged approach to avoid the judgment, she said, adding she can’t know for sure why Mack would include the Chevron in his resolution. "Mack’s resolution in and of itself will not achieve that purpose, but it's part of a strategy to pressure Ecuador to intervene on the case on its side," she said. "They probably would have preferred for Mack to have sponsored a law that would do more." Other experts empathized with Chevron’s argument that it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador, and that it overlooks that Petroecuador has been in control of drilling operations for the past 20 years. "A lot of us familiar with Latin America don’t lend any credence to this award," said Ed Glab, director of the Global Energy Security Forum at Florida International University and a former longtime employee of Exxon. "Ecuador is not a place where you can put your faith in the law." It would not be unusual for Chevron to request a business-friendly lawmaker to support its cause, he said, but that doesn’t mean Mack’s effort will do anything. "I don’t know that the U.S. government can or would be willing to step in," Glab said. "I don’t know if (Mack) has the power to ‘protect’ Chevron." As Mack’s spokesman pointed out, the resolution contains a timeliness factor. The trade preferences program that Ecuador currently enjoys is an updated version of a Reagan-era policy the U.S. established with four Andean nations to "adopt business-friendly intellectual property, investor, tax and other policies that U.S. companies favored and draw countries away from left-wing influences," said Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. Every few years, Congress must reauthorize the law that designates the trade preferences, the qualification conditions and which countries are eligible for special duty-free access to the U.S. market. The next deadline for Congress is July 31, 2013. Mack could have chosen a couple dozen other investor claims against Ecuador to include in his resolution, she said, but it’s telling that he singled out the Chevron case. "He’s shilling for Chevron but has not yet delivered on actually cutting off Ecuador’s trade preferences," she said. Our ruling Nelson’s TV ad hits Mack for "protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests." Mack’s act of protection is a yet-to-be-heard congressional resolution listing the Chevron case as one of many reasons to withhold trade preferences with Ecuador. Resolutions are symbolic gestures, so it would take a law for Congress to take real action on Ecuadorian trade practices. The Chevron case is also particularly complicated. Chevron says it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway. Still, the resolution seems designed to exert political pressure on the country in Chevron’s favor.

pomt-05403	"The United States already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/04/scott-desjarlais/freshman-congressman-scott-desjarlais-says-us-has-/	Taxes are always good fodder for politicians, especially in an election year. This year is no exception. U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Jasper, recently took President Barack Obama to task for invoking Ronald Reagan as part of his effort to persuade Congress to pass the so-called Buffett Rule, which would force the wealthiest Americans to pay a higher percentage of their income in federal taxes than middle-class families. DesJarlais took issue with Obama’s claim that Reagan would have supported the Buffett Rule. But it was another part of DesJarlais’ statement that caught our attention. "The United States already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world," the freshman congressman wrote in a blog post on his website on April 24, 2012. We asked DesJarlais’ office to back up the claim. His spokesman, Robert Jameson, emailed us articles from CNN and the Heritage Foundation, both of which reported that the United States has achieved the dubious distinction of having the world’s highest corporate tax rate. DesJarlais is not the first member of Congress to claim that the U.S. corporate tax rate is the world’s highest. Over the past year, our PolitiFact colleagues have looked into similar -- in some cases, identical -- claims made by President Barack Obama; U.S. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. Some of their findings are also pertinent to the DesJarlais claim and are repeated here. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the "combined corporate income tax rate" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services. For 2010, the United States ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point – 39.54 percent for Japan, 39.21 percent for the U.S. But PolitiFact noted at the time that Japan had recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations. Japan’s reduced rate of 36.8 percent took effect on April 1, 2012. The U.S. rate stands at 39.2 percent, the world’s highest, when both federal and state rates are included. But a little context is in order. The OECD rate is the "statutory rate" – in other words, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting these factors produces a statistic called the "effective tax rate." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service looked into whether U.S. corporate taxes are the world’s highest and concluded that the answer depends, in part, on which taxes are being compared. In a report released on March 31, 2011, the agency said that while the statutory tax rate is higher, the average effective tax rate is about the same as other countries, and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher. The effective rate is determined by the ratio of taxes paid divided by profits. It captures the tax benefits that reduce the taxable income base relative to financial profits. The marginal rate is calculated from a projected investment project: it estimates the share of the pre-tax return that is paid on taxes. Another issue that affects comparisons between U.S. and worldwide tax rates is whether tax rates are simple averages or whether they are weighted in some fashion to indicate their relative importance, the CRS study said. "If tax rates are not weighted, then a small economy, such as Iceland, can have the same effect on the average of international rates as a large economy, such as Germany or Japan," the study said. "In general, smaller countries tend to have lower tax rates and thus unweighted averages are lower than weighted averages in most cases." The study looked at corporate tax rates for the United States and the rest of the OECD. When weighted, the U.S. statutory rate was higher, 39.2 percent compared to 29.6 percent for other nations. But the effective rate was a little lower – 27.1 percent in the United States, 27.7 percent elsewhere. The marginal rate in the U.S. was slightly higher -- 23.6 percent, compared to 21.2 percent elsewhere. When the U.S. was compared to the other 14 largest countries, the weighted effective rate was basically the same – 27.1 percent in the United States, 27.2 percent elsewhere. Our ruling There are different ways to compare worldwide tax rates. DesJarlais is right that the United States has the world’s highest corporate tax rate, at least among industrial countries, if one is referring to the statutory rate.

pomt-03011	Says "we are going to sell this house and use the proceeds to stabilize rates."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/15/nick-fish/could-selling-portland-water-house-help-stabilize-/	For many people, the dream of inheriting a nice house remains as elusive as that rich relative they wish they had. By contrast, the house Portland Commissioner Nick Fish inherited from former Commissioner Randy Leonard -- the much-maligned Water House -- has proved more nightmare than dream. The Northeast Portland demonstration project, completed in 2011 during Leonard’s tenure as the commissioner who oversaw the Portland Water Bureau, was supposed to be a marvel of innovation and money-saving technology. "Water-friendly" features include a rain garden and eco-lawn, and floors made of wood reclaimed from a school gym. However, the tinge of green most associated with the Water House isn’t the environmental angle, but the money it burned. Originally budgeted at $310,900, the project’s total costs with design, construction management and inspection staff time ballooned to nearly $950,000, according to Fish’s own tally. In August, two months after Mayor Charlie Hales assigned Fish to oversee the Water Bureau, Fish directed the bureau to sell the house. The $475,000 asking price, Fish said, would at least cover the Water House’s "hard costs" of $456,287. (The asking price has since been reduced to $439,000.) Then, in an article posted on the bureau’s website, he added this: "We are going to sell this house and use the proceeds to stabilize rates." PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether that amount could help stabilize water rates that have, for a variety of reasons, climbed steadily in recent years. To find out, we contacted Fish’s office and quickly received an email from the commissioner. Fish noted that it takes about a $1.3 million reduction in the bureau’s $480 million operating budget to get a 1 percent rate reduction for residential customers. So even if the bureau manages to find a buyer willing to plunk down the asking price, water rates would drop only by about one-third of 1 percent. Currently, the average single-family residential bill for water service in Portland is $27.61 a month, according to rates contained in the current budget. (Note, residential sewage rates, included in the same bills, are typically more than twice that. Most residents also pay quarterly, though we’re using monthly costs for simplicity.) So the typical family would see a savings of about 9 cents a month from the Water House’s sale. Further, Fish said, all proceeds from the sale will go into the bureau’s Rate Stabilization Account, a fund started in 2006 to smooth the effect of rate increases. Combined water and sewer rates have been driven higher in recent years by big-ticket projects, such as the $1.4 billion Big Pipe to keep sewer overflows from reaching the Willamette River, and work to comply with federal mandates to cover or replace the city’s open drinking-water reservoirs. PolitiFact Oregon, appreciating that every 9 cents counts, dug a little deeper by calling Cecelia Huynh, the Water Bureau’s finance director. Asked how much the Water House’s sale would help ratepayers, she said, "Every dollar helps, but as far as a percentage, it’s not going to register. It is a one-time source of revenue." Portland’s water rates, like those in cities across the region, have increased steadily in recent years. Unresolved questions of whether Bull Run water needs to be treated and how much it will cost to replace reservoirs could mean more increases in years to come. The Water Bureau’s Rate Stabilization Account is intended to smooth out short-term rate spikes. Managers this year used about $5.8 million of the fund’s $20.6 million to stabilize monthly water bills that otherwise would have increased more than the 3.6 percent jump that took effect July 1, Huyhn said. PolitiFact appreciates Fish’s making the best of the political haunted house he inherited from Leonard, but any effect the sale of the Water House will have on water rates is going to be a tiny drop in a very large bucket. Further, the fact that those proceeds will represent a one-time-only infusion blunts any effect even more. Money from the Water House’s sale will have no ability to stabilize water rates. We find his statement False.	None	Nick Fish	None	None	None	2013-10-15T15:25:50	2013-08-13	['None']
pomt-03546	Says the inspector general for the IRS said there was "no political motivation" and "no outside influence" for targeting of tax-exempt applications from tea party groups	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/24/sander-levin/sander-levin-says-irss-inspector-general-said-ther/	Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree: The IRS screwed up, big time, when it watched for phrases like "tea party" to trigger extra scrutiny of groups seeking tax-exempt status. But there’s a partisan disagreement over whether it was merely an ill-conceived time-saver for overworked Ohio staffers or a sinister White House plot to hamstring conservative groups before an election. ("It's the IRS targeting-gate!" said New York Republican Tom Reed.) Rep. Sander Levin, a long-serving Democrat who’s the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, said after a May 17 hearing that evidence is on Democrats’ side. "My view is that the criteria were very inappropriate," he told MSNBC host Chris Matthews. "There was terrible mismanagement. I think there was very terrible oversight. ... "But the IG, the inspector general, when asked, Was there any political motivation for the people who were in the exempt organization in Cincinnati, the lower-level people who were working on this, he said no. Was there any outside influence? And he said no." The inspector general for tax administration is charged with independent oversight of the IRS. Did he say there was no "political motivation" or "outside influence" driving the agency’s inappropriate behavior? ‘Inappropriate criteria’ The latest round of congressional hearings — and there will be more — kicked off after the May 14 release of a mildly titled audit from the inspector’s office: "Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review." It asked whether the IRS: • Targeted groups applying for tax-exempt status. • Delayed processing of targeted groups’ applications. • Requested unnecessary information from targeted groups, such as donor lists. It found that Cincinnati employees did all of those things, beginning in early 2010. A "determinations unit" there reviews applications for tax-exempt status for various kinds of organizations — such as charities and nonprofit schools and hospitals. It ran into trouble with applications for 501(c)(4) status — a designation that allows a tax-exempt group whose primary activity is social welfare to engage in political activity without disclosing its donors. In theory, a group whose primary activity was actually political activity — such as supporting candidates for office —wouldn’t qualify. So IRS employees developed criteria to identify and group applications from organizations likely to engage in political activity for a deeper look. But regulations don’t define how to measure a group’s "primary" activity. So, according to the report, amid confusion, three "inappropriate" things happened. • For months, employees used phrases such as "tea party," "patriots," "9/12" and political-sounding names such as "we the people, or "take back the country" to group applications for special review. The criteria got more generic in 2011, then more specific again in mid 2012, including "political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the constitution and bill of rights, social economic reform/movement." • Most of those applications languished for more than a year as employees sorted out how to handle them. • Then it sent lengthy, probing questionnaires to many applicants, requesting detailed responses, such as lists of all donations and donors, whether any leaders or donors had run for office or would in the future, and lists of all issues important to the organization and its position on those issues. The basic result was that while none of those groups had their applications denied, more than half of them waited more than 200 days — and some as long as three years, across two election cycles. Some are still awaiting decisions. Auditors asked various IRS leaders and employees in Cincinnati and Washington whether anyone outside the IRS influenced the "inappropriate" criteria. They found the opposite: that one problem was insufficient high-level oversight. "Specifically, only first-line management approved references to the tea party," the report said. However, interviews with employees in the Cincinnati office didn’t turn up exactly who had been involved in creating the criteria, the report said. Inspector general Since the audit, lawmakers have repeatedly brought in the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, J. Russell George, to testify about the findings of his auditors. Levin’s staff pointed us to this exchange before Ways and Means, when the congressman asked George to clarify the audit’s results on outside influence and political motivation: Levin: On page 7, Mr. George, of the IG report it states and "all of these individuals stated that the criteria were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS." Is that correct? George: That is the information we received, correct. Levin: Did you find any evidence of political motivation in the selection of the tax exemption applications? George: We did not, sir. It’s important to note that George is careful to say that information gathered during the audit didn’t point to outside influence or political motivation — not that he was certain it had been ruled out. He was similarly careful in his responses that day to Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and later, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis.: McDermott: The inspector general report says that no one acted out of malice or political motivation. Mr. George, I want to know, do you still stand by that? George: We have no evidence at this time to contradict that assertion, sir. ... Kind: "According to your report, you found no bias or partisanship behind the development and the use of the criteria for selecting applications in the Cincinnati office. Is that right? George: That is correct, sir, but we did find gross mismanagement in the overall — Kind: Right. And that's clear in your report, too. Did you find any evidence that anyone outside of the IRS was involved in the development and review of — George: Not at this time, sir. Kind: Not the White House or Treasury? George: That's correct, sir. Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., pointed out that day that George’s office had conducted an audit, but not yet an investigation. "There's a reason you don't know who came up with this. You didn't investigate that," he said. Indeed, George clarified for lawmakers in the days after Levin’s MSNBC interview that auditors didn’t ask directly about White House involvement, because no evidence pointed that direction. He also distinguished between an audit — designed to uncover systemic problems — and an investigation, which focuses on misconduct by specific people. "It is not uncommon for audits to present specific issues that lead to additional reviews or investigations," he said. Our ruling Levin told Matthews on MSNBC that, "the inspector general, when asked, Was there any political motivation for the people who were in the exempt organization in Cincinnati, the lower-level people who were working on this, he said no. Was there any outside influence? And he said no." That was the gist of George’s testimony the same day before the Ways and Means Committee, but with the important clarification that he was careful to explain that the assessment was based solely on evidence turned up so far by auditors. Levin offered no such caveat. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Sander Levin	None	None	None	2013-05-24T17:17:59	2013-05-17	['None']
pomt-09148	California's credit rating is "the worst in the country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/11/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-californias-not-golden-state-when/	Compared to the drama in the California gubernatorial Republican primary, Jerry Brown's campaign for governor can seem a little low-key. Still, Brown is the Democratic challenger, so PolitiFact decided to check out his website. In his welcome video, the former governor and current attorney general of California outlined the problems he sees plaguing the state. "It's no secret that Sacramento isn't working today. The partisanship is poisonous. Political posturing has replaced leadership. And the budget: It's always late, it's always in the red, and it's always wrong. Today the political breakdown in Sacramento is threatening jobs, our schools, and the state's credit rating, which is the worst in the country. Our state is in serious trouble, and the next governor must have the preparation, and the knowledge, and the know-how to get California working again." We were curious about his claim about credit ratings. Are they really the lowest of all the states? Just as individuals borrow money to buy a car or a house, states like California borrow money to fund their budget and projects. One way that they do this is by issuing General Obligation bonds. And just as a bank tries to determine the likelihood that an individual will pay back a loan, plus interest, on time, credit rating agencies try to determine if states will pay back the money they borrow, plus interest, on time. "The rating on a bond answers a very simple question with an often complicated answer: how likely is this issuer (California) to not make good on its debt," said Satya Thallam, associate director of economic education at the George Mason University's Mercatus Center. In the spectrum of bonds, G.O. bonds tend to be the lowest risk because they are not tied to any specific revenue stream, but are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the issuer, he said. That means California promises to use all tools at its disposal, including tax increases, to pay the loan on time. The three biggest U.S. credit rating agencies -- Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch -- have all given California's G.O. bonds the lowest ratings of any state. • Standard and Poor's: Gave California an A- rating with a negative outlook Their rating starts at AAA, then AA, A, then BBB and so forth down to D. • Fitch: Recently gave California an A- with a stable outlook. • Moody's: At the time Brown made the claim, California was alone in the cellar of Moody's ratings among states. But the agency recently downgraded Illinois to the same level. Moody's uses a slightly different rating system. Its highest rating is Aaa, then Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, A2, A3, Baa1 and so forth down to C. California and Illinois are rated A1. But none of these ratings are quite as bad as they sound. Gabriel Petek, the primary author of S&P's report on the California GO Bond rating, said that the "A-" rating is still strong in the "grand scheme of the rating universe. But relatively speaking, the risks seems incrementally greater to us" compared to other states. Still, why are California's bonds riskier than those of other states? Two of the biggest problems are institutional constraints and partisan politicking. In California, the legislature requires a two-thirds majority to pass a budget and to raise taxes. That makes passing a budget, let alone a balanced one, very difficult, because the minority party, which has more than one-third of the votes, has a great deal of leverage. Furthermore, the state constitution requires that the legislature spend at least 40 percent of the budget on education, which further decreases legislative flexibility. As a result, it is not uncommon for the budget to be passed late, leaving the state short of cash. In 2009, California started issuing IOUs to "non priority payees" such as tax refund recipients, in order to be able to continue reimbursing for G.O. bonds. Petek said that those IOUs were good and bad: "The ability of the controller to issue IOUs when cash is or is expected to become unacceptably low both protects the state's credit quality, and at the same time illustrates that the state's budget and cash problems have reached a fairly serious point." California is also feeling the bite of the recession more than many other states because it derives 50 percent of its revenue from income taxes, much of it from capital gains taxes. So when the stock market took a sharp dip, so did California's revenue. Brown was right about California having the lowest credit rating. Illinois' recent descent to California's level in Moody's ratings happened after Brown's post, so we are not counting that in our assessment. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-09787	"In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-claims-domestic-violence-counts-pre/	In his effort to pass a health care overhaul, President Barack Obama has enlisted help from a close ally — his wife, Michelle. On Sept. 18, 2009, the first lady gave a speech about the importance of health care reform to women, and cited several reasons she thinks the current system is gender-biased. This line caught our attention: "Women are affected because, as we heard, in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender," she said. "And this is still shocking to me. These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night. ... In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence." Health reform bills under consideration by Congress would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-exisiting conditions, an issue we've already explored ; we've also examined how pregnancy can sometimes be a basis to deny coverage, and how pre-exisiting conditions already lead to health care rationing by private health insurers. But we'd never heard domestic abuse could count as a pre-existing condition, so we decided to look into the claim. The issue first came to light in 1994, when a Pennsylvania woman was denied health, life and mortgage disability insurance because of domestic violence, according to the Women's Law Project. That group, along with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, began advocating for legislation to expressly prohibit the practice. Since then, most states, including Pennsylvania, have adopted laws prohibiting the practice. But, as Mrs. Obama said in her speech, denying coverage due to a history of domestic abuse is still legal in some states. Those states are Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, according to the National Women's Law Center. The claim has become a popular talking point for groups supporting health care reform such as the Service Employees International Union. (It's been discussed so much recently that Arkansas, which had no prohibition, this year passed a law prohibiting discrimination against domestic violence victims.) A Huffington Post story about the laws last week prompted several states and insurance companies to say that the laws have been changed or that the companies don't treat domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. The North Carolina situation is a matter of some disagreement. Although the Women's Law Center says the practice is still allowed, state officials say they interpret the laws to mean it is not. Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told the Jackson Free Press that he wanted to explore whether insurance companies were taking advantage of the law: "I've got to get some of my lawyers to do some research on this, but we have only six mandated (conditions that must be covered) in our state statues, and we have 25 or more optional coverages, but domestic abuse doesn't seem to be one of them. ... The whole situation is bad. Let's say a woman works with a company that had Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and she gets beat up in her house and Blue Cross says 'we're not covering you because getting beat up is your pre-existing condition.' That's terrible." Meanwhile, Wyoming Department of Insurance staff attorney James Mitchell told the Huffington Post that state law does not expressly prohibit insurers from using domestic abuse as grounds to deny coverage, though he'd found no cases of the practice in his state. Mitchell's response raises an important point: Just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean that insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Back in the 1990s there was evidence that the practice was widespread. In 1994, a House Judiciary Committee panel conducted an informal survey and found that eight of the 16 largest insurers in the country used domestic violence as a factor in deciding coverage. And a year later, the Insurance Commission of Pennsylvania reported that a formal survey showed that 24 percent of accident, health and life insurers took domestic violence into account when deciding whether to issue and renew insurance policies. But that data is more than 10 years old, so we asked Lisa Codispoti, senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center, if insurance companies are still denying health care coverage based on domestic violence history. Examples are hard to come by, she said, because people who get coverage through an employer don't usually face exclusions about pre-existing condititions. Only people who apply for individual coverage would, she said. "It's such a small number of people who apply for individual insurance," she said. "And it's not like insurance companies have to tell you why you're being denied coverage." Indeed, underwriting standards are private, said Nancy Durborow, health projects coordinator for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, making it difficult for groups such as hers to find out how widespread the practice still is. "This is very secretive stuff," she said. A spokesman for the association representing insurance companies told us he's not aware of any insurers that deny women coverage based on history of domestic abuse. And the group supports a proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that would fully prohibit the practice. "No one should be denied coverage because they are victims of domestic abuse," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. We find that the first lady is correct that "in some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence." Putting aside the disputed North Carolina law, there still are several other states — including Mississippi and Wyoming — that have no specific laws prohibiting the practice. It's important to note that we couldn't find this was happening on a widespread basis — or even just a little bit. But still, Mrs. Obama is correct and we rate the claim True.

pomt-05102	"Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-means-20-million-americ/	Following the Supreme Court’s decision upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, Mitt Romney claimed in a speech that "Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep." When we checked with the Romney campaign, a spokesman confirmed that the source of Romney’s claim was a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. In March 2012, we checked a similar statement by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. While PolitiFact does not put predictions to the Truth-O-Meter, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others. So that’s what we’ll do here. Cherry-picking the CBO report The CBO study was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO came up with a "baseline" estimate -- its best guess. CBO settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies means a decline of an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s quite a bit lower than 20 million. So where did 20 million come from? CBO supplemented its "baseline" estimate with four alternative, and wildly divergent, estimates. One resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million. A number of other estimates by groups other than CBO have tracked with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Romney’s figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. So the 20 million number Romney cited does come from CBO, and he hedged by saying "up to." But it’s the most extreme outcome of the five presented, and it’s not the primary estimate. Some who "lose" coverage will do so because they find better options Even beyond the cherry-picking, Romney is wrong to say that 20 million Americans will lose the insurance "that they like and they want to keep." According to CBO’s "baseline" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. For these people, it’s a stretch to say they will "lose" coverage that they "like," since they are leaving of their own volition for something that suits them better. Romney also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get employer coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. Even people who lose employer insurance involuntarily won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law. Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will have a fallback option on the exchanges that offers guaranteed, subsidized coverage. It’s also important to remember the big picture. CBO projects that, overall, the number of uninsured Americans will drop by 29 million to 31 million due to the law. Romney acts as if no one ever loses coverage today As we have previously noted, many Americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law, though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. But you don’t have to change jobs to see your plan change. Your employer may change insurance carriers, or the insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company. It’s also common for employers and their insurance carriers to unilaterally change their plans. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third. All told, this churn -- which, to reiterate, is happening because of forces beyond the Obama health care law -- almost certainly dwarfs the scale of the changes Romney is talking about. Even Romney’s cherry-picked number of 20 million amounts to 7 percent of the 270 million non-elderly people in the U.S. CBO’s preferred figure represents an even smaller share -- 1 percent to 2 percent. But the rate of plan-changing is almost certainly much higher if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that either change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out. Why does this matter? Because knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans -- even if they like them -- would provide a different impression of the statistics that Romney cites. Our ruling Romney said that "Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep." That number is cherry-picked, and he’s wrong to describe it as only including people who "like" their coverage, since many of those 20 million will be leaving employer coverage voluntarily for better options. Romney also ignores that under the status quo, many more people today "lose" coverage than even the highest, cherry-picked CBO estimate. We rate his statement False.

pomt-03563	There are about 120,000 solar energy jobs in the United States, but only 1,700 of them are in Georgia.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/22/tim-echols/commissioner-makes-case-twitter-more-solar-project/	Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols recently took a different approach to hear from Georgians -- a Twitter town hall meeting. Some of our most interesting fact-checking claims have come from the social media site that has an estimated 200 million users, so we were curious to see what Echols had to say. One statement involving job growth in a particular sector of Georgia’s economy caught our attention. "Nationwide, approximately 120K #solarjobs (more than coal miners), but in #GA we have about 1,700 solar jobs," he wrote. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether Echols was right. Or was there some information that clouded his claim? The Public Service Commission oversees Georgia’s energy industry, among others. In recent years, the voices of those who believe solar energy should be more aggressively explored has grown and become more vocal in Georgia. Count Echols among those voices. "Solar is a peaking resource," Echols wrote in one recent Twitter post. Echols included a Web link in his tweet about the number of people employed in the solar industry. The link came from the Solar Foundation, which does research to educate and spread the gospel of solar energy. In November, the foundation released its third annual National Solar Jobs Census. The report was put together by the foundation, Cornell University and BW Research, a public opinion research firm that focuses on workforce development. The report says there are nearly 120,000 Americans directly employed by the solar industry. In Georgia, however, the tally was 800 jobs, less than half of what Echols said on Twitter. Echols told us via email that he made a mistake, and he posted a correction on his Twitter page the same day we contacted him. "CORRECTION from town hall," he wrote. "Typo on #solarjobs in #ga - not 1,700, actually 800! room to grow!" We reached out to a few other sources on this issue to see whether anyone else had verifiable data on solar energy jobs in Georgia. Georgia’s Labor Department does not have a specific jobs count because employment is confidential in the solar electric power generation industry, a spokeswoman told us. James Marlow, the founder and chief executive officer of Radiance Solar, a solar installation company in Atlanta, said the estimate of 1,700 jobs for Georgia may still be correct. "My estimate is that there are 135 to 150 solar companies or firms doing focused work in solar in Georgia," said Marlow, whose company has 12 full-time employees and 10 contractors. He said Georgia Power is adding workers to its solar workforce. He also mentioned some companies that specialize in solar energy and pointed out that there are accountants, attorneys and training companies. Combined, Marlow said, they "make up a significant worker base." Shan Arora, project manager at Southface, an Atlanta-based nonprofit company that promotes ways to make homes and businesses more energy-efficient, said it is difficult to accurately track how many people are employed in the solar industry in Georgia. Arora is working on a Georgia clean energy industries census that would include that statistic. It’s hard to track down some businesses and gather jobs data, he said. Southface has 150 solar industry companies mapped on its website. Its list includes some electricians, plumbers and builders that were not compiled by the foundation, he said. The foundation has some solar companies on its list that Arora said he was initially unaware of. He hopes to have the census ready by early 2014. "The solar industry is bigger than I thought it was," Arora said. "To pinpoint how many jobs there are is very difficult." Our conclusion: Echols wrote that there are about 120,000 solar energy jobs in the United States and 1,700 of them are in Georgia. The website he cited to come up with the Georgia number actually said the total was 800 jobs. Echols wrote a correction on Twitter after we noticed the discrepancy. Such estimates are hard. Since he apparently got the first part correct, but erred about Georgia, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-14824	"We now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money," for California's high-speed rail project.	mostly false	/california/statements/2015/nov/23/jim-patterson/private-sector-unwilling-fund-californias-bullet-t/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Plans for California’s high-speed rail network hinge on the private sector paying for much of the $68 billion project. Voters agreed to kick-start the rail plan with public money in 2008 by passing a nearly $10 billion state bond. The project has also received a limited supply of federal dollars. Increasingly, however, the California High-Speed Rail Authority has looked to the private sector for help. This summer, the authority asked businesses to offer financial advice and ideas on how to make the venture more efficient. It allowed the authority to gauge private investment interest. More than 30 companies responded. None pledged any funds, though the rail authority’s solicitation said it was asking only for advice, not money. Soon after, Assemblyman Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, told the LA Times in a November news article: The rail authority has "failed to disclose huge cost overruns and after they boasted private firms were interested in funding this project, we now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money." We decided to focus on his claim that the private sector is "unwilling to put up any private money." He’s made similar statements elsewhere, including to a TV news station in Fresno. KSEE TV Fresno interview with Assemblyman Jim Patterson, Nov. 1, 2015 Was Patterson right? Did the responses amount to corporations writing off the bullet train as a bad investment? We decided to check the facts. Our research First stop: A look at the role the private sector was expected to play when Californians voted for the high-speed rail network in 2008. Dan Richard, chairman of the rail authority, told us this month that the authority originally envisioned private funds paying about one-third of the project’s cost. It’s expected companies would invest their own capital to build, operate and maintain large portions of it -- once an initial government-funded Merced-to-Burbank segment opened in 2022 and showed strong ridership and revenue. Language in the ballot measure approved by voters requires the authority to seek private funds to cover the project’s cost, though it does not specify what percentage. Richard said the state still plans on private funds covering about one-third of the cost. Connecting the network from San Francisco to Los Angeles depends on it, he added. Richard also recently said opening the initial operating segment in 2022 could be delayed. The project broke ground in January in Fresno. "There’s really no question about interest from the private sector," Richard added. "The only question is when that money comes in." Challenges ahead The rail project continues to face numerous legal and financial challenges and has lost voter support in recent years. Cost projections have seesawed from $33 billion to nearly $100 billion, and most recently to $68 billion. Patterson’s statement about a lack of private funds raises a key concern. Responses from many private firms mirrored those by Madrid-based Acciona. It said it was "concerned about the financial market capacity to raise the required capital" unless the project’s contracts are broken into smaller pieces. Many also said they need a revenue guarantee from the state to reduce their investment risk. That’s prohibited by the law voters passed in 2008, though Richard has said such guarantees won’t be necessary once the project can demonstrate strong ridership. The proposed rail network would be one of California’s largest ever public works project, and the first high-speed rail system in the United States. Early stages Still, rail authority leaders, members of the private sector and the head of the project’s oversight panel all said it’s much too early to conclude the private sector has given up on high-speed rail. "We’re only at that very first stage where the authority has asked for expressions of interest, not (funding) proposals," said Stephen Polechronis, a senior vice president at AECOM, one of the private firms that responded to the rail authority’s request for advice. Michael Cahill of Siemens Industry, another firm that responded, told the Sacramento Bee recently: "We didn’t propose anything concrete in terms of private money going in, because there wasn’t an opportunity to do that. Which doesn’t mean we wouldn’t be interested. Quite the opposite." The company confirmed those comments, but declined our request to elaborate. No one is saying the private sector will soon jump onboard with gobs of cash. They are waiting and watching to see if the rail authority can successfully start the project and eliminate financial risks, said Louis Thompson, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project. "What the private sector has said," added Thompson, a retired federal rail administrator, "is that it is not willing to take many of the risks that the project would entail as of now." Thompson said the claim by Patterson, the Fresno lawmaker, about the private sector being unwilling to fund the project "isn’t strictly correct." A spokeswoman for Patterson said the lawmaker stands behind the statement. She pointed to recent news articles that outline private sector concerns with the project. Our ruling Assemblyman Jim Patterson said this month: "We now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money." He was referring to the more than 30 companies that submitted financial advice to the rail authority, without offering any funding. Many of those companies identified financial concerns, including the need to reduce the size of the project’s contracts and guarantee revenue. But Patterson does not mention that the rail authority’s request was for advice, not money. And we simply don’t "know" how willing those companies will be once a formal funding request is made. Some of the firms that responded, along with rail authority leaders and the head of the project’s independent oversight panel, all said it’s too early to conclude the private sector has given up on the project. Patterson’s statement implies they already have. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10166	John McCain "has threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/29/barack-obama/one-obama-example-is-just-too-old/	John McCain and Barack Obama debated foreign policy on Sept. 26, 2008, including policies for dealing with Pakistan. "(Obama) said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan," McCain said. "Now, you don't do that. You don't say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. ... I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them." McCain is distorting Obama's position by saying he wants to attack Pakistan, a statement we checked previously and found to be a Pants on Fire! This time, Obama responded directly to McCain's criticsm. "Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan," Obama replied. "Here's what I said — and if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know — that if the United States has al-Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out." Then he added, "And, John, you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But coming from you, who in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know how credible that is." It's a snappy comeback, but let's check its accuracy. We reviewed McCain's previous comments on North Korea and found the "extinction" claim dates back to 1994, when McCain appeared on the interview show This Week with David Brinkley to discuss North Korea. At the time, North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, was refusing to allow inspections of his nuclear program. Brinkley asked McCain what he would do about that. "Well, I would make sure that China and Japan realize that it is in the United States' and their vital national security interests that North Korea not be a nuclear power and possess nuclear weapons, and that they should go along with and help enforce strong sanctions against Korea," McCain said. "If not, then the United States will have no choice but to militarily disable that nuclear capability." Reporter Sam Donaldson, who also sat in on the interview, then asked McCain about the prospects of outright war with North Korea if the situation escalated. " I think history shows us, especially in dealing with dictators, that a strong, resolute policy and position is what usually avoids what you're talking about," McCain said. " You think they're bluffing?" Donaldson asked. " I don't know, but I know what they understand and that is the threat of extinction," McCain replied. So, he said it. The threat was implied rather than direct, but there's no mistaking the point McCain was seeking to make. But it was one time in 1994. That was 14 years ago, when McCain was not a candidate for president, and North Korea had a different leader. (Kim Il Sung would die later that year; the leadership would pass to his son, the current leader, Kim Jong Il.) Now, about McCain's singing songs about bombing Iran. The basis for this statement is something McCain said at an April 18, 2007, campaign appearance held at a VFW hall in Murrells Inlet, S.C. A man in the audience told McCain he thought Iran was causing problems in the Middle East. He then asked, "How many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people now, never mind if they get a nuclear weapon? When do we send an airmail message to Tehran?" The audience clapped and there were a few scattered cheers. "That old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran," McCain said, apparently referencing the Beach Boys' 1965 single "Barbara Ann." The audience laughed, then McCain sang softly, "Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. Anyway..." Video of the incident is available on YouTube. McCain said later it was a joke. "When veterans are together, veterans joke," McCain said. "And I was with veterans and we were joking. And, if somebody can't understand that, my answer is, please get a life." The McCain campaign never shied away from the bombing reference and played "Barbara Ann" at many of its rallies. Obama's charge is based on things McCain did say. His comments about North Korea sound like an implied threat, even if it wasn't a direct ultimatum. But given that it was one remark from 14 years ago, we question its relevancy to today's campaign. Because Obama omits the context of the remark and North Korea is still in the headlines, voters would likely think McCain said it recently, which was not the case. In the end, Obama is right that McCain said both things. But since the context of the Obama claim was a discussion of what "a president" should or shouldn't say publicly, we're not going to give full weight to the 14-year-old tough-talking remarks of a senator who at the time hadn't ever declared himself a candidate for the presidency.

pomt-09599	"Most Texans aren't millionaires."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/19/linda-chavez-thompson/says-most-texans-arent-millionaires/	Linda Chavez-Thompson kicked off her campaign for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor by assailing the personal wealth of incumbent Republican David Dewhurst, who’s jet-fueled three winning statewide campaigns partly from personal funds. Chavez-Thompson, whose background lies in labor unions, said Jan. 4: “I know I will be an underdog against Lt. Gov. Dewhurst, who is a comfortable millionaire. But most Texans are not millionaires.” See her single out the Lone Star state's wealth stereotype at the 1:08 mark of the video at right, which was posted on YouTube by the Texas Tribune. Thanks go to Chavez-Thompson for stating the obvious. We here at PolitiFact aren't millionaires and expect most Texans aren't, either. Still, Chavez-Thompson caused us to wonder: How many Texans are millionaires? And are many Texans well off compared to people elsewhere? We found that the latest statistics on Texas millionaires date back a few years. In 2004, according to an Internal Revenue Service estimate posted online in 2008, Texas was home to 108,000 individuals whose net worth was $1.5 million or more. (Why the $1.5 million benchmark? We don't know, but we suspect that a meager $1 million doesn't go as far as it used to.) Karl Eschbach, the state demographer, peeked at the same analysis and offered a quick caveat: The estimate was reached before the nation entered a recession partly driven by plunging home values, fueling drops in net worth. In 2004, 1 in 208 Texans were in the $1.5-million wealth tier--about 1/2 of 1 percent of the state's nearly 22.5 million residents. Texas ranked 37th nationally in its share of individuals with net worth of $1.5 million or more. Connecticut ranked first, Florida second, the District of Columbia third. Eschbach noted that the wealthiest people in Texas were better off than their rich counterparts in most states. In 2004, Texas ranked 18th in the average net worth of individuals whose net worth was $1.5 million or more. The average net wealth of such Texans was more than $4.5 million. We also found a 2001 estimate, based on an IRS sampling of federal tax returns, suggesting Texas was home to 182,000 millionaires, amounting to less than 1 percent of its 21.3 million residents that year. California was the heady home to 572,000 millionaires, New York to 317,000 and Florida to 249,000 Even Illinois had more millionaires, at 185,000, making us scratch our heads: When was the last time peacock-proud Texans had to fret about keeping up with residents of the Land of Lincoln? In her campaign kickoff speech, Chavez-Thompson didn’t recap the less salutary fact that Texas families rated as poorer than families nationally. In 2007, according to the Census Bureau, half of American households had income exceeding $50,740 and half made less than that. Texas had a median household income of $47,548. Of course, Texas still had enclaves of wealth. According to the bureau’s study, the Dallas suburb of Plano was a nationally prominent pocket of lucre, with a median household income of $84,492. At the other end of the scale, the state retained bastions of poverty along the Mexico border. Residents of El Paso County had median household incomes of $34,980 while residents of Hidalgo and Cameron counties had median incomes of $30,295 and $29,347, respectively, both ranking worse off than other U.S. counties. As of 2008, nearly 16 percent of Texans (3.8 million residents) lived in poverty, with 22.5 percent of children living in poverty, according to the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for government aid to low-income residents. Nationally, 13.2 percent of residents lived in poverty, including 18.2 percent of children. Eschbach said sizing up the state's wealth is no cinch. "You have a lot of major corporations headquartered here. You've got a lot of wealth creation," Eschbach said. "In that respect, we certainly aren't the wealthiest state or the poorest state. We do have a large representation of very disadvantaged people. At the same time, we have a robust economy." Much debate lies in the details. Yet to Eschbach and the rest of Texas, Chavez-Thompson's statement was no surprise. We rate her statement True.	None	Linda Chavez-Thompson	None	None	None	2010-01-19T20:28:29	2010-01-04	['None']
pomt-03586	"The Social Security trust fund is sound. Without anything being done, it would function well into 2038; and even after that time with no changes, we could pay 80 percent of the benefits that people have earned."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/may/15/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-social-security-trust-/	There’s a reason that Social Security is called the "third rail" of politics. When President Barack Obama issued a 2014 budget proposalthat would cut Social Security’s spending growth by using a "chained CPI" to calculate inflation-related benefit increases, he was promptly zapped by many in his own political party, including Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Toledo. Kaptur denounced Obama’s proposal on the House of Representatives floor, arguing that the "formula change that is being proposed would add up to a big cut for America’s senior citizens who have earned their benefits," and would harm struggling senior citizens. "The Social Security trust fund is sound," Kaptur said on April 11, 2013. "Without anything being done, it would function well into 2038; and even after that time with no changes, we could pay 80 percent of the benefits that people have earned." Given claimsfrom othersthat Social Security is bound for bankruptcy, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Kaptur’s claims that the Social Security system can function without tweaking into 2038 and beyond. Kaptur’s spokesman Steve Fought referred us to an Oct. 2012 reportfrom the Congressional Budget Office. It projects the Social Security’s Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund will be exhausted in 2016 under current law, and its Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) fund will run out in 2038. The report notes that in past years when the disability fund ran short of cash, legislators allowed money from the old age fund be to be spent on the disabled, leading many people to consider the funds in tandem. If future legislation again shifts money from the old age fund to those with disabilities, CBO projects the joint fund would be exhausted in 2034. The report stressed its forecast is somewhat uncertain. It said the trust funds were exhausted in 2029 or earlier in 10 percent of the simulations it examined, and lasted until 2045 or later another 10 percent. In an email, Fought said Kaptur’s remarks referred to the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. He noted that her speech only discussed the the elderly without mentioning the disabled. "Social Security is commonly associated, at least in layman’s circles, more so with OASI (old age benefits) than with DI (disability benefits)," Fought’s email said, adding it was that context in which Kaptur made her remarks. The CBO report notes that after the combined trust funds are exhausted in 2034, revenues the following year "are projected to equal 81 percent of scheduled outlays. Thus, payable benefits will be 19 percent lower than scheduled benefits. The gap between scheduled and payable benefits will shrink slightly for the following decade, falling to 16 percent in 2050. It will then widen, and by 2086, payable benefits will be 24 percent smaller than scheduled benefits." Fought said the CBO was referring to the combined funds, not just the Old Age and Survivors Insurance fund. He said it’s possible revenues would be higher than the 81 percent figure if only the OASI were examined, but said Kaptur’s speech used the more conservative 80 percent figure. The most recent Social Security trustees report, issued for 2012, didn’t echo Kaptur’s confidence about the trust fund’s long term health. The figures in it’s forecast were close to Kaptur’s numbers, but not identical. The reportpredicted the joint trust funds’ reserves would be exhausted in 2033, and "thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2086." If each program was considered alone, the trustees said the disability fund would be exhausted in 2016, and the old age fund would run out in 2035. The report urged lawmakers to address "the long-run financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare." "If they take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare," the report said. The proposal Obama made to use the the chained CPI as Social Security’s inflation index is one of many ideas that’s been suggested to improve the program’s long term health and reduce the federal budget deficit. "Chained CPI" refers to the "Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers." It differs somewhat from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which the Social Security Administration currently uses to adjust benefits for inflation. The chained CPI reflects substitutions that consumers make when prices rise. As the Congressional Budget Officeexplains it, "many people can lessen the impact of inflation on their standard of living by purchasing fewer goods or services that have risen in price and, instead, buying more goods or services that have not risen in price or have risen less." Using the chained CPI to adjust government benefits such as Social Security is would be estimated to save the government about $130 billionover the next decade. If such a proposal took effect next year, the CBO predictsSocial Security benefits would be roughly $30 a month lower, on average, by 2023 than they would be under current law, representing a reduction of about 2 percent of average benefits. A Social Security trustee told the House Ways and Means Committee the change would have a small beneficial impact on Social Security’s total financing shortfall, but won’t solve long term problems. "Accomplishing long lasting Social Security financing reforms will require far more substantial action to align the program’s basic benefit formula and eligibility rules with future tax schedules," trustee Charles Blahous told the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security.. Kaptur’s claim is partially accurate. She cited numbers from statistics compiled by the Congressional Budget Office. They don’t mesh precisely with the Social Security Administration’s numbers, but are fairly close. She’s on shakier ground with her contention that the fund is "sound." Without corrective action, Social Security’s old age trust fund will be exhausted in 25 years, the CBO projects, and its lack of funding could impact benefits for future senior citizens. That’s an important contextual factor. On the Truth-O-Meter, her statement is Half True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2013-05-15T18:07:29	2013-04-11	['None']
pomt-00203	"Indiana has purged no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order."	mostly false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/17/blog-posting/indiana-purge-20000-voters-federal-court-order/	Voter purges in Georgia and Ohio have captivated a national audience leading up to the midterms. Does Indiana face the same problem? "Indiana Caught Illegally Purging 20,000 Voters – Are You One?" was an Oct. 9 headline on Greg Palast’s blog read. Palast is a freelance investigative reporter who has been published in Rolling Stone and Al Jazeera. The subhead on his story claimed that Indiana has purged "no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order." This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Has Indiana taken tens of thousands of voters off their list in violation of a court order? The answer is complicated. Yes, Indiana has removed voters from its rolls -- but not in violation of a federal court order. An Indiana law passed in April 2017 would have allowed the state to kick thousands of voters off the voter registration list if a cross-state database known as the Interstate Crosscheck Program found what appeared to be duplicate voter registrations. But Indiana’s NAACP and League of Women Voters and Common Cause Indiana, a nonpartisan advocacy group, filed two separate lawsuits in August and October of 2017 challenging the removal of these voter registrations. They argued the process ignores critical safeguards before canceling voter registrations. The Interstate Crosscheck Program highlights voter records with matching names and birthdays across states. But researchers from Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania have found there is "a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people." Following those two legal challenges, the court in June granted a preliminary injunction that stopped the law from going into effect. The state has appealed. A final ruling will not be made until after the election. The statewide voter registration system was never updated to implement the new law. After we contacted him, Palast modified his subhead to read that of the 20,000 that were purged, only "some" were "apparently in violation of a federal court order." Indiana has taken nearly 500,000 people off the voter roll since 2016, according to Jan Mensz, staff attorney at the ACLU of Indiana, which represented Common Cause in the suit. That’s about 10 percent of the 4.5 million registered voters. "The fact that there have been a large number of voters removed since 2016 isn’t in itself that surprising," Mensz said. They may have moved, died, or been incarcerated, although that’s not always the case. After a Crosscheck list flagged 58,000 voter registrations as possible duplicates, election officials mailed those voters a postcard to confirm they still lived in Indiana. Of those, about 27,000 registrations were revoked. Palast found that 7,000 of them had moved. But the process the state used to kick these voters off the rolls would not have violated the court order. Voters can be "legitimately and legally removed" under a process by which the state first sends statewide mailers. If the postcard gets sent back as undeliverable, election officials wait until the voter hasn’t cast a ballot for two federal election cycles before taking the voter off the list. In fact, federal law requires that Indiana have a method to remove voters from the rolls, Mensz said. Indiana has been using the Crosscheck database for years as a catalyst to send out these mailers. The new law changed this so the state didn’t have to send a mailer or wait two election cycles before kicking a voter off the list; a Crosscheck match alone would do the trick. "It’s our view that those removed by Crosscheck, with or without a postcard, doesn’t matter to us if they missed two elections, that's illegal and a violation of the National Voter Registration Act," Palast said. "However, the subhed (which said the state violated the court order) was wrong." Both lawsuits challenge Crosscheck as a basis for removal under any procedure, but the preliminary injunction order doesn’t grant that yet. No court has yet held the use of Crosscheck to be illegal in all circumstances. Our ruling Palast said, "Indiana has purged no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order." Using data from the Indiana Office of Secretary of State, Palast found that roughly 20,000 Indiana voters were removed from the voting rolls in 2017 after their names matched an entry in the Crosscheck database. However, there is no evidence those removals violated a federal court order. The court order blocked a law from going into effect that would have used only the database to kick voters off the rolls. The voters Palast identified were first sent mailers and were given two federal election cycles to respond. That process has not yet been found illegal by any court.

pomt-13117	"Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/03/donald-trump/trump-leaves-out-context-claim-about-immigrants-an/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has emphasized his promise to deport criminals living in the United States illegally with just a few days left before the election. In recent rallies in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, he recounted how Americans have been murdered by undocumented immigrants with criminal records. "Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants," Trump said Oct. 27 in Springfield, Ohio. He offered a range of anecdotes in different cities. In Springfield, Trump mentioned a 90-year-old Minnesota farmer "brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home." In Kinston, N.C., Trump told the story of a 21-year-old "viciously murdered in cold blood, shot point blank by an illegal immigrant with a long and vicious criminal record." In Tallahassee, Fla., Trump spoke about a 25-year-old shot dead by a man who had been deported four times and "had a lengthy criminal record." We asked Trump’s campaign for more details, wondering if the thousands of killings referred to specific years or regions. We did not get a response. We decided to look into the statement given the key role immigration has played this election season. Lack of data Immigration experts told us Trump’s statement is so vague it is bound to be true. Without time or geographic parameters, the statement is just as accurate as saying "thousands of Americans have been killed by men," said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. The challenge in finding concrete numbers is due to a shortfall of data. There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims. About 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants accounted for about 3.5 percent of the total national population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. Certainly some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes. "The rate of murder may be lower or higher than other groups, but when we are talking about people, violent crime is never zero," said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. "By the same token it cannot be thousands every year. But adding up a few years then it has to be in the ‘thousands.’ There are a lot of murders in America and there are a lot illegal immigrants, so the statement has to be true." Overall, there are about 16,000 murders and 10,000 drunk driving deaths a year (the drunk driver is the person killed more than 60 percent of the time), Camarota said. Research on crime activity At his rallies, Trump portrays a picture of undocumented immigrants as a strong force of violent crime. Among the examples he offers is the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in July 2015. Authorities said her killer was an immigrant in the country illegally who had been ordered deported five times. Some killings highlighted by Trump’s campaign involved drunk driving incidents. Others went back more than a decade, according to a McClatchy review. McClatchy found that one of the killings Trump has mentioned dates back to 1990 and involved a man who was not in the country illegally, but a legal refugee originally from Vietnam. The man he shot, a police officer in California, ended up a paraplegic and died of cancer 12 years after being shot, McClatchy reported. While Trump’s discourse suggests waves of immigrants equals violence, scholars say studies don’t substantiate that message. Research on immigrants and crime finds that immigrants are not more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Social Work. "Again and again, we see evidence that they are not," Salas-Wright said. "In fact, it’s the opposite." Studies show that for the most part, people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and who don’t want to risk getting in trouble with the law, said Kubrin, the criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of immigrant males between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population in that same age group. (The Census does not specify legal status.) Our ruling Trump said, "Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants." Trump puts no timeframe on his comment, leaving his audience to fill in the blanks. In reality, there is no solid data for homicides committed by people here illegally. His implicit suggestion is that people should fear illegal immigrants more than citizens, and we don't see evidence for that. Research shows immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than the native-born population. However, like the legal U.S. population, some of the country's more than 11 million undocumented immigrants have committed murders. Trump’s statement was open-ended enough that we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d5475563-24db-4e90-8690-4d02c81f5bbf	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-03T15:03:39	2016-10-27	['United_States']
pomt-03816	Georgia loses "millions of dollars of revenue because people go out of state to buy fireworks."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/22/jeff-mullis/lawmaker-says-georgia-loses-out-fireworks-revenue/	The Georgia night sky could -- loudly -- come to life if a piece of legislation becomes state law. Senate Resolution 378 would allow revenue from the sale of consumer fireworks to be used to help fund trauma care and firefighter services in Georgia. Currently, nothing with more pop than a sparkler can be sold in this state. The expansion would allow the sale of more high-powered fireworks, such as rockets, firecrackers and Roman candles. The resolution, if approved, would require a statewide voter referendum in November 2014. One prominent sponsor of the bill, Sen. Jeff Mullis, said there’s a practical reason for such a law. "We lose millions of dollars of revenue because people go out of state to buy fireworks," said Mullis, a Republican from Chickamauga, a 10-minute trip from the Tennessee border. Mullis claimed in a press release that "the sales tax on these purchases will raise and [sic] estimated $5 million each year for vital emergency services." Lawmakers propose a 6 percent tax on fireworks sales with the proceeds being evenly split for trauma care and a firefighter safety council. An additional 1 percent tax could be collected by cities and counties. PolitiFact Georgia received a reader request to figure out if Mullis is correct in his assertion that Georgia loses millions of dollars because people travel to Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee to get their fireworks. We try to stay away from fact-checking revenue projections. Mullis, a former firefighter, said via email that his primary concern is Georgia is "failing to capitalize on a form of commerce that could add millions of dollars to our state's bottom line, as well as jobs which would be created as a result of new industry." Marietta resident Bill Tugwell owns the large Alabama fireworks store on U.S. 431 between Phenix City and Eufaula that many metro Atlantans pass on their way to vacation along the Florida Panhandle beaches. The parking lot is often filled with cars bearing Georgia license plates. "I don’t think it’s millions plural," Tugwell said regarding how much money Georgia loses to other states. "I think it’s closer to a million." Some states have interesting purposes for their fireworks laws. Florida allows people to buy an estimated 2,000 forms of fireworks that are listed under the category of sparklers. For anything that explodes or lifts off the ground, you need a permit. Some of the permitted uses for more powerful forms of fireworks include scaring birds away from crops. "There shouldn’t be a critter left in Florida," quipped Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, a Maryland-based trade group. Revenue officials in Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee said they did not have any research showing how much money Georgians spend on fireworks there. Economics academics at colleges and universities in those states said they haven’t seen or conducted such research. A Senate spokeswoman sent us a report by the American Pyrotechnics Association that says consumers nationwide spent $649 million on fireworks in 2011, up from $284 million in 1998. The figures were not broken down by states. Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, suggested we could come up with an estimate by calculating a per capita breakdown of how much money Georgians would spend on fireworks if the menu of products was expanded. Since slightly more than 3 percent of the nation’s population lives in Georgia (9.9 million residents), that would equate to about $20 million being spent by Georgians in 2011. Humphreys advised us that there would be a multiplier effect on top of the direct fiscal impact due to reduced shopping outside Georgia if fireworks were available for purchase inside the state, but he said it would not be large. A 6 percent tax or fee could be worth at least $3 million annually. In 2006, Indiana lawmakers imposed a 5 percent safety fee on retail fireworks sales. Indiana collects about $2.5 million a year from the fee, state data shows. Indiana has about 6.5 million residents. Michigan collected $755,262 from a 6 percent fireworks safety fee during the first eight months of its new law to allow more powerful fireworks to be sold, the Detroit News reported. The newspaper reported the revenue collected was far below projections. Michigan’s new fireworks safety fee and guidelines took effect in January 2012. Michigan has 9.8 million residents, nearly the same amount as Georgia. Bill Weimer, a top official of a company in Ohio that sells many of the fireworks not currently sold in Georgia, believes Mullis’ claim is accurate. Weimer looked at the amount of fireworks sold in Indiana and believes the same volume of fireworks will be sold in Georgia or more. "You can do the math," said Weimer, vice president of Phantom Fireworks, which sells fireworks to several national retail chains. Phantom Fireworks has been working with Mullis and other lawmakers trying to pass SR 378. So where does this leave us? Mullis claimed Georgia’s economy loses millions of dollars in revenue because residents travel outside the state to purchase their fireworks. It’s probable, but there is no specific research to support his argument. We do know some Georgians go outside the state to buy fireworks, and it does seem like people spend millions of dollars on fireworks in other states. It would be useful if there were more hard numbers out there to back up Mullis’ claim. But based on the specific numbers we have from other states and our own estimates, he seems to be in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02811	"I did not support the sequester."	true	/florida/statements/2013/nov/26/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-he-never-supported-sequester/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., once compared watching our national debt to waiting for the killer to appear during a horror movie. "You know those movies where the people in the audience are screaming, ‘Don’t go in that door!’ because you know the killer is there? Well, it is the same thing with this debt," Rubio said during a Jacksonville radio station interview in 2012. "We know how this ends." Scary stuff indeed. Rubio returned to talk about our killer debt during a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Nov. 20. "To lift the sequester we must find a real, lasting solution to the true cause of our growing national debt: the unsustainable path of important programs like Medicare and Social Security," he said. During the question and answer session, Rubio mentioned the sequester again: "This notion that the sequester is just going to vanish and people are going to wake up, unfortunately, is unrealistic. I did not support the sequester. I do not believe that’s the right way to balance a budget. I just think it's better than tax increases, as bad as the sequester may be." We decided to turn the clock back and review Rubio’s actions and words that related to the sequester. The path to the sequester Rubio, a former state legislator, propelled himself into the national spotlight running for U.S. Senate in 2010. During the campaign, he raised alarms about federal spending and "mountains of debt for our children." He continued that theme once elected to office. (We have fact-checked multiple claims by Rubio about the debt or sequester.) In March 2011, he made a flurry of national media appearances and penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal to announce he would vote against raising the debt limit "unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid." Rubio gave props to a plan by Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., to lower and simplify tax rates, close loopholes, and make permanent low rates on capital gains and dividends. He also gave a shout out to House Republicans for their budget plan, which he said would lower discretionary spending by $862 billion over 10 years. In an interview with Florida reporters, Rubio said lawmakers should consider raising the retirement age for Social Security, but not for people currently near retirement. Rubio has also called for reducing "non-defense, non-veterans" spending to 2008 levels. But Rubio, a freshman Republican in the minority in the Senate, didn’t have much sway. In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress entered a high-stakes stand-off over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a "grand bargain," a specific plan to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. The House passed the bill 269-161. In the Senate, it passed 74-26 with Rubio voting ‘’no’’ on Aug. 2, 2011. The law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan "supercommittee." As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a sequester would automatically go into effect, putting in place nearly across-the-board budget cuts, with half coming from defense. Rubio released a statement about his vote against the measure: "I cannot support this plan because it fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis." Rubio wrote that the plan failed to immediately downsize government and ignored "the biggest driver of our debt, health care spending." Rubio also wrote that he feared the vote would lead to consideration of big tax hikes. "And if Congress rejects new taxes, then up to $850 billion of devastating automatic defense spending cuts would be triggered at a time when the world is as dangerous as it’s ever been," he wrote. Both Obama and Boehner supported the plan, and despite Rubio’s no vote, it passed Congress with bipartisan majorities. The supercommittee deadlocked, though, so it never proposed new cuts. That’s what led to the sequester. After it was clear the supercommittee couldn’t reach agreement, Rubio was among a group of Republican senators who tried to prevent defense from being subject to the sequester. "Defense funding should be driven by our national security needs, not by arbitrary fiscal arithmetic," said the senators in a December 2011 statement. The sequester officially started in March 2013 and led to multiple claims about the impact on Head Start, airports and wacky spending. Lawmakers found plenty of fodder to criticize about the sequester and Rubio was no exception. In July 2013, Rubio wrote an op-ed criticizing the fact that the sequester grounded the Navy’s Blue Angels from an event in Pensacola. "The Blues were grounded this weekend all because of a feckless decision made two years ago more than 900 miles away in Washington, D.C." Rubio wrote. Rubio repeated that he opposed the sequester and wanted limited to spending in a floor speech in July. "I do not dispute that it (the sequester) will have an impact. In fact, I voted against the deal that actually gave us the sequester, and I voted against it because, while I believe deeply we need to constrain spending because we are spending a lot more money than we are taking in, about $1 trillion a year more than we are taking in, borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar we spend in the federal government -- for the folks visiting here in the gallery, you may be shocked to hear that. Every dollar the federal government spends, 40 cents of it is borrowed. In September 2013, Florida federal courts officials held a video conference with aides to Rubio and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to talk about the impact of the sequester on the courts. Brooke Sammon, Rubio's deputy press secretary, said then that Rubio "has always said that the sequester was a bad idea, in part because it does not prioritize core public safety functions. The only way to solve our long-term deficit problems is to grow our economy, which will require entitlement reform and pro-growth tax reform, not tax hikes." Our ruling Rubio said "I did not support the sequester." Rubio voted "no" on the Budget Control Act in 2011 that paved the path toward the sequester in March 2013. He said at the time that he voted "no" because the law "fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis."

pomt-00746	"99 percent of all new income today (is) going to the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/19/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/	When U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., finds a microphone these days, you can expect him to harp on the erosion of the American middle class. Sanders, who has said he is considering a 2016 presidential run and caucuses with Democrats, made a striking point about the country’s income inequality over the last 40 years in an April 19 interview on Fox News Sunday. "What we're seeing, Chris, right now is that for 40 years, the American middle class has been disappearing. Millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages despite a huge increase in technology and productivity," Sanders said. "And what we have seen during that period is a massive transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of America — massive wealth and income inequality, where you have 99 percent of all new income today going to the top 1 percent." With the financial rift between everyday and mega-rich Americans poised to dominate the 2016 White House race, PolitiFact wanted to examine Sanders’s statement about 99 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent. The research behind the claim Sanders used a similar line about the top 1 percent taking home 99 percent of all new income during a Brookings Institution speech a couple months ago, saying, "In fact, the latest information that we have shows that in recent years, over 99 percent of all new income generated in the economy has gone to the top 1 percent." The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded that claim One Pinocchio, a designation for claims that include in part a "selective telling of the truth." Sanders did not agree with the conclusion and doubled down on the accuracy of his claim in a displeased letter. Sanders’ office told us the senator was talking about pre-tax income growth from 2009-13 during his Fox interview. A Sanders spokesman highlighted a New York Times Upshot article in January by Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. Wolfers based his calculations on the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who uses pre-tax income reported on Internal Revenue Service filings in his studies of top incomes, including capital gains. Saez and French economist Thomas Piketty have written about the disparate recovery from the recession among America’s two big income classes for several years. Saez found most recently that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12. Using Saez’s preliminary 2013 numbers, Wolfers stretched the window to account for an average of 2012-13 incomes (He used an average for those years because tax rates on top earners increased in 2013, prompting some to shift more income to 2012.). The takeaway? The average income for the richest 1 percent of Americans, excluding capital gains, rose from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 from 2012-13, he wrote. The 99 percent, on the other hand, experienced a drop in average incomes from $44,000 to $43,900, Wolfers said. The calculation excludes government benefits in the form of Social Security, welfare, tax credits, food stamps and so on. "That is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent," Wolfers wrote for the New York Times post. Sanders spokesman Jeff Frank said his office double-checked the statistic with Wolfers, who double-checked his own work with Saez. Saez told PolitiFact that the key to understanding the statistic is knowing that it’s measuring pre-tax, pre-government benefit income. "That's the key stat to think about how the market allocates incomes in the first place," Saez said. "Anybody should be worried that the recovery from the Great Recession has been so skewed in terms of market incomes." Other points to consider Other economists argue that the more comprehensive way to talk about income is by looking at earnings after taxes and how government alters the income picture. That measure is called net or disposable income. Under this measure, the income differences are not as badly skewed, Saez said. That’s because on one side, government programs are making life easier for low-income Americans through things such as Social Security, unemployment compensation, veterans’ benefits, food stamps, welfare, housing assistance, health subsidies, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, said Brookings Institution fellow Gary Burtless. At the same time, tax policy has become more progressive since 2009 through lower taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans and higher taxes for higher earners. The drawback with this analysis, however, is it does not reflect how people are "sharing directly in the rewards of the market," said Urban Institute fellow Eugene Steuerle, who has written about the different definitions of income. For Steuerle, all of the numbers matter, though each one holds a different meaning depending on the policy question. Steuerle is a fan of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, which he said offers a more comprehensive look at the income gap by including labor, business, capital and retirement income. Another way to think of it is comparing living standards. In November 2014, CBO released a study of household income taxes, which compared income growth after taxes since 1977. The problem is it only goes up to 2011, so we cannot compare it to the 2009-13 market measure. Other researchers have probed inequality in income growth over other time periods (a couple detailed here), but they do not apply to Sanders’s recovery timeframe. "Is there a lot of inequality in living standards after tax and transfers? The right data to answer that question is simply unavailable for recent years," Wolfers said. Often, income inequality measures do not account for health care, the costs of which are often employer-paid and can level the playing field between low- and middle-income earners and the super rich, Steuerle said. Another point to keep in mind: The country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession — a point that Sanders’s claim does not account for because it picks up with the recovery, Burtless said. To Burtless, Sanders’s estimate is correct in the narrow way he meant it but would be overstated under a broader income definition that extends pre-2009. Our ruling Sanders said that "99 percent of all new income (is) going to the top 1 percent." Sanders is referring to pre-tax, pre-transfer income growth during the economic recovery from 2009-13. We found consensus among economists that the statistic and calculation offered by Sanders is credible, but it’s just not the only way to consider income inequality. Other measures may be equally valid and produce different results. But economists say specific data does not yet exist. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional notes of context. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-04-19T18:55:37	2015-04-19	['None']

pomt-15030	Says Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Jason Kander is "attending fancy dinners all over the country."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/fact-checking-nrscs-pandering-panda-attack-jason-k/	The NRSC is sponsoring an ad campaign featuring "The Pandering Panda," a portrayal of Jason Kander, U.S. Senate candidate and current Missouri secretary of state, as doing anything to win over lobbyists and big money in Washington.The ad campaign features a Twitter page, YouTube video, Snapchat series and website. The YouTube ad, released Aug. 19, features a person dressed in a panda suit in various locations throughout Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. The panda character alternates between holding a burlap sack full of money and a hand-drawn sign that reads, "I love Obama." The ad also features clips of real pandas and high pitched voices making claims about Kander "pandering" for money in Washington. To date, the video has less than 12,000 views on YouTube after nearly a month online. Kander, a Democrat, is hoping to unseat Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who has held the office since 2011. Among the charges in the NRSC ad is the claim that Kander is "attending fancy dinners all over the country." We decided sink our claws into this claim. The NRSC provided us with a list of five fundraisers they say Kander attended between March 1 and May 31, 2015. Kander fundraiser Date Washington: Porterfield, Lowenthal, Fettig & Sears (lobbying firm) March 4, 2015 Washington: Hosted by Sen. Chris Murphy and various lobbyists May 20, 2015 Las Vegas: hosted by Harry Reid May 2015 Martha’s Vineyard Date unknown Philadelphia Date unknown We could only independently verify fundraisers in Washington and Las Vegas based on public reports. Kander's campaign manager Abe Rakov would not provide additional information about the fundraisers. So we can't tell you whether these fundraisers meet the definition of a "fancy dinner." The NRSC provided no specific evidence to support that part of the attack. That aside, three or five out-of-state fundraisers didn't seem like a lot to us, so we wanted to check with political scientists who are experts on the American political system. They didn't see much out of the ordinary in Kander's trips or actions based on the information provided by the NRSC. Greg Vonnahme, an associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said that most congressional candidates raise most of their money from out of district and even candidates for state office will seek out-of-state sources for funding. He also notes the NRSC itself hosts fundraisers for candidates. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, raised more than half of his campaign funding from out of state in the 2014 election. "Whether Kander attending three or five fundraisers during the period from March to May is excessive depends on one's feelings about the nature of campaign finance," Vonnahme said. "But is it unusual among Democrats, Republicans, House or Senate candidates? No." Peverill Squire, a professor of political science at MU, said this scenario of the NRSC attacking Kander for out-of-state fundraising is not uncommon. "Given the large sums of money now required to run for the U.S. Senate, it is common for candidates, particularly from smaller, less wealthy states, to attend out-of-state fundraisers," Squire said. "It is also common for the opposing party to attempt to make an issue of it. Challengers running against Senate incumbents face an uphill battle and need all the campaign money they can raise. Kander will raise as much as he can, and Blunt will likely respond by raising even larger sums." As of the release of second-quarter campaign finances, Blunt raised $1.4 million in the second quarter as compared to Kander's $734,000. The Blunt campaign announced it has $3.8 million in cash on hand; the Kander campaign $1.1 million. Blunt's money, as of July 30, is 49.8 percent PAC donations, totaling $1.2 million compared to Kander's $176,650, totaling 11.6 percent. In total itemized contributions, Blunt has 516 Missouri donors (after refunds) resulting in $581,647, compared to Kander's 835 Missouri donors for $679,816. Blunt's campaign would not release any information regarding Blunt's travel or specific fundraisers. Our ruling The NRSC ad campaign "Kander Pander" involves a claim that Kander is "attending fancy dinners all over the country." The NRSC provided a list of five fundraisers that it says constitute fancy dinners. That evidence is fairly thin. It's also worth noting that Kander, who is currently Missouri's secretary of state, has raised plenty of money from Missourians — more than his opponent. The NRSC claim has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09802	The Democratic health care bill in the House would "create 53 new government bureaucracies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/11/charles-boustany/boustany-and-other-republicans-say-health-care-pla/	In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's address on health care before a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., a heart surgeon by profession, repeated a popular Republican talking point, saying the health care reform bill introduced in the House would "create 53 new government bureaucracies." This claim originates with a detailed list complied by the House Republican Conference, which you can view here . Fifty-three new bureaucracies sounds like a lot, and the list is so specific, we decided to dig into it to see if it's legitimate. "Bureaucracy" can mean different things to different people, so we began with a trip to the Merriam-Webster dictionary to set some parameters. It defines it like this: "a body of nonelective government officials; an administrative policy-making group; government characterized by specialization of functions, adherence to fixed rules, and a hierarchy of authority; a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation." So, to the list... The first two are no-doubt-abouters. No. 1 is a Health Benefits Advisory Committee (Section 123, p. 30). This is a new panel of experts that will make recommendations to the secretary of Health and Human Services on covered health benefits. It's an advisory board, but a new entity nonetheless. New bureaucracy, check. No. 2 on the list is the creation of a Health Choices Administration (Section 141, p. 41). This is a biggie. The Health Choices Administration would be an independent executive branch agency charged with establishing qualified plan standards, creating the health insurance exchange and administering affordability credits for low-income people. New bureaucracy, check. After this, however, the list gets murkier. Consider No. 3, Qualified Health Benefits Plan Ombudsman. This person, or office, would be charged with helping people navigate the new health reform system and report to Congress on recommendations for improvements in administration of the program. It's part of the Health Choices Administration (No. 2 on the list). That sounds like double-counting to us. And that's true of a number of other items on the list as well. We're not going to detail all 53 items on the list. But here are a few general observations from our examination of them. Four of the items on the list include the creation of various trust funds. These are new funds, but they are to be created by existing agencies. These are essentially bank accounts. Those aren't new government bureaucracies in our book. The list also includes six pilot programs and three demonstration programs. These are small-scale demo programs. If the programs turn out to improve care and save money, the government will roll them out nationally. There's already an office in place in Medicare that runs demonstration programs. In fact, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003 included 14 new demonstration projects. It wouldn't be fair to call that 14 new bureaucracies then, and it's not fair to call these demonstration programs new bureaucracies now. "The programs and demonstration projects they list aren't new agencies but rather new projects, and they're sensible ways to test new policies before more broadly implementing them," said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. And, he said, "many of the programs and demonstration projects are things that Republicans themselves have called for and supported." The list also includes three new ombudsmen and a special inspector general for the Health Insurance Exchange. And again, these are individual offices in existing agencies — not bureaucracies. Three items on the list deal with comparative effectiveness research. Although the government already does such research, we think it's fair to count the creation of a new Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research on the list. But the next two items, a comparative effectiveness research commission and a patient ombudsman for comparative effectiveness research seems like triple-dipping. Ironically, said Stan Dorn, senior research associate at the left-leaning Urban Institute, those safeguards were put in to assure Republicans that the program would not be used to force insurers to comply with the council's research findings. "Some of these things are new government bureaucracies," Dorn said. "But a lot of these items are not new government agencies, they are new activities that existing agencies would be asked to perform." By Dorn's count, 36 of the 53 items on the Republican list fall in that latter category. An example is an item on the list for a program of administrative simplification (Section 163, p. 57). It would be up to the department of Health and Human Services to implement the updated standards. "That is not a new bureaucracy," Dorn said. "That's an activity required of an existing government agency." "Just eyeballing this list," Dorn said, "it is clearly way over the top." We agree that there are lots of suspect items on the list and the Republicans' methodology in choosing them is inconsistent. But we also think it's fair for them to claim that the Democratic health plan would create new government bureaucracy. The plan would create new ways to subsidize health insurance for millions of low-income people. It would establish a health insurance exchange in which people not on plans provided by large companies could shop for competitive rates. That requires the creation of some new institutions. But they are wrong to cite 53 as the number. In fact, the number is clearly much smaller. So we find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charles Boustany	None	None	None	2009-09-11T18:14:32	2009-09-09	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-11383	"Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day"	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/28/blog-posting/was-ohio-student-suspended-staying-class-during-na/	After an Ohio high school student’s suspension notice was posted on social media, claims went viral that he was suspended for not participating in National Walkout Day one month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day," a Fox News headline stated March 16. The Associated Press had a similar headline: "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts." Many right-leaning websites repeated the story about Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, located in a suburb of Columbus, with hashtags such as #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder and #DefendThe2nd. Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Shoemaker’s suspension notice, posted on social media by a friend, stated: "student refused to follow instructions after being warned repeatedly by several administrators." While some social media posts presented the situation as the school punishing a student for refusing to call for gun control, the situation was actually more nuanced. Shoemaker was suspended following National Walkout Day when thousands of students nationwide walked out of school one month after the massacre in Parkland to protest gun violence and call for gun control. The first paragraph of the Fox News story shows that Shoemaker didn’t want to follow the alternative for students who didn’t want to attend the walkout: "An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall." Shoemaker told Fox News that he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate so he chose to stay in the classroom and do school work instead. "They presented the situation of the national walkout in such a way to where it really seemed they were forcing me to make a choice, a political choice in the classroom," he said. "I didn’t like that I was going to have to decide whether I was anti-violence and pro-gun control or if I was to stay inside and be pro-gun violence, effectively. It didn’t feel right to have to make that decision." Shoemaker’s father Scott Shoemaker posted a message on Facebook March 16: "My son was suspended for not leaving the room to either join a demonstration or reporting to the commons. He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of, but staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service. "This had nothing to do with his own political beliefs, but with politics in school in general. Students should not have been forced to leave their classrooms, choose a side, and be politically divided. He got support from students on both sides of the political aisle after returning today, but he felt there were other students and staff angry with him for taking this position." Fox News reported a statement from the school: "As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. .... This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location." We found the school’s full statement on its website, which stated that no students were forced to participate in the walkout. "In fact, student participation overall was well under 50 percent of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings. Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment." School spokeswoman Stacie Raterman told PolitiFact that students opting not to attend the walkout were able to go to supervised study halls in different classrooms and the commons area. She said she couldn’t comment on any individual student’s discipline due to federal privacy laws but said about a dozen students at Davidson were suspended after attending the memorial gathering but not returning to class. A Fox News network spokeswoman did not have any additional comment. Our ruling Many online headlines said, "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day." The headline in and of itself could lead viewers to reach a misleading conclusion that the student was suspended for simply opting out of the walkout. But the story states that he was suspended because he didn’t take the alternative the school district offered, which was to attend a supervised study hall instead. The school said that less than half of the students participated in the walk out and that no one was disciplined for opting out of it, but they had to remain in a place supervised by staff.

pomt-03608	On an early date for Florida's presidential primary	full flop	/florida/statements/2013/may/09/marco-rubio/did-marco-rubio-flip-flop-setting-floridas-preside/	Why should Iowa and New Hampshire get all the attention when it comes to presidential politics? That was the question Florida legislators were asking back in 2007, when they ignored advice from both national Republican and Democratic party leaders and moved Florida’s presidential primary date. By moving it earlier, to January 29, the idea was that presidential candidates would give more time and attention to Florida voters. The parties were not amused, and they sanctioned Florida delegates with a variety of penalties, both in 2008 and 2012 More recently, though, Florida legislators have lost interest in going rogue. In the waning days of the 2013 Florida legislative session, lawmakers tucked a provision into an elections bill to move the primary back, so that it’s held "on the first Tuesday that the rules of the major political parties provide for state delegations to be allocated without penalty." They made the change with the support of one of Florida’s top Republicans: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. That jogged our memory: Wasn’t Rubio the one in favor of moving the primary up in the first place? We decided to investigate the matter on our Flip-O-Meter. We use the Flip-O-Meter to determine when a political official or candidate has changed position. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gaging whether they did or not. • • • A look through the archives showed Rubio promoted an early primary date as early as in March 2006. The Miami Republican was then a young state legislator, but a powerful one, as Florida’s Speaker of the House. "With all due respect to New Hampshire and Iowa, nowhere are you going to be on a national stage like Florida," Rubio told the Tampa Bay Times back then. "You're going to get questions about Israel, Latin America, immigration. It's the old South, it's Latin, it's Midwestern, it's rural and urban." Rubio included the idea in his book, 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future, which became his game plan for the Florida House in 2007 and 2008, and a checklist he touted when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. (PolitiFact Florida documented the idea as No. 37 for Rubio, and marked it a promise kept.) Rubio won an open U.S. Senate seat in 2010, and since then he has become a rising star in the Republican Party. He’s often mentioned as potential presidential candidate in 2016 and even leads in some polls. (Yes, current polling has little predictive value for a race more than three years away.) While Rubio’s been out of the Florida Legislature for years now, he was still credited as a force for getting the primary moved back to a date in 2016 so that the parties don’t apply penalties to Florida delegates. Rubio has cited two reasons for his change in position: harsher penalties from the party, and the rise of super PACs. The penalties for Republicans would have been notably harsher in 2016 than in 2012, according to an analysis by the Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau. The state’s full complement of delegates is 99. In 2012, Republicans were docked back to 49 for its early primary. In 2016, they would have been bumped down to 12. That’s in addition to the indignity of far-flung hotel rooms. In 2012, Florida delegates spent hours waiting for shuttle buses that were supposed to take them from downtown Tampa to hotel rooms in Palm Harbor, nearly 30 miles away. The move would also be a dramatic boost to whoever wins the Florida presidential primary in 2016. Maybe Rubio? From the Times/Herald report: "We would go from being the third-largest delegation to being the smallest," said Todd Reid, state director for Rubio. Asked about Rubio's potential bid for president in 2016, Reid said the changes had nothing to do with the senator's political future and noted that Democrats support the changes as much, if not more, than Republicans. The Times caught up with Rubio himself in Washington. He said the penalties changed the situation, as did the growing influence of super PACs. "When we changed the primary when I was in the House, it made sense because at that time these elections were still being decided in three or four early states. In the advent of super PACs, where someone will give you $1 million and you can survive for months at a time, it's changed. If these races are going to go on until April or June, then it behooves Florida to have its full comple­ment of delegates." Finally, we wondered, who benefited the most from Rubio’s change of position? Rubio, or the people of Florida? After all, Florida did get a lot of attention in 2008 and 2012 with its early primary. (In 2012, the major Republican candidates came to Tampa for a nationally televised debate.) To help us consider that question, we turned to Steven Tauber, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. For Rubio the candidate, it’s unlikely that an 87-delegate penalty would be a make-or-break difference for his presidential aspirations, he said. For the state of Florida, though, the penalties are tough enough that it makes sense to follow the rules. And besides, going first isn’t the big advantage that it used to be. "When races are close, and the assumption is that the 2016 Republican nomination will be close, the states in the middle are more important," he said. Our ruling There is little doubt that Rubio has changed position on whether Florida should jump the line and have an early primary. Back in 2007, he pushed the change through the Florida Legislature. Just recently, he supported moving the date back. He says facts on the ground have changed: The penalties exacted by the political parties are harsher. Meanwhile, campaign cash from super PACs means candidates are hanging in longer and extending the campaign season. Be that as it may, the move is a major reversal of position.

pomt-04963	"This year in Congress (Connie Mack IV) has missed almost half of his votes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/25/dave-weldon/weldon-connie-mack-missed-almost-half-votes/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has been criticized for missing votes while campaigning for U.S. Senate. A Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon of Indialantic near Melbourne, aired a robocall recently that picked up that story line: "How angry would you be if you hired someone to do a job and they only showed up half the time? You know -- they only cut half the grass, or they charged you for four hours when they really only worked two? Well, that’s what candidate Connie Mack has done. This year in Congress he has missed almost half of his votes, and now he not only wants to be paid for not showing up, he wants to be promoted into the U.S. Senate." We wanted to check if that number was correct. GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. The page on Mack states that throughout his tenure, starting in January 2005 through July 23, 2012, Mack missed 362 of 6190 recorded or roll call votes, which is 6 percent. The median was 2.4 percent. We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in late 2011, when he missed 10.1 percent of votes. Mack announced he was running for Senate in late October 2011, with the goal of taking on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Since the robocall said he missed almost half the votes "this year," we will focus on Mack’s 2012 record. Below are his votes from Jan. 1 to July 23. Total votes Missed votes Percentage missed First quarter 2012 151 65 43 percent Second quarter 2012 299 75 25.1 percent Third quarter 2012 (starts July 1) 47 2 4.3 percent Total 497 142 28.6 percent We shared our findings with Weldon and asked how he concluded that Mack missed "almost half" of his votes this year. "You know how these things are," Weldon said in an interview with PolitiFact. " I didn’t actually get that. I relied on my staff to research that. It sounds like you did a better job than them." Weldon said that the claim might have been based on previous attacks against Mack by George LeMieux, who dropped his Republican U.S. Senate bid in June. The robocall might not have factored in the second quarter and the portion of the third quarter, Weldon said. "It sounds like (Mack) is showing up more," Weldon said. Campaign spokesman J.B. Kump said that he didn’t put together the robocall, but it was intended to refer to the first quarter. "It was something that will probably be corrected in future robocalls if we use that script again," Kump said. "We will try to be more accurate." But Kump reiterated the general criticism of Mack saying he has missed too many votes -- in an email he told PolitiFact "Any discussion of quarters, etc., is just quibbling." Kump wouldn’t tell us exactly when or where the robocall aired -- the Tampa Bay Times posted it on its Buzz blog on July 22 and stated that voters heard it in Tampa Bay over the weekend. American Bridge 21st Century PAC, a Democratic group, said in July that Mack missed about 31 percent of votes based on the first half of 2012. (They arrived at a slightly different figure because they didn’t use the partial data available for the beginning of the third quarter.) Mack’s missed votes have made news for several months. The Tampa Bay Times reported in February that Mack missed a series of missed votes, including to repeal part of the health care law. POLITICO noted in April that Mack missed the high-profile vote on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan. Mack’s response Mack’s campaign spokesman David James did not dispute our numbers. "Mack has a lifetime 95 percent voting attendance record affected by missing some votes to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington," James told PolitiFact. It’s not unusual for a congressman running for statewide office to miss a high number of votes. The Miami Herald reported in a 2000 story that Nelson missed many votes in 1990 while running for governor. Nelson has only missed one vote this year, according to GovTrack, but unlike Mack, he hasn’t faced feisty primary challengers, and the Senate takes fewer votes. Our ruling The Weldon robocall said that Connie Mack "missed almost half of his votes" this year. Actually, Mack missed about 28.6 percent of votes this year, which is significantly less than the robocall claimed. The Weldon campaign conceded that they relied on out-of-date information for their attack. However, Mack has missed votes. He's missed more votes than the average member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he's missed high-profile votes on health care and the budget. He hasn't missed "almost half of his votes," though. So we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Dave Weldon	None	None	None	2012-07-25T10:33:16	2012-07-22	['None']
pomt-13467	Heroin comes in the United States "from the southern border."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/donald-trump/trump-right-heroin-coming-through-southern-border/	Donald Trump tied the heroin epidemic gripping suburban white communities to the issue central to the campaign: border security and illegal immigration. The rate of heroin-related overdoses has nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013, with more than 8,200 deaths that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Appearing on CNBC, Trump argued that this too is tied to weak borders. "Our youth is being poisoned. You go to places like New Hampshire, where it’s the No. 1 thing, heroin, and it comes from the southern border. And you go to Ohio, as an example, I was there two days ago, and the biggest complaint they have is what’s pouring into there," Trump said, before repeating his False claim that Hillary Clinton "is for open borders." We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border? Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. "Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand," the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. "Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States," the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. "Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons." Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border: As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves. Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact. This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer. In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer. "The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends," he said. Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. Here’s a map from the Justice Department that shows how heroin moves through the United States: Our ruling Trump said heroin "comes from the southern border." The vast majority of heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.

pomt-09892	On mandating health care coverage.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-requiring-people-buy-health-care/	Walk back with us through the mists of time to early 2008, and you might remember then-candidate Barack Obama defending the rights of hard-working people so they would not be forced to buy health insurance. Obama's position was different from his two nearest rivals, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, who included mandates for individuals to buy health insurance in their plans for reform. It was an issue that got downright contentious on the campaign trail. At a debate in South Carolina, Edwards said Obama's plan really wasn't universal health care, since it didn't have a mandate to ensure everyone was covered. Obama replied that his plan was universal (a claim we rated Barely True ) and explained why he was against a mandate: "A mandate means that in some fashion, everybody will be forced to buy health insurance. ... But I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can't afford it. And that's why my plan emphasizes lowering costs." Obama said at the time it was possible some people would refuse to buy health care under his plan. "It's true that some people could game the system by just waiting till they get sick and then they show up," Obama said. "But keep in mind that my plan also says children will be able to stay on their parents' plan up until the age of 25. And so I don't believe that there are a whole bunch of folks out there that will not get coverage. And John, both you and Hillary have a hardship exemption where, if people can't afford to buy health care, you exempt them so that you sort of don't count them." Let's contrast those comments with what Obama said on CBS News on July 17, 2009, after Democrats in the House of Representatives unveiled legislation that includes a mandate. "Do you believe that each individual American should be required to have health insurance?" asked Jonathan LaPook, an M.D. and a medical correspondent for CBS News. "I have come to that conclusion," Obama said. "During the campaign I was opposed to this idea because my general attitude was the reason people don't have health insurance is not because they don't want it, it's because they can't afford it. And if you make it affordable, then they'll come. I am now in favor of some sort of individual mandate as long as there's a hardship exemption." Obama said a hardship exemption should protect people who truly can't afford the required coverage. We will agree that there's a technical argument to be made that Obama is still concerned with not punishing people for not having enough money to buy health insurance. But it's hard to take that argument seriously when Obama used the issue of the individual mandate to wallop Hillary Clinton with negative ads. "Hillary Clinton's attacking, but what's she not telling you about her health care plan? It forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can't afford it, and you pay a penalty if you don't," said one of his television ads . His mailings made similar claims, which we rated Half True . At one campaign stop, Clinton waived the mailers and declared, "Shame on you, Barack Obama!" "Meet me in Ohio," she added. "Let's have a debate about your tactics and your behavior in this campaign." Obama was vigorous in his attacks on Clinton for including an indvidual mandate in her plan. Now that the Democrats in the House have included a mandate in health reform legislation, he's fine with it. He admitted he changed position in the interview with CBS. Full Flop!

pomt-12473	"Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/04/donald-trump/trumps-false-claim-dems-want-billions-go-insurance/	President Donald Trump has claimed the reason Democratic lawmakers support the Affordable Care Act is to reward their political patrons in the health insurance industry. "Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors," Trump said in an April 30 Tweet. Trump’s remarks come as Republicans in Congress attempt to undo and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare. Trump’s reference to a "bail out," according to experts, reflects a longstanding Republican epithet for Obamacare subsidies paid to insurers participating in government-run marketplaces. In fact, in recent remarks, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared to use the term "bailout" synonymously with cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs. "There’s absolutely no language in this bill that requires us to make any Obamacare bailout payments, any CSR payments of any way, shape or form as a result of this deal, okay?" Mulvaney said in a May 2 budget briefing with reporters. Trump’s comment raises several questions we’ve decided to investigate. To what extent are health insurance companies Democratic donors? Do Democrats in fact want billions to go to these companies? And do Obamacare subsidies amount to a kickback from Democrats to health insurers? Are health insurance companies Democratic donors? Strictly speaking, health insurance companies do give to both parties. Several experts told us the industry views this as a strategic hedge. "Insurers largely balance their political donations to reflect whichever political party is more (or less) in power, because their primary objective is to ‘stay in business’ pragmatically under the best terms available," said Thomas Miller, an American Enterprise Institute fellow. "It's more a matter of the price of doing (political) business than any consistent ideological commitment in either direction." But explicitly calling insurance companies Democratic donors, as Trump did, gives the impression the industry has a clear partisan bias toward Democrats. Is that the case? According to recent political spending, the opposite is true. Significantly more industry money has flowed to Republicans than Democrats over roughly the past decade. In fact, from the period starting in 2007 just before the Obamacare debate began in earnest through the first years of its implementation, financial data suggests insurers tried to undermine Democrats as they sought to reform the health care system. From 2007 through August 2012, the 11 largest health insurance companies and their biggest trade group gave $10.2 million to federal politicians, with two-thirds going to Republicans who opposed Obamacare or supported its repeal, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Over the past five election cycles, the two biggest health insurance associations have given significantly more to Republicans than Democrats, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in U.S. politics. Since 2008, the National Association of Health Underwriters PAC gave $2.4 million to Republicans and $899,600 to Democrats, while America's Health Insurance Plans PAC gave $637,500 to Republicans and $563,700 to Democrats. Political donations over this same period by the insurance industry as a whole also favors Republicans, who’ve received $158 million compared to $96 million to Democrats, though this particular data is only modestly helpful, because it also includes companies that provide property, life and car insurance. Sherry Glied, dean of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service, said ever since Democrats came under fire for health care reform efforts in the 1990s, they’ve been more concerned with provoking the industry’s ire than receiving its largesse. "Most Democrats are mainly concerned about anti-reform lobbying by insurers, not pro-reform contributions," she said. So Trump’s attempt to paint Democrats as industry clients grossly distorts reality. Do Democrats want billions to go to insurance companies? Again, strictly speaking, Democrats do want billions to go to health insurance companies -- but not for the reason Trump claims. Obamacare does in fact contain mechanisms designed to transfer federal money -- indeed, billions of dollars per year -- to insurance companies. The government set up the system this way to tackle a complex challenge: how to make a health insurance marketplace that's affordable for lower-income people buying insurance on their own, as well as providing stability for insurance companies facing the uncertainty of a newly-regulated market that makes insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions. "The entire structure (was designed) to create an individual insurance market that could serve a population that included sick people as well as healthy people," said Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management. This structure is expensive to maintain. Practically speaking, Obamacare will transfer an estimated $49 billion in federal money to private insurance companies this year, and another $63 billion in 2018, according to the CBO. The bulk of 2017 funding -- $38 billion -- goes to lowering premiums for lower-income Americans who buy their own insurance. The remaining $11 billion will reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses, while helping to stabilize the individual market. So given that Obamacare subsidies are an essential part of a reformed health care system that has seen an estimated 20 million people gain coverage, there’s an element of truth to Trump’s claim that Democrats want billions to go to health insurance companies. Do Obamacare subsidies amount to kickback from Democrats to health insurers? So what to make of Trump’s insinuation that Obamacare subsidies amount to a venal quid-pro-quo, a kind of kickback from Democrats to their health insurance patrons? Several experts we talked to said this claim essentially turns the Affordable Care Act on its head. "These transfers relate to specific ways the ACA was designed to subsidize low income consumers and provide market stability in the first few years," said Katherine Hempstead, Senior Advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "I have never heard of any relationship between these components of the ACA and any kind of political donations." Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management, said Trump’s tweet echoed a familiar attack line by Obamacare critics. "The notion that these payments to insurers reflect campaign contributions strikes me as absurd and a continuation of attempts to undermine the ACA by attacking payments to insurers," Ginsburg said. Other experts found Trump’s explanation of Democrats’ support for Obamacare risible. "It is absurd to say that Democrats support premium tax credits or cost sharing reductions to reward donors," said Timothy Jost, a health care policy expert at Washington & Lee law school. "The money is to cover low-income Americans who are not big political donors." The argument that Obamacare is a giveaway to insurers is undermined by provisions Democrats placed in the law to specifically limit corporate profits and subject insurance companies to financial scrutiny, said Glied of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service. An Obamacare regulation known as the 80-20 Rule, for example, stipulates that under certain plans, for every $1 an insurance company takes in from premiums, at least $0.80 has to be spent on health care. In other words, the maximum profits a company could make under this rule is 20 percent of the revenue it collects from premiums. This scenario describes a company with a so-called medical loss ratio, or MLR, of 80 percent -- the amount being paid out for health care. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, it’s unlikely insurers can be profitable when MLRs exceed 85-90 percent. That matters because if subsidies given to insurance companies participating in Obamacare exchanges were supposed to be a kickback, as Trump claims, the kickback hasn’t worked very well in recent years. "Many companies participating in the individual market – where most of the major market reforms took place in 2014 – experienced substantial losses in this market in the early years of reform," according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Instead of viewing Democrats and insurers as being engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo, some experts we talked to suggested a softer kind of symbiosis is at play. "The better explanation is that Democrats and insurers needed each other," said Miller of the American Enterprise Institute. "The ACA could not work tolerably without the active involvement, and adequate profitability, of private insurers. Both sides reached short term accommodations, even though their longer term interests were not fully parallel in all respects." Glied of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service expressed a similar view. "I think the Democrats are well aware that they need the cooperation of the industry to make the plan work, since the plan does rely on private insurance," she said. "They need the cost-sharing reductions because otherwise the industry is not going to participate in the market and people won't have any coverage." "That's not pandering," Glied added, "it's common sense." Our ruling Trump said, "Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors." Democrats do want billions to go to health insurance companies -- but not for the reason Trump claims. Their cooperation has been essential to the functioning of the health care system set up by the Affordable Care Act. Trump’s suggestion that Democrats are engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo involving Obamacare subsidies in exchange for campaign contributions is patently absurd, health care experts said, particularly given that industry donations over the past decade show a clear bias in favor of Republicans.

pomt-01864	"I co-sponsored the Rebuild America Jobs Act" for transportation and infrastructure.	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/11/jeff-merkley/did-us-sen-jeff-merkley-co-sponsor-rebuild-america/	U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s race against Republican challenger Monica Wehby is already featuring heated back-and-forths on an issue that could be pivotal in November -- the economy. As Oregon continues its recovery from the Great Recession, both candidates are making claims about what could have been done -- and what should be done -- to improve the situation. The claim: U.S. Senate Democrats, responding to a call from President Barack Obama, tried in late November 2011 to pass the Rebuild America Jobs Act. The bill called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. Ultimately, the bill died when Democrats failed to muster enough votes to break a Republican filibuster. Merkley, in a recent position statement on jobs and the economy, reiterated his support for the bill, saying it would have created living-wage jobs for Oregon families and financed much needed transportation projects. He added, "I co-sponsored the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that." We wondered if that was true. The analysis: It’s old news that the act died along largely partisan lines, when Democrats were unable to round up the 60 votes needed to over the filibuster. So we focused on Merkley’s claim of co-sponsorship. We checked with GovTrack.us, a non-partisan website that draws from a number of sources to help people find and track bills in Congress. An overview of the bill, formally numbered S. 1769, showed it was introduced Oct. 31, 2011, by U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and reported to committee the next day. A secondary link showed that the bill had 17 original co-sponsors, ranging alphabetically from Sen. Mark Begich, D-AK to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. Six more senators, including Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell, signed on as co-sponsors in the following 10 days. Among those 23 senators, Merkley’s name was noticeably absent. Since that was at odds with his recent position statement, we emailed his office and asked about the discrepancy. Lindsey O’Brien, Merkley’s press secretary, acknowledged that listing the senator as a co-sponsor was incorrect. In an email, she attributed the error to an "editing mistake." She added, however, that he stands by the act’s intent. "Sen. Merkley was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act," O’Brien wrote. "He advocated for it on the floor of the Senate, and was proud to support because it meant more middle-class jobs for Oregonians." The senator’s position piece, she said, should have read: "I was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that." In a floor speech, delivered Nov. 2, 2011, Merkley spoke at length in favor of the bill. Nowhere did he mention being one of its co-sponsors. The ruling: Merkley, in an "issues" statement on jobs and the economy, said his support for a major 2011 infrastructure spending bill was so strong that he signed on as one of the act’s co-sponsors. Merkley did deliver a floor speech promoting the supposed benefits of the failed Rebuild America Jobs Act, but nowhere does his name appear as one of the proposal’s 23 co-sponsors. His campaign staff admitted the assertion was a mistake and sent along revised language characterizing Merkley not as a co-sponsor of the act, but as a "vocal supporter." Based on the original submission, however, we rate the senator’s claim False. Comments? Questions? Click over to our entry on OregonLive.com and let us know what you think.

pomt-07130	"Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/16/mitt-romney/500-billion-medicare-obamacare-romney-says/	Mitt Romney keeps making the case that the health care plan he put into place in Massachusetts is substantially different from the health care law signed by President Barack Obama. At a debate in New Hampshire on Monday June 13, 2011, Romney continued that theme. One difference was, he said, that his state plan didn't make any changes to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly. "Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare," Romney said. We've written about how the health care law affects Medicare many times, but Romney made his point in a new way, so we decided to put his statement to the Truth-O-Meter. To begin with, the Massachusetts plan and the federal plan are conceptually similar. Both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help people with moderate incomes buy insurance. Individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance to employees have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. Romney's point was that the Massachusetts plan didn't change Medicare, the health insurance program for people over age 65. We should note that Medicare is a federal program; states can't change it anyway. So don't give the Massachusetts plan too much credit on the point. The national health care reform law, though, made several changes to Medicare, which makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. In a few cases, the law actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover prevention services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is sometimes called the doughnut hole). Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care, in ways including reducing hospital re-admissions. The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare. Still, where does the $500 billion in future savings come from? Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Romney said, "Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare." The law doesn't literally take money out of Medicare, but Romney isn't entirely wrong in his point, either. That's because in creating the law, Democrats wanted to make sure they did not increase the federal deficit. The savings from Medicare offset new spending resulting from the health care bill. The major new spending in the bill comes from tax credits to help people of modest incomes buy health insurance and from expanding Medicaid to offer coverage to the poor. The tax credits and other cost-sharing subsidies are estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, while the Medicaid expansion costs $434 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those two initiatives add up to more than $500 billion. So in addition to reducing Medicare spending, the law also increases Medicare taxes on the wealthy and creates new fees for the health care industry, as well as a few other things, to come up with the needed sums. Romney said, "Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare." He's right that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law. But the way he phrases it gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it. In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then applied to costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05365	Says he did not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/09/joe-donnelly/donnelly-says-he-didnt-vote-pelosi-speaker/	Democrat Joe Donnelly, who will face a tea party-backed candidate in Indiana’s U.S. Senate contest, is having to answer questions about his political loyalties -- specifically to Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader who is a lightning rod of conservative criticism. Indiana’s Republican Party Chairman, Eric Holcomb, linked Donnelly’s politics to Pelosi’s following an Indiana Democratic Party fundraiser headlined by Pelosi on May 5, 2012. "Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi – they all have one thing in common and that is records that are out of step with Indiana," Holcomb said, according to Indiana Public Media. Donnelly, who has served in the House since 2006, responded by saying, "Well, I did not vote for her for speaker and so, you know, my focus is on the Senate race, what we’re doing here and on job creation." The Club for Growth, a conservative Washington group backing Donnelly opponent Richard Mourdock, immediately pounced, sending out a statement pointing to Donnelly’s votes for House Speaker in 2007 and 2009. We decided to sort it out. About the election The Senate race in Indiana is getting national attention after Mourdock defeated six-term Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican known for being willing to work with Democrats. Mourdock, the former Indiana state treasurer, ran on a message demonizing bipartisanship. He beat Lugar by 20 points. Many political analysts think Democrats have a better chance of winning the seat now that the race pits a tea party conservative against Donnelly, a moderate who favors gun rights and abortion restrictions. When he ran for re-election in 2010, Donnelly touted his credentials as an independent who opposed Pelosi on immigration and climate legislation. But did he vote for her? The Club for Growth cited House records of Donnelly’s votes in 2007 and 2009. They leave no doubt: Donnelly voted for Pelosi to be speaker of the House. In 2011, however, he pulled his support and voted for Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina. In voting for Shuler, Donnelly said, "This afternoon, I cast my vote for Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina for speaker of the House in the 112th Congress. I supported my friend Congressman Shuler over former Speaker Nancy Pelosi during our party's leadership elections in November citing a need for new leadership. This need remains the same. What the voters told us in the 2010 election was that they wanted a change. And I believe a moderate approach with a dedication to working across the aisle, something I know is important to both me and Congressman Shuler, is the best way forward." Republicans won a majority in the House in 2010 and elected John Boehner of Ohio to the speaker’s post. Pelosi still won a majority of her colleagues’ support (Shuler received only 11 votes) and was elected House minority leader. Our ruling It’s true that in the most recent House election, he voted for someone else. But in the two previous votes -- the ones in which Democrats held a majority and had the power to choose the speaker -- Donnelly supported for Pelosi. His statement ignored those two votes. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Joe Donnelly	None	None	None	2012-05-09T17:34:19	2012-05-07	['Nancy_Pelosi']

pomt-00512	On Common Core.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/24/chris-christie/christie-says-parent-and-teacher-complaints-prompt/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s recent changes to the state’s education policy don’t exactly quell rumors that he plans to enter the 2016 GOP presidential field. On May 28, Christie announced the end of the existing Common Core standards in New Jersey. "It's now been five years since Common Core was adopted. And the truth is that it's simply not working," he said. "Instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating new ones." This is not the first time critics have accused Christie of flip-flopping on Common Core -- the state-based educational standards aimed at improving students readiness for college and workplace. (Read our past fact-checks of claims and flops relating to Common Core.) Christie’s decision to nix Common Core is not unexpected, but it is notable considering his initial stance in support of the standards. "This is one of those areas where I’ve agreed more with the the president than not," Christie said in 2011, a year after he implemented them in New Jersey. With an upcoming presidential campaign seeming increasingly likely, we decided to check how Christie’s position on Common Core registers on our Flip-O-Meter. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether they did. Christie in support of Common Core Common Core was set into motion in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Christie signed off on the standards, and New Jersey adopted them in 2010. In September 2011, the Christie administration and New Jersey acting Education Commissioner Chris Cerf worked to implement the standards. Christie praised Common Core standards as "a building block in our state’s education system meant to ensure that teachers and districts can innovate within a framework of high expectations and accountability." Common Core Standards were set to be implemented over a three-year period, and the state Department of Education offered 300 presentations within the first year to provide educators with information about the new initiative. In August 2013, Christie maintained a positive view of the standards. "We’re doing Common Core in New Jersey and are going to continue," he said. He attributed majority Republican opposition to the standards as a "knee-jerk reaction … that if the president likes something, the Republicans in Congress don’t." Christie in opposition to Common Core Christie’s 180-degree turn on Common Core occurred in slow-motion. In December 2014 he said in an NJTV interview, "I have real concerns about the Common Core." Then in February 2015, he expressed "grave concerns about the way this has been done, especially the way the (Obama) administration has tried to implement it through tying federal funding to these things." Christie stated publicly that Common Core was "in the midst of re-examination" in New Jersey. We’ve fact-checked several claims that Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It’s not. Rather, Christie is referring to the Obama administration using the promise of federal funding to incentivize adoption of Common Core standards. But, despite improving the state’s chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards, Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program. Nonetheless, on May 28, 2015, Christie made the full switch, saying the standards have "brought confusion and frustration to parents. I’ve heard it every day. It’s brought distance between our teachers and the communities where they work, and instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating morale problems in those classrooms and at home." Christie’s spokesperson pointed to a document released prior to the governor’s speech on May 28, 2015. The document outlines various efforts Christie made throughout 2014 to canvass the state’s educators and parents about their experiences with Common Core after its three-year implementation that began in 2011. In July 2014 he established a study commission to review, among other student assessments, Common Core. Then, in November 2014, Christie announced that he was in the midst of evaluating the Core’s effectiveness. Christie attributed his change of heart in May 2015 to the negative feedback he received from the aforementioned study commission and educators’ reviews. In an interview on June 7 on CBS’s Face the Nation, Christie said, "I’m changing because I gave it four years to work … but in four years, we did not have educators or parents buy into the Common Core." However, there is one element of the standard’s implementation he’s not phasing out: PARCC testing. Christie has said PARCC testing will continue, and those tests were developed in line with Common Core standards. "PARCC is a set of assessments meant to test progressions to the standards," stated Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. She added, "the tests have been developed separately but are meant to align with the Common Core." Our ruling Christie was a supporter of Common Core, but five years following its implementation he has become a critic. He attributes his changed stance to negative reviews from educators and parents within the state. We rate his change of position a Full Flop.

pomt-12441	"(Charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in a greater capacity than the public school systems."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/may/13/nate-walker/missouri-charter-schools-arent-failing/	Since the confirmation hearing for U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, charter schools have been under increased scrutiny. In Missouri, charter schools have only been built in Kansas City and St. Louis, but a bill now before the legislature may make it easier for the schools to pop up in other towns. On March 17, the Missouri House of Representatives narrowly passed and sent House Bill 634 to the Senate to allow for the expansion of charter schools. One legislator who didn’t vote in favor for House Bill 634 was Rep. Nate Walker. The Republican from Kirksville told MissouriNet that Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, tried to persuade him to change his mind, but Walker wouldn’t budge. One reason, Walker said, was because "(charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in greater capacity than public school systems." But are they? Walker didn’t provide a definition for what he meant by failing, and the Missouri education department doesn’t have a specific definition, either. However, after looking at the education department's performance reviews, the data shows that charter schools are performing about the same as nearby public schools. Definitions of failing When PolitiFact called Walker and asked him where he got his data, he said he got it from a "lot of different things," and began providing some numbers. "Sixty-four percent of Missouri Charter Schools have failed or are failing," he said, without citing the source of these statistics. "Since 1999, we’ve had 59 charter schools open in the state. Thirty-eight of the 59 charter schools have failed or are failing students." However, according to the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, for the 2016-17 year there were 72 individual charter schools within 39 charter school districts. And since 1999, the year after charter school law was enacted, there have been 63 charter school districts, and 21 — or 33 percent — have closed. When we asked Walker in a phone interview what his definition was for "failing," this was his response: "Well, they’re not meeting the standards of the (education department). You go check the facts, I’m not a reporter. You’ve got a degree in journalism and understand factual information, but I stand by my comments, and all you need to do is go do your research and find I’m absolutely right. Probably more than right." We went to the education department to learn more. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the department, wrote in an email, "There are no parameters in state statute for a ‘failing’ charter school." However, the department does issue an Annual Performance Review score for both charter and traditional public schools to determine how well they’re educating the students. Charter schools are independent public schools freed from certain regulations. They are also subject to other rules defined by their contracts with their sponsors, such as universities, who then hold charter schools accountable for their results instead of the state. This performance review takes into account standardized test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates along with financial status and leadership stability. There are four levels of accreditation. "Accredited with Distinction" and "Accredited" signify that the school or district is meeting performance standards. Schools or districts must earn a 70 percent or higher on their performance review to earn those classifications. "Provisionally Accredited" and "Unaccredited" indicate that the school or district isn’t meeting performance standards and earned a performance review score below 70 percent and below 50 percent, respectively. In fact, in our phone interview with Walker, he did mention accreditation, saying: "Of the 38 charter schools (districts) currently open for business, 11 have been deemed Provisionally Accredited, six would have been deemed Unaccredited and four were too new to receive a score. Right now 46 percent of the active charter schools would be classified as Accredited." These numbers are correct — though there were 39 districts and not 38 as Walker said — according to the latest data available at the state education department’s website. For comparison, 99 percent of traditional public school districts earned Accredited or above while only 46 percent of charter school districts earned that status. It’s not looking so good for Missouri charter schools. Charter schools vs. traditional public schools Not so fast, said Doug Thaman, the executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association. "One of the concerns we have is that when statements are made like (the one) Walker made, that’s a comparison of charter schools to an entire school district, and that is just not a true comparison," he said. "You can’t compare a single school to an entire district or to the entire state." What Thaman means is that performance scores are assigned to both individual schools and the districts in which several schools reside, and the scores are often different. He also pointed out that charter schools, which have to accept any student who applies, often educate lower-performing students whose needs haven't been met by traditional public schools, so charter schools score poorly on the performance review because they're helping students who score below grade level catch up. Thaman suggested it would be better to compare the performance score of individual charter schools to individual competitor public schools within the same district. So we did. In Kansas City, the charter schools reside inside public school district Kansas City 33, which had an overall performance score of 70 percent, which is also the lowest score to earn an Accredited or above rating. Both the Kansas City charter schools and traditional public schools in the district had 32 sites that were assigned a performance score in the 2015-16 school year, But more individual charter schools — 21— were performing at or above district’s rate of 70 percent than individual public schools — 12. And even when you compare charter school districts’ performance scores to Kansas City 33’s performance score, over 60 percent of the charter school districts meets or exceeds the district's score. So overall, it appears that most charter schools in Kansas City are doing just fine when compared to Kansas City 33 district and its schools. Now let’s take a look at St. Louis. This one is a little harder to compare because the public school district the charter schools are located within — the St. Louis City district — has 71 sites with performance scores, compared to only 22 charter school sites. St. Louis City district has an overall performance score of 74.6 percent. Just as with Kansas City, it appears that individual St. Louis charter schools are performing about the same as their public school counterparts. Fifty percent of charter schools and 48 percent of public schools earned an Accredited rating, or a 70 percent performance score. However, when comparing districts’ scores, the scales tip toward the public schools. St. Louis City district has an overall score of 74.6 percent. Nine charter school districts, or 56 percent, score below that. However, 57 percent of the traditional public schools fall below their districts’ performance rate. Our ruling Rep. Walker said, "(Charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in a greater capacity than the public school systems." Neither Walker nor the education department gave a definition for a failing charter school. And although charter school districts performance scores are nowhere near the 99 percent of public school districts that are Accredited, current charter schools are performing on par with with the public schools in their city. Walker’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-13289	Says Patrick Murphy "supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/11/national-rifle-association/patrick-murphy-wants-ban-commonly-owned-guns-nra-s/	The National Rifle Association is firing allegations at U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, saying the Democratic Senate hopeful wants to take away voters’ guns. The gun rights group’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, attacked Murphy in a mailer we received on Oct. 4, 2016. The flier listed several reasons why Murphy is against guns. "Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense," one of the items read. That sounds like Murphy, now running against incumbent Marco Rubio for U.S. Senate, wants to make it illegal to own a wide range of weapons, so we zeroed in on that statement. ‘Military-style weapons of war’ Murphy has been an advocate of stricter gun control, especially in the wake of the June 12, 2016, mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others using a semi-automatic rifle and handgun. Murphy called for keeping "assault weapons out of the hands of dangerous people." In an August 2016 candidate survey, Murphy told the Tampa Bay Times he does not believe "that civilians need access to military-style assault weapons." In September, he told the Orlando Sentinel he agreed with the families of the Pulse victims who wanted Congress to ban weapons like the rifle Mateen used. Murphy said the government should "keep military-style weapons of war out of our communities and out of the hands of criminals and terrorists." Murphy’s campaign did not provide any specifics about what types of guns, other than to call them "military-style assault rifles" and "dangerous weapons of war." Technically there’s no true definition of what makes a particular rifle an "assault weapon." There’s no clear, legal interpretation of any of the descriptions Murphy and other gun control advocates are using, giving the NRA wide berth in its attack. Put simply, the term "semi-automatic" refers to any firearm designed to fire one bullet with one trigger squeeze, then automatically reload the chamber and be ready to fire again. This is different from an automatic weapon, in which squeezing the trigger once fires multiple times until the shooter lets go. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted in the United States since 1934. Regulations put in place in 1986 made it much more difficult for civilian buyers to get an automatic weapon. Experts told us that while legislators have struggled for decades to find a universal term that fits the mold, in general that means so-called black rifles that look like a soldier’s weapon. These include rifles that have pistol grips, high-capacity magazines, bayonet lugs to fix edged weapons, flash suppressors at the end of the barrel and so forth. The NRA-ILA told us Murphy and others usually are referring to rifles similar to the AR-15, which is a derivative of a rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. (The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for "assault rifle.") There are somewhere between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in circulation in the United States. The NRA routinely refers to this style of semi-automatic weapon — used in shootings in Aurora, Colo.; Roseburg, Ore.; San Bernadino, Calif.; and Newtown, Conn. — as a "modern sporting rifle." One of Mateen’s weapons in the Pulse shooting, a Sig Sauer MCX, is similar in style to an AR-15 but not the same design. Internally, however, the consumer versions of these rifles basically work the same as any other semi-automatic rifle. Cartridges are fed from magazines and are fired one at a time with each trigger pull. They are used for self-defense and recreational shooting, just as the NRA said. About half of all guns are semi-automatic. Handguns are far more prevalent in crimes. The 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, for example, were committed with two semi-automatic handguns, a Glock 19 and Walther P22, she said. Mateen also used a Glock 17 pistol. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas at Dallas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, said many lawmakers resort to focusing on specific makes and models that usually are both semi-automatic and considered military in appearance. That’s what the 1994-2004 federal assault weapons ban did. Kovandzic said in the research he’s seen, these types of "assault weapons" are used in less than 2 percent of gun crimes. Of course, the NRA words the claim in such a way that there could be some confusion about Murphy’s wishes. While Murphy is focusing on rifles that are arguably only cosmetically different, his intention is a bit obscured by the mailer. "He may want to ban some semi-automatic weapons," UCLA constitutional law professor Adam Winkler said, "but he doesn’t want to ban all semi-automatic weapons." Our ruling The NRA-ILA said, "Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense." Murphy has called for a ban on ill-defined "military-style weapons of war" and "assault weapons." His campaign didn’t specify further which guns, but these political terms usually refer to rifles used in some mass shootings with mostly cosmetic differences from other semi-automatic rifles. These rifles, often based on the AR-15, are used by owners in the way the NRA describes. But the mailer could be construed as saying Murphy wants to take away most, if not all, semi-automatic firearms, which Murphy denies. Their statement is slightly off the mark, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f846a250-ebaa-424b-91b2-838df31df173	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2016-10-11T08:00:00	2016-10-04	['None']
pomt-11655	On requiring young people to perform national service.	full flop	/texas/statements/2018/jan/10/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-flip-flops-requiring-public-service-y/	We galloped to fact-check a claim that the Democratic congressman seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Ted Cruz wants every young American to work a year for the government. But while we were looking into that, the candidate, Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, said that he’d made a mistake in describing the envisioned service as "mandatory." O’Rourke’s declaration led us to shift from solely verifying what he’d originally advocated to rolling out the PolitiFact Texas Flip-O-Meter, which gauges shifts in position. Candidate extols mandatory service O’Rourke, who’s been making web-casted campaign stops around Texas, piped up in favor of a national service mandate while speaking in Corsicana Jan. 4, 2018. As noted in a Jan. 5, 2018, KSAT-TV news story, O’Rourke specified there that he hopes to introduce legislation this year requiring all young Americans to spend at least a year "in service to this country." Some context: His campaign’s Facebook Live post of O’Rourke’s remarks shows that O’Rourke edged toward airing his interest in mandatory national service after an audience member asked: "How do we meet the challenge of the increasing wealth gap?" O’Rourke responded, in part, by mentioning his concerns about Republican-passed federal tax changes. He also talked up improved access to higher education before turning to requiring national service, saying: "One last idea on this--and I’m trying to find a Republican colleague--and I may have one, and I hope to announce it soon--who will help me to introduce this into the Congress this year. "And that is a national service bill that will require every young person, no matter how wealthy or how poor, to spend at least a year of their lives in service to this country, in a military unit, in a conservation corps unit, in a medical unit, in a teaching unit, in some way that they’re going to help to make this country better and stronger and have to sacrifice together and leave that with a shared understanding of who we are as a people--and no kid is going to be rich enough to buy their way out of it and no kid (interrupted by applause)." Co-sponsorship of a measure O’Rourke had already embraced the idea of expanding national service. A web search led us to learn that in June 2017, O’Rourke was among more than 150 House co-sponsors of the America’s Call To Improve Opportunities Now for National Service Act filed by Rep. John B. Larson, D-Conn. That legislation doesn’t require any Americans to perform government service. Still, Owen Dodd in Larson’s office emailed us a summary stating the proposal would result in at least a million government-linked "service opportunities" and reward "young people who serve two full terms of service" with four years of their home state’s average in-state tuition. The resulting program, the summary says, would "help the nation address priorities in education, infrastructure, healthcare, disaster relief and poverty." Another mention of mandating service We spotted one other recent instance of O’Rourke speculating about mandatory service. In September 2017, he said in an interview with The Daily Texan, the student newspaper at the University of Texas, that improved college affordability could lead young Texans to return to their home communities after college. O’Rourke then said that compulsory national service might be appropriate: "Maybe a next step is a national service program, which gives everyone the opportunity, or maybe compels young people to spend a year or two improving their communities. And in exchange for that, there is the ability again to pursue higher education, or training, or an apprenticeship or certification. And again, it doesn’t have to be a traditional four-year college, and it doesn’t have to be for the 18-year-old. It could be for that 52-year-old who was just laid off from that peanut-packing plant in Plainview, Texas, who needs a little bit of help getting that next job. And if she needs help getting that online course, certification, the credentials that she needs, she is going to be able to do that. I think all of that should be part of the conversation in college affordability or higher education affordability." Reversal: ‘I made a mistake’ In Corsicana, then, O’Rourke revealed his plans to offer a mandatory national service measure. But a few days later, O’Rourke said that he’d gone too far in saying that national service should be "mandatory." "That is a word that has concerned a lot of you," O’Rourke said about three minutes into his Jan. 8, 2018 remarks livestreamed on Facebook. "And I’ve got to tell you, you’re right. "I think I got way out in front of this without having the necessary conversation," O’Rourke said, "without listening to enough of you about if you were serving as a teacher, if you were serving in the VA, if you were clearing trails in a conservation corps, if you were serving in the military, if you were doing some kind of service that helps to make your country stronger, your community better -- that, that allows us all to have some sense of shared purpose and sacrifice in this country. "You know," O’Rourke went on, "talking about this being a requirement for everybody, that’s a few steps beyond the conversation that we’ve had already. So I want to tell you that I’ve heard you and that I’m listening to you--and I think I made a mistake without having listened to enough people and really had the conversation we need to have about what this would look like, getting so far out ahead on an issue." After watching the video, we inquired into O’Rourke’s up-to-date position on national service. An O’Rourke campaign spokesman, Chris Evans, replied by email: "He does not plan on introducing a bill to require mandatory national service. Texans made their voices heard and he is listening to them." Our ruling In January 2018, O’Rourke said he soon planned to file a proposal mandating at least a year of national service for all young Americans. A few days later, O’Rourke called his pitch for that mandate a mistake and, we confirmed, dropped plans to file a measure requiring national service. We rate this shift a FULL FLOP.

pomt-12485	Regarding the surgery that saved Jimmy Kimmel's son, "Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/02/margaret-hoover/cnns-margaret-hoover-corrects-claim-kimmel-surgery/	On CNN, a panel of commentators discussed some of the health-policy issues surrounding Jimmy Kimmel’s revelation the night before that his newborn had to have surgery for a rare heart defect. In a video clip that went viral, Kimmel devoted the monologue of his ABC late-night show to telling the story of the birth of his son, Billy. Shortly after he was born, doctors discovered a serious congenital heart defect known as tetralogy of Fallot. The doctors were able to operate on Billy, and their efforts appear to be successful, though additional surgeries may eventually be needed. In addition to drawing widespread popular interest in his son’s story, Kimmel touched on the current debate over whether or how to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. In the monologue, he urged lawmakers not to return Americans to the days before the law, when a pre-existing condition -- like his son’s -- could prevent you from securing health insurance. "If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make," Kimmel said. "I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?" Kimmel’s monologue inspired a discussion of health care policy on a CNN segment moderated by anchor Kate Bolduan the following day. At one point, CNN commentator Margaret Hoover noted that, for all the concern about Kimmel’s situation, poor families would be less likely than a celebrity to have access to a world-class surgical team. Referring to the Kimmel surgery, she said, "Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service. Our health care system is broken, and the poorest of us cannot afford it." We wondered whether she was correct, so we started contacting experts. Before we could finish our research, Hoover emailed us to say that she had misspoken. "The point I had intended to make was that poorer families, especially those who have received health coverage under the ACA, have largely received it through Medicaid expansion, which increasingly isn't accepted at hospitals," she said in an email. "Sadly, in an emotional segment, I misspoke," Hoover told us. Hoover said she realized she had said something wrong when she began seeing criticism in her Twitter mentions. Hoover tweeted a correction shortly after our email exchange: "Correction to misspeaking w/ @KateBolduan: I accidentally said Medicaid has stopped providing ‘that kind of service.’ … Point I intended to make was that hospitals increasingly don’t accept Medicaid. … Which means poor families have a harder time getting Kimmel’s level of care already." For the record, the experts we contacted agreed that Medicaid has not done anything to cut off its beneficiaries from complex pediatric surgeries like the one Kimmel’s son underwent. Hoover’s initial remark on CNN was "totally incorrect," said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. In fact, she said, "Medicaid is the major source of health insurance coverage for children’s hospitals and the specialized services they offer." MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, added that Medicaid covers a broad range of services for children under its Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit, called EPSDT. Any state that accepts Medicaid funding must offer EPSDT to children from birth through age 21, she said. As a practical matter, this means that Medicaid must cover necessary services for children’s physical or mental health, even if that service is not covered by Medicaid for adults in that state, she said. At PolitiFact, our policy is to correct a speaker’s original misstatement while noting subsequent corrections by the speaker. Hoover, for her part, did have a point when she mentioned the relative lack of access for Medicaid beneficiaries. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while 85 percent of physicians accepted new patients with private insurance, only 69 percent accepted new patients with Medicaid. Hoover pointed to this column, by Scott W. Atlas, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, to support her point. "People on Medicaid have more challenges accessing specialists than the privately insured, and the more high-tech and innovative, the more challenging that may be," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Our ruling Hoover said that, regarding the surgery that saved Kimmel’s son, "Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service." That’s wrong -- Medicaid does cover this kind of service, and indeed, the federal-state program is a key source of reimbursement for children’s hospitals. Hoover quickly acknowledged that she was wrong and tweeted a correction. We rate Hoover’s original claim False.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., say he wanted to "beat the living crap out of" his Republican opponent during a debate with his Republican opponent, Republican Patrick Morrisey? The West Virginia Republican Party says so. On Nov. 3, the West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "What did Joe Manchin say about civility? Today, he said he wanted to ‘beat the living crap out of’ his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet. #WVSen" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet linked to an article in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, that included verbatim text from the campaign appearance in Marmet, W.Va., as well as an audio clip. Here’s what Manchin said: "You might have seen the debate the other night. (Applause) I want to tell you something. It took every bit of my discipline not to beat the living crap out of them. You don't come to someone's state. You don't come in here and not knowing who we are and just be spewing out horrible things. Every other word was trust, liberal, trust, dishonest, and I'm thinking, ‘Trust?' Here's a man who ran for Congress, Patrick Morrisey ran for Congress in New Jersey in 2000. He ran in the primary and got beat, only got 9 percent of the vote. Who trusts who?" Morrissey picked up on the "beat the living crap" remark, tweeting that "the national media should look at so-called Mr. Civility in action." But the West Virginia Republican Party’s tweet twisted Manchin’s words by not reporting his entire remark. In Marmet, Manchin did express his frustration with Morrisey’s attacks in the recent debate -- enough frustration to feel an impulse to "beat the living crap out of" his opponent. But the tweet leaves out an element of what Manchin said -- that "it took every bit of my discipline" not to do it. In other words, by the time he was speaking in Marmet, he had already extinguished that impulse. That said, even what Manchin did say does seem to conflict with a prior pledge in favor of civility. In February 2018, Manchin took to the Senate floor to pledge "an era of bipartisan cooperation and agreement in order to restore civility to the United States Senate and our political discourse." Manchin urged his colleagues to join him in co-signing his pledge and "taking the first step to show the American people that they are here to work towards a better United States." Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "What did Joe Manchin say about civility? Today, he said he wanted to ‘beat the living crap out of’ his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet. #WVSen" This uses a portion of Manchin’s remarks, leaving out the fact that Manchin had prefaced that comment by saying, "It took every bit of my discipline not to" beat up Morrisey. That said, even the substance of what Manchin did say conflicts with a high-profile civility pledge he made in February 2018. The tweet needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07119	"A couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/19/michael-cutler/immigration-expert-says-hundreds-us-cities-have-be/	For years, Southwestern states, particularly Arizona, have been trying to reduce the porosity of the Mexican-United States border, in part to control the flow of illegal drugs coming into the country. Most of us are aware that drugs make their way to our region via Mexico and that the Mexican cartels are ruthless. But in the Northeast that threat seems relatively remote. So we were intrigued when Michael Cutler made one of his regular appearances on WHJJ's "Helen Glover Show" and suggested that the cartels now have a serious presence in hundreds of U.S. cities. Cutler spent 30 years with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (most of them as a criminal investigator) and is a fellow with Californians for Population Stabilization, which wants to limit both legal and illegal immigration in that state. "A couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels, which, by the way, have been responsible for about 35 or 36 thousand people killed in Mexico just since Felipe Calderon became president," he said. First, let's look at his choice of the provocative -- and loaded -- verb "infest." The word is all too often used as a slur applied to immigrant populations. Cutler said in an interview that such usage would be inappropriate. But he said it does apply to the drug traffickers. "I'm not talking about illegal aliens," he said. "'m speaking about the cartels," which he characterized as extraordinarily vicious. So, to be clear, we were interested in applying the Truth-O-Meter solely to his claim that the reach of Mexican cartels has extended to hundreds of cities. To infest is to live as a parasite or, in the words of The American Heritage Dictionary, "to inhabit or overrun in numbers or quantities large enough to be harmful, threatening or obnoxious." We decided that having a drug distribution network in a city would clearly qualify as an infestation of illegal activity. Just dropping off drugs for distribution by other groups might not seem to qualify, but the effect of those deliveries is certainly harmful, threatening or obnoxious to a community. We uncovered a series of articles on various websites reporting a similar claim made in April 2011 by Roberta Jacobson, deputy secretary of state for Mexico and Canada. According to one of them, she said the Mexican drug cartels are operating in more than 230 U.S. cities. When we first heard from Cutler, he said his source was Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary for Homeland Security, who has repeatedly used the 230 number going back at least to 2009. When we dug a bit deeper, we discovered the source of that estimate. In December 2008, the U.S. Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center issued its 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment. It reports that Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) "control most of the U.S. drug market" with various transportation routes and strong affiliations with gangs in the United States. "Law enforcement reporting indicates that Mexican DTOs maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 U.S. cities," the report says. The report includes a map showing where Mexican drug organizations were reported between Jan. 1, 2006, through Sept. 30, 2008. In New England, it includes Providence, Boston, Hartford, Portland, Fitchburg, Mass., and Greenville, N.H. The 2009 version warns that it may contain outdated information, so we found the most recent report, released in February 2010. The newer version doesn't give a count of cities where the cartels have influence, but it does say that their reach is expanding, "primarily in areas where the direct influence of Colombian DTOs is diminishing" and that "they are active in more cities throughout the country than any other DTOs." The 2010 report also says the Mexican cartels "are increasing their cooperation with U.S.-based street and prison gangs to distribute drugs and expand their reach into more rural and suburban areas." The report estimated that the United States has more than 900,000 "criminally active gang members representing approximately 20,000 street gangs in more than 2,500 cities." Most recently, we've seen some direct evidence of cartel activity in Rhode Island. In January, three men whom law enforcement officials say are linked to a Mexican cartel were arrested in a storage unit in North Kingstown with 145 pounds of cocaine and $1.2 million in cash. We should also note other evidence of Mexican cartel influence, even though it may not involve drugs. In February 2011, federal officials said they had identified a Mexico-based fraudulent-document trafficking operation that had cells in 19 cities, including one in Pawtucket. Cell managers were charged with various counts that included murder, racketeering, money-laundering and kidnapping. Prosecutors said kidnapping and beating was used to drive competitors out of the region. To sum up, Cutler said that "a couple of hundred [U.S.] cities are infested by the Mexican cartels," a 2008 Justice Department report said the cartels either run drug distribution sites or supply illegal drugs for distribution in 230 cities, and the latest report said the influence of those cartels have only grown. We rate his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-04431	Says the U.S. Senate has passed "a budget" over the last three years "called the Budget Control Act."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/14/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-says-budget-control-act-fed/	When it comes to passing a budget, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez hasn’t been doing his job, according to his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos. In a heated debate Wednesday on New Jersey 101.5-FM, the Democratic incumbent and Kyrillos argued over whether the U.S. Senate has passed a budget in the last three years. The two candidates will face off in the Nov. 6 general election. "The Senate hasn’t passed a budget in three years," said Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County. "That’s just a fact, hasn’t done it." But Menendez said that wasn’t true: "Secondly, there is a budget. It’s called the Budget Control Act and you should look it up. You’d understand then that your statement about not having a budget for the last three years would be wrong." So, is Menendez right that Kyrillos’ statement is inaccurate and the Senate has passed a budget "called the Budget Control Act"? That legislation performs budgetary functions -- such as setting limits on certain types of future discretionary spending -- but the Act is not a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. That kind of plan is called a "budget resolution" and the Senate hasn’t passed one in more than three years. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that "a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs." Galston added, "The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn’t constitute a full budget." Let’s explain what a budget resolution is. The House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years. A budget resolution does not become law, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters. With Menendez voting yes, the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009 for fiscal year 2010. In the absence of a budget resolution, Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines. Now, let’s turn to the Budget Control Act. Enacted in August 2011, that legislation also included provisions to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, and set up a process that could trigger additional spending cuts. Menendez voted against the bill. The Act is similar to a budget resolution in terms of setting those discretionary spending limits, according to Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction. But the legislation did not "set forth projections for mandatory spending and targeted revenue levels for five years," which budget resolutions do, Peuquet told us. Harvard Law School professor Howell Jackson added in an e-mail that "I don’t think it’s fair to consider this a substitute for the actual adoption of a budget resolution, which has lots of other implications (and procedural vehicles for getting around the filibuster)." In a statement, Mike Soliman, Menendez’s campaign manager, argued that Menendez didn’t say the Senate passed a budget resolution, but that it passed a budget. "The Budget Control Act is stronger than a budget resolution because it actually has the force of law," Soliman added. "The Budget Control Act carries the force of law, it sets our spending limits for two years, and it actually dictates our nation's spending. A non-binding budget resolution does not." Our ruling During last week’s debate, Menendez claimed Kyrillos’ statement was wrong and that the Senate has passed "a budget" in the last three years, "called the Budget Control Act." That Act set limits on discretionary spending, but it is missing other features of a "budget resolution," which is considered a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. The Senate hasn’t passed such a plan in more than three years. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10898	"You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar.'"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/03/donald-trump-jr/did-nazi-platform-echo-democratic-platform-donald-/	At the Washington, D.C., premiere of a new movie by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, Donald Trump Jr. gave an on-camera interview to One America News Network, a conservative outlet. In it, the younger Trump echoed one of D’Souza’s themes that Democrats are a crypto-Nazi party. "You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the DNC (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar' to a point where it's actually scary. It's the exact opposite of what you’ve been told." (The Aug. 1 interview can be seen on video here, around the 3:20 mark.) Really? The assertion appears to originate with D’Souza’s 2017 book, The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left. In one passage, he cites a 25-point program that included nationalization of large corporations, government control of banking, the expropriation of land, a broader pension system, and universal free health care and education. If you read the Nazi platform without knowing its source, you could easily be forgiven for thinking you were reading the 2016 platform of the Democratic Party. Or a least a Democratic platform drafted jointly by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Sure, some of the language is out of date. The Democrats don’t talk about "usury" these days; they’d have to substitute "Wall Street Greed." But otherwise, it’s all there. All you have to do is cross out the word "Nazi" and write in the word "Democrat." D’Souza did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but Trump Jr. sent a tweet on Aug. 2 that said, "So the left spends the last 3 years falsely calling my entire family NAZI’s, but the second I point out the similarities between the economic platform of the National Socialists and the Democrat Party, they scream bloody murder. Here’s what I was referring to. #facts." The tweet linked to a teaser clip from D'Souza's film that covers much the same ground as the excerpt above. We dug out the original Nazi platform from 1920 and consulted with historians of the period. There was wide agreement that D’Souza has made a dubious and overly simplified comparison of the Nazis and the Democrats while also overlooking large portions of the platform that couldn’t be further from present-day Democratic orthodoxy. "There is not the slightest, tiny sliver in which this could be even somewhat accurate," said Jeffrey Herf, a University of Maryland historian and author of The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust. Herf is a self-described critic of President Barack Obama, yet he said he can say confidently "that the Democrats have nothing in common with the Nazi Party." What did the Nazis run on? In 1919, Adolf Hitler joined what was then the tiny German Workers' Party and began to convert it to his renamed National Socialist German Workers' Party, said Richard Breitman, an American University historian and author of The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution. Hitler became a co-author of the party’s program of 1920. (At that point, Germany had democratic elections.) The document is important, historians said, but it also requires a caveat. "It did not reflect all of Hitler’s views — it was a compromise," Breitman said. Some items — indeed, many of those that D’Souza says echo contemporary Democratic Party planks — are socialist. But even some of these are overlain with nationalist ideas more in tune with Hitler’s thinking, and overall, a majority of the planks articulate an extreme form of racial nationalism that is absent from modern-day Democratic platforms. The economic elements D'Souza emphasized need important context, said Laurie Marhoefer, a historian at the University of Washington who has studied the period. "The socialist elements in national socialism are in service to the racism," she said. "That's very different from socialism itself, from social democracy, and from the Democrats in the United States, who aren't even social democrats." Some points that may sound similar We found only three points in the 1920 Nazi platform that could be described as clearly similar to points made in the 2016 Democratic Party platform. • "We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age." • Support for "the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement. ... We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the state." • "The state must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised." However, these goals are so anodyne that not only the Democratic platform but also the Republican platform in 2016 mentioned them. In three other cases, it’s possible to cherry-pick language from the Nazi platform that echoes Democratic Party principles of equality, prosperity and freedom, but a closer look reveals important differences. • "All citizens shall have equal rights and duties." This sounds inoffensive, but elsewhere in the Nazi document, it offers an exclusionary definition of "citizens" — specifically, that "only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation." • "We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class." This may sound like American political boilerplate, but the next clause defines the pathway to this goal as "the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders." There’s nothing in the Democratic platform about expropriating department stores for the benefit of small-business owners. • "We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the state." This sounds fine, but the sentence goes on to clarify, "provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race." D’Souza ignores many Nazi planks that are antithetical to Democratic Party policies The majority of points in the platform address issues that cannot be found in the Democratic Party platform. • Colonization. "We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population," the Nazi platform said. • Immigration restrictions and deportations. The document says, "If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich." In addition, "all non-German immigration must be prevented." The 2016 Democratic platform, by contrast, says the party "supports legal immigration" and would maintain ‘the United States’ role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety, freedom, and security." • The death penalty. The Nazi platform said that "common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race." But the Democratic platform calls for abolishing the death penalty. • Nationalization of the economy and expropriation of assets. While some may suggest that Democrats’ preference for progressive taxation and regulation of the free market are tantamount to socialism, the elements of the Nazi platform derived from the socialist side of its roots are more far-reaching than elements of the Democratic platform. For instance, the Nazi document advocates "the abolition of incomes unearned by work," "the ruthless confiscation of all war profits," "the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations," and "expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation, the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land." • Restrictions on the press. The Nazi document said that ‘the publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden" and added that "non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers," punishable by "immediate deportation." Nothing like this appears in the Democratic platform. • Racial purity. The roots of the Holocaust can be detected in the 1920 Nazi platform. "Only members of the nation may be citizens of the state. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation." It goes on to say that the party "combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us." This element offers the starkest difference, experts said. "There is nothing in the Democratic Platform that resembles the central point of the Nazi movement — that ‘no Jew may be a member of the nation,’" said Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor of history and German and author of Why?: Explaining the Holocaust. And as harsh as some of its rhetoric is, the 1920 document actually underplays what Nazism eventually became. "Because Hitler wanted to create the image of consistency and infallibility, he never changed the program after he became Fuehrer of the party," Breitman said. "He just continued to radicalize his views. When he gained power in 1933, he exploited opportunities to seize dictatorial control and then worked to expand party-state control of all aspects of life." Our ruling Trump Jr. said, "You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar,' to a point where it's actually scary." Only a small number of elements of the two platforms are clearly similar, and those are so uncontroversial that they appear in the Republican platform as well. The vast majority of planks in the Nazi platform not only don’t appear in the Democratic platform, but are wholly antithetical to it. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-13628	Says Carlos Beruff "supported (Charlie) Crist even after he switched parties."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/11/florida-first-project/carlos-beruff-supported-charlie-crist-after-party-/	Florida’s GOP primary for U.S. Senate has turned into mutual finger-pointing over which candidate is possibly more like former Republican Charlie Crist. A super PAC called the Florida First Project released an ad July 14 calling Sen. Marco Rubio’s primary opponent Carlos Beruff a "Charlie Crist Republican," a major insult among the Florida GOP faithful. The PAC supports Rubio’s re-election bid and is managed by several staffers from Conservative Solutions PAC, which backed Rubio’s presidential run. "Beruff supported Crist even after he switched parties, and stabbed Republicans in the back," the ad says. The line refers specifically to the Bradenton developer’s support for Crist’s 2010 Senate campaign against Rubio. Former Gov. Crist switched from Republican to having no party affiliation as Rubio’s campaign gained steam. After losing that race, Crist lost a 2014 re-election bid for governor as a Democrat, and currently is running as a Democrat for a U.S. House seat held by Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores. Beruff has released his own ad counterattacking Rubio, accusing him of being a "political opportunist" like Crist. We wondered whether Rubio’s challenge of Beruff’s Republican bona fides was correct. Did Beruff still support Crist after Crist became an independent candidate? His actions at the time don't indicate Beruff shunned Crist entirely, despite what he says now. Grist about Crist Beruff likes to claim that he is a political outsider, but he has long been involved in Florida politics. Crist as governor appointed Beruff to three political boards: the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority, the State College of Florida Board of Trustees, and the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Beruff also has donated thousands to Republican candidates over the years, including to Crist’s Senate campaign. Crist announced his Senate candidacy in May 2009. Federal Election Commission reports from June 2009 showed Beruff gave Crist the maximum allowed for individuals — $2,400 for the primary and $2,400 for the general elections. (Beruff’s companies also had donated to Crist when he ran for governor in 2006.) As Rubio gained traction, Crist toyed with the idea of switching his registration. An April 2010 story in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune listed Beruff as a donor who would continue to support Crist if he made such a move. The story also listed other Republicans as faithful to Crist, including former Sarasota Republican Party chairmen Bob Waechter and Eric Robinson, and prominent chiropractor Gary Kompothecras. By the end of April 2010, down 20 points to Rubio in the polls, Crist announced he would cede the Republican nomination for Senate by switching to no party affiliation. Several weeks later, in June 2010, Beruff attended a fundraiser for Crist (with several Democrats) at Kompothecras’ Siesta Key home. It seems peculiar that Beruff would have gone to any Crist event during the politically charged atmosphere of the 2010 Senate race had he disagreed with Crist’s decision. At the time, Republicans faced a bitter rift in their party over Crist's defection, and choosing sides was a very public issue. To give you an idea of how contentious Crist's decision was, state Rep. David Rivera of Miami called it "one of the biggest betrayals in American history since Benedict Arnold." Beruff’s political opponents have made hay of his attendance at the fundraiser, repeatedly. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who faced Beruff in the primary before dropping out, made the same accusation back in February, starting a website called CharlieCristRepublican.com. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera dropped out of the Senate race and also lobbed the attack at Beruff earlier this summer. But Beruff has recently denied supporting Crist, despite going to the fundraiser, and said he gave up on Crist after he "got stupid" and left the Republican Party. A Crist spokesman declined to say whether Beruff threw support to Crist at the fundraiser. We couldn’t find any other reports from six years ago listing Beruff as a vocal Crist advocate when he turned NPA. We also didn't find an instance of Beruff speaking out against Crist. Through campaign spokesman Chris Hartline, Beruff told PolitiFact Florida he voted for Rubio over Crist, but was "disappointed" in Rubio’s performance. The Washington Free Beacon asked Beruff about the 2010 fundraiser after Lopez-Cantera’s comments. Beruff admitted he was there, but said he was no longer supporting Crist at the time. There’s no record of Beruff donating to Rubio. "If Dr. Gary (Kompothecras) invites me to something at his house, I go, unless I am out of town," Beruff told the Free Beacon. "He’s a good friend, even though we don’t share political roadways all the time." Beruff also said he had not donated to Crist after the party affiliation switch, saying "follow the money." Hartline echoed the sentiment when we asked him about it. "It's a lie, and Marco Rubio knows it," Hartline told us in a statement. "Carlos never supported Charlie Crist after he left the Republican Party. His last donation to Crist was June 1, 2009, almost 11 months before he became an independent." Of course, there’s good reason why Beruff didn’t donate any more money, even if he wanted to. He had reached the $4,800 legal limit and was prohibited from giving further. "Beruff could not have given more in the 2010 cycle, but he gave at a time when Crist was running for the Republican nomination," Douglas Weber, senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, told PolitiFact Florida via email. There is no evidence of Beruff giving Crist money since. Furthermore, news reports at the time said some donors demanded refunds after Crist’s party switch. Beruff did not. Hartline said it was because Beruff "turned his focus to helping Rick Scott in his run for governor." Our ruling Florida First Project said Beruff "supported Crist even after he switched parties." Beruff had supported Crist’s 2010 Senate run when Crist ran as a Republican, giving the maximum legal amount in donations. After Crist switched to an independent run, Beruff also attended a Crist fundraiser, although he denied supporting Crist in any way at that event. The Bradenton developer was listed as dependable Crist supporter in a news report prior to the switch, and didn’t ask for a refund of his donations. We found nary a mention of Beruff beyond that. But the bottom line is, even if Beruff denies it now, there's evidence that he didn't give Crist the same cold shoulder other Republicans immediately did.

pomt-07797	"Despite what you may have heard about Wisconsin’s finances, Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-wisconsin-track-have-budget-sur/	It has taken hold with conviction: the idea that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ginned up a phony budget crisis to justify his bold bid to strip state employees of most bargaining rights and cut their benefits. A volley of e-mails, blog posts and inquiries to reporters followed a Madison Capital Times editorial on Feb. 16, 2011, that said no state budget deficit exists for 2010-’11 -- or if it does, it’s the fault of Walker and the Republicans in the Legislature. Liberal MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow joined in Feb. 17, accusing Walker of manipulating the situation for political gain. "Despite what you may have heard about Wisconsin’s finances, Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year," she said. "I am not kidding." She added a kicker that is also making the rounds: Walker and fellow Republicans in the Legislature this year gave away $140 million in business tax breaks -- so if there is a deficit projected of $137 million, they created it. Maddow and others making the claim all cite the same source for their information -- a Jan. 31, 2011 memo prepared by Robert Lang, the director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It includes this line: "Our analysis indicates a general fund gross balance of $121.4 million and a net balance of $56.4 million." We were curious about claims of a surplus based on the fiscal bureau memo. In writing it when it was released, reporters from the Journal Sentinel and Associated Press had put the shortfall at between $78 million and $340 million. That’s the projection for the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2011. Walker himself has settled on $137 million as the deficit figure, a number reporters have adopted as shorthand. We re-read the fiscal bureau memo, talked to Lang, consulted reporter Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel’s Madison Bureau, read various news accounts and examined the issue in detail. Our conclusion: Maddow and the others are wrong. There is, indeed, a projected deficit that required attention, and Walker and GOP lawmakers did not create it. More on that second point in a bit. The confusion, it appears, stems from a section in Lang’s memo that -- read on its own -- does project a $121 million surplus in the state’s general fund as of June 30, 2011. But the remainder of the routine memo -- consider it the fine print -- outlines $258 million in unpaid bills or expected shortfalls in programs such as Medicaid services for the needy ($174 million alone), the public defender’s office and corrections. Additionally, the state owes Minnesota $58.7 million under a discontinued tax reciprocity deal. The result, by our math and Lang’s, is the $137 million shortfall. It would be closer to the $340 million figure if the figure included the $200 million owed to the state’s patient compensation fund, a debt courts have declared resulted from an illegal raid on the fund under former Gov. Jim Doyle. A court ruling is pending in that matter, so the money might not have to be transferred until next budget year. To be sure, the projected shortfall is a modest one by the standards of the last decade, which saw a $600 million repair bill one year as the economy and national tax collections slumped. But ignoring it would have meant turning away eligible Medicaid clients, which was not an option, Lang said. This same situation has happened in the past, including during the tenure of Doyle, a Democrat. In January 2005, a fiscal bureau memo showed a similar surplus, but lawmakers approved a major fix of a Medicaid shortfall that would have eaten up that projected surplus. Reporters who cover the Capitol are used to doing the math to come up with the bottom-line surplus or deficit, but average readers are not. (The Journal Sentinel’s Stein addressed these and other budget questions in a follow-up story.) So why does Lang write his biennial memo in a way that invites confusion? Lang, a veteran and respected civil servant working in a nonpartisan job, told us he does not want to presume what legislative or other action will be taken to address the potential shortfalls he lists. Admittedly, the approach this time created the opportunity for a snappy -- and powerful -- political attack. But it is an inaccurate one. Meanwhile, what about Maddow’s claim -- also repeated across the liberal blogosphere -- that Walker’s tax-cut bills approved in January are responsible for the $137 million deficit? Lang’s fiscal bureau report and news accounts addressed that issue as well. The tax cuts will cost the state a projected $140 million in tax revenue -- but not until the next two-year budget, from July 2011 to June 2013. The cuts are not even in effect yet, so they cannot be part of the current problem. Here’s the bottom line: There is fierce debate over the approach Walker took to address the short-term budget deficit. But there should be no debate on whether or not there is a shortfall. While not historically large, the shortfall in the current budget needed to be addressed in some fashion. Walker’s tax cuts will boost the size of the projected deficit in the next budget, but they’re not part of this problem and did not create it. We rate Maddow’s take False.

The issue is that there is "very little ability" to verify and vet the people coming from the countries listed in Trump’s directive, Kelly said, adding that most of the countries have no passports, no police and no intelligence on its people. "Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet," Kelly told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on May 28. Trump’s revised, March 6 order — currently blocked by courts — aimed to temporarily suspend entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Is it true that there is no U.S. embassy in many of those countries? Information from the State Department shows there isn’t an embassy in at least four of those six. Limited U.S. diplomatic presence David Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred us to information posted on the State Department’s website regarding countries with limited or no U.S. visa services. U.S. embassies and consulates sometimes limit or suspend their visa services for reasons that include natural disasters, civil unrest, war and security concerns, the State Department said. Iran The State Department website said the United States does not have diplomatic relationships with Iran, therefore no U.S. embassy or consulate in that country. Other countries listed as having no diplomatic relationship were Bhutan and North Korea. Libya The State Department’s website said that on July 26, 2014, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, Libya, "went on ordered departure and staff temporarily departed due to the ongoing fighting around our embassy and the serious risks faced by our diplomatic personnel." The ambassador to Libya and a core group of personnel work from the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia. Since visa services are unavailable in Libya, the State Department designated the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca, Morocco, "as the processing post" for visa applications from Libyan immigrants. Syria The U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria, suspended its operations in February 2012. U.S. citizens in need of emergency assistance are to contact the embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus, which acts as a protecting power for U.S. citizens. U.S. passports or visas are not issued in Syria. Somalia The United States does not have an embassy or diplomatic presence in Somalia. It has a mission to Somalia that operates out of Nairobi, Kenya. Embassies in Sudan, Yemen, Iraq The United States does have an embassy in Khartoum, Sudan. It also has an embassy in Sana’a, Yemen, but out of political and security concerns has reduced its staffing to "minimal levels." The embassy has also suspended its consular services, the State Department said. The U.S. embassy in Cairo, Egypt processes visas for Yemeni citizens. Trump’s first executive order included Iraq, but the country was left out in the revised order. The United States does have an embassy in Iraq’s capital, Baghdad. Having an embassy helps in the vetting process because that's where the State Department can do most of its questioning, said Bill Hing, an immigration expert and law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law. Though refugees from areas of conflict are also often vetted at U.S. embassies in other countries, Hing said. Our ruling Kelly said, "Many of the countries in question (in Trump’s travel ban) don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet." Trump’s revised executive order aimed to temporarily suspend entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The United States does not have an embassy in at least four of those six countries. We rate Kelly’s statement True.

pomt-13702	Says Donald Trump said at the Republican convention, "I alone can fix it."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/28/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-said-i-alone-can/	Hillary Clinton said during her Democratic convention speech that voters shouldn’t trust Donald Trump because of his go-it-alone mentality. "And most of all, don't believe anyone who says: ‘I alone can fix it.,’" Clinton said on the last night of the convention in Philadelphia. "Those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland." Clinton then reeled off a list of folks she said Trump was forgetting, including soldiers, police officers, firefighters, doctors and nurses, teachers, entrepreneurs and mothers who lost children to violence. "He's forgetting every last one of us," she said. "Americans don't say: "I alone can fix it." We wondered if that’s what Trump really said. We did not hear back from the Trump campaign. Trump’s RNC speech We found the comment in Trump’s speech at the Republican convention right after he rattled off a list of criticisms of Clinton, including one about her practice keeping State Department emails on her private server. He then pivoted to explain why he should be president: "I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. "But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American." So Clinton did accurately quote Trump -- he did say "I alone can fix it." But he did say more than that. Clinton mentioned several types of Americans who work to "fix it together" such as police officers, implying that Trump ignored the crucial role they play in fixing our country’s problems. But Trump did mention that he would work with law enforcement: "I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job done." On foreign policy, Trump talked about working with allies: "We must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel." Our ruling Clinton said Trump said at the Republican convention "I alone can fix it." Trump did say those words when explaining why he thinks he is the best candidate for president. However, Clinton omitted that in other portions of his speech he showed a willingness to work with partners including prosecutors, law enforcement and foreign allies.

pomt-04266	Says Tennessee’s higher education funding model "is 100 percent outcomes-based" and "we are already seeing this model changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/11/bill-haslam/tennessees-outcomes-based-college-funding-model-al/	When we saw the Oct. 18 edition of Time magazine – its higher education issue – we found Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam listed as one of eight people the magazine consulted for "8 Ideas to Improve Higher Education." Haslam’s article: "Tie Funding to Graduation Rates." The governor described the big changes in the focus and funding of Tennessee’s public higher education system brought about by the Complete College Tennessee Act, which was approved by the Tennessee legislature in 2010 at the behest of then-governor Phil Bredesen. CCTA did several things, all with a goal of improving the rate at which Tennesseans attain college degrees or post-high school certificates to help prepare them for the modern workforce. Toward that end, the law revised how the state allocates taxpayer funding among its public universities, community colleges and technical institutes, away from the old model based mostly on enrollment and to an "outcomes-based" formula to reward institutions that perform well in helping students advance through their programs and graduate. Haslam wrote: "States have traditionally funded their public institutions of higher education based on enrollments. This means the more students attending an institution, the more money that institution receives from the state. While this may incentivize colleges to expand access, it does nothing to incentivize efficiency and productivity. Institutions are rewarded for admitting more students and keeping them enrolled as long as possible, not for ensuring that every student is making progress toward a degree and ultimately leaving with a credential that has value in the labor market. "Instead of funding … based on enrollments, states should use a formula that pays institutions for success in key areas like progress toward and completion of degrees and credentials. … Tennessee remains the only state to have a 100 percent outcomes-based model … (and) we are already seeing this model changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business." We decided to look at Haslam’s claims. It’s a given that the 2010 legislation changed the funding formula to a performance and outcomes based model. A Tennessee Higher Education Commission summary says, "The outcomes-based funding formula bases the entire institutional allocation of state appropriations on the basis of outcomes including degree production, research funding and graduation rates at universities, and student remediation, job placements, student transfer and associates degrees at community colleges." Higher education officials agree that 100 percent of the variable funding component of the formula is based on outcomes. That variable funding is about 80 to 85 percent of the total state appropriation for public higher education. There is also funding allocated for fixed costs like routine building operating expenses and utility costs that are based on square footage and type of space. But the bulk of the funding is allocated totally on performance. Dr. Richard Rhoda, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission says it’s also true that "Tennessee is the only state in which the funding formula for higher education is totally outcomes-based." Perhaps the most important part of the discussion for students is whether and how the institutions they attend are, in the governor’s words, changing how they do business. On that point, officials agree: a lot, particularly by committing more resources to help students succeed. Most universities, including the University of Tennessee and the University of Memphis, have established student success programs and centers and academic support centers where students can get individual and group tutoring, advising centers where advisers review students’ majors and recommend what courses they need to take, and career centers that help students figure out what they want to do and what majors they need to get there. Those centers and advisers constantly remind students and their parents during orientation and enrollment that the advising services are available. UT has consolidated its student success center in new offices in Greve Hall, and has established a "one-stop shop" for success counseling and tutoring in the newly renovated Commons at the main library. It has also created UT LEAD, a program to promote undergraduate success, academic excellence and persistence to graduation for selected students awarded the Tennessee Pledge or Tennessee Promise scholarships. "This has indeed changed the way we do business. It is fair to say that each of our institutions is looking at how they allocate financial resources and assessing how those allocations will contribute to outcomes," said Chancellor John Morgan of the Tennessee Board of Regents, which governs U of M, Southwest Tennessee and Pellissippi State community colleges, and all other institutions outside the University of Tennessee System. "Since the outcomes under the formula are heavily weighted toward student progression and program completion, there is an intense focus on spending money in a way that will promote student success." Rhoda at THEC agreed: "The changes we are seeing are in the forms of more intentional and direct assistance to students in selecting courses and majors; getting students to focus on completing programs and earning credentials; new programs that lead to credentials and skills that employers are seeking; and targeting adults with some college experience but no degree." On that last group, adults with no degree, Rhoda says THEC is advocating Prior Learning Assessment on all state campuses – which helps adults earn college credit for skills they have acquired in the workplace. Rhoda said the University of Memphis appears further along in that than other institutions, offering experiential learning credit. Our ruling So, funding is outcomes based and the institutions are changing the way they operate, by focusing more resources on students. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03626	"Obama for President and Baldwin for Senate have kept their campaign offices up and running in Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse with their staffs preparing for the next battle."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/06/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-democrats-using-obama-and-ba/	With his next election approaching, Gov. Scott Walker is working to build his campaign war chest. In a March 27, 2013 fund-raising letter to supporters, Walker said the 2014 campaign will be even more difficult than his 2010 race or the 2012 recall election, declaring of Democrats: "We’re bracing for perhaps their biggest effort in 2014." He said state Democrats are looking to capitalize on the November 2012 victories by President Obama and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and added this head-scratcher: "Obama for President and Baldwin for Senate have kept their campaign offices up and running in Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse with their staffs preparing for the next battle." But Obama has run in his last election and Baldwin is a just few months into a six-year term. Are their campaign offices really still fired up and now focused on Walker? As evidence, Walker campaign spokeswoman Nicole Tieman offered links to three news stories "about the ongoing presence of OFA and Wisconsin Democrats in Wisconsin." Tieman highlighted an article from Politicothat said: "OFA now has paid state coordinators in place in Georgia, Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, Iowa, California, Texas and Arizona." But that story was from April 24, 2013 -- nearly a month after Walker’s letter went out. And the group Tieman referred to is not Organizing for America, the president’s campaign operation. It is a newly-formed formed non-profit called Organizing for Action, an outgrowth of the campaign organization. As for the offices and employees the governor mentioned, we searched the web and got on the phone to see if we could find some lonely campaign workers. We started with the president’s campaign. We found a list from last fall of about 60 Obama campaign offices around Wisconsin, including the "Milwaukee Region HQ" listed at 744 N. 4th St., an office building in downtown Milwaukee. When we visited that one, just down the street from us, there was no sign of an Obama office on the building directory. A lobby guard said that during the campaign people occasionally stopped in and asked about the office, but there was not one there. We called each of the 59 Obama offices that had a phone number listed -- including those in the areas named by Walker: the Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse. Virtually all of the numbers have been disconnected and not one was for the Obama campaign. The Obama campaign’s successor group, Organizing for Action, doesn’t yet have a presence in Wisconsin, said the new state coordinator Justin Koehler. "I’m moving out there tomorrow, actually," he said in an April 30, 2013 telephone interview. "We do not yet have an office for Organizing for Action. It’s me." The New York Times said Obama operators have converted their massive campaign operation into a lobbying effort, and hope to raise $50 million. "The goal is to harness those resources in support of Mr. Obama’s second-term policy priorities, including efforts to curb gun violence and climate change and overhaul immigration procedures," the Times said in a Feb. 22, 2013 story about the group. "Those efforts began Friday, when thousands of Obama supporters were deployed through more than 80 Congressional districts around the country to rally outside lawmakers’ offices, hold vigils and bombard Congress with e-mails and phone calls urging members to support stricter background checks for gun buyers." The tax exempt group will also maintain the connection between the president and his most ardent supporters. So what about the Baldwin campaign? We found a frequently updated Baldwin campaign web page. But didn’t locate an office in any of the three cities mentioned, though there is one in Madison. And after we began our reporting, Tieman of the Walker campaign sent a followup email noting Baldwin’s Madison campaign office was seeking a summer intern. But that posting was made after Walker’s letter went out and is not in the areas cited. We asked the state Democratic Party if they knew of any offices for Obama or Baldwin. "Obama for President and Senator Baldwin have closed their field offices," said Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, via email. "But Scott Walker is correct that Democrats are preparing for the next battle -- county Democratic party offices remain open and staffed all over the state, and the state party has organizers working in La Crosse, Eau Claire and the Fox Valley as part of our 72 County Strategy." To be sure, it is not unusual for campaign offices and web sites to remain open between elections -- Walker himself has done it. And political staffers routinely move from job to job between campaigns, political parties, office staffs and interest groups during the "off season." So, there would be little surprise if, say, a Baldwin staffer in Green Bay was now working for the state Dems -- perhaps even out of the same office space. But even that is not what Walker claimed. Our rating In a fund-raising letter, Walker told supporters that he needs to build his campaign war chest because Baldwin and Obama have kept their campaign offices open in three Wisconsin locations, and have staff "preparing for the next battle." There is no evidence of Obama or Baldwin offices. We found only a single employee of the successor to Obama’s campaign group, who didn’t start working until long after the statement was made. The Baldwin campaign has a single office in Madison -- not in the areas Walker mentioned in his claim. And the limited evidence the Walker campaign provided to in support of the claim all came after the statement was made. We rate Walker’s claim False.

pomt-11639	"Of all the 62 counties in New York state, all of them, unemployment is going up except for the five counties of New York City."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2018/jan/17/edward-cox/unemployment-inching-almost-every-county-outside-n/	New York Republican State Committee Chairman Edward F. Cox claimed the unemployment rate is rising in upstate counties, something Republicans intend to remind voters about in the 2018 race for governor. "Of all the 62 counties in New York state, all of them, unemployment is going up except for the five counties of New York City," Cox said in a radio interview. The claim is in direct contrast to a rosier picture of the economy painted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor touted a decline in unemployment statewide during his State of the State address this month. "Every region has seen a drop in unemployment and underemployment," Cuomo said. Is Cox right that unemployment is up everywhere outside New York City? Cox’s numbers Cox based his claim on a press release on unemployment from the state Department of Labor, his spokesperson said. The release showed the jobless rate for the state’s 15 metro areas in November 2016 and November 2017, the latest data released by the department. The release does not break down unemployment by county, though it links to that data. Albany, Schenectady and Troy are all counted as one area even though the cities are in different counties. Each of the 14 metro areas outside New York City had a higher unemployment rate in November 2017 than the year before, the data showed. The rural parts of the state, lumped into one category, also had a higher unemployment rate. The New York City metro area was the only place where unemployment went down. A short-term rise in unemployment isn't always bad news. As was the case in Massachusetts last year, a higher unemployment rate could mean more people have decided to enter a growing workforce, but have not landed a job yet. All but five of the state's metro areas added private sector jobs last year. The labor force, meanwhile, increased in all but two counties in New York state. Unemployment by county The state Department of Labor also tracks the unemployment rate for each county. Our analysis of the data shows Cox is mostly correct in his claim, with a few exceptions. • The unemployment rate in Lewis County decreased from 6.1 percent in November 2016 to 5.9 percent a year later. The county’s labor force and the number of people working increased during that time. • Seneca and Clinton counties saw no change in unemployment during that time. The labor force and the number of people employed increased in those counties as well. Unemployment in every other county outside New York City went up between November 2016 and November 2017. Unemployment in each of New York City’s five boroughs went down. The rates for each county and metro area are not seasonally adjusted. That means they don’t adjust the data for major shifts in employment during retail holidays seasons, or construction in the summer. A market analyst from the state Department of Labor said the agency does not calculate seasonally adjusted numbers at the county level. Since 2011 While unemployment has inched up in most counties outside New York City recently, the trend has been very different since Cuomo took office in 2011. The unemployment rate is lower in every county since Cuomo took office in 2011, according to state data. Hamilton County, which recorded the largest one-year increase in unemployment in 2017, still has a lower unemployment rate than it did in 2011. Other counties, like Clinton and Columbia, now have an unemployment rate less than half of what it was when Cuomo took office. Some analysts believe drops in unemployment upstate have been inflated by a shrinking population. Monroe County had more than 13,000 fewer people in the labor force in November 2017 than January 2011, for example. During that time, the county’s unemployment rate decreased from 8.3 percent to 5.1 percent. Our ruling "Of all the 62 counties in New York state, all of them, unemployment is going up except for the five counties of New York City," Cox said. Cox was comparing unemployment figures between November 2017 and November 2016. The figures showed unemployment up in almost every county outside New York City. One county had a lower rate, and two other counties had no change in their unemployment rates. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06598	Says he never said he wanted to move Social Security "back to the states."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-never-backed-moving-social-secu/	During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google Republican presidential debate in Orlando, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney continued to spar over Social Security. The future of Social Security has turned into a key point of difference between the two candidates. Romney used a new line of attack that Perry wants to send Social Security back to the states, and Perry contended that wasn't true. Romney clearly stated his claim in an op-ed posted on the Fox News website a few hours before the Orlando debate. He said Perry "agrees with me that Social Security’s financing is in trouble, but from that point forward we sharply diverge. Instead of repairing the program as I aim to do, he wants to dismantle it." At the Orlando debate, Megyn Kelly of Fox News followed this line of inquiry. "Gov. Romney has been hammering you on your idea of turning Social Security back to the states, repeatedly," she said. "Can you explain specifically how 50 separate Social Security systems are supposed to work?" Perry answered, "Well, let me just say first, for those people that are on Social Security today, for those people that are approaching Social Security, they don't have anything in the world to worry about. We have made a solemn oath to the people of this country that that Social Security program in place today will be there for them." He continued, "Now, it's not the first time that Mitt has been wrong on some issues before. And the bottom line is, is we never said that we were going to move this back to the states. What we said was, we ought to have as one of the options the state employees and the state retirees, they being able to go off of the current system, on to one that the states would operate themselves. As a matter of fact, in Massachusetts, his home state, almost 96 percent of the people who are on that program, retirees and state people, are off of the Social Security program. So having that option out there to have the states -- Louisiana does it, almost every state has their state employees and the retirees that are options to go off of Social Security. That makes sense. It's an option that we should have." Kelly asked Romney if he wanted to respond, and Romney said, "Well, it's different than what the governor put in his book just, what, six months, and what you said in your interviews following the book. So I don't know. There's a Rick Perry out there that is saying -- and almost to quote, it says that the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business, that it's unconstitutional. Unconstitutional and it should be returned to the states. So you better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that." This is a lot to digest, so for right now, we’ll keep our fact check limited to this question: Is Perry justified in saying, "We never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states"? What Perry argues in 'Fed Up!' As we’ve noted in a previous fact-check, Perry’s 2010 book Fed Up! argues that the New Deal was a disastrous policy that expanded the federal government’s reach, curbed individual rights and state prerogatives and set the nation on a path to, as he put it, "socialism." Perry has praised the decision by employees of Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria counties in Texas to break away from the Social Security program in 1981, two years before the federal government closed off that option. Under the plan, participants contribute to retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds are invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process. (For more details on the Galveston program, you can read a fact check we did here.) On the Nov. 4, 2010, edition of the CNN show Parker/Spitzer, Perry had a spirited conversation about this option with co-hosts Kathleen Parker and Eliot Spitzer: Perry: Here's what I think would be a very wise thing. In 1981, Matagorda, Brazoria and Galveston counties all opted out of the Social Security program for their employees. Today their program is very, very well funded and there is no question about whether it's going to be funded in the out years, it's there. That's an option out there. Spitzer: So you want to let people opt out? Perry: I think -- you know what? Let the states decide if that's what's best for their system? Spitzer: So the states will opt out of Social Security? Perry: They should, I think it's a ... Spitzer: I haven't seen anybody propose that before because that's ... Perry: We just laid it on the table, let's talk about it. Spitzer: And so that's your plan? Perry: No, it's not my plan, Eliot. Spitzer: Well, I know, Governor, I'm trying to get you ... Perry: I know, you're trying to get me in a corner, and I don't corner very good. What I'm trying to do is have a discussion with the people of this country on an issue that ... Parker: I think that's a brand new idea. Nobody has said that. Perry: ...nobody, nobody is willing to talk about. Spitzer: No, no, here is the problem that I have -- the tea party, and we have had everybody from Dick Armey to Richard Viguerie -- folks who have been leading this movement, dodging and dancing unable to give a single answer about what they actually support. Having a conversation is to push it someplace else. I want to know if there's an answer, will you raise the retirement age? Are you saying you want to have private accounts, you can say it, we'll disagree, but at least it's an answer. Perry: Okay, I think all those are legitimate options out there, but let the states decide. Don't force us from Washington, D.C., to say, here is the size of tube socks that you're going to wear down in Texas, put them on. The following day, on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Perry mentioned the Texas counties again and said, "I would suggest to you, let's have that conversation. Is that one of the fixes? Get it back to the states. Why is the federal government even in the pension program or the health-care delivery program? Let the states do it. I'll promise you (Gov.) Bobby Jindal over in Louisiana, he'll come up with some great and effective ways and money-saving ways to deliver health care in Louisiana. And governors will look around, they'll go, you know what? That's a good idea. That'll work in our state, and they'll go get it and put it -- put it in their states." In both interviews, Perry stopped short of officially advocating a let-the-states-decide approach, hedging with such phrases as "let's talk about it" and let’s "have a discussion." Still, he spoke favorably of an option that would loosen the federal monopoly on Social Security and empower states to fill the role of Social Security, even going so far as saying, "Let the states decide." It’s worth noting that Perry has softened his position in recent weeks, emphasizing the need to protect the program for retirees or people nearing retirement age. For instance, during the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, he said, "Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there." And as we noted, Perry repeated the point in the Orlando debate. Our ruling Romney says Perry wants to dismantle Social Security and leave it to the states. Perry says that's not true. Perry’s not being entirely accurate when he contends that "we never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states." He came close to that position when he said, "Let the states decide" on Parker/Spitzer and "Get it back to the states" on Morning Joe. But in other comments, he hedged, saying it was merely an idea worth discussing. And while Perry tried, during the Orlando debate, to draw a distinction between a state opt-out system and a mandate that every state have its own Social Security plan, we don’t see it as a major distinction in this context. He claimed to have "never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states," yet allowing every state, or units within a state, to opt out of Social Security empowers states to make their own decisions and ultimately establish their own alternative plans. Perry brought up the opt-out idea by his own choice on two different television shows. Even if he mostly stopped short of explicitly advocating the let-the-states-decide idea, it’s clear that he was warm to the idea of allowing states to opt out of Social Security. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-23T17:04:47	2011-09-22	['None']

pomt-01269	"Over 214,000 doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-214000-doctors-refuse-take-pati/	Are doctors en masse refusing patients who gained health care coverage due to the Affordable Care Act? That’s the claim in a chain email a reader asked us to check. "More, truly scary Obamacare news," said the email, sent just before Halloween. The accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. "Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges," read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described "center-right policy institute." The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: "Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans." How many? According to the post, "as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products." It went on to list some reasons "doctors are opting out of the exchange plans." That’s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let’s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it’s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don’t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It’s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. "The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans," said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an "upper bound" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here’s the rub, from the research: "The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide." While there’s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there’s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. "That’s a significant difference," said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. "I wouldn’t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians." Let’s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn’t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are "opting out" of Obamacare. Many — almost half — weren’t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren’t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. "Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they’re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company)," Ginsburg said. "On an exchange, you don’t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans." There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won’t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000. Our ruling A chain email claimed that more than 214,000 American doctors are "opting-out of Obamacare exchange plans." That is based on a survey of a select group of doctors and even the makers of the survey said it can’t be extrapolated for the entire country. Further, of the doctors responding to the survey, 42 percent said they weren’t participating in marketplace plans because they were never asked to, not because they were "opting out." The estimate is the result of a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data. We rate the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-11-06T16:11:08	2014-10-30	['None']

pomt-13820	"Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) — her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaract-fbi-director-comment-about/	Republican nominee Donald Trump seized on testimony from the head of the FBI to slam Democrat Hillary Clinton’s email practices while she was secretary of state. The practices were detailed by FBI Director James Comey in a July 5 news conference and an appearance two days later before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The FBI declined to recommend prosecution in Clinton’s case. Comey concluded that Clinton was wrong when she repeatedly said that classified emails didn't end up on her personal system and he characterized her handling of very sensitive information as "extremely careless." Trump told the crowd at a July 11 campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that Clinton's conduct as "willful, intentional, and unlawful." "Just look at what the FBI director said about her — her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country," Trump said. Comey was tough on Clinton, saying at one point that any reasonable person in Clinton's position "should have known that an unclassified system was no place" for some of the conversations she was having. But we didn't recall him saying her conduct was "a disgrace" or an "embarrassment." So we decided to check it out. The Trump campaign doesn't regularly respond to PolitiFact's requests for information. But in this case, the Trump campaign posted the speech (as prepared but without his extemporaneous remarks) with annotations. The speech transcript specifically indicates, via the dash, that Trump was explaining the remarks of the FBI director, not just giving his own opinion. Trump's delivery on video makes it sound that way, too, and that's what caught our attention. The campaign said that the source for the "disgrace and embarrassment" line came from the Washington Post's transcript of Comey's July 5 news conference. We checked. Neither the words "disgrace" nor "embarrassment" are contained in the transcript. We checked Congressional Quarterly's transcript. Same result. We wondered if Comey might have used the words during the hours he spent before the House committee two days later. He did not. We read his public comments again, looking for words that mean the same thing as a disgrace or an embarrassment. We didn’t find them. Instead, Comey used words that focused on her conduct as showing a lack of attention. "I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That, I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent," was about as harsh as Comey got. He declined to say whether Clinton lied to the public. He did suggest that Clinton may have been less sophisticated about email than most people assumed. "She didn't have a computer in her office at the State Department, for example," Comey said. We wondered if anybody used the words "disgrace" or "embarrassment" during the hearing. They did not. Our ruling Trump said, "Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) — her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country." The Trump campaign indicated Comey said it during his news conference. He didn't. He said her actions were careless, but he didn’t call them a disgrace or an embarrassment or the equivalent. It's possible that Trump was trying to convey two different thoughts, urging people to look up the FBI director's comments and the "disgrace and embarrassment" comment was supposed to be his own characterization. But that's not how it comes across, both when spoken and in the transcript. With that in mind, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b1a6a5e7-b27c-496b-a3cd-73f65def2f05	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-15T11:16:28	2016-07-11	['Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']

pomt-14718	"Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing" on the Mexico border.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/29/ted-cruz/cruz-falsely-claims-us-law-requires-double-fencing/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says President Barack Obama’s border policies aren’t just bad, they’re illegal. "Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing," Cruz, a presidential candidate, said during a recent radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show," broadcast in Portsmouth. "The Obama administration refuses to do that. They’ve built only 36 miles." We wondered if the law requires that the U.S.-Mexico border have a 700-mile span of "double-layered fencing" in which two barriers are set up, one in front of the other. Rick Tyler, a Cruz campaign spokesman, backed the senator’s statement by pointing us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which required that at least two layers of reinforced fencing be installed along five sections of the U.S.-Mexico border. Those sections totaled about 850 miles, although the fenced area would be somewhat less, because other means could be used to secure the border in areas with steep terrain. In areas of steep terrain, "other means" could be used to secure the border, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report. The bottom line is, the law mandated a double-layered fence along a stretch of at least 700 miles, covering more than one-third of the roughly 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. But the law was amended in 2008 and loosened the fence requirements that Cruz continues to describe. The current law, contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, still mandates the construction of a fence covering "not less than 700 miles" of the border. But - key to this fact check - it erased the requirement that the fence be double-layered. Instead, the law mandates that "reinforced fencing" be erected. That generally means a barrier that’s more durable and sturdy than a typical fence, but the law doesn’t specify the barrier’s height or that it be constructed from wire mesh or another material, according to the Congressional Research Service report. The new law "now mandates only a single layer of reinforced fencing (while not precluding additional layers from being deployed, if deemed appropriate)," the report says. So what has been built? The Department of Homeland Security says it has fencing on 650 miles, according to the research service. About 350 miles of that fencing is designed only to deter pedestrian crossings and contains only one barrier layer. Another 300 miles is covered by a "vehicle fence" - barriers designed to stop cars and trucks from crossing the border but not people traveling by foot. Only 36 miles are covered by double-layered fencing, according to Homeland Security tallies. "DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) believe they have all the fencing that they need and that any additional fencing would not contribute to border security," Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an interview. Others disagree, saying the barrier is not enough. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which urges tighter immigration policies, noted the vehicle fencing provides no deterrent for people on foot. "Your grandma could hop them," Krikorian told us in an email. Our ruling Cruz says, "Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing." He complains that Obama is ignoring the mandate. Such a law was passed in 2006 but no longer is on the books. It was amended in 2008, before Obama took office, and the double-layered fencing requirement was removed. About 650 miles of fencing now stands, of which 36 miles is double-layered. Cruz’s statement is long past its expiration date. We rate it False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-12-29T00:00:00	2015-12-17	['Mexico']

pomt-15252	"In 1960, we spent more than 3 percent of our GDP on infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway. Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/03/gerry-connolly/connolly-says-us-road-spending-based-gdp-one-third/	U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly says the nation will short-change its future if it doesn’t invest more money in infrastructure. In testimony prepared for a July 9 hearing with fellow Democrats, Connolly warned that the nation’s systems of roads and rails was being bled by lack of spending. "In 1960, we spent more than 3 percent of our GDP on infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway," Connolly, D-11th, said in a July 9 written statement. "Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments." Connolly’s comments came amid debate on Capitol Hill over spending to maintain the country’s roads and rails. The congressman recently chastised colleagues in the GOP-run House over that chamber’s passage of a June measure that cut funding for Amtrak. Just this past week, Congress passed legislation to keep the keep money flowing into the federal Highway Trust Fund for the next three months as lawmakers grapple to find a long-term fix to the fund’s looming insolvency. We wondered if the congressman was right that infrastructure spending has been whittled to one-third of its level 55 years ago when the nation was just starting to build the Interstate Highway System. George Burke, Connolly’s spokesman, backed the congressman’s statement by pointing to several studies on infrastructure spending by federal, state and local governments. As Burke noted, the studies have varying results because of differing definitions of what constitutes infrastructure. Some looked at not just spending for transportation arteries like roads and passenger rails, but also costs to build and maintain power grids, private freight rail networks, and municipal sewage plants. The most recent report was released in March by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It said that federal, state and local money spent of transportation totaled $138 billion in 1960 compared to $279 billion in 2014, using inflation-adjusted dollars. All these dollars flowed into two categories: capital expenses that are used to buy equipment and pay for construction; and operating and maintenance expenses that pay for upkeep. That means public spending on transportation infrastructure totalled 2.1 percent of GDP in 1960 compared to 1.6 percent in 2014, according to the CBO report. These figures don’t mesh with Connolly’s statement. So what’s the congressman referring to when he talks about infrastructure? Burke said Connolly was specifically referring to a smaller subset: capital spending to construct roads and bridges. Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, drilled down into the CBO figures for us to meet Connolly’s definition. He found that in 1960, public spending on new roads and bridges amounted to 1.17 percent of GDP and fell to .53 percent in 2014. That’s a drop, but not quite as steep as Connolly said. One last note: Connolly also sent us a 2014 report from the White House that said public spending on surface transportation infrastructure was just under 3 percent in 1962 compared to 1.4 percent today. That’s a drop of about 50 percent, which is more dramatic than the CBO findings but still not as stark as the two-thirds decline Connolly described. No matter how it’s defined, public spending on infrastructure -- as measured by the the percentage of GDP -- is lower now than 55 years ago. Shatz said a key reason is that the U.S. has built out its infrastructure system. "You can always build more and improve it, but we’re not going to build a second full interstate system – we already have one, and we don’t need to double its size," Schatz wrote in an email. "We need additional roads here and there, and we need to make sure we do (operation and maintenance). I don’t know what the right amount of infrastructure spending is, but I do think it’s a mistake to say we need to spend the same amount now when we have a lot of infrastructure as we did a long time ago when we lacked a lot of infrastructure." Our ruling Connolly wrote, "In 1960, we spent more than 3 percent of our GDP on infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway. Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments." His figures don’t match the statistics in a number of reports his office sent us. Connolly says he was referring specifically to road and bridge construction. CBO and White House data show that -- when measured by GDP -- we’re spending about half as much on roads and bridges as we did in 1960. That’s a drop, but not as steep as the two-thirds plunge Connolly describes. Connolly’s statement is also void of the context that our interstate system, new in 1960, is now pretty much built out. Bottom line is that the congressman has the trend right, but his numbers and trajectory are off. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01829	Says Rick Scott’s per-pupil education spending is "about $200 less" than what it was under Charlie Crist during the recession.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/18/charlie-crist/rick-scotts-student-spending-about-200-less-during/	Charlie Crist has gone on the offensive against Gov. Rick Scott, launching a TV ad campaign and pulling no punches in interviews. In one freewheeling discussion with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board July 16, 2014, former Gov. Crist attacked Scott’s education spending. "I can only imagine how nice it would be to serve as governor when you have a surplus of almost $3 billion. That’s what this guy has right now," Crist said. "And in spite of it, he still hasn’t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids. In fact, he’s about $200 less." PolitiFact Florida has done many checks on claims about school spending by these two candidates, but we wanted to know if Scott really budgeted $200 less per student than Crist. Good thing both governors have permanent records for us to check. Budget crunch As a quick overview, the Florida Education Finance Program is the main source of dollars for K-12 education. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the "required local effort," in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. Scott has been touting the $18.9 billion K-12 education spending budget he signed this year as the largest in state history. We rated that Half True, because it was the largest in terms of dollars spent, but not after inflation and not per pupil. When we break down the most recent budget, it works out to $6,937 in spending per pupil. Even though the budget is higher, Florida schools now have a higher enrollment, roughly 90,000 more than in 2007, according to state projections at the start of the 2014-15 school year. Crist has been contending that his per-pupil spending has been higher, referring to the $7,126 per student allocated in his $18.7 billion education budget for 2007-08. That works out to an $189 difference. But considering both governors’ terms as a whole, there’s more to the story. Education budgets declined during Crist’s administration, with a corresponding drop in per-pupil spending, save for a slight bounce his last year in office. Scott, meanwhile, came into office looking to slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget, resulting in a $700 per pupil cut. But lawmakers balked. He settled for knocking $1.3 billion out of the budget, dropping per-student dollars by $540, due in part to a loss in federal stimulus money that had been shoring up spending for Crist’s last two budgets. Then Scott’s numbers started to steadily rise. Fiscal year K-12 budget (total) Per pupil spending 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,761 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,937 The two years with an asterisk were years when the state received about $900 million each in federal stimulus money. In context, Crist said Scott "still hasn’t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids." Crist signed his first budget in 2007, a year before the Great Recession began. In 2008, education funding dropped to less than what the 2014 budget now offers. If you compared the 2008-09 budget to Scott’s current budget, Crist is actually behind. However, these numbers don’t account for inflation. If they did, that 2007-08 number would equal $8,176 in 2014 dollars, $1,200 more than what is currently budgeted per student. Even at the lowest spending during Crist’s tenure in 2009-10, the inflation-adjusted total in state and local funding would be around $7,209, still a higher value than Scott’s last budget. Our ruling Crist said Scott’s per-pupil education spending is "about $200 less" than the Crist administration did during the recession. Scott’s current budget does spend almost $200 less per student than Crist did in 2007, but that was before the recession really hit. Spending was less during the other three years of Crist’s term -- although still higher than some of Scott’s years. It’s worth noting that Scott cut school funding when he came into office, but has gradually increased it to a level that’s currently higher than what Crist signed off on during the Great Recession. When you account for inflation, though, Crist’s per-pupil spending outpaces Scott’s for every year. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00050	"In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/04/senate-leadership-fund/mccaskill-voted-path-citizenship-its-stretch-call-/	Immigration policy is one of the thorniest issues of the 2018 midterm election cycle. Just ask incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She’s running against Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley in one of the nation’s most high-profile races. An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican-backed political action committee, questions her voting record on immigration. "In Missouri, Claire McCaskill said she was against amnesty for illegal immigrants. In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants without border protections in place," the ad said. We’ve fact-checked some of the Senate Leadership Fund’s other ads, as well as various politicians’ statements pertaining to McCaskill’s immigration voting record. We wanted to see if there was truth to the ad’s claim that McCaskill voted along party lines to grant amnesty 11 million undocumented immigrants . Senate bill 744’s proposed path to citizenship The Senate Leadership Fund did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment or clarification. However, the ad included a small caption referencing McCaskill’s voting record, noting McCaskill’s vote in favor of the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). It would have provided some of the undocumented immigrants living in America a pathway to citizenship which would have taken at least 13 years. At the time, the so-called "gang of eight," a coalition of four Republican and four Democratic senators, touted the bill as a sweeping fix for the country’s flawed immigration system. The bill proposed the following steps to citizenship: Registered provisional immigrant status: Anyone who had entered the country prior to Jan. 1, 2012, could apply for this status. Approval of the application was contingent on an applicant paying assessed taxes, application fees and a $1,000 penalty. A background check excluded applicants who had been convicted of a felony, three or more misdemeanor offenses, certain foreign offenses or unlawful voting. Permanent resident: After maintaining provisional status for a 10-year minimum, they could apply for lawful permanent resident status, commonly known as a green card. Citizenship: After at least three years, a lawful permanent resident could apply for full citizenship. The bill would have also allocated $46.3 billion in border security, doubled the number of border agents, imposed fines on immigrants seeking citizenship and created a merit-based visa category, among other measures. It passed the Senate 68-32, but died in the House. Did McCaskill vote for amnesty? Although the bill would have laid out a path to citizenship, the experts we talked to said it was a stretch to call it amnesty as the Senate Leadership Fund did. "I do think this is a type of amnesty, but I would hesitate before using amnesty in our current political environment because it has been so heavily criticized," said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. "Amnesty tends to indicate that you’re talking about giving someone a benefit that they don’t deserve," Pierce said. Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. "The whole point of the Senate bill was to create a whole series of hurdles that people who were here without status would have to jump through, including background checks, paying significant fines, waiting long periods of times," he said. "It was all linked to securing the border." The ‘amnesty’ precedent of 1986 Alden noted that critics of the 2013 bill might liken it to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The 1986 bill, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, gave the approximately 3 million unauthorized immigrants who had arrived in the country prior to Jan. 1, 1982, a chance to apply for citizenship. As a result of its passage, 2.7 million people obtained permanent residency status, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. "(Senate bill 744) was also closely tied to meeting border security benchmarks, whereas the Immigration Reform and Control Act legalization had no strings attached," Alden said in an email. Unlike the bill McCaskill voted for five years ago, Alden said the Reagan-era law did not "prevent people from coming illegally in the future or from working in the United States even if they didn’t have status." "To conflate this with the amnesty President Reagan signed is a misreading of what (the 2013 bill) contained," Alden said. As for the Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that 11 million people would have benefitted from the bill’s pathway to citizenship, experts agreed that’s also a stretch. "Not everyone would have been able to meet those requirements and pay those fees (to get citizenship)," said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Voigt said the lengthy process combined with strict background check requirements would have prevented all from qualifying. Our ruling In 2013, McCaskill voted for a bill that would have given undocumented immigrants living in the country a path, albeit a long one, to citizenship. The Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that she joined "the liberals" in supporting a bill that would have given "amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants" is deceptive for three reasons: First, the bill was branded as a bipartisan solution to immigration reform and co-sponsored by four Republican and four Democratic senators. Second, the bill included numerous hurdles unauthorized immigrants would have had to overcome, including fines and background checks, before becoming eligible for full citizenship. Experts say it is a loose interpretation of blanket residency. Lastly, in 2013 there were approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, but given the exclusions and restrictions included in the 2013 bill, not all of them would have qualified to start the citizenship process under the Senate bill’s guidelines. For those reasons we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Senate Leadership Fund	None	None	None	2018-11-04T11:20:44	2018-09-11	['Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-14275	"More people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud" by impersonation.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/07/mark-pocan/which-happens-more-people-struck-lightning-or-peop/	In a blog post one month before Wisconsin’s presidential primary election -- which was a test for the state’s photo ID law -- U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for making it easier to vote in the Badger State. But the Madison-area Democrat’s post on Medium, an online publishing platform for sharing information and viewpoints, started by making a claim about voter fraud that we want to check. "First, we need to accept the fact that in-person voter fraud by impersonation is virtually non-existent, with only 10 cases proven nationally out of 1 billion ballots cast since 2000," Pocan, who opposes Wisconsin’s newly reinstated photo ID law, wrote in the March 7, 2016 post. "Let’s put it this way, more people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud." Getting struck by lightning might actually be more common than what you’d guess. What about in-person voter fraud by impersonation -- that is, claiming to be someone else as you cast your ballot? We’ll note up front that there are various types of voter fraud, but Pocan is citing one particular type. Photo ID laws controversial Laws requiring citizens to show photo identification in order to vote have long been controversial across the country, including in Wisconsin. They are praised as a way to prevent fraud and criticized as being a barrier for some citizens, including college students and those who don’t have a valid drivers license. But when GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in June 2015 that most Americans support voter ID laws, we rated his statement Mostly True. Polls showed strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats. Walker signed Wisconsin’s voter ID law in 2011, but the requirement was in place for only the spring 2012 primary election before being blocked by court challenges. Those eventually failed and the requirement was reinstated. The April 2016 primary was the first high-turnout election since the reinstatement. Similar claim A claim similar to Pocan’s was made in August 2015, days after Texas’ voter ID law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. "You’re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas" than find in-person voter fraud, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said in a national television interview. PolitiFact National rated Booker’s statement, which Booker said was about voter fraud by impersonation, as True. The probability of being struck by lightning in Texas was 1 in 1.35 million. Based on the number of in-person voter fraud cases identified in Texas versus the number of ballots cast, those odds were lower -- 1 in 18 million. Pocan’s claim is somewhat different -- it is about actual numbers, not odds, and is national in scope. Lightning strikes The National Weather Service tracks lightning strikes. The most recent figures -- in terms of injuries as well as deaths caused by lightning strikes -- cover the 10-year period from 2004 through 2013. On average, the number of deaths and injuries reported each year was 267 -- 33 deaths, plus 234 injuries. The weather service believes that total figure is higher, however, because some injuries from lightning strikes are not reported. It estimates that the total number of casualties per year is actually 330 -- 33 deaths plus 297 injuries. Documented cases of voter fraud by impersonation are far fewer. Voter fraud Election administration expert Justin Levitt, who has been tracking allegations of voter fraud since 2000, most recently wrote on the topic in the Washington Post in August 2014. Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said in the piece that dating back to 2000 he found around the country 31 "credible allegations of potential fraud that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls" -- that is, possible fraud involving impersonation. Other election experts, including Lorraine Minnite of Rutgers University, also have used the lightning strike comparison. It’s fair to say, however, that impersonation cases can be hard to count in that they are hard to prove -- particularly when no photo ID requirement is in place and a voter can cast a ballot simply by stating the name of a registered voter. So the number of cases of in-person fraud by impersonation may be higher than that cited by Levitt, but no independent source suggests it is higher than the number of lightning strikes. Our rating Pocan said: "More people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud" by impersonation. Roughly 300 people per year are struck by lightning in the United States. But cases of voter fraud -- someone impersonating another voter -- are documented even less often. We rate Pocan’s statement True.

pomt-05496	"Rhode Island’s exports have increased by 53 percent in the last two years."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/17/lisa-tomasso/rhode-island-state-rep-lisa-tomasso-says-exports-o/	The Rhode Island economy is stagnating. While other parts of the country are starting to recover from the recession, the Ocean State is stuck in place, with little job growth and an unemployment rate far above the national average. But one part of the local economy has actually shown significant improvement in recent years, according to state Rep. Lisa P. Tomasso. "Rhode Island’s exports have increased by 53 percent in the last two years," the Coventry Democrat said in a State House news release on April 5. "This is something we need to pay attention to. Exports are essential to economic growth, not only in the nation but here at home in Rhode Island." Fifty-three percent. That’s quite an increase, a surprising one considering the well-known ills of the state economy. So naturally we wondered whether it’s really true. "When I heard it, my reaction was the same," Tomasso said when we asked her about the increase. She told us that she heard the figure at a recent meeting of the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Economic Development in Rhode Island, of which she is a member. The information on exports was part of a presentation put together by the John H. Chafee Center for International Business at Bryant University. While we waited for her to get us a copy of that PowerPoint presentation, we started our own research on the issue. Information on Rhode Island’s exports, it turns out, is easy to find on the web. The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, tracks all sorts of data on exports nationally and by state. We used a tool on the ITA’s website to create tables on Rhode Island’s exports for the past seven years. Rhode Island has exported products to 184 countries since 2009. The state’s leading foreign market is Canada, which accounts for more than a quarter of the state’s exports in terms of dollar value. Germany and Mexico are second and third, respectively. The state’s top exports are waste and scrap -- which account for 30.2 percent of total exports -- followed by manufactured metals (13.5 percent), chemicals (11.1 percent), miscellaneous manufactured products, including jewelry, medical equipment, sporting goods and office supplies (9.4 percent), machinery (7.3 percent) and electronic equipment (6.5 percent). The total value of the state’s exports has nearly doubled since 2005, but what about in the last two years alone? In 2009, exports totaled $1.5 billion. In 2011, they were $2.3 billion, which is in fact a 53-percent increase. With that question answered, we were curious about the reasons for the steep increase. One reason has to do with the global recession. Exports around the world fell at the nadir of the economic downturn. It was no different in Rhode Island, where in 2009 exports plummeted by 24 percent compared with the previous year -- from nearly $2 billion to $1.5 billion. The state made up that ground by 2010 and the number increased again in 2011. Because the state’s exports had fallen so far, the recent gains were more dramatic than in typical years. Another reason for the high percentage has a similar logic. Rhode Island’s exports, at $2.3 billion in value, are low compared with other states, such as Connecticut, where exports totaled $16.2 billion last year, or Massachusetts, with $27.7 billion in exports. So in Rhode Island, a large increase in volume can have an outsize effect in terms of percentage. Meanwhile, Tomasso sent us the presentation put together by the Chafee Center at Bryant, which advises businesses on how to export their products overseas. Not surprisingly, the 53-percent figure in the presentation was based on the same numbers that we found on the ITA website. We called Ray Fogarty, the director of the Chafee Center who also serves as the Rhode Island state trade director. He agreed that the recent increase in exports was more noticeable because the state had fallen so far. In addition, on a national level, many manufacturers are moving their operations back to the United States from overseas as labor and other costs come down. Those companies are then exporting their products, said Fogarty. So that has helped drive the increase in Rhode Island and many other states. We also asked Fogarty why our top export products are waste and scrap. He said the Port of Providence has become a regional shipping hub for scrap metal, with supplies coming in from Massachusetts and Connecticut and other nearby states and then sent to Canada, Turkey, China and other countries. Our ruling Tomasso said that exports from Rhode Island have increased by 53 percent over the past two years. According to federal trade statistics, she’s correct. That improvement doesn’t mean the state’s economy is set to turn around anytime soon, but it may be a sign of hope. We rate Tomasso’s claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-04916	"U.S. Olympic medal winners will owe up to $9,000 to the IRS."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/01/americans-tax-reform/do-olympic-medalists-owe-9000-irs/	With Americans paying close attention to the London Olympics, two leading figures in the conservative movement -- Grover Norquist and Marco Rubio -- have launched an effort to lighten the tax burden for athletes who win medals. A July 31, 2012, blog post on the website of Norquist’s group, Americans for Tax Reform, had the headline, "Win Olympic Gold, Pay the IRS: U.S. Olympic medal winners will owe up to $9,000 to the IRS." The ATR blog post continued, "American medalists face a top income tax rate of 35 percent," ATR wrote. "Under U.S. tax law, they must add the value of their Olympic medals and prizes to their taxable income. … At today’s commodity prices, the value of a gold medal is about $675. A silver medal is worth about $385 while a bronze medal is worth under $5. There are also cash prizes that accompany each medal: $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze." These prizes are given by the U.S. Olympic Committee. ATR went on to offer calculations of what medal winners might owe the IRS, using that 35 percent tax rate. A gold-medal winner would owe $8,986, while a silver-medal winner would owe $5,385 and a bronze winner would owe $3,502. These calculations were widely noted in the blogosphere. The following day, Aug. 1, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., introduced the Olympic Tax Elimination Act, which would "exempt U.S. Olympic medal winners from paying taxes on their hard-earned medals." Rubio’s news release said the U.S. tax code "is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success, and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness. Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics shouldn’t have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home." (A new Olympics tax exemption might make the tax code more complicated, but we digress.) After a reader notified us of this developing issue, we decided to fact-check ATR’s specific claim that "U.S. Olympic medal winners will owe up to $9,000 to the IRS." We checked with accountants who specialize in representing athletes and they agreed that the bonus would almost certainly be taxable. Our experts diverged somewhat over whether and how the medal would be treated for tax purposes, but we’ll assume for the purposes of our analysis that it is subject to taxation. We will also note that ATR said "winners will owe up to $9,000" -- a phrase that gives the group leeway for its estimates. Still, the experts we spoke to suggested that a $9,000 tax payment was unrealistically high. For most athletes, the payment will be less, and possibly quite a bit less. Here’s why: Business expenses An athlete who wins a medal bonus would be free to deduct any unreimbursed expenses from the bonus, lowering -- or maybe even eliminating -- their tax hit. In fact, accountants say an athlete would be crazy not to. "Anything used for the production of income is deductible," said Brad Bell, a partner with BGBC Partners LLP in Indianapolis who specializes in accounting for athletes. Greg Shafer, an accountant in Colorado Springs, Colo., added that "if they were my client and had to pay that kind of tax, I would say, ‘Well, what are your ordinary and necessary expenses?’ That could be travel, uniforms, cell phone use." The U.S. Olympic Committee is based in Colorado Springs, and Shafer said he has provided accounting services to athletes. So expenses for gymnasts might include tumbling classes, payments to coaches and travel costs to international meets. Cyclists would pay for new bikes and maintenance. An Olympian fencer told Forbes.com that her expenses for equipment and competitions run around $20,000 per year. Not every athlete earns as much as Michael Phelps The way the U.S. tax system is constructed, income is taxed at higher rates the higher your income goes. So the full 35 percent rate (known as the marginal rate) only kicks in on income earned after you pass a threshold of about $380,000. Below that level, income is taxed at lower tax rates. So even someone earning well into the six figures will likely see an overall (or "effective") tax rate quite a bit lower than 35 percent -- even before you take into account exemptions and deductions. When we contacted ATR, Ryan Ellis, the group’s tax policy director, defended the calculations. He said that when you’re isolating a specific element of someone’s income, it’s actually more appropriate to use marginal tax rates rather than effective tax rates, because in the calculation, the medal is the essentially the last piece of income being considered, and thus gets taxed at the highest marginal income rate. He added that while athletes may scrape by in low tax brackets in non-Olympic years, the Olympic year is the one in which they would have a reasonable shot of getting into a higher tax bracket -- if not 35 percent, then perhaps 33 percent or 28 percent, a rate that would still produce a high tax bill. Still, while some world-class athletes come into the Olympics as international superstars with lucrative endorsement deals, many athletes earn less. Though the data is incomplete, we did find one study conducted by the Track & Field Athletes Association that found that about half of track and field athletes who ranked in the top 10 in the U.S. in their event made less than $15,000 annually from the sport in sponsorship, grants and prize money. About 20 percent of such athletes made more than $50,000 annually. And beyond marquee athletes such as sprinters, milers and distance runners it's toughest of all, the study found. There’s anecdotal evidence as well. Marathoner Brian Sell, who made the 2008 U.S. Olympic team, told CNNMoney that it took years of struggle, including three years earning less than $25,000, before he made significant money from running. "It's a small percentage of people who make a real living in this sport," he told CNNMoney. "And if you didn't run well, you didn't get paid." An athlete earning the same $25,000 a year that Sell earned for three straight years would pay about 15 percent on gold medal winnings. That would be $3,851 -- before accounting for any allowable expenses. We should also note that there is nothing special or "extra" about the taxes levied on income derived from Olympic victories. They are the same taxes laid on any kind of income, whether that’s from wages or lottery winnings. Our ruling Americans for Tax Reform is correct that gold medalists’ winnings are taxable, and it provides some leeway by saying that U.S. winners could be taxed up to $9,000. Still, it’s not likely that anyone would pay that much per medal in taxes -- even if the winner was fortunate enough to have annual income well over $380,000 and refused to deduct any business expenses on their winnings. Any accountant worth their salt should be able to get the rate of tax on medal winnings much below $9,000, and maybe even to zero. We rate the statement Mostly False.

ranz-00019	We've gotta remember that we lost Te Reo through compulsion in schools	fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858175/fact-or-fiction-all-just-spin	Firstly, it’s important to point out that Te Reo is actually not compulsory in schools in New Zealand, despite recent recommendations made by the Waitangi Tribunal. What Mr Seymour is apparently referring to is a series of Māori language recovery programmes that began in the 1980s, targeted at young people and the education system – such as kōhanga reo (immersing pre-schoolers in the Māori language) and kura kaupapa (schooling in a Māori language environment). This had come after years of lobbying by Māori activists, who highlighted 1985 statistics showing that only about 12 percent of the Māori population (50,000 people out of the total population at the time) were fluent in Te Reo. This should be compared to 1919 statistics, in which 99 percent of Māori school children were native speakers. Te Reo Māori was only declared to be an official language of New Zealand in 1987. Maori Language WeekChildren celebrate Te Wiki o Te Reo in 2016 Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King According to the Health of the Māori Language Survey, after extensive work to re-establish the language (such as government funding for a Māori television channel, and community Māori language initiatives), the number of Māori who had “some Māori speaking skills” had risen to 136,700 speakers in 2001. However, only 13 percent of this population aged over 15 could read Te Reo “well” or “very well”, according to the same survey. A later survey in 2006 found the number who could read Te Reo “well” or "very well” had increased significantly to 23 percent. While proficiency in Te Reo was highest for the oldest Māori, the second highest age group was for 15 to 24-year-olds – indicating that Māori language teaching in schools, was, in fact, helping to revitalise the language. While the total proportion of the Māori population able to converse “well” in Te Reo dropped to 21 percent in the 2013 Census, the higher proportions of younger speakers in 2006 indicate the introduction of Te Reo in schools was a help, rather than a hindrance, to the survival of the Māori language. However, if Mr Seymour meant that Te Reo was "lost" through making English language compulsory in schools (and banning Te Reo), he was correct - as the statistics from 1919-1985 highlight a drop from 99 percent fluency to merely 12 percent.

pomt-05462	"We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/23/ted-nugent/ted-nugent-says-four-supreme-court-justices-declar/	Conservative rocker Ted Nugent, a board member of the National Rifle Association since 1995, throws his "fire-breathing intensity" behind his guitar — and the Second Amendment. On April 14, 2012, his NRA convention rhetoric caught the attention of the Secret Service, but the provocative speech — which was largely a call to action to get out the vote for Mitt Romney — also included some checkable facts about gun rights. One that caught our eye: "We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense." Here’s the setup: We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who don’t believe in the Constitution. Does everybody know here that four of the Supreme Court justices not only determined you don’t have the right to keep and bear arms, four Supreme Court justices signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense. That sounds like a stoned hippie. That doesn’t sound like a Supreme Court anything. It sounds like a supremely intellectually vacuous punk. To think that a human could think that humans don't have a basic right to self-defense is so bizarre to me — as to — my brain can't accept the information. And if you want more of those kinds of evil, anti-American people on the Supreme Court, then don't get involved, and let Obama take office again. Is the "Motor City Madman" correct about Supreme Court jurisprudence? District of Columbia vs. Heller We reached out to Nugent’s press contact and the NRA, but didn’t get a response. Still, we found a case with dissenting opinions signed by four justices that appears to be what he's referring to. (If Nugent offers us some other "declaration," we’ll be happy to update our item.) A quick refresher on the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: It says: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." The 2008 case District of Columbia vs. Heller struck down the District of Columbia’s handgun-ownership ban. It also marked the first time the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment secures an individual right to gun ownership. But the decision was split 5-4 — and justices who didn’t side with the majority offered two dissenting opinions. The dissents offered two views about self-defense. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, "There is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution." So, Stevens acknowledged a "common-law right," but not necessarily a constitutional right. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: "Thus I here assume that one objective (but, as the majority concedes ... not the primary objective) of those who wrote the Second Amendment was to help assure citizens that they would have arms available for purposes of self-defense. ... "I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree. ... Although I adopt for present purposes the majority's position that the Second Amendment embodies a general concern about self- defense, I shall not assume that the Amendment contains a specific untouchable right to keep guns in the house to shoot burglars. … "(T)he self-defense interest in maintaining loaded handguns in the home to shoot intruders is not the primary interest, but at most a subsidiary interest, that the Second Amendment seeks to serve." So, Breyer acknowledges that one objective of the Second Amendment -- but not the primary objective -- is to allow citizens guns for self-defense, along with "a general concern about self-defense," and "a subsidiary interest" in keeping loaded handguns at home. Stevens and Breyer, along with Justice David Souter and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined both dissenting opinions. That's four justices. But we should note that Stevens and Souter are no longer on the court, replaced in recent years by Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Nugent's phrase, "We've got four Supreme Court justices who ..." suggests he meant four current justices. Still, Sotomayor sided with the minority in a 2010 case, McDonald vs. Chicago, which affirmed the decision in District of Columbia vs. Heller, and Kagan hasn't yet tipped her hand. About the opinions themselves: We contacted a few attorneys who have argued before the Supreme Court to help us weigh whether those they could reasonably be described as "a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense." ‘Fundamental right’ It turns out "fundamental right" has a fairly specific meaning in constitutional law. Justices divide constitutional rights into categories, such as fundamental and nonfundamental. Fundamental rights, as you might have guessed, trigger a higher level of protection from the court. Laws that might infringe on such rights face "strict scrutiny." But regulations that infringe on nonfundamental rights have a much easier burden to pass constitutional muster. They just have to have "a rational basis." Clark Neily, an attorney who helped represent security guard Dick Anthony Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller, says it looks to him like the dissenting judges treated self-defense more like the court typically treats nonfundamental rights than fundamental rights. In other words, Nugent's characterization was reasonably accurate. Tom Goldstein, the publisher of SCOTUSblog who has argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court, agrees. "I think Ted is correctly describing what the dissenters … believe," he said. But Erwin Chemerinsky, the founding dean of University of California at Irvine School of Law, whose most recent book was The Conservative Assault on the Constitution, found Nugent’s statement misleading. "The statement from Justice Stevens was about whether the Second Amendment right to bear arms includes a right to have firearms in the home," he said. "The justices did not deny that self-defense is available as a defense in criminal cases in all 50 states. The Nugent statement made it seem that the justices were questioning that." In other words, Nugent’s use of the legal phrase "fundamental right" might make lay people think those justices disagree with self-defense as protection in criminal cases. We’re willing to give Nugent credit for using the correct term of art, in this case "fundamental right." Still, we’ll ding him for saying the justices signed their name to a "declaration," when he meant dissenting opinions in a court case — especially since they didn’t make it explicitly clear that self-defense was a nonfundamental right. Even Neily found that a stretch. Our ruling Nugent, an NRA board member for almost 20 years, told a crowd that, "We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense." We find the phrase "a declaration" an exaggeration, along with the suggestion that all four justices are still on the court. But he’s correct that four justices signed on to dissenting opinions in District of Columbia vs. Heller that find some right to self-defense — but arguably not a fundamental right earning the Supreme Court’s highest level of protection. He used the right phrase. Still, "a declaration" and "four justices" make the statement just partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07029	Says $6 billion projected to accumulate in the state’s rainy day fund is already used.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/04/charles-perry/charles-perry-says-6-billion-projected-accumulate-/	The latest state budget signed into law by GOP Gov. Rick Perry is expected to leave $6 billion-plus in the state’s so-called rainy day fund, right? Nope, says first-term state Rep. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, who told the Texas Tribune for a June 24 article that while the $6 billion indeed went unspent in the 2012-13 budget, that’s not the whole story. "We’ve got to get the message right," said Perry, who’s of no relation to the governor. "There’s been a lot of misinformation out there that there’s $6 billion in the fund that’s not been used. It’s been used." Eh? Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.6 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget, which runs through August. The governor recently told a New Orleans audience that Texas lawmakers balanced the budget while leaving $6 billion in a rainy day fund--a claim we rated Half True this week because his claim didn’t acknowledge some costs that lawmakers put off paying until 2013. "That’s the governor’s message," Rep. Perry told the Tribune. "That’s not Charles Perry the legislator’s message." In an interview with us, the representative conceded the Republican-guided Legislature did not earmark the money expected to pile up in the fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion. But, he said, that doesn’t mean it couldn’t have covered existing needs. Rep. Perry, informing us he’s a CPA by trade, said underfunding Medicaid by $4.4 billion and postponing $2.3 billion in payments to school districts to the fiscal year starting in September 2013 amount to obligations that can’t be denied. "It’s not accurate to say that (rainy-day) money is not restricted," he said. "We know we’re going to have to pay it." In separate interviews, Rep. Jim Pitts of Waxhachie and Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan, who chair the respective House and Senate budget-drafting committees, agreed lawmakers left the cited items dangling. Both cautioned, though, that much could change to ease pressures by 2013. The state’s economy could out-perform expectations, Medicaid caseloads might fall short of projections, Congress could even reduce what it expects states to chip in. Rep. Perry reminded us those are uncertain speculations. Plus, he suggested, it’s likely "we are going to see less and less money from the feds," noting that Congress is in talks to reduce federal spending and besides, states will ultimately be expected to pick up a share of the costs of the federal health care overhaul approved in 2010. Our take: Rep. Perry’s statement overreaches because the money projected to pile up in the fund has not been used. Still, the 2011 Legislature adjourned amid expectations that when legislators next gather, they will lean on the fund to cover $6 billion in unpaid expenses. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14521	In 2005 and 2007, " Joe Straus received a 100 percent rating by NARAL (the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League)."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/18/empower-texans/claim-shows-abortion-rights-group-gave-100-joe-str/	For years, Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio has been characterized on right-leaning websites like Breitbart and Red State as effectively pro-choice, in favor of abortion rights. Of late, SpeakerStraus.com, a site run by the Empower Texans Foundation, a tea party nonprofit, suggests Straus, who faces tea-party challengers in the March 2016 Republican primary, had a perfect pro-abortion voting record in the two legislative sessions before he became speaker in 2009. At the top of the SpeakerStraus.com page: A graphic stating Straus received a 100% legislator rating from NARAL Pro-Choice, an abortion rights advocacy group, in 2005. Further down on the page: "In 2007, Joe Straus received a 100 percent rating by NARAL (the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League)." Image from SpeakerStraus.com (fetched Feb. 12, 2016) We wondered if the foundation’s representation of NARAL’s ratings were accurate. As it turned out, the posted 2005 rating for Straus was inaccurate and the one for 2007 could arguably use a blinking asterisk. NARAL scorecards The foundation didn't respond to repeated inquiries. But we found the NARAL Pro-Choice Texas scorecards using the web’s Wayback Machine and confirmed their authenticity with a NARAL representative. In 2005, that year’s scorecard shows, the group gave Straus a 45 percent rating — not "100" — for his House votes. Straus leaned "pro-choice," the ‘05 scorecard says, in voting to require agencies getting funds for abstinence-only sex education to report to the state about successes reducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and also voting on the group’s side in four instances during action on abortion restrictions. But Straus otherwise took six "anti-choice" votes that session, the scorecard says, fueling his 5-of-11 rating. The group’s 2007 scorecard indeed shows a "100%" score for Straus based on his "pro-choice" vote against setting aside a NARAL-backed amendment to the 2008-09 state budget. But a web search led us to a Dec. 16, 2014, blog post by the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life’s Joe Pojman stating Straus’s 2007 rating "has little validity. NARAL’s scorecard is wrong." That is, Pojman wrote, Straus didn’t even vote on the amendment that NARAL’s scorecard cites for Straus’ "100." The 2007 vote Stop the carousel: Did Straus get his ‘07 "100" based on a single, possibly misreported vote? According to the ‘07 scorecard, Straus got his "100" for being 1-for-1 on the group’s scored votes in which he participated — a result confirmed by email by Zoey Lichtenheld, communications coordinator for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. Then again, the scorecard shows, Straus didn’t vote on 10 other items potentially affecting each House member’s NARAL rating; he wasn’t on the House State Affairs Committee where the votes occurred. Lichtenfeld said NARAL records indicate Straus on March 29, 2007, voted on the group’s side against tabling proposed Amendment 20 to the 2008-09 state budget, the committee substitute for House Bill 1. That amendment, offered by Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, sought to strip the state’s Alternatives to Abortion program of its $5 million in funding over two years and put that amount into child abuse prevention grants for community organizations. Alternatives to Abortion program The Alternatives to Abortion program’s state backing traces to 2005 when a rider to the 2006-07 appropriations act directed $2.5 million a year in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program "focused on pregnancy support services that promote childbirth" among women who don’t want abortions. The program took the form of a network of clinics run by the nonprofit Texas Pregnancy Care Network that offer counseling along with adoption and parenting resources. In 2011, lawmakers amended a 2003 law and newly required doctors to give patients a directory listing such centers (along with a sonogram and verbal explanation of the sonogram) 24 hours before performing an abortion. NARAL has been an outspoken opponent of the Alternatives to Abortion program and of crisis pregnancy centers in general, deeming them "outposts across the country with the sole purpose of preventing women from accessing abortion (through lies and coercion)." In a March 2011 report, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the Alternatives to Abortion program "bad health policy, bad fiscal policy," and described the program’s primary provider, the Texas Pregnancy Care Network, as "a wasteful and inefficient public structure" that "overestimated its budget needs by half a million dollars in FY 2010." House Journal: Straus absent from vote So, what was Straus’ position? We checked the Texas House Journal for voting details. It says Straus — who otherwise participated in 26 of 35 votes that day — was absent during the vote on Amendment 20, as were 11 of his colleagues. House-posted video of the floor action that day shows that after the amendment was offered, another legislator moved to table it. Next, Speaker Tom Craddick announced the unfavorable-to-NARAL result (89 ayes to 48 nays); the journal presents the same tally. From the video, we further determined that a few minutes after the vote, Straus wasn’t at his desk on the floor; members usually vote from their desks. The speaker’s press secretary, Jason Embry, said by email he wasn’t sure why Straus missed the decision. Our ruling The foundation says Straus in 2005 and 2007 received 100 percent NARAL ratings. To the contrary, Straus got a 45 percent "pro-choice" NARAL rating in 2005. And while he got that "100" in 2007, that result was based entirely on the group concluding that Straus sided with it on a budget amendment when, records show, he was absent from the scored vote. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-11769	In the House Republican bill, "70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/kevin-brady/does-70-percent-tax-bills-relief-go-those-making-u/	As crunch time in Congress approaches, Republicans are aggressively making the case that their tax bills will allow a broad swath of Americans to benefit. During a recent interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas -- the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- said that "70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000." When we took a closer look, we found Brady’s statistic to be somewhat misleading. The Joint Committee on Taxation study Brady's office pointed us to an analysis of the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan office of Congress charged with analyzing the impacts of tax bills. The committee released breakdowns of how much various income ranges would see their taxes collectively increase or decrease over the next decade. Because one of the divisions between income groups is at $200,000, it’s straightforward to break down what share of the benefits accrue above and below that income level. Brady’s office pointed us to one chart in particular. It shows the breakdown of gains on the income tax side of the proposal. Those below the $200,000 threshold get 69 percent of the benefits, while those above $200,000 get 31 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That’s in line with what Brady said -- but the talking point is cherry-picked. First, the ratio of gains above and below $200,000 change over time. By 2025, households below $200,000 get 52 percent, and by 2027, they get 51 percent -- still a majority, but significantly below Brady’s 70 percent figure. The bigger issue concerns what kinds of income are counted in the chart Brady used. As we’ve found in a previous fact-check, the chart Brady used addresses just the personal income tax changes in the bill. However, the bill would not only change personal income taxes; it would also change how other types of taxes are levied, including corporate and estate taxes. "A big part of the bill is slashing taxes on business income, which disproportionately affects high-income earners, as does eventually repealing estate tax," Len Burman, a co-founder of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us. These taxes are not factored into the personal-taxes-only data that Brady cited, so the chart he used underplays the positive impact the bill as a whole would have on wealthy households. As it happens, the same Joint Committee on Taxation assessment does analyze all aspects of the bill. We calculated the percentage of the total benefits going to those above and below $200,000 in income and summarized them here: Year Percentage of gains going to incomes under $200,000 Percentage of gains going to incomes over $200,000 2019 58 percent 42 percent 2021 63 percent 37 percent 2025 62 percent 37 percent 2027 50 percent 50 percent For each year, the percentages taken by the under-$200,000 households are lower than Brady’s 70 percent figure. But they are always a majority. An outside analysis Calculations from the Tax Policy Center show an even smaller share of benefits flowing to under-$200,000 households. That’s because the Joint Committee on Taxation does not include the benefits associated with eliminating the estate tax, and because the two groups use slightly different definitions of "income." The Tax Policy Center found that households below $200,000 in income would get about 54 percent of the House bill’s benefits. That percentage would shrink to about 31 percent by 2027. Our ruling Brady said that in the House Republican bill, "70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000." That’s only accurate if you look at the individual income tax portions of the House bill. Once you factor in tax changes related to business income, which tend to benefit wealthier taxpayers, the share earned by those under $200,000 is actually 58 percent in 2019, falling to 50 percent in 2027. And if you factor in the impact of the estate tax, it would be as low as 54 percent initially and 31 percent by 2027. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08878	"(Bill) McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-focus-mccollums-record/	Gubernatorial hopeful Bill McCollum has been in politics for much of his adult life, charting a wide map of potential minefields for his enemies to use against him. The Florida Democratic Party, no stranger to partisan warfare, took such aim in a July 26, 2010, press release, using the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act to remind voters of McCollum's initial concerns about the sweeping civil rights legislation. "Earlier this year, McCollum said he was proud of his efforts to pass the ADA when he was in Congress, noting there was 'Great Resistance' to the bill. McCollum neglected to state that he was a major player in the 'Great Resistance,' " wrote party spokesman Eric Jotkoff in the press release. The press release goes on, "He urged then-President George H.W. Bush to reconsider his support of the ADA ... McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs. McCollum then voted for final passage of the ADA, saying 'politically, it's a very tough vote.' " The Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law July 26, 1990, is considered one of the nation's most important civil rights victories. It requires that disabled Americans be provided reasonable access to employment, transportation, public buildings and communications services. It is widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, although some conservatives, libertarians and business groups have long expressed concern that the law puts an undue burden on public servants and employers to accommodate the disabled. The Democrats' claim that McCollum, who represented Florida in Congress for two decades, tried to water down the legislation and didn't want to help people in wheelchairs is an emotional charge. We wondered, is it true? In fact, congressional records show McCollum voted for several amendments to the bill. He supported Amendment 448, which would have specified that the costs required to accommodate the employment of a disabled person not exceed 10 percent of the annual salary or the annualized hourly wage of that job. In debate, McCollum said the amendment, "may be the most significant one from the standpoint of mitigating the cost to small business." It failed 187-213 on May 17, 1990. "Today, we are going to say that a company manager who earns $40,000 is entitled to a greater accommodation that the mail clerk who receives a salary of $15,000?" argued Rep. Dwayne Payne, D-N.J., according to congressional records. On May 22, 1990, the day the legislation passed in the House, records show McCollum voted for Amendment 452, which sought to exempt commuter rail services from the requirement that all new rail cars be readily accessible by persons with disabilities if the commuter rail service made at least one car per train accessible for the disabled. To qualify for the exemption, a rail service would have to add more accessible cars if the demand could not be met by just one car. Proponents of the rail amendment argued that the change offered more specific requirements, albeit different ones, than the original bill, and therefore provided greater protection. For example, the bill required all new purchased or leased buses and rail cars be accessible to the disabled but did not require retrofitting of existing vehicles. The amendment, singled out by the Florida Democratic Party in its press release, failed 110-290. The New York Times wrote at the time, "opponents said the effect of the proposed changes would be to segregate people with disabilities." McCollum also voted for Amendment 453 that day, which sought to provide an annual exemption to public transit systems in urban areas with populations of less than 200,000 from the bill's requirement that new vehicles be accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair users. To qualify for the exemption, the transit system would have to develop an alternative plan, such as a Dial-a-Ride service. "It is the people who need to get from their home to where they want to go, the people who cannot get to the bus stop, are the people who are going to suffer," said sponsor Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn. The amendment failed 148-266. "A civil right to equal transportation services does not diminish according to a city's population in the latest census," said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., according to Congressional Quarterly. Finally, McCollum voted for Amendment 454, which sought to keep plaintiffs from suing for monetary damages by limiting the remedies available to discrimination victims to those provided under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such as injunctive relief, back pay and attorney fees. Supporters argued the disabled should not have greater remedies than those available to women and minorities under the 1964 law. The amendment failed 192-227. "You have lesser rights if you have lesser remedies," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., at the time, according to Congressional Quarterly. On that amendment, McCollum argued at the time: "The real problem I have had with the ADA bill altogether, and I am going to vote for this bill, even though a lot of people think that I am out here with a lot of amendments and I am opposed, I am not, because I think the disabled need to have a civil rights bill like this one. I think the problem we have had all along has been costs. It has been a question of how do we mitigate, how do we reduce, costs. It is far more complex under the civil rights legislation for the handicapped than it is for race or sex or any other kind of discrimination. There may be as many as 900, some people say, 900 different disabilities covered by this legislation. There are innumerable different situations in the workplace where the handicapped of different types will intermesh, and those situations will have to be resolved hopefully through processes that are short of litigation. It will be expensive, and even if there is a resolution occasionally by litigation, that will undoubtedly be a very expensive route." McCollum then joined the majority to pass the legislation in a 403-20 vote. So, would the amendments he supported have weakened the legislation? The McCollum campaign did not respond to our questions on this point. But many experts on disability law said the amendments did attempt to undercut the bill. "These amendments sought to narrow the rights provided to individuals with disabilities," said Ruth Colker, author of The Disability Pendulum: The First Decade of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a law professor at Ohio State University. The amendments were "more pro business and anti-worker," said Paul Steven Miller, a University of Washington law professor and a former commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces employment discrimination laws. "They sort of run counter to what the ADA seeks to accomplish." We also checked whether the law was eventually altered to reflect the amendments supported by McCollum. It wasn't. To this day, Americans with disabilities can sue for monetary damages, there is no fiscal cap on how much an employer may spend to accommodate a disabled employer, and transportation systems still must be accessible. To be sure, the Americans with Disabilities Act does have its critics. After the legislation's passage, the libertarian Cato Institute published a policy analysis by economist Robert O'Quinn, that concluded, "the ADA so zealously pursues its mainstreaming goal that individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies must make expensive accommodations to ensure full integration even when less costly, more convenient alternatives, which are preferred by disabled individuals, are available." He continued, "The ADA is objectionable on moral as well as economic grounds. In a free society the government should employ its coercive powers only to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens from aggression. Any attempt to enforce moral behavior, however noble or desirable, is beyond the proper scope of government." In contrast, some advocates of the bill have complained that it did not go far enough. Our mission, however, is not to judge the value of the acclaimed legislation. The Florida Democratic Party claimed McCollum "voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs." We rate this claim True.

pomt-02276	"Greg Abbott said it would be a ‘waste’ to expand pre-k to all Texas children."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/07/wendy-davis/greg-abbott-says-no-universal-pre-kindergarten-wit/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis cited a news story as showing that Greg Abbott, the Republican choice for governor, unequivocally opposes providing pre-kindergarten to all Texas youngsters. About three hours after the Austin American-Statesman posted its March 31, 2014, story outlining Abbott’s just-revealed position on how best to serve the state’s youngest pupils, Davis put a photo-quotation on Twitter stating: "Expanding pre-k education to all Texas children is a ‘waste’ -- Greg Abbott." The tweet came to our attention from Matt Hirsch, an Abbott campaign spokesman. Davis’ message, retweeted more than 100 times by the next afternoon, asked followers of @WendyDavisTexas to sign a petition telling Abbott that "educating a child isn’t a waste." Her petition was topped by this statement: "As he rolled out his education plan today, Greg Abbott said it would be a ‘waste’ to expand pre-k to all Texas children." Did she get that right? Texas school districts have been required to offer pre-k to certain students since 1985, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Factors affecting eligibility include qualifying for a free- or reduced-price lunch, homelessness or the inability to speak or comprehend English, the institute says. In 2011-12, about 225,000 3- and 4-year-old Texans were enrolled in a pre-k class, the institute says. Abbott’s proposal states that nearly all the state’s districts offer a state-supported pre-k program. Clashing visions, plans The candidates are offering clashing visions at a time that some communities, including San Antonio, have moved to expand pre-k. The Statesman news story noted that Davis supports a broad expansion of full-day pre-k to all youngsters, costing the state about $750 million a year, the story said. In contrast, the story said, Abbott proposes spending an additional $1,500 per student in districts that agree to implement a "gold standard" program consisting of a rigorous curriculum and staff requirements plus assessments to measure effectiveness. Senator's back-up By phone, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said a section of Abbott’s proposal, headlined "Effective Pre-k Programs," was the basis of Davis’ tweet and petition statement. Abbott’s proposal states: "Expanding the population of students served by existing state-funded programs without addressing the quality of existing prekindergarten instruction or how it is being delivered would be an act of negligence and waste." The sentence was the second paragraph of the Statesman story. Petkanas said the part of Abbott's statement about the state needing to address quality issues--not mentioned in Davis' claim--didn't diminish the validity of her claim that Abbott said providing pre-k to more students would be a waste. Petkanas further suggested that nothing in Abbott’s plan envisions expanded pupil enrollments. Petkanas also pointed out a section of Abbott's proposal touching on the Head Start program. The "best available evidence," the proposal says, "raises serious doubts that a large public investment in the expansion of pre-k for four year-olds will have the long-term effects claimed by supporters. Lawmakers instead should improve Texas’ current framework to better serve the existing eligible students." Next, we read Abbott's plan with an eye out for indications he opposes expanded pre-k participation. Abbott's proposal According to the proposal, Abbott would want districts to participate in his quality-assurance program, but doesn't propose cuts in state aid for the half-day classes currently mandated. "This proposal would leave the existing pre-k rules untouched," Abbott’s proposal says, while creating the option for districts to seek more aid in return for gauging and ensuring results. The added state cost of Abbott's approach would initially be $118 million over two years, according to his plan. A footnote says that if every district with a program buys in, so to speak, "allocating enhanced funding for all eligible four-year-olds will cost an additional $294,444,000 annually." "Any increased investment in state-funded pre-K must tie outcomes to funding, and must provide incentives for private providers to offer high-quality kindergarten programs that meet the educational goals established by the state," the proposal states. Abbott’s plan calls any "across-the-board expansion" of pre-k without addressing quality a "disservice to Texas students," and it says he’d leave it up to individual districts to fund full-day pre-k from local funds. "Until a very high-quality, statewide half-day prekindergarten is achieved," Abbott proposes, "the Legislature should not mandate full-day, but rather lawmakers should allow schools to make that decision based on the needs of their community while still rewarding schools" that "manage a quality program." Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta emailed us the text of Abbott’s March 31 speech unveiling his pre-k ideas. The remarks speak to Texas transforming pre-k by sending more aid to districts that embrace the "gold standard" program. Abbott said districts adopting his "gold standard" would have leeway to determine effective ways to use the additional funding to meet requirements. "Some districts may choose to hire more teachers," his speech said. "Others may expand to full day pre-k. Others may choose to expand their existing partnerships with private providers." While critical of existing pre-k, Abbott's remarks don’t directly address the idea of expanding pre-k classes to full days. We asked Huerta how Abbott responded to reporter questions about full-day pre-k. By email, he presented a question and Abbott’s reply, which seems to indicate that "gold standard" participants could use the added state aid to offer full-day programs. In the exchange, Abbott also used the abbreviation for independent school districts: REPORTER: The Davis people are saying that what you proposed is not expanding pre-K. If so, why is that? ABBOTT: Well, if you go back and look at the plan, what our plan does is give flexibility to local ISDs [and] allow them to decide how they want to [approach] pre-K…Some can take that $1,500 and use it to expand to full-day. Others can [use] it to hire more teachers - you have an almost infinite number of ideas of ways they [can] use the money. They could, say, buy technology. Whatever it is they feel they need. They can use that to craft what they perceive as the best pathway to achieve the Gold Standard in pre-K 4. And so, full day is a possibility for local ISD pre-K 4 if they choose it to be the best pathway for them. Our ruling According to Davis, Abbott said expanding pre-k to all Texas children would be a waste. Abbott said nothing like that in his prepared remarks, while his plan unveiled the same day folds in a caveat that Davis disregarded. In the plan, Abbott says it would be a waste to offer pre-k to more students--without addressing quality. While the senator's statement leaves a misimpression, it also has an element of truth. Abbott wouldn't move now to fund all-day pre-k for all Texas toddlers. We grade the petition claim as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14111	The city of Clarkston "can’t decriminalize marijuana. Only state legislators and Congress can do that."	true	/georgia/statements/2016/may/11/vernon-keenan/georgias-top-cop-correct-about-citys-pot-plan/	Once the smoke clears, the tiny city of Clarkston could become the pot-friendliest place in the Peach State. Or so says 33-year-old Democratic Mayor Ted Terry. Known locally as "Mayor Ted," he is the only mayor in Georgia to publicly endorse Bernie Sanders for president. Terry and his City Council could vote next week on a plan to make possession of less than an ounce of pot an offense punishable by a small fine only -- possibly $5 to $15. Offenders could also be required to attend a Marijuana Awareness Program, a diversion course for people with risky behavior. Terry touts the proposal as a rational move to make low-level pot possession a public health issue instead of criminalizing users. Clarkston, which is about 1.4 square miles and has 13,000 residents, would become the first city in Georgia to do this -- Athens flirted with a similar idea but backed off. Some people contend it would be a de facto decriminalization of pot possession by the progressive DeKalb County municipality near Atlanta. The pot plan has made some in law enforcement bristle. "They can’t decriminalize marijuana," Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan recently told a newspaper reporter. "Only state legislators and Congress can do that." Keenan is a veteran top cop and a guy with more than a working knowledge of the law. But could he have overstated his case on this one? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. We contacted Keenan, who stood by his statement but declined to comment further. The Clarkston plan has also caught the attention of Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who gave it an immediate thumbs down. "We should not have any municipality or jurisdiction of state government saying that they’re willing to flaunt the law to downgrade or excuse what is otherwise criminal conduct," Deal recently told public radio station WABE. PolitiFact also contacted Terry, who surprisingly, agreed with Keenan -- but with a few, key caveats. "We are not decriminalizing it," Terry said. "We are just changing the way we punish it. The more appropriate term is deprioritization, moving to a ticket-only offense." Chuck Spahos, the director of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, said a move by Clarkston would only affect cases heard in Municipal Court. "Nothing is going to prevent the solicitor general or the district attorney from prosecuting those cases in State Court," he said. "All it does, it gives the citizens of that city a false sense of security." Terry said there were 77 arrests for low-level pot possession in Clarkston in the past year or so. About 50 of those defendants had their cases judged by Municipal Court. The other defendants had committed additional state crimes and their cases were heard in State Courts. Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said the city could certainly change its local ordinance and order police to make pot possession a low-level offense. But, he said, that’s only part of the equation. "If they got to an actual prosecution it’s less clear that the mayor would have control over the charges the prosecutors brought," Roosevelt wrote in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. Jessica Cino, a law professor at Georgia State University, said any real change in pot laws would have to come from the state level. "They (Clarkston) certainly can deprioritize it," Cino said. "But they are not going to be able to get around state law." A municipality can have that policy policewise," she added, "but anyone could still be arrested under state law." Our ruling. Vernon Keenan, Georgia top state cop, said the city of Clarkson "can’t decriminalize marijuana. Only state legislators and Congress can do that." Keenan is correct on that point -- even the mayor of Clarkston agrees with him. Clarkston can change its pot ordinance, and it can instruct its police officers to make pot enforcement a low-level priority. This, however, would not preclude the district attorney from bringing charges in State Court, which is beyond Clarkston’s control. We rate Keenan’s statement True.

pomt-00176	"Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/22/tony-evers/attack-scott-walker-tony-evers-misleads-claiming-h/	Continuing a series of attacks on Republican Gov. Scott Walker on health care, Tony Evers compares Wisconsin to Minnesota with a TV ad released Oct. 9, 2018. The state schools superintendent, who is the Democratic challenger to Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, uses a woman who describes her experience with Stage 4 breast cancer. She accuses Walker of wanting to play politics rather than deal with health care costs. Then the claim we want to check is made. This statement appears on the screen, as the woman speaks nearly the same claim: "Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care." So, with that statement, which is broad, Evers doesn’t directly blame Walker. But in the context of the ad, Evers at least suggests that the governor has failed to tackle what he claims is a drastic difference in costs between neighboring states. Evers’ claim has an element of truth, but it’s misleading in that it is overly broad. Join us for a free PolitiFact event in Milwaukee. Previous Evers claim Let’s start by noting that Evers made a similar claim earlier in the campaign. He said Walker refused federal funds and "Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50 percent more than Minnesotans for the same health care." Our rating was Mostly False. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. In that earlier claim, Evers talked about families when the data he cited to back up his statement was on individuals. But the bigger problem was that Evers blamed the cost difference on Walker’s refusal to accept additional federal aid to do an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), when many factors were at work, as experts told us then: 1. Other factors that determine premiums include reinsurance, risk pool differences and competition between insurers and providers, said a health care expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. 2. "It is just challenging to draw hard and fast conclusions when you’re just comparing one state to another, because states can have very different policy and market dynamics," a Georgetown University expert said. Evers has similar problems with the statement we’re checking now. New Evers claim As he did in his earlier claim, Evers in his new claim relies on data from a gold-standard source on health care, the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation. A table of data entitled "Marketplace Average Benchmark Premiums" shows the 2018 premium as $569 in Wisconsin $385 in Minnesota. That’s a difference of 48 percent, nearly what Evers claims in the ad. But Evers’ claim is broad -- and the premium data he cites is narrow. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Kaiser gathered figures for the second-lowest-cost silver premium for a 40-year-old in each county who buys individual insurance through the state and federal marketplaces that were created after the Affordable Care Act. So, we’re talking a relatively small slice of everyone who buys health insurance — individuals who buy it on their own. In contrast, most non-elderly people get their health coverage through an employer-based plan. And many people, including the elderly, are covered by programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. Broader measures can paint a different picture. For example, Walker’s campaign also cites Kaiser research, but on a measure involving more people — the average annual family premium per enrolled employee for employer-based health insurance. For 2017, the employee contribution in Minnesota was $4,998, slightly higher than the $4,842 in Wisconsin. Our rating Evers says: "Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care." On one measure — how much 40-year-old individuals pay for health insurance they buy on their own — the annual average premium is nearly 50 percent higher in Wisconsin than in Minnesota. But Evers’ statement is broad, and that measure is narrow, given that the vast majority of people get their health insurance through an employer or from the government. By one measure of employer-provided health insurance, the average annual premium paid by employees was actually 3 percent higher in Minnesota than in Wisconsin. Moreover, Evers suggests Walker has failed to address health care costs, when many factors are involved, especially in an apples-to-oranges comparison of two states. Evers’ statement has only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-15218	"Some of the things that (Megyn Kelly) said, I didn’t say."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/	Donald Trump maintained several times on the Sunday shows that he would not apologize for "totally appropriate" — yet widely criticized — comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who questioned him during the first GOP presidential debate about the way he’s talked about women over the years. "You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ " Kelly said. Trump cut her off with his index finger in the air, quipping it was "only Rosie O’Donnell." When the crowd’s roar settled, Kelly continued. "Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women’s looks. You once told a contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice it would be a ‘pretty picture’ to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the 'war on women'?" Trump, who owned up only to insulting comedian Rosie O’Donnell, disparaged Kelly after the debate — saying that she "behaved very badly," that "she had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever," and sharing a Twitter post that referred to her as a "bimbo" — only inflaming debate about whether he is a misogynistic threat to the GOP. NBC host Chuck Todd tried to get Trump to understand why his comments are perceived as sexist, bringing up New York Times columnist Gail Collins and singer Bette Midler as two more examples of times he went after a woman’s "looks." "Well, some of the things that she said, I didn't say, okay?" Trump said of Kelly. "And she went through a whole list. And this is a hell of a first question, by the way. But I will say this, I was attacked by the people that you talk about." We decided to fact-check whether Kelly said things that Trump didn’t say and look at the context of some of his other arguments with high-profile women. A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign could not be reached for comment. ‘Fat pig,’ ‘slob’ and ‘animal’ Kelly said Trump had referred to women as "fat pigs" and "slobs." As he admitted during the debate, Trump has leveled both invectives at O’Donnell, the comedian and former panelist on The View. He rattled off the first in a Dec. 29, 2006, interview with Fox News while imagining how O’Donnell’s ex-wife Kelli might have explained the couple’s relationship to her parents. "Can you imagine the parents of Kelli ... when she said, 'Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a big, fat pig named Rosie?’ " he said. Trump also referred to O’Donnell as an "animal" and a "slob" in 2006. So the insults clearly happened, apparently spurred by comments O’Donnell made on the Dec. 20, 2006, episode of The View. After Trump announced he would not fire a Miss USA winner who had been accused of drug use, underage drinking and "sexual indiscretions," O’Donnell criticized Trump’s personal and professional dealings, pointing out that a few of Trump’s companies had gone bankrupt in the past and calling him a "snake-oil salesman." O’Donnell also lamented Trump’s appearance as the "moral authority" in the scandal, pointing to his two divorces as evidence that he should not be considered "a model for the nation’s 20-year-olds." ‘Dogs’ Kelly said Trump called women "dogs." One incident, as Todd brought up, refers to an insult he allegedly directed at Gail Collins, a liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times who had interviewed Trump during his early years as a developer. In a 2011 Times column, Collins wrote, "He is extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. During one down period, I referred to him in print as a ‘financially embattled thousandaire,’ and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and ‘The Face of a Dog!’ written over it." We could not independently verify Collins’ claim, or dig up her original story from a "down period" for Trump. But Trump directed similar language at Arianna Huffington on Twitter in April. ‘Disgusting’ Kelly also referenced Trump’s treatment of a lawyer during a lawsuit involving one of his Florida developments. In a 2011 lawsuit, Elizabeth Beck, a lawyer representing Trump’s opponents, asked for a medical break, saying she had to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter. But Trump objected, calling Beck "disgusting" when she took out the pump. Trump left the deposition, halting the day’s proceedings. Trump once traded barbs with the singer and actress Bette Midler, as Todd pointed out on Meet the Press. In 2012, Midler tweeted about Trump: "The man who has ruined New York seeks to ruin the nation." Midler deleted the tweet, but later referred to him as "stupid" and called his hairstyle a "terrible dye job someone talked him into." Trump replied by calling Midler "disgusting," as well as "grotesque," "ugly," and a bad singer. We could not find documentation of an exact time he said "disgusting animal," but he has certainly used both words. The Celebrity Apprentice Another remark came in 2013 during an episode of Trump’s reality show, The Celebrity Apprentice. During a judging session with Trump, former rocker Bret Michaels described a female contestant, Playboy playmate Brande Roderick, as "falling to her knees" and begging not to be fired. "Excuse me," Trump said. "You dropped to your knees?" "Yes," Roderick said. "It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees," Trump said. Our ruling Trump said that "he didn’t say" some of the things about women that Kelly talked about. The record, however, shows the opposite is true. He has said exactly what Kelly mentioned in the debate. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9520c998-b1af-4223-a6b2-7acb3ccbb9c9	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-10T13:39:11	2015-08-09	['None']
pomt-10883	"I used tax cuts to help create over 80,000 jobs in New Mexico."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/01/bill-richardson/richardson-takes-credit-for-new-jobs/	Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that New Mexico gained 75,800 jobs from December 2002 to July 2007, which is slightly lower than Richardson's claim. As our friends at FactCheck.org note in this article , Richardson has consistently cited the higher number, even when the actual number was lower. For our ruling, however, we'll rely on the current 75,800 and call it mostly true. It's difficult to calculate how big a role his tax cuts played in getting businesses to create those jobs. James Peach, an economics professor at New Mexico State University, said many factors make a company decide to add jobs and that tax incentives often play only a modest role. Indeed, much of the job growth in the state began before Richardson became governor, Peach said. Still, Peach said Richardson's tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state's mentality in the mid-1970s, when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named Microsoft. "The climate here has changed considerably since then," Peach said. "Bill Richardson has been a big part of that. He's not the whole story, but he's been a big part of it."

pomt-04438	"The Canadians — they (dropped) their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-canada-now-has-15-percent-corporate/	Canada doesn’t often get mentioned in political debates in the United States, but our northern neighbor had a cameo in the vice presidential debate, cited as a bastion of low taxes. Seeking to draw a contrast with the tax policies of President Barack Obama, Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin native, said, "Where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior — the Canadians — they drop their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent." We wondered whether Canada was really as much of a low-tax haven as Ryan indicated. Canadian corporate taxes We found two measurements of Canada's corporate tax rate from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. Over the past 15 years, the trendline for both has been consistently downward. Since 1998, the central government corporate rate has declined from 29.12 percent to 15 percent today; while the combination of the central and provincial corporate tax rates has fallen from 42.94 percent to 26.1 percent today. So Ryan is right that Canada’s national rate was recently lowered to 15 percent -- the culmination of policies put forward by both center-left prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin and current center-right prime minister Stephen Harper, who took office in 2006. Small businesses today have a special, lower rate of 11 percent. Still, it’s worth noting that when you take into account average provincial tax rates -- the equivalent of state corporate taxes in the U.S. -- the combined corporate tax rate in Canada rises to 26.1 percent. International comparisons What about Ryan’s claim that the "average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent"? We can use the same OECD data to check this claim. Averaging the 2012 tax rates for OECD members, we found that the average for the 34 countries studied is just slightly under 25 percent. That’s just as Ryan said. And in case you’re wondering, the top U.S. corporate tax rate, including both federal and state taxes, is 39.1 percent. That’s quite a bit higher than Canada’s, and since April, it has been the highest corporate tax rate on the books of any OECD nation. Still, the actual tax rate paid by a company will likely be lower than the official rate, due to deductions and exemptions. Our rating Ryan said Canada dropped its corporate tax rates to 15 percent and that "the average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent." He’s correct on both counts, though it’s worth pointing out that provincial taxes boost Canada’s rate to 26.1 percent, and that the actual rate paid by specific companies in certain countries, such as the U.S., can be lower than official rates due to deductions and exemptions.

pomt-06572	"It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/29/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-executions-cost-more-life-impris/	Opposition to the death penalty is one of those issues where the libertarian wing of the Republican party sometimes loops around to meet left leaning Democrats. Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico and contender for the GOP nomination, enjoys stirring the pot within his party, and on a visit in New Hampshire he said, "It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees." Set aside for a moment that capital punishment is mainly up to the states. Beyond the federal death penalty, presidents don't have much to do with the matter. Johnson is making a fiscal argument -- the death penalty costs too much -- and he's making it at a moment when state budgets face huge pressures. Elected officials and taxpayers in every state might be curious to know if he's right. The Johnson campaign cites the Death Penalty Information Center as the source of its claim. The website of this anti-death penalty group lists 18 studies that examine costs. All of them conclude that as soon as a prosecutor decides to go for capital punishment, the price tag just for the legal work itself goes up. How much depends on the state. A 2008 study in Maryland found it was three-times more expensive; an analysis from Indiana in 2002 said it costs five- times more. No one on either side of the issue disputes these higher costs. Remember, we’re only talking about the legal process, not the cost of keeping someone behind bars or paying for the executions themselves. DPIC Executive Director, Richard Dieter, says when the death penalty is on the table, the constitutional scrutiny is intense with more lawyers and more hearings. "People are more skeptical," Dieter said. "There are more tests -- DNA, mental illness, retardation, experts are brought in." To get at the full picture, the legal costs, plus everything else, arguably the most useful report is one that doesn’t appear on the DPIC web site, although it is cited by several that do. It comes from George Mason University and sizes up what it called three of the best studies with an eye on the big question, does a sentence of life without parole cost less than the death penalty? The results tend to support the idea that imprisonment is cheaper but not across all three states examined. In North Carolina, researchers said a life sentence would save $163,000 per case; Indiana pegged the number a bit lower at $116,000. But in Tennessee, analysts concluded that executions were cheaper by a lot -- some $773,000. The value of the George Mason study is it picks apart the data behind those numbers. It has high praise for the Indiana work, calling it the gold standard for assessing costs. It gives a nod to the North Carolina team but notes that the work was done in the early 1990’s and is dated because the rules for death penalty cases have changed. As for the Tennessee research, it notes that it relied on very limited data, something that the authors in Tennessee acknowledged. Not the least of the problems was that Tennessee had executed just one person during the period the study analyzed. The main problem Gov. Johnson might have in supporting his claim is that the death penalty plays out differently from state to state. States apply the death penalty to different crimes. Some put more money into giving the accused a strong defense and find their convictions upheld. Others cut corners on the front end and wind up paying for two trials. The court systems in some states get bogged down administering the cases of hundreds of people on death row; others work with ten or fewer. All of these factors affect how quickly a state processes a death penalty case and speed has big implications for a key piece of Johnson’s argument, that it’s the legal fees that make the death penalty more expensive. The common belief is that appeals are where most of the dollars go. That too depends on the state. A detailed study of more than two decades of murder prosecutions in Maryland found that 70% of the costs come in the pre-trial and trial phases. But the author of that study, John Roman, says in other states, lengthy appeals eventually can add up. In 2008 alone, California set aside $42 million just for the appeals process, or about $68,000 per inmate on death row. As with every other step in these cases, the government generally pays for both the prosecution and the defense during appeals. To some people, the solution lies in making the death penalty swifter. Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group that supports the death penalty, says states like Virginia have built a process that is fair and, in capital punishment terms, speedy. From conviction to execution takes about seven years in Virginia. In California, it runs closer to 20 years. The average is over 10 years. "You get more bang for your criminal justice buck in Virginia," Rushford said. "Johnson can make that speech in California. He couldn't make it in Virginia or Delaware." At the end of the day, it’s difficult to make broad statements about the cost of the death penalty that hold true in every state. The dollars spent depend on many factors, including how many people the government tries to put on death row, how it handles appeals and the fraction of death row inmates that ultimately are executed. The author of the Maryland study, John Roman, has a rough rule of thumb for determining which is cheaper, life imprisonment and death. It's not one that the death penalty opponents would like. "If you don't execute lots of people," Roman said, "the death sentence is more expensive." Because the costs of appeals add up over time. On the other hand, Roman continues," If you execute lots of people, then life imprisonment probably turns out to be more expensive." And that's because, the shorter the time between sentencing and execution, the less the government spends on appeals and imprisonment. Our Ruling Johnson said life imprisonment is cheaper than the death penalty because of attorney fees. If we define attorney fees broadly, there is ample evidence that as soon as a prosecutor decides to seek capital punishment, it dramatically increases the price tag for taxpayers, who are paying for the defense as well as the prosecution. The meter continues to run during the appeals process. The shorter that process, the greater the cost effectiveness of an execution. But as a practical matter, for reasons rooted in both state and federal procedure, the process often lasts close to a decade or more. That means that the costs in some states don't support Johnson's claim that life imprisonment is cheaper because of attorney's fees. So we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00297	Says Elissa Slotkin’s plan is to take Medicare away from current senior recipients.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/26/mike-bishop/no-elissa-slotkin-does-not-support-plan-would-take/	The race for the U.S. House seat in Michigan’s 8th district continues to heat up between Republican incumbent Mike Bishop and Democratic opponent Elissa Slotkin. In his latest move, Bishop aired a 30-second TV ad featuring a senior couple from Brighton – Ann and Richard. The couple, whose last names were not displayed, say that "Medicare saved them" and accuse Slotkin of supporting a policy that would bankrupt Medicare and leave them with nothing. Richard: "When Ann was in the hospital, we thought we may lose everything." Ann: "Medicare saved us." Richard: "We are on a fixed income." Ann: "We have to keep to a budget. So I write down all of our bills." Richard: "Slotkin’s plan is to take most everything we have and give it away. We paid into the system. Why would she want to take this away from us?" Richard: "Medicare needs protecting. Elissa Slotkin doesn’t get that." The ad contains no onscreen sources, recordings by Slotkin, or links to offer evidence or context. We found no evidence to suggest that any of Slotkin’s positions on health care would result in taking away coverage for current seniors. Slotkin’s stance We looked into Slotkin’s stance on health care and reviewed various reports, as well as her remarks at events, in interviews and on her campaign website. We found that she does not support Medicare for All -- a program proposed in 2017 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to create a single-payer health care system -- and has routinely criticized the single-payer system. Slotkin does, however, suggest a buy-in option for Medicare. "I believe all Americans should have access to health care they can afford, regardless of pre-existing conditions," Slotkin says on her campaign website. "To get there, I believe we need true bipartisan reform of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We should also consider options that would allow people the choice to buy into plans, such as Medicare, that have been proven to control costs for consumers." The option would allow any American to buy into the program, which is now only for seniors. It would also be optional, and those choosing to buy-in would likely have to pay full prices, something that current Medicare recipients do not. "Slotkin has been outspoken on the need to lower health care costs," Laura Epstein, Slotkin’s spokesperson, said in a response to the ad. What the Bishop campaign says In a news release, the Bishop campaign wrote that Slotkin’s plan is "risky" and would make Medicare premiums higher, along with taxes and would threaten to end Medicare. In the release, the campaign cites a study from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason University, that said Medicare for All would increase the demand for health care services while also cutting payments to providers. The study suggests that the system would cost $32 trillion over the next 10 years and wound Medicare. But the study doesn’t analyze a Medicare buy-in program, nor does it suggest that such an option would be harmful to current Medicare recipients or that it would somehow create the Medicare for All proposal. Stu Sandler, a consultant for Bishop, said that expanding Medicare to buy-ins risks higher premiums, reduces senior access and threatens the solvency of Medicare. In an October 2009 Congressional Budget Office report, the office found that the Medicare buy-in plan proposed by Democrats during discussions of the Affordable Care Act would include negotiated payment rates with all providers and suppliers, and providers would not be required to participate in a public plan in order to participate in Medicare. The report also pointed out that the public plan would have to charge premiums that covered its costs, including the costs of paying back start-up funding that the government would provide. However, nowhere in the analysis does it say that Medicare’s financial solvency would be threatened beyond its current state. So would a buy-in to Medicare hurt coverage or costs for current recipients? A buy-in to Medicare would be complex because of the program’s multiple parts, such as institutional services (hospitals), physicians, drugs and more. But when it comes to the core question of whether the option would drive costs up for current seniors, the answer is most likely, no, according to John Holahan, an economist with the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. It all comes down to a separate risk pool. "If the costs for those under 65 who would be allowed to buy in, if those costs are kept in a separate risk pool from the current Medicare program, then it really has no impact on that program," Holahan told PolitiFact. The AARP Public Policy Institute made similar points, saying that a buy-in could be a solution for those without employer coverage, but also said its design would have to address the need for subsidies to make premiums affordable. AARP said that the pros of a buy-in could provide: • Guaranteed access, continuity of coverage and overall stability for many older adults. • Better health and lower future Medicare costs. • Efficiency and speed of building on existing infrastructure. The organization’s concerns about a buy-in: • If it was financed through existing trust funds, it would hasten insolvency. • Further erosion of employer-sponsored retiree health benefits. • Adverse selection could limit its appeal. But, again, this is all to say that regardless of the form that a Medicare buy-in could take if implemented, it is not the same thing as Medicare for All. "Medicare for All often means we are going to outlaw private insurance," Holahan said, "and this option seems like if you’re thinking about buying into the Medicare plan, if that’s better for you, you can do that or you can also keep your private insurance. It’s a choice." Our ruling Bishop's ad says that Slotkin’s plan is to take Medicare away from current senior recipients. But the campaign’s argument relies on suggesting Slotkin supports Medicare for All, a single-payer program, that would get rid of private insurance and provide health care to all Americans. Slotkin does not support such a program, but has suggested allowing Americans a buy-in option to Medicare, alongside private insurance. And while some studies have suggested a Medicare buy-in may help ease the transition to a single-payer system, they are still two separate ideas. The ad lacks context and ignores that Slotkin has repeatedly said she does not approve of such a program. We rate it False.

pomt-06357	"Corrupt political bosses. Money laundering. Fraud. It’s just another day at the office for Vin Gopal."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/04/new-jersey-republican-state-committee/vin-gopal-targeted-gop-attack-ad-new-jersey-assemb/	Dirty politics is nothing new in the art of campaigning, especially in the final days running up to an election. But sometimes, those dirty tactics reach the point of utter filth. Take the case of an attack ad by the New Jersey Republican State Committee against 11th District Assembly candidate Vin Gopal. Democrats Gopal and Kathleen Horgan are challenging Republican incumbents Caroline Casagrande and Mary Pat Angelini for the seats to represent parts of Monmouth County. "Corrupt Political Bosses. Money Laundering. Fraud. It’s Just Another Day At The Office For Vin Gopal," reads a campaign mailer circulating in the district. The ad shows a $100 bill hanging from a clothesline and features Star-Ledger headlines from articles about former Assemblyman Joseph Vas, who was sentenced to 6 ½ years in prison for stealing affordable housing funds when he was Perth Amboy’s mayor and for committing federal election fraud. From February to June 2006 -- when he was a 20-year-old political science student -- Gopal was a campaign manager for Vas during his primary campaign for congress. The ad also shows a washing machine with money inside and a statement below it that reads "To you, this might look like someone illegally laundering money … To Vin Gopal, it looks like Pay Day!" The ad seems to imply that Gopal had a connection to Vas and his criminal activities, but does not accuse Gopal of any criminal act. PolitiFact New Jersey found that readers of the ad could infer improprieties by Gopal, but there’s no proof that he did anything wrong. One of the article headlines shown in the ad reads "Aide to former Perth Amboy Mayor Joseph Vas pleads guilty to money laundering." Gopal, a Long Branch resident and business owner, said what bothers him most about the ad "is the implying and lying that I was that aide." We pulled the Star-Ledger article and found that the aide in question was Raymond Geneske, who was a campaign adviser to Vas. Geneske was sentenced in January to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine for participating in a scheme to funnel contributions to Vas’s congressional campaign. Gopal, who told us that he was never contacted by any law enforcement agency or official about Vas, is not mentioned in the article. We checked further by running Gopal’s name through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records database covering federal courts and bankruptcies and found that he was never charged with a crime. The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office said it had never heard of Gopal and the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office confirmed that Gopal had no connection to the Vas case. "The (Republican) State Committee is not suggesting Mr. Gopal committed a crime," Communications Director Rick Gorka said in an email. "Rather, it is suggesting that he had a front row seat for the corruption that plagues New Jersey's political process. The fact is, Mr. Gopal, a career political operative, was the campaign manager of Vas for Congress, a campaign of a sitting State Legislator who was at the center of federal and state corruption investigations and charges. He was paid from Joe Vas’s campaign account. "Indeed, as the campaign manager he was presumably responsible for expenditures from that account," Gorka continued. "If he didn't know where the money was coming from, he should have. In the past he has been proud of his association with that campaign, touting it in his bio when he was deputy campaign manager for the short-live Kucinich for President Campaign. Now he's seeking to run away from it. The State Committee thinks the voters have a right to know about Vin Gopal's connections to those sordid events." A "career political operative?" Gopal, 26, became involved with the Vas campaign when he was a 20-year-old student at Pennsylvania State University majoring in political science and wanted to work on a campaign for class credit and to gain experience in politics. Gopal told us he applied to 20 campaigns and eventually went to work as a campaign manager for the Vas campaign. He had also worked on other campaigns. Vlad Gutman, campaign manager for the District 11 Democrats, said that although Gopal had the title of campaign manager with Vas, he managed no personnel and "was the most junior position" on staff. "I would talk to the press briefly about events he (Vas) would do in a day, set up phones, work with volunteers, handle scheduling," Gopal said of his responsibilities. "I never had anything to do with money, never saw money, never was at any fundraisers." Gopal said he learned about the case against Vas when he saw a newspaper article about it two years after leaving the campaign, and attributes the current spate of attack ads to what he called "desperation." "The things they’re doing are borderline slanderous," Gopal said. "It’s unethical. They’re lying and misleading the public in every way possible to hide their failed actions in this district." Our ruling The Republican state committee distributed an ad in the 11th Assembly District that links Gopal to Vas, a disgraced politician convicted of election fraud and other offenses. Gopal worked four months on Vas’ unsuccessful congressional campaign. Gopal dealt with scheduling, phone banks, volunteers and occasional media queries. Given that law enforcement and a public database all confirm that Gopal had no connection of any kind to the Vas criminal case, the implications made by the ad aren’t just ridiculous, they’re also outrageous. Some laundering is definitely needed because this claim is Pants on Fire! To comment on this article, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13388	Says Donald Trump "started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/true-hillary-clinton-says-federal-government-sued-/	After years of repeating conspiracies that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Donald Trump finally backed away from the so-called birther movement earlier this month. But that didn’t stop the question from coming up during a key exchange at Monday’s presidential debate in New York. Hillary Clinton said Trump embraced a "racist lie" and it demonstrated a pattern that carried over from his business practices. "Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans," she said. That’s quite the charge, but is it true? Yes. It turns out he was. In 1973, Trump, as a 27-year-old, was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management. It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. By all accounts, including his own, Trump was a hands-on president and very active in managing the day-to-day business operations. That year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race. "The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings," the complaint reads. Black people, the government found, were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent. In one instance, a black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18, 1972, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot. The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government said the company’s comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said "C" for "colored" to every application submitted by a person of color. Trump vehemently denied the claims, which he called "absolutely ridiculous," according to a 1973 New York Times article. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But he did offer an explanation in the debate. "As far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued," Trump said. "We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do." Indeed, both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle. Trump claimed victory, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: "In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt" However, under the agreement, Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements. It’s also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly -- "north of 98 percent," Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law, previously told PolitiFact. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt. "That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence" against Trump, Schwemm said. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump "started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans." Both parts of the statement are carefully worded and accurate. The Justice Department sued Trump, his father and their company under the Civil Rights Act in 1973. In many instances, the government said, prospective black tenants were blocked from renting in his buildings. The case was settled and Trump never admitted guilt, though his company had to agree to stipulations meant to prevent future discrimination at his rental properties.

pomt-03492	"If Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/10/bob-gibbs/rep-bob-gibbs-says-30-million-will-be-left-uninsur/	On May 16, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives held its 37th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act that was enacted in 2010. Because the U.S. Senate is controlled by Democrats, the House had no real chance to repeal the law. As the Washington Post reported that day, its main purpose was to give Republicans a platform to bring up their objections to the law they call "Obamacare." Holmes County Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs was eager to take advantage of that opportunity. Before the vote, he delivered a House of Representatives floor speech in which he described the law as "detrimental to all Americans" and said that if the U.S. Senate "really wants to pass a jobs bill, then they should listen to the American people and support repeal and replace." The next day, Gibbs used his Twitter account to decry the law further. "If #Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance," Gibbs tweeted. We decided to check out Gibbs’ claim that so many people would still be without health insurance after the bill is fully implemented. Although Gibbs’ office did not respond to requests to document his information, we found a Congressional Budget Office analysis released three days before Gibbs’ remark that stated: "In our current projections for 2023, the ACA reduces the number of people without health insurance by 25 million, leaving 31 million uninsured (compared with 30 million in our February estimate)." That’s close to the number that Gibbs provided. A widely circulated CBO report from last summer said the "ACA, in comparison with prior law before the enactment of the ACA, will reduce the number of nonelderly people without health insurance coverage by 14 million in 2014 and by 29 million or 30 million in the latter part of the coming decade, leaving 30 million nonelderly residents uninsured by the end of the period." Gibbs’ statement that 30 million people will be uninsured after the health care law’s full implementation is close to the CBO’s latest estimate, but it ignores a key fact: the number of people without insurance would be much higher without the law. In the next 10 years, 25 million nonelderly people who don’t have insurance now would gain insurance under the bill. That’s important context that Gibbs overlooks in his tweet. According to CBO, the insurance rate for the nation’s non-elderly residents is predicted to rise from 80 percent this year to 90 percent in 2023. While Gibbs is right that many people will not have insurance after the law is implemented, his statement fails to acknowledge that it will enable millions of people to get insurance. We rule his statement Mostly True.	None	Bob Gibbs	None	None	None	2013-06-10T06:00:00	2013-05-17	['None']
pomt-06825	"I built the last nuclear plant — not only in the state, but in the country."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/09/tom-kean-sr/former-gov-tom-kean-says-he-built-last-nuclear-pow/	Former Gov. Tom Kean recently claimed he "built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country." The remark, published in an Aug. 1 question-and-answer column in The Star-Ledger, was in response to the question: "Hearings began this week on Gov. Christie’s new energy plan, which includes a nuclear component. Realistically, do you think New Jersey would accept a new nuclear plant?" Kean, a Republican, replied: "I built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country. It wasn’t easy politically, but Republicans and Democrats got together and acted for the future of the state. It’s almost impossible to rely totally on fossil fuels, as of now, there are not enough alternatives. If we want efficient, cheap, nonpolluting energy, we may have to accept a new plant." But did Kean really build the last nuclear power plant in the state and the nation? He’s right about New Jersey, but wrong about the country -- though it’s worth noting that during his tenure as governor, one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind to be built in the United States started commercial operations. New Jersey is home to four nuclear power plants. The Oyster Creek plant in Lacey Township in Ocean County is operated by Illinois-based Exelon Generation. PSEG Nuclear, a subsidiary of PSEG Power, operates the other three plants -- Salem 1, Salem 2 and the Hope Creek Generating Station, all of which are in the same complex in Lower Alloways Creek Township in Salem County. Hope Creek and Oyster Creek are two of 23 boiling water reactors in the United States with General Electric Mark I containment systems -- similar to the ones at Japan’s ill-fated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which sparked a nuclear crisis after it sustained damage from a massive earthquake in March. Kean told PolitiFact New Jersey he was referring to Hope Creek and said he was basing his statement on a conversation he had with an expert at a nuclear conference he recently attended. But data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission shows -- and a spokesman for the agency confirmed -- that Hope Creek wasn’t the last nuclear plant built in the nation. According to data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a construction permit for Hope Creek was issued on Nov. 4, 1974. Joe Delmar, spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, said actual "shovel in the ground" construction began in 1976. In July 1986 -- during the beginning of Kean’s second gubernatorial term -- an operating license was issued for the plant and commercial operations began there that December, according to the federal nuclear agency’s data. Construction hasn’t started on any new nuclear power plants in New Jersey since -- though PSEG Power and PSEG Nuclear have submitted an application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review whether its Salem County site could support another nuclear power plant. Now, let’s take a look at nuclear power plants throughout the country. Because Kean took office in 1982, after construction had begun on Hope Creek, we’re only going to focus on nuclear power plants that started commercial operations after Hope Creek. Of 104 nuclear power plants in operation in the U.S., 19 started operating commercially after Hope Creek, according to federal data. The last reactor to start commercial operations in the United States is the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee in 1996. Scott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates Watts Bar, has had a valid construction permit for a second reactor at the same location, and has applied for an operating license. The federal agency expects to have a final decision on that application next year, Burnell said. Back to Kean’s statement. The former governor said he "built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country." Hope Creek was completed during Kean’s tenure and it is the last nuclear plant built in New Jersey. So he’s right there. But, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Hope Creek isn’t the last nuclear power plant to be built in the United States. Kean would be correct if he had said he built one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind in the United States. But he didn’t specify, so we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01729	San Antonio is "now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African American woman mayor."	true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/06/henry-cisneros/ivy-taylor-first-african-american-female-serving-m/	San Antonio’s onetime mayor, Henry Cisneros, offered praise when the Alamo City’s City Council chose Council Member Ivy Taylor to serve out Julián Castro’s term as mayor. The July 22, 2014, council action was touched off by Castro leaving to become U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a post also previously held by Cisneros. Cisneros reacted in a statement we spotted on Twitter: "The decision by our City Council to select Ivy Taylor to become mayor of San Antonio for the next year underscores once again San Antonio’s place as one of the most inclusive and fair-minded cities in America. I believe we are now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African-American mayor." Is that so? We emailed Cisneros asking how he reached his assessment and also reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based National League of Cities, which describes itself as a research and advocacy group for 19,000 municipalities. A league administrator, Jim Brooks, responded by phone, noting first that because San Antonio is among the nation’s 10 most-populous cities, this claim has a limited scope. As of July 1, 2012, according to the U.S Census Bureau, San Antonio’s nearly 1.4 million residents placed it seventh nationally in population behind New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix. (It's worth keeping in mind the bureau's city population estimates don't take into account surrounding metro areas.) Brooks said Baltimore, Md., has an African American woman as mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, initially sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, according to a City of Baltimore web page. Brooks noted, too, that Shirley Franklin, an African American, is the former mayor of Atlanta. Franklin, who now teaches at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, was Atlanta’s mayor from 2002 to 2010. Each of those cities is home to far fewer residents than San Antonio. As of July 2012, according to the bureau, Baltimore had about 622,000 residents; Atlanta was home to an estimated 443,000-plus residents. Based on his 25 years working on city issues, Brooks said, he was unaware of mayors who would disprove Cisneros’ statement. We reached another person with perspective, E. Faye Williams, the president/ceo of the National Congress of Black Women. Williams said by phone the cities larger than San Antonio haven’t had African American female mayors. She also suggested we mention Sharon Pratt Kelly, the mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 through 1994, according to a February 2014 compilation of city leaders by Washingtonian magazine. The district’s estimated population as of July 2012 exceeded 633,000, the bureau says. By telephone, Cisneros noted another mayor we hadn’t already tallied, Sharon Sayles Belton, who led Minneapolis from 1994 to 2002, according to a 2013 web post by The Uptake, an online news operation. That city’s estimated population as of July 2012 was nearly 400,000, the bureau says. Our ruling Cisneros said San Antonio is the largest U.S. city to ever have a female African American mayor. True.

Barack Obama of failing to repudiate nasty statements against McCain involving racial politics. “Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful,” McCain said during the Hofstra University debate on Oct. 15, 2008. “And, Senator Obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks.” McCain referred to comments by Rep. Lewis, D-Georgia, who is an icon in the civil rights movement. In a statement Oct. 11, 2008, Lewis related the tenor of McCain campaign events to political tactics by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace that encouraged attacks over people seeking civil rights protections in the 1960s. “What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history,” Lewis wrote. “Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division, and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse.” Lewis issued his statement after news reports catalogued a series of McCain campaign events in which some audience members shouted such things as “terrorist” and “kill him” when Obama’s name was mentioned by the speakers. The remarks came as the McCain campaign embarked on a decidedly aggressive approach, focusing on Obama’s long-ago association with 1960s radical William Ayers. But the question is whether Obama was silent when Lewis likened the tone of the McCain rallies to those of Wallace and the segregationists. Obama’s campaign did break with Lewis’ statement the same day he made it, although it also said Lewis “was right to condemn” statements by Palin associating Obama with terrorists. Here’s the statement Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued on Oct. 11: “Senator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies. But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night, as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States ‘pals around with terrorists.’ “As Barack Obama has said himself, the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry, divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together. That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead.” But that statement never explicitly said Lewis was wrong — which is crucial to repudiating someone or something. Instead, Obama’s campaign said Lewis’ comparison wasn’t correct. In the debate, Obama did say Lewis “inappropriately drew a comparison” between the civil rights trouble and McCain rallies. Lewis later said he could have phrased his words differently, because he didn’t want to relate McCain and Palin directly to Wallace’s tactics. But he said he accomplished his goal of highlighting the dangerous tone of the rallies. Obama’s campaign did promptly issue a statement, disputing the comparison that Lewis made. But that’s not the same as “repudiating” or admonishing Lewis for making that comparison. Because Obama’s campaign never specifically criticized Lewis, we rate McCain’s statement as True.

pomt-07272	"750 days since Bill Nelson & the Democrats in the Senate passed a budget. How can this be justified?"	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/may/24/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-rips-sen-bill-nelson-senates-budget/	Update: This item was originally posted on May 20, 2011, with a ruling of Barely True. After additional reporting, the ruling was revised to Half True and republished on May 24. George LeMieux has been rapping his former colleague, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, in videos and campaign websites lately. LeMieux, the Republican appointed by then-Gov. Charlie Crist to fill out Mel Martinez's last 16 months in the Senate, is running on his own for a Senate seat in 2012. In a recent video, he criticized Nelson for supporting health care reform and amnesty for illegal immigrants. He also blasted Nelson for supporting earmarks such as a $225 million "Bridge to Nowhere" in Alaska (we rated that Mostly True). And LeMieux insisted that he had never requested a single earmark during his short time in the Senate (we gave that one a Half True). Now, LeMieux's linking Nelson to the Senate's failure to approve the usual annual budget. In a tweet on May 19, 2011, LeMieux wrote: "750 days since Bill Nelson & the Democrats in the Senate passed a budget. How can this be justified?" Has it really been two-plus years since the Senate approved a budget? We decided to find out. We looked at the budget process first, then at what has happened in the past two years and finally at Nelson's role. We e-mailed LeMieux to ask him to elaborate beyond the 140 characters allowed by Twitter, but we didn't hear back. Background on budget resolutions For background on what "passing a budget" means, we turned to explanations offered previously by our PolitiFact National colleagues. Congress today follows a budget process based on the 1974 Congressional Budget Act. That process calls for a budget resolution, passed first by the Senate Budget Committee, then by the full Senate. The resolution, says Jason Peuquet, staff analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank, is "an internally binding document that defines for a period of at least five fiscal years totals of appropriation levels and outlays, federal revenues, and the resulting surplus or deficit in the budget." The House and Senate usually approve budget resolutions in the spring. If the chambers disagree, they work out a compromise. It's not a show-stopper if they don't approve a budget resolution, because the actual appropriation of money to all the departments and agencies in the government is a separate process. If no resolution is approved, it becomes a talking point for the minority party -- in this case, for the Republicans. (In fact, Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, also a Senate candidate in 2012, also tweeted May 19 about the 750 days.) The inability to pass the resolution illustrates the discord in Congress and reflects poorly on the majority party. We should add two points. First, the budget resolution is not a bill. It outlines Congress' intent, but it doesn't go to the president or require his signature. Second, the past two years are not the first time we’ve had trouble getting a budget approved. Since 1983, the two chambers have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress. Budgets for 2010 and 2011 We turn next to what has happened in the past two years. The Senate passed a budget resolution in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year. The final action was April 29, 2009, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service. That vote was 53-43, with all the Republicans and three Democrats voting against it. That was the last budget resolution the Senate approved. Fast-forward to May 19, 2011, and that's exactly 750 days later. That’s the time-frame LeMieux is referencing. From the Democrats’ viewpoint, the 2009 resolution covered the budget for the year ending Sept. 30, 2010. So Adam Jentleson, deputy communications director for Majority Leader Harry Reid, R-Nev., calls the 750-days figure "tremendously misleading" because it’s been only 231 days from the start of the fiscal year to LeMieux’s tweet. Remember, though, what LeMieux said was 750 days since the Senate "passed a budget," not "since we had a budget." So the number of days in LeMieux's tweet is correct. What has been Nelson's role in the budget haggling since then? Nelson did his part in 2010 for a budget resolution as a member of the Senate Budget Committee. "In April 2010, that panel by 12-10 passed a budget resolution for fiscal year 2011. Nelson voted for it," said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. "Every member of LeMieux's political party voted against it." In the full Senate, the budget resolution introduced in 2010 by Budget Committee chairman Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota went nowhere. The Democrats (and two independents who caucused with them) were in the majority at the time, 59-41, so they had the 51 votes needed to pass a budget. If they had the votes, why didn’t Democrats pass a budget in 2010? We asked Jentleson in Majority Leader Reid's office to explain. "At a time when Democrats’ top priority was creating jobs and getting our economy back on track, Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes, even as our economy continued to struggle in the wake of the financial crisis," Jentleson said. "Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families." For example, Jentleson cited other 2010 laws passed with at least a little Republican support. He mentioned a jobs bill to give businesses incentives to hire more workers, passed 68-29 on March 17 with support from 11 Republicans, including LeMieux; another bill providing incentives to businesses, passed 61-38 on Sept. 16, 2010, with LeMieux and one other Republican supporting it; and the Dodd-Frank bill to overhaul financial regulation, passed 60-39 with support from three Republicans. His point is that a complete lack of bipartisanship on the budget would have damaged the prospects for other bills. Jentleson also points out that a budget vote is a "completely open amendment process." So any senator can offer any amendment -- and any number of amendments -- and they will be considered germane and require a vote. Democrats feared that Republicans could, if they chose to, use that method to stymie any budget vote. That explanation, though, doesn't wash with Republicans, nor with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. He says budgets are historically partisan affairs, and he looked up the last four Senate votes on them. The budget for FY 2010 didn't get a single Republican vote in 2009. The budgets for FY 2009 and 2008 passed with only two Republican votes for each. And for FY 2007, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, not one Democrat voted for it. His explanation for the failure to pass a budget in 2010: Politics. Democrats didn't want to be seen as big spenders prior to the 2010 midterm election, so they didn't vote at all. Budget for 2012 This year, with Republicans in control of the House and with a bigger minority in the Senate, the highest-profile budget plan for fiscal year 2012 is coming from House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. It passed the House on April 15. A vote is expected in the Senate this month, McLaughlin said. But forecasts are that the measure will fail in the Senate. The other main hope for a budget, expected from a bipartisan group called the "Gang of Six," ran aground just last week when a key member, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., backed out of the negotiations. Conrad, the budget committee chairman, issued a statement May 19 saying that Democrats were close to an agreement but would delay "because of the high-level bipartisan leadership negotiations that are currently under way." From the Republican side, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and the ranking Republican on the committee, responded that "as Democrats retain the majority in the Senate … it is their responsibility … to publicly present their budget to the American people." There's the tit-for-tat talking points again. What the analysts say We checked again with Peuquet from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "It has technically been 750 days since the Senate last passed a budget resolution," he said. That makes the Democrats appear irresponsible, he said, but they have continued to allocate dollars as needed through other spending bills. "But the larger picture is that lawmakers in Congress and the administration have so far not enacted a long-term fiscal plan to stabilize and reduce the debt," Peuquet said. "That is the true metric of fiscal responsibility, and there is plenty of blame to go around for both parties as to why our fiscal outlook is so dire." Ellis, from Taxpayers for Common Sense, added: "The blame for that (failure to pass a budget) always falls at the feet of the majority -- Democrat or Republican. The majority rarely gets any support (from the minority) for their budget resolution; it is a partisan affair. So last year, the Democratic majorities were concerned about schisms in their caucus and talking about spending money. It was an abdication of responsibility." Ellis added: "But to say it was Sen. Nelson's fault is a big stretch. If he was budget chair or in leadership, it would be different." Our ruling The number of days since a budget passed the Senate, 750, is correct. LeMieux's implication, though, is that Nelson and the Democrats in the Senate get the full blame. The truth about the stalled budget process is that it is a function of partisan politics on both sides, not just the Senate Democrats. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00614	The Supreme Court "can’t overrule the other two" branches of government.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/29/mike-huckabee/huckabee-supreme-court-cant-overrule-other-branche/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks current leaders need a basic civics refresher. The Republican presidential hopeful has said current politicians have allowed the judicial branch to exert more power than the executive and legislative branches of government. If elected, he would not bow to what he sees as "judicial supremacy." On Fox News Sunday May 24, he said this "defies everything there is about the three equal branches of government." He added, "We are sworn to uphold the Constitution and law. And it has to be consistent and agreed upon with three branches of government -- one can't overrule the other two." We know from our own basic civics lessons about checks and balances -- that the three branches of government have the ability to limit each others’ power. So we wanted to dig into Huckabee’s claim that one branch, particularly the courts, "can’t overrule the other two." On the one hand, Huckabee glosses over the fact that the Supreme Court can overrule laws passed by Congress and the president. However, he has a point that the Supreme Court doesn’t have to be the final word on the law -- the president and Congress have tools that can achieve certain goals in the face of judicial opposition. "Working out the details of (his position) turns out to be quite complicated, but Huckabee is saying something located within one tradition in constitutional interpretation," said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. The final word One thing Huckabee and legal scholars across the political spectrum can agree on is that the courts have the power of judicial review. This means they can rule on the constitutionality of a law brought before the courts. To take just one example, in 1989, the Supreme Court effectively invalidated laws that prohibit flag burning by ruling that a Texan who burned an American flag was exercising his constitutional right to free speech. Though judicial review was not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, several founding fathers called for it, and the Supreme Court’s 1803 ruling on Marbury vs. Madison confirmed the court’s prerogative. It remains a cornerstone of the United States’ judiciary system. So the Supreme Court can clearly overrule the other two branches of government. Congress may pass a law and the president can sign it, but the court can invalidate it. The Supreme Court, however, only has the ability to interpret laws-- not to draft or enforce them. So the president is obligated to enforce the law as determined by the courts, said Katy Harriger, a professor of constitutional law at Wake Forest University. For instance, in 1954, the Supreme Court in Brown vs. Board of Education ruled that segregated schools are unconstitutional. The then-governor of Arkansas had decided that his state would not desegregate its schools to comply with the ruling, and in 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Arkansas to enforce the court’s decision. "Deciding not to comply with a Supreme Court ruling would undermine the entire judiciary and have dire consequences for the separation of powers," said Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Slattery added that this doesn’t relieve the other branches of also upholding the Constitution. For instance, the president is obligated to veto legislation he believes is unconstitutional. Additionally, while the president and the legislature can’t flat-out ignore a ruling, they can still achieve the same goals contrary to Supreme Court opposition. They could amend the Constitution, for example, or appoint new judges who align with their position. "If the other branches of the federal government don’t back the court, it is true that the court has very limited power to enforce its judgments," said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Several presidents have chosen to independently interpret the Constitution, such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln disagreed with the 1857 Supreme Court ruling in the Dred Scott case, which concluded that people of African descent -- free or slave -- were not American citizens, and therefore could not petition for their freedom. So he pushed for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery and the 14th Amendment established the right to citizenship, nullifying the Dred Scott vs. Sandford decision. (The 14th Amendment passed after his death.) In other words, all three branches have at least some ability to go around the other branches when they disagree. This is what Huckabee was trying to express, said Huckabee spokesman Hogan Gidley -- that the court’s decisions are not immediately binding because the court can only write an opinion, not pass or enforce laws. Court opinions do not automatically become law, he said, and in this way, the legislative and executive branch are co-equal with the judiciary with "numerous options" to respond to rulings. That said, the other branches do tend to view the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the Constitution, Roosevelt said -- and he and other legal scholars see that as a good thing. "It would be difficult for our constitutional system of government to work if we did not have one body that had the last word on the meaning of the Constitution," Roosevelt added. While sympathetic to Huckabee’s position, Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University, said it’s not often that the situation arises where the executive and legislative branches can push back successfully against an adverse judicial ruling. And to the extent that rulings often align with public opinion, it would not be politically expedient in some cases to try to go around a ruling that most of the country agrees with. Defying the court through well-established means, such as a constitutional amendment, "is all perfectly legitimate. Each branch publicly contests with the others using the tools at its disposal," Chafetz said. Our ruling In trying to make the point that the judicial branch has grabbed too much power, Huckabee said the Supreme Court "can’t overrule the other two" branches of government. But the Supreme Court indeed has the power to overrule the other branches through judicial review -- the court's ability to rule that a law passed by Congress and signed by the president is unconstitutional. While there are certainly tools the president and Congress can use to go around a Supreme Court decision it doesn't like -- such as amending the Constitution or selecting justices that support the alternate position -- these are difficult to accomplish and usually require years of effort, making them rare. The much more common result is for the executive and legislative branches accept a Supreme Court decision as the final word. Huckabee may not like this state of affairs, but on balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2015-05-29T10:00:50	2015-05-24	['None']
pomt-11183	Says Tammy Baldwin is "more worried about the mastermind of 9/11" than supporting CIA director nominee Gina Haspel.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/18/leah-vukmir/pants-fire-attack-without-evidence-links-us-sen-ta/	Does U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin have so much more concern for a 9/11 terrorist, compared to the president’s nominee to run the CIA, that she would vote against the nominee? It’s an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrat’s patriotism. And if it’s correct, where is the evidence? The claim was made by Leah Vukmir, who is vying with fellow Republican Kevin Nicholson for the chance to run against Baldwin in November 2018. As stated, Vukmir’s claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwin’s stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Let’s examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc ‘Team Terrorists’ Vukmir took flak, even from conservatives, when she branded Baldwin and Mohammed as "Team Terrorists." But Vukmir then doubled-down and even tripled-down in a series of statements, including one that makes the claim we want to check. In a May 14, 2018 interview, Steve Scaffidi, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, asked Vukmir to explain "what you were trying to say" in tying Baldwin to Mohammed. Vukmir alluded to Gina Haspel, the nominee of President Donald Trump to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and said: Tammy and her party are more interested, and they’re more worried about, the mastermind of 9/11 -- the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over 3,000 Americans on our soil. And she‘s more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA. No evidence When Vukmir did the interview, it was expected that Baldwin would ultimately oppose Haspel. But Baldwin had not yet said whether she would vote for or against the nominee, who needs Senate confirmation to become CIA director. (Three days after the interview, Baldwin announced she'll vote against the nomination.) In any case, Baldwin’s support or opposition to Haspel is not what we’re fact checking here. When we asked Vukmir’s campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmir’s claim that Baldwin is "more worried" about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking. Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates: Baldwin: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks. Mostly True. Nicholson: Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence." Mostly True. Vukmir: Baldwin "claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words." False. We were referred only to a New York Times news article, published six days before Vukmir’s interview. Vukmir’s campaign said the article shows Mohammed’s "opposition" to the nomination of Haspel, a career CIA officer. The article reported on Mohammed’s request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspel’s confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article. Haspel has since declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article. The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed. About Baldwin For her part, when asked the day after Vukmir’s interview about Haspel and Vukmir’s "Terrorist Team" attack, Baldwin said on MSNBC she was on a "third iteration" of attempts to meet with Haspel. Two other points are worth noting: Baldwin did not call for Mohammed’s testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. (She is not a member of the panel.) In the days after 9/11, Baldwin, as a member of the House, voted for a measure overwhelmingly approved by Congress that gave the president authority to use force to invade Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. In short, Vukmir provided nothing of substance to support linking Baldwin with a terrorist. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin is "more worried about the mastermind of 9/11" than supporting Trump’s nominee for CIA director. She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee.

pomt-09500	"We were promised (the stimulus) would provide 'green jobs' for Americans, but 80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/23/sarah-palin/palin-falsely-claims-most-renewable-energy-stimulu/	The best way to find out what Sarah Palin is thinking these days is to visit her Facebook page. For example, on the anniversary of the passage of the stimulus bill, the former Alaska governor jotted down her thoughts on the $862 billion legislation meant to boost the economy. "One year ago today, President Obama signed a nearly trillion dollar stimulus package and handed our children the bill. What did we get for that massive price tag? Many promises, but the promises have proven false," she wrote on Feb. 17, 2010. Among those broken promises is the administration's pledge to "provide 'green jobs' for Americans, but 80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China." That's a lot of money, so we wondered whether Palin is correct. The stimulus bill, otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, includes tax credits to develop alternative energy, including solar, geothermal and wind energy. In lieu of the tax credit, investors can opt to take a cash grant of up to 30 percent of the cost of their project, an alternative that has turned out to be very popular. To support her statement, Palin's Facebook missive links to a Feb. 11, 2010, op-ed in Investor's Business Daily, a conservative news source. The editorial states that, according to the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, nearly $2 billion from the stimulus bill has been spent on wind power, and that 80 percent of that has gone to foreign manufacturers of wind turbines. "The goal was to further energy independence while creating American jobs. It has done neither," the editorial said. The Investigative Reporting Workshop's story on stimulus dollars and the wind industry came in two parts. In October 2009, it published its first analysis. The group found that of the $1.05 billion in clean-energy grants already handed out by the Department of Energy, about 84 percent -- or $849 million -- ended up in the hands of foreign wind companies. We spoke with Russ Choma, the story's author, who explained that these grants are given to U.S.-based wind projects, but that many of these projects are being built by the American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. For instance, on Sept. 22, 2009, the DOE awarded $464.2 million to wind projects, and all of it went to local subsidiaries of foreign companies, according to the report. Those companies include Iberdrola, a Spanish company that received $250.9 million; the American subsidiary of Japan's Eurus Energy, which got $91.3 million; and the American subsidiary of Germany's E.ON Group, which received $121.9 million. Choma also points out that the wind turbine manufacturing industry in the United States is relatively weak compared to those abroad; of the 1,807 turbines erected in the United States as a result of the stimulus grants, foreign-owned manufacturers made 1,219, according to the report. On Feb. 8, 2010, Choma updated his original findings, reporting that an additional $1 billion had been handed out in renewable energy grants, bringing the grand total to $2.1 billion. Of that, about 79 percent has gone to overseas firms. The news prompted indignation from some lawmakers concerned that stimulus dollars are not being spent effectively. Sen. Charles Schumer had some choice words about an October announcement that a Chinese wind-turbine company would be selling turbines to a wind project in Texas. Chinese banks have said they will bankroll the project, though there have been no final decisions on whether stimulus money will be tapped as well. "In all due respect I remind the secretary (of energy) there is a four-letter word associated with the stimulus -- J-O-B-S," Schumer said. "Very few jobs here, lots of jobs in China. That is not what I intended or any other legislator who voted for the stimulus intended. ... It is fine that the Chinese make them. But why don’t we use the stimulus money to start building up an industry to build them here, that was the very point of the stimulus." The same quote was picked up by the IBD op-ed. Hence, China enters our story. Energy Secretary Steven Chu and the American Wind Energy Association also weighed in on Choma's story. Their point: Wind energy projects supported with stimulus dollars create and save American jobs. On Facebook, Chu wrote that, "Every dollar awarded through this program helps put Americans to work. ... All of the wind turbine installation jobs are created here in America." Christine Real de Azua, a spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association, credits the stimulus bill with saving and creating 40,000 jobs; at the start of 2009, her organization expected that wind power development might drop as much as 50 percent from 2008 levels. Midyear, the trend turned around, she said. Most of those 40,000 jobs are in the construction sector; jobs in the manufacturing sector fell last year. That said, the American Wind Energy Association estimates that more than 50 percent of turbine parts, such as towers, blades, nacelle assembly, and some internal components are made in the United States, a number that is growing. Clearly, jobs are being created and saved in the United States as a result of these projects. But what about overseas? We were hard-pressed to find an exact number, though using data from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a group that advocates for clean energy, Choma estimated that as many as 4,500 foreign manufacturing jobs have been created with stimulus dollars. We spoke with George Sterzinger, executive director for REPP, about that figure. He said it's just an estimate, "but with the present momentum in the world, you can bet (stimulus money) is going to stimulate foreign manufacturing jobs." On that point, Sterzinger said that Obama's stimulus plan for renewable energy has missed the boat. The jobs that have been created or saved in the United States are construction jobs, which are temporary. Creating a robust local industry for wind energy will require jobs in the manufacturing sector, an area where the United States still lags. Back to what Palin said, that "80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China." There is a small amount of truth to Palin's underlying point: Because many parts of these turbines are being made overseas, some of the stimulus money is supporting jobs abroad. But that's not to say that no wind energy-related jobs have been created in the United States. Aside from that, Palin -- and the IBD editorial -- misrepresented Choma's story in a number of ways. First, while Choma found that many of the grants given so far have been for wind projects -- and that many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies -- the 79 percent of the $2.1 billion he cites in his story (Palin's rounded that number up to 80 percent) is the amount that has gone overseas for all renewable energy projects, not just wind projects. Choma shared his data with us, and it shows that, as of February 2010, only 73 percent has gone to foreign companies involved in wind projects. The rest of that 79 percent has gone to geothermal projects. And, more importantly, says Choma, none of these American subsidiaries is owned by Chinese companies. While the Texas deal may eventually shuttle some stimulus dollars to China through the purchase of turbines, the deal is still in the works. So, it's incorrect to say that any stimulus money has gone to Chinese turbine manufacturers, let alone 80 percent of the $2 billion spent on renewable energy projects.

pomt-14020	We’ve broken "by millions" the all-time record for votes in a GOP presidential primary election.	false	/california/statements/2016/jun/01/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-you-havent-broken-voting-record-mi/	During a campaign speech in Sacramento on Wednesday, Donald Trump repeated claims about how many votes he’s received in the Republican presidential primary. "We’ve broken the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party" for votes in a primary election, the presumptive GOP nominee said. "We’ve broken it by millions." This is not the first time Trump has repeated the "all-time record" claim while in California. He said it on April 29 at the state’s Republican Party Convention when he was on pace to break the record but was still short at the time. We rated it "False … for now." He appears to have secured that record now. Trump’s victory in the Washington primary nearly a month later, on May 24, put him over the top, said Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics. But we wondered about the second part of Trump’s latest statement: "We’ve broken it by millions." Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next? We set out on a fact check. Presumed GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned in Sacramento on June 1, 2016 ahead of California's primary election. Jae C. Hong / AP Our research Ostermeier told us Wednesday night that Trump got ahead of himself, once again. "Trump will have broken the GOP record by millions after the remaining states vote on June 7th," the professor said in an email. "But, currently sitting at 11.70 million votes, he is now only a shade more than 150,000 votes ahead of George W. Bush’s previous mark set in 2000, which tallied 11.54 million direct primary and caucus votes." Trump’s campaign had not responded to a request for comment as of Wednesday night. The remaining contests include California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, all on June 7. Ostermeier is not the only one tracking vote tallies. RealClearPolitics.com shows Trump at 11.53 million popular votes -- slightly behind Bush’s 2000 vote total, certainly not "millions" ahead. Trump’s 2016 vote count has benefitted, Ostermeier said, from a larger national population, a more competitive race and from lasting nearly two months longer than Bush’s contest against Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ostermeier added that Trump also "lost votes" to this year’s crowded field of GOP candidates. Our ruling Trump said he’s broken "by millions" the record for GOP presidential primary votes. With victories on June 7th, including in California, he may well smash the record. But he’s not there yet. We rate Trump’s claim False again … for now. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-03757	"A report by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/07/jeff-tittel/nj-sierra-club-director-claims-ashbritt-had-dirty-/	The company handling disposal of Hurricane Sandy debris here has a rather dirty history from the work it did along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, according to the director of the Sierra Club New Jersey chapter. The company, AshBritt, left new contaminated sites in its wake as it did cleanup along the Gulf Coast after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, Jeff Tittel said in a Feb. 22 opinion column he wrote for NJToday.net. "A report by the US General (Government) Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans," Tittel wrote in his column, which explored links between Hurricane Sandy and climate change. This claim caught our eye since AshBritt received a no-bid contract from New Jersey to handle the bulk of the Hurricane Sandy cleanup. Even more eye-catching? The nearly 40-page GAO report cited by Tittel not only never mentions AshBritt, it looks only at debris disposal in the New Orleans area. Let’s first review some background about how Florida-based AshBritt came to New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, causing widespread damage here, in New York and Connecticut. Hours after the storm, Gov. Chris Christie awarded AshBritt a no-bid contract that piggybacked off one the company had with Connecticut. The decision has drawn public scrutiny for a variety of reasons, such as higher-than-usual disposal costs to towns for which AshBritt has handled debris disposal. Now let’s get into Tittel’s claim about that GAO report. AshBritt general counsel Jared Moskowitz called Tittel’s claim about the company’s role in New Orleans and Louisiana "hocus pocus." Moskowitz said AshBritt was only in Louisiana for a couple of weeks after Katrina before the Army Corps of Engineers moved them to do debris removal work in Mississippi. "We weren’t in New Orleans and Louisiana long enough to create a Superfund site," Moskowitz told us. "It is a lie." The Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt worked briefly in New Orleans before moving east to Mississippi. We also checked with the GAO about AshBritt’s alleged role, and the agency confirmed that neither AshBritt nor any other disposal company was referenced in their report. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress. "We did not look at contractors at all, in fact," said Alfredo Gomez, a GAO spokesman. "We looked at federal agencies and Louisiana agencies. Contractors are outside the scope of our work." The report notes disposal violations at several New Orleans-area landfills, but doesn’t reference the "Gulf Coast," as Tittel does, and details how the state dealt with those violations. Tittel said the purpose of his column was to point out debris disposal problems that occurred after Katrina and to ensure that New Jersey has strong oversight of Hurricane Sandy debris removal and the contractors doing the work. "The lesson that we saw in the Gulf was when you privatize things and you don’t have clear oversight and enforcement in place, you end up having a lot of mistakes," he said. Finally, let’s look at the rest of Tittel’s claim. We reviewed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List of Superfund sites in three Gulf Coast states hit hard by Katrina: Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. None of 31 sites listed referenced Katrina, including two in New Orleans: the Old Gentilly Landfill and the Agriculture Street Landfill. "The Agriculture Street site did not receive any debris from Katrina," said EPA Region 6 spokeswoman Jennah Durant. "No new National Priority List (NPL) sites were created in New Orleans as a result of post-Katrina clean-up." Our ruling Tittel said in an opinion column, "A report by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans." There are several major problems with Tittel’s claim. First, neither AshBritt nor any other contractor is named in the report. Second, the GAO confirmed that contractors were not part of their study. Third, the Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt was not the major contractor in New Orleans - the company was moved to Mississippi shortly after Katrina cleanup started. Fourth, the report’s scope is limited to existing landfills in the New Orleans area – not new contamination sites or "the Gulf Coast." Fifth, the EPA has confirmed that post-Katrina debris did not cause new Superfund sites in New Orleans. At least five falsehoods in one claim? That’s beyond ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03632	Proposed gun control legislation "will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database" and make it "nearly impossible" to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/05/ed-doyle/gun-rights-advocate-says-proposed-rhode-island-law/	The Newtown, Conn., school shooting sparked new waves of proposals to restrict gun ownership and use, including a package of bills in the Rhode Island General Assembly supported by Governor Chafee, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, legislative leaders and many police chiefs. That, in turn, has sparked opposition from gun rights advocates. One of them, Ed Doyle, administrator of the Rhode Island chapter of Gun Rights Across America, issued a news release and posted a notice on Facebook announcing "an emergency call to stand up for your rights" at a May 1 House hearing on the Rhode Island gun legislation. "The wording in these bills will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, make a CCL [permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get, and eliminate the 2nd Amendment as we know it!!!" the advertisement warned. Several hundred supporters and opponents of the legislation showed up for the hearing, which lasted seven hours. No votes have been scheduled on the bills. We’ll look at the elements of Doyle’s claim one at a time, leaving the Second Amendment part until last. $100 PER FIREARM: This is true. House Bill 5573 would require everyone who carries or possesses a firearm to register it at a cost of $100 per firearm. POLICE DATABASE: This is also true. Under the same bill, registration would be done by the licensing authority of each city or town. That would probably be the police department because the bill says registration information "shall not be disclosed to any individual or entity … [except] to law enforcement organizations and personnel when that information is sought for legitimate law enforcement purposes." MAKE CONCEALED WEAPON PERMITS "NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE" TO GET: Under existing law, owners can get such permits from the local licensing authority -- usually the police chief -- or the attorney general's office. The law says local authorities "shall" grant the license. One bill in the legislative package, S 0865, proposes taking cities and towns out of that loop and giving the authority exclusively to the attorney general's office. The catch here, according to Doyle, is that the proposed law says the attorney general "may" issue a permit but doesn’t require the attorney general to do so. Doyle said an anti-gun attorney general could halt the flow of permits. Gun advocates worry about this because when U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, was attorney general, some gun owners complained that the office was denying too many requests. In 1999, for example, 77 percent of the 216 renewal requests were approved and 23 percent denied. Even today, there are complaints that applicants are routinely denied and get their permits only on appeal. Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Kilmartin, the current attorney general, said that in 2011, 85 percent of the 370 new applications were approved. In 2012, the approval rate was 75 percent for the 275 new applications. Between Jan. 1 and April 23 of this year, 65 of the 115 new applications have been approved, 26 are pending and 24 have been denied. She reported that only 2 percent of renewal requests were denied in 2011 and 2012. Kempe said the office did not have any data readily available on how many people have been granted a permit after appealing an initial denial. The bottom line: the proposed law would not inherently make the permits "nearly impossible to get." It puts the authority in the hands of an office that is currently granting the vast majority of permits it receives. An attorney general with a tougher stance on guns might approve fewer, but, on the other hand, a pro-gun attorney general might authorize every request. We rate this part Doyle's statement False. OUTLAW "PRACTICALLY EVERY FIREARM": House Bill 5990 and a companion Senate bill, 0859, would make it illegal for anyone to purchase, possess, sell or manufacture a semiautomatic assault weapon after July 1. (Legislators have promised that existing owners would be grandfathered.) Most firearms today are semiautomatics, which means that they eject a spent round and feed the next one into the chamber whenever the trigger is pulled. With a semiautomatic, you have to pull and release the trigger for each shot. (A fully automatic weapon continues to fire as long as the trigger is pulled.) What makes a firearm an assault weapon? The legislation defines an assault rifle, for example, as a weapon that can accept detachable magazines and has at least two other characteristics, such as a folding stock or a pistol grip. When we contacted Doyle, he said the lengthy description makes just about everything an assault weapon. Two gun control groups disputed Doyle’s statement. Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, in Washington, D.C., said the language of the Rhode Island bill "essentially mirrors the expired federal assault weapons ban which is widely acknowledged as having major loopholes that allowed the continued sale of assault weapons [including the Bushmaster used at Newtown]. The bill wouldn’t even ban all assault weapons, much less any sporting firearms." And Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, said in an e-mail that the Rhode Island proposal's language is "considerably weaker than the current California assault weapon ban" because it requires at least two features to make a firearm an assault weapon. In California, only one can be enough. "And even under the much stronger California assault weapon ban, over 800,000 guns were sold in California last year!" she said. Finally, Doyle took us gun shopping online. We started browsing the rifle and shotgun section of Walmart.com. Of the first 32 rifles on the list, the proposed law would affect no more than seven. When we searched for shotguns, the first page of results had 29 actual shotguns; no more than three would be illegal under the proposed law. (We didn't do a count of handguns or pistols because most of the items that came up in the search were pellet guns. Our favorite: the Undead Apocalypse Crosman Airsoft Pistol with Compensator, which comes in Zombie Green.) When at least 80 percent of the weapons seen in a spot-check could still be purchased, it seems ridiculous to say the wording of the proposed legislation would outlaw practically every firearm. That's worthy of a Pants On Fire. Our ruling Firearms rights supporter Ed Doyle said the wording of the gun control measures being debated at the State House "will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, [and make a permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get." The database and registration fee claims are correct. None of the proposed bills would inherently make it "nearly impossible" to get a concealed weapon permit. And we found that the definition of "assault weapons" in the legislation would not "outlaw practically every firearm." Consumers would have plenty of rifles, shotguns and pistols to choose from. Finally, none of the Rhode Island bills would eliminate any part of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite Doyle’s triple-exclamation point assertion. Because of the mix of fact and fiction in his statement, we rate it Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-05387	"The United States imprisons more than any nation in the world."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/07/hank-johnson/us-locks-more-people-any-nation-congressman-says/	The U.S.A. Land of the free and the home of the imprisoned? U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson says the United States puts a lot of people in prison. How many? "Mister Speaker, the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world," the liberal Democrat from DeKalb County said one day in the House of Representatives. "We currently incarcerate 2.3 million people. The incarceration rate is not fitting for a nation which is routinely touted as the greatest nation in the world." PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Johnson was correct about his claim that America has more people in its prisons than any other country. Or should the congressman go into our fact-checking holding cell? Johnson’s main reason for the statement was a verbal volley at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which he accused of lobbying for harsher prison sentences that benefit some members that run for-profit jails. Johnson’s office posted a video of his speech on YouTube. The congressman’s office sent us several news articles and reports to fortify his claim. The news coverage all said the United States led the world in prison incarceration. The coverage was based on data from the International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain. The center consistently tracks prison populations worldwide, and its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters. The most recent study, using data as of May 2011, found there were nearly 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons, the same number Johnson used in his congressional floor speech. A 2010 congressional report said 2.3 million Americans were in prison. The report was based on 2008 data. In the most recent World Prison Population List, the U.S. had more prisoners than any other country. China was second with 1.65 million people in prison, but the report said it does not include people in pre-trial detention or "administrative detention." Russia was a distant third, with about 806,000 people in prison. The center also measured the numbers by the percentage of people in prison. The report estimated the U.S. population at 308.4 million. It concluded that 743 of every 100,000 Americans were in prison. Again, the U.S. was first on the list. Rwanda and Russia were second and third, respectively, with 595 and 568 people in prison per 100,000 citizens. The congressional report shows the U.S. prison population was about 100 per 100,000 between the 1920s and the late 1970s. Afterward, it went up like a rocket. One turning point, the report said, was New York state’s 1973 imposition of mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenses under the administration of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Other states followed. Georgia ranked eighth nationally in the number of prisoners in that 2010 report, with 540 per 100,000. Louisiana was first, and eight of the top 10 states are in the South. The World Prison Population List includes totalitarian regimes and nations often on the world’s bad actors list such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Venezuela. But it does not include two Communist countries: Cuba and North Korea. So how many inmates do those countries have? Amnesty International gave us a report it released in May 2011 on political prisoner camps in North Korea. It concluded there were an estimated 200,000 people being held in such camps, using satellite images and eyewitness accounts. That equates to 813 per 100,000, higher than the U.S. As for Cuba, a 2003 study reported in The Miami Herald found an estimated 100,000 inmates in its 200 prisons and labor camps spread across the Caribbean island. Several prominent human rights organizations did not dispute the figure. In 1995, the United Nations estimated there were "between 100,000 and 200,000 prisoners in all categories,'' the Herald reported. "If accurate, the figure of 100,000 inmates in an island of nearly 11.3 million people would give Cuba 888 inmates per 100,000 people, far ahead of the United States," the Herald article said. The Herald reported that the last time the report included Cuba was in 1997, when it used data from an academic in Norway to estimate there were about 33,000 inmates in Cuba’s prisons. For various reasons, neither country is willing to open up its prisons for independent verification of the number of inmates in its jails. The people who put together the World Prison Population List told PolitiFact Georgia that it is possible one or both of those countries may have more inmates than the United States. "[T]he U.S. is accepted as having the highest prison population rate, but it is possible that Cuba and North Korea are depriving a higher proportion of their citizens of their liberty," Roy Walmsley, who helps put together the report, told us via email. According to most reports, the United States does imprison more people than any other nation. But the figures are not as clear on the percentage of the population it locks up. Some reports do not include countries such as Cuba and North Korea. Those countries, according to some research, may have a higher ratio of inmates in their prisons. Johnson’s statement is based on accurate data. But it needs additional context to move the needle higher on the Truth-O-Meter. We give the congressman a Half True on this one.

pomt-05817	Says the federal government could save $175,587 by eliminating a study of the "connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/20/mark-neumann/uncle-sam-spends-six-figures-study-coked-birds-cop/	When the federal government gets ridiculed for doing a study on what seems like a wacky phenomenon, it always sounds like the research was concocted by Leno or Letterman. Then Uncle Sam goes and funds another study that sounds even crazier. Spending tax dollars in this way amounts to juicy red meat for budget hawks such as Mark Neumann, one of the Republicans running for a U.S. Senate seat from Wisconsin in 2012. On Jan. 26, 2012, the former congressman put out a list of 10 federal programs he’d trim or eliminate that he said would save $138 billion. Near the bottom of the list was … eliminating a federal study! Neumann claimed he could save $175,587 by ending a study of the "connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail." We wondered: Which comedian was Neumann citing as his source? Just kidding. So is Uncle Sam really spending six figures just to observe coked-up copulating quails? Or is there more to the study? Asked for backup, Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato showed us that in January 2011, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $175,587 grant to a University of Kentucky psychology professor for an "enhancement of sexual motivaton" project. Indeed, the sex habits of Japanese quail on cocaine were to be observed. So, Neumann is correct on the cost and the basic set-up of the study. Lato also cited an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news web site. The article pointed out that the project is actually a five-year study and it quoted a university official defending it. Quail watching The grant information shows the government launched the project with a $181,406 award in January 2010. It added the $175,587 cited by Neumann in 2011 and another $175,211 in February 2012. The study is slated to continue through January 2015. The grant document explains why Japanese quail were chosen and how the study relates to humans: "The goal of the proposed experiments is to utilize an animal model whose sexual behavior system has been well-studied, Japanese quail. In addition to the benefits of using quail to study sexual behavior, the use of a visually-oriented species in studying drug effects may be of additional relevance to studying human drug addiction. "We currently have preliminary evidence in male Japanese quail that pre-exposure to cocaine enhances sexual motivation. This finding ties in well with clinical observations that indicate that cocaine use in humans may increase sexual motivation, thereby increasing the likelihood of the occurrence of high-risk sexual behavior," such as unprotected sex and increased number of sexual partners. The Daily Caller article provided by Neumann’s campaign noted that James Tracy, the vice president for research at the University of Kentucky, defended the study. "Why Japanese quail? Cocaine abuse in humans has been shown clinically that it leads to risky sexual behavior, they have more sexual partners, and that leads to more sexually transmitted diseases," Tracy told a Kentucky TV station. "It's important to look what is behind the title (of the study). You are limited to only 64 characters" in applying for the federal grant, he said. Also backing the study is chronobiologist Bora Zivkovic, blog editor of Scientific American, which describes itself as the "leading source and authority for science, technology information and policy for a general audience." Zivkovic said in the magazine he spent 10 years studying the Japanese quail and that the bird has been used in laboratory research since at least 1914. "Studying effects of cocaine on reproductive behavior is so much more efficient in a species in which we do not have to start from scratch – we already know so much about its brain, behavior and reproduction, we can move on to more sophisticated studies than just the first exploratory ‘basic experiments.’ Thus we can make faster progress. This is an efficient approach," Zivkovic wrote. Whether it’s a good use of tax money to do more study on quail and sex and cocaine isn’t a question we’re here to settle. But the study Neumann cited isn’t intended merely to learn about birds, but about drug abuse and sexual habits of humans that can lead to public health problems. Our rating Neumann said he could save $175,587 by eliminating a study of the "connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail." A grant for that amount was awarded for such a study in 2011, another was made in 2012 and more are slated to be made. But the scope of the study is much larger than what Neumann suggests by citing only the title. Neumann’s claim was accurate, but needed additional information. We don’t know how Leno or Letterman would rule, but that’s our definition of Mostly True.	None	Mark Neumann	None	None	None	2012-02-20T09:00:00	2012-01-26	['Japan']

pomt-03649	Says the fertilizer plant that exploded in West, Texas,"had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006."	false	/texas/statements/2013/may/01/jack-ohman/california-editorial-cartoonist-says-state-texas-l/	Defending an editorial cartoon that ticked off Gov. Rick Perry, creator Jack Ohman said he intended to make a provocative point about government oversight in the wake of a Texas disaster that left 14 people dead and 200 people injured. The April 25, 2013, cartoon by Ohman, editorial cartoonist for the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee, depicts Perry as making one of his pitches for businesses to come to Texas. In the cartoon’s first panel, Perry says from behind a dais: "Business is booming in Texas!" The cartoon’s next panel shows the April 17, 2013, explosion of the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, with "BOOM!" in red letters plus a flag with "low regs" visible near flames. Challenging the cartoon, Perry said in a letter to the Bee, published April 26, 2013, that "I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths of my fellow Texans and our fellow Americans... The Bee owes the community of West, Texas an immediate apology for your detestable attempt at satire." Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, which aired a few negative factual claims about Texas in 2012, stood by the cartoon. For his part, Ohman wrote in an article posted after the cartoon debuted April 25, 2013: "The Texas chemical plant had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006. That's seven years ago. You may have read in the news that Gov. Perry, during his business recruiting trips to California and Illinois, generally described his state as free from high taxes and burdensome regulation. One of the burdensome regulations he neglected to mention was the fact that his state hadn't really gotten around to checking out that fertilizer plant." We wondered about Ohman’s claim that the state last inspected, or checked, the plant in 2006. Ohman did not respond to our inquiry. But his year reference alone is incorrect, it turns out, while the issue of which agencies, state or federal, could or should have headed off the evening explosion has not (and may not be) settled. According to news stories and government documents, a couple of state agencies went to the plant before the explosion and federal agencies also played roles. "A patchwork of state and federal agencies regulated the West fertilizer plant," the Austin American-Statesman said in an April 24, 2013, news article, with nearly all focused on pollution concerns or securing the facility and its potentially dangerous fertilizers from criminal or terrorist threat. Let's recap agency visits, starting with the state departments. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality The commission regulates the state’s air and water quality and has authority to inspect fertilizer businesses, though an April 19, 2013, American-Statesman news story quoted its executive director, Zak Covar, as saying it typically does so only after it receives complaints. Another Statesman news article, published April 20, 2013, said that in commission parlance, the West facility is considered a "minor source" of pollutants since it’s authorized to emit only 0.11 tons of soot and 0.92 tons of anhydrous ammonia each year. Major source facilities, by contrast, emit at least 100 tons per year of certain contaminants, the newspaper said, and regularly draw commission investigations. By email, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow told us that unlike air, water and waste-related fronts involving state-issued permits and the like, other "industrial conditions at facilities are not under TCEQ’s investigative authority nor its regulatory control." The April 19 Statesman story said agency records show two complaints filed against West Fertilizer, which owns the plant, since the company began operating in 1962. According to the newspaper, a 2002 complaint said: "There is a cloud of dust. Particles are falling like snow around town. People are afraid to complain, however, this is effecting neighbors health with scratchy throats, cough and sneezing." A subsequent investigation found no nuisance conditions, the newspaper said. In 2006, the story said, the commission received an odor complaint. An agency investigation found that the facility’s permit had expired and issued a notice of violation for operating without a required air quality permit. The matter was resolved at the end of the year, the story said, when the agency granted the facility a new air permit for its two 12,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. Also, the story said, a second permit, for the loading and storage of fertilizer materials, was issued in 2007. Both permits were granted after an agency technical review and a public comment period during which no member of the public commented either time, the newspaper said. "With no new complaints," the story said, "no on-site inspection has taken place at the facility since 2007." By email, Morrow told us the agency last conducted a "site investigation" at the plant Jan. 16, 2007. Office of the Texas State Chemist The April 19 Statesman story said oversight of the fertilizer industry in Texas is handled primarily by the Office of the State Chemist’s Feed and Fertilizer Control Service at Texas A&M AgriLife Research, with duties focused on serving fertilizer users by testing products to make sure that they are free of contaminants and that their labels accurately reflect the advertised product. The story said the office registers companies such as West Fertilizer, which experts described as a sort of compounding pharmacy for fertilizers that stores tons of chemicals it mixes for farmers depending on their particular soil and planting needs. Since 2007, the agency has also overseen sales of ammonium nitrate, which can be made into explosives, the story said. The office can also inspect individual sites "for product safety and security," the office’s director, Tim Herrmann, was quoted as saying. He also was quoted as saying the West facility had been inspected "quite recently." The April 20 Statesman news story quoted Hermann saying that ammonium nitrate is a common fertilizer ingredient, because it doesn’t break down as quickly as other fertilizers. That’s handy if, say, a farmer spreads the fertilizer anticipating a rainfall to carry it into the soil, but then it remains dry. But because it can be used to make explosives, it is more tightly regulated than other farm chemicals — as a security threat, the Statesman said. Since 2007, Texas has required those who buy and sell the chemical to be registered and record the transactions. Herrman, whose office handles the paperwork, said fertilizer distribution centers such as West Fertilizer also must be deemed "100 percent in compliance" to maintain their license to handle ammonium nitrate, a standard the West facility met, he told the newspaper. By telephone, Hermann told us the office last went to the plant on April 5, 2013, at the request of the plant’s owners who expressed concern they had received fertilizer ingredients that were not what they were labeled. A letter from the state office’s associate director, Ben Jones, to the fertilizer company--dated April 16, 2013--seems to confirm the product ordered by the company, diammonium phosphate, was not entirely what it was supposed to be. The letter encourages the company to take the issue up with the company that originated the product. Documents posted online by the agency indicate that a representative of the state chemist went to the plant in January, June, July and September 2012 and that agency employees went to the facility one to 10 times each year from 2004 through 2011. Referring to ongoing investigation of the cause of the fatal explosion, Hermann said he could not comment on the nature of the office’s inspections. Federal agencies The April 19 Statesman story indicated it’s not clear that a state agency holds direct responsibility for gauging the safety of such plants in that a patchwork of government entities, including federal departments, could play roles. Homeland Security For instance, in light of the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, an attack in which Timothy McVeigh made explosives from ammonium nitrate, as well as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been writing rules tightening the sale and purchase of that chemical, the newspaper said. The agency's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) requires facilities that handle high-risk chemicals to send a self-assessment to the agency, which then determines if the facility needs to be regulated. Those that don't send in the required information can be fined or closed. A Homeland Security spokesman told the newspaper that West Fertilizer had yet to respond: "The West Fertilizer Co. facility is not currently regulated under the CFATS program." OSHA The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, generally entrusted with overseeing workplace safety, rarely inspects fertilizer facilities, the newspaper said, with the agency having inspected only a half-dozen fertilizer manufacturers in Texas in recent years. The paper said OSHA inspections are triggered by complaints, referrals from other government agencies and after deadly incidents. In a news article published the same day, the New York Times quoted an unidentified OSHA spokesman as saying the West plant was not included in its so-called National Emphasis Plan for inspections because it did not produce explosives, had no major prior accidents and the Environmental Protection Agency did not rate it as a major risk. The plant’s latest OSHA inspection occurred in 1985, the Times said. ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization, said in an April 25, 2013, article that it’s unclear if any agencies failed to inspect the plant when they should have, quoting a Huffington Post news story posted April 22, 2013 stating that since the OSHA inspection, "regulators from other agencies have been inside the plant, but they looked only at certain aspects of plant operations, such as whether the facility was abiding by labeling rules when packaging its fertilizer for sale." Environmental Protection Agency The EPA, which oversees air and water quality,requires risk management plans at all facilities that store hazardous chemicals to keep local communities apprised of local risks, the Statesman reported. According to EPA records, though, West Fertilizer was supposed to update its plan in 2004 but didn't do so for another two years, the paper said. Federal inspectors also found that the company kept poor training records, hadn't developed a formal written maintenance program and had operating procedures that failed to address the "consequences of deviation," the newspaper reported. According to the EPA, following a $2,300 fine, the company "certified they corrected the deficiencies" and filed an updated plan in 2011 as required. "The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes," the company stated in the plan. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration The largest fine levied on the plant, for $10,000, was handed down in 2012 by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Statesman said, when West Fertilizer failed to write a security plan to transport anhydrous ammonia, a chemical fertilizer stored under pressure. The company said it couldn't afford to pay that amount, and the penalty was halved after West Fertilizer agreed to correct the oversight, the newspaper said. An administration investigator inspected the plant in September 2011, according to documents spelling out the reduced fine. Summing up: One state office went to the plant a few weeks before the disaster and multiple times in recent years, while another, with authority over air and water issues, last inspected it in early 2007. Separately, federal agencies monitored and occasionally penalized the plant, most recently in 2011. Our ruling Ohman said the fertilizer plant in West was last inspected by the state of Texas in 2006. In fact, one state agency went to the plant less than two weeks before the disaster and multiple times over recent years, while the state’s environmental agency was there in 2007. As significantly, this claim leaves misimpressions that the state routinely conducts major inspections of such plants and that federal government has no particular role. Neither conclusion was supported by news stories published before the cartoon came out. We're not taking a position here about the Texas regulatory climate nor are we concluding that agencies should be let off the hook for what happened before the explosion. That said, the statement is not accurate. We rate it as False.	None	Jack Ohman	None	None	None	2013-05-01T15:30:00	2013-04-25	['Texas']

pomt-12899	"That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/21/sean-spicer/trump-had-biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever-metrics-don/	At the first press briefing of the new administration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer blasted the media, saying they deliberately misled the public about the size of President Donald Trump’s inauguration crowd. "Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular Tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall," Spicer said on Jan. 21. "That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe." Spicer offered a few "facts" to disprove media reports of low turnout, but many of them are misleading or inaccurate. His overall assertion that Trump’s inaugural drew the "largest audience" ever is flat-out wrong. Infrastructure issues Spicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout. It was the "first time" that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said. But this is not the case. Floor coverings were also used in 2013, and floor coverings remained on the Mall during the Women’s March on Washington the day after the inauguration. Spicer also blamed the "first time" usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for "preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past." According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report, screening magnetometers, or metal detectors, have been used in past inaugurations, though it’s not clear if they were placed on the Mall itself. The screening zones, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, did include two busy metro stops close to the Mall. Spicer’s claim was also disputed by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who tweeted that two unnamed law enforcement officials told him "magnetometers were not used in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall." Crowd size Spicer then knocked the press for tweeting out "inaccurate numbers involving crowd size." "No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out," he said. "We do know a few things. So let’s go through the facts." "We know that from the platform from where the President was sworn in to 4th Street holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the oath of office." Many news organizations, including PolitiFact, have noted that it’s difficult to gauge crowd size and that estimates are inconsistent. The National Park Service stopped tallying crowds on the National Mall in 1995 after a dispute over the attendance of the Million Man March. Spicer’s claim of full spaces on the Mall -- which photographs contradict -- would give Trump a crowd size of at least 720,000, which is higher than preliminary estimates reported in the media but are on par with the 700,000 to 900,000 organizers expected to attend. The President himself touted 1.5 million on Jan. 21 at CIA headquarters. But that still wouldn’t have been the top figure. Here are the attendance estimates for past inaugurations: Inauguration Estimated attendance Trump, 2017 250,000 to 600,000 Barack Obama, 2013 1 million Obama, 2009 1.8 million George W. Bush, 2005 400,000 Bush, 2001 300,000 Bill Clinton, 1997 250,000 Clinton, 1993 800,000 George H.W. Bush, 1989 300,000 Metro ridership Spicer said 420,000 used the D.C. Metro public transit on Jan. 20, 2017, compared with 317,000 for President Obama’s 2013 inaugural. It’s unclear where his 420,000 figure for Trump’s inaugural comes from, but the Washington Post reported that for Trump’s inaugural around 570,557 took trips in the system between 4 a.m and midnight on Friday. Inauguration day 2013 drew more, at about 782,000. Spicer’s 317,000 figure refers to ridership as of 11 a.m. on Jan. 21, 2013, reported the WMATA. Trump’s inaugural drew about 193,000 as of the same time. Here’s a breakdown of ridership of the most recent inaugurations: Day Metro ridership (whole day) Metro ridership (as of 11 a.m.) Jan. 20, 2017 (Trump inaugural) 570,557 193,000 Jan. 21, 2013* (Obama inaugural) 782,000 317,000 Jan. 20, 2009 (Obama inaugural) 1,100,000 513,000 Jan. 20, 2005 (Bush inaugural) 583,803 197,000 *Note: Obama’s second inauguration was Jan. 21 instead of Jan. 20, which fell on a Sunday. Our ruling Spicer said, "That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period." To support his claim, Spicer offered a few pieces of misleading or inaccurate evidence. He said that floor coverings highlighting empty spaces on the National Mall were not used for previous inaugurations, but these were in place for Obama’s 2013 inauguration. He claimed metro ridership was higher for Trump’s inaugural than for Obama’s 2013 inaugural, but he compared numbers for the morning of Obama’s inaugural to the whole day for Trump’s. Spicer suggested 720,000 attended Trump’s inauguration, while organizers said they expected 700,000 to 900,000, and Trump himself estimated 1.5 million. All of those figures are less than the 1.8 million people who attended Obama’s 2009 inaugural. We rate Spicer’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14476	"There is no evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool" for terrorists.	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/29/joe-heck/nevada-rep-joe-heck-says-no-evidence-shows-guantan/	It’s not entirely clear whether terrorists really care about the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center. Despite President Barack Obama’s new plan to close the facility, Republicans are promising to block the move under the rationale that none of the 91 detainees should be moved to the United States. But Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a U.S. Senate candidate, went further than most and said terrorist groups don’t use Guantanamo at all in recruitment efforts. "There is no evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool or affecting relations with allies, both of which are being used to advance the president’s flawed foreign policy goals," Heck said in a statement. Heck saying there’s "no evidence" that terrorist groups use the site as a "recruiting tool" directly contradicts one of the president’s core arguments for closing the detention center, which made us wonder — do groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda use Guantanamo in any fashion to draw in potential terrorists? Terrorist groups often mention Guantanamo in their propaganda and publications, but it’s less clear whether or not the site is used as a "recruiting tool" for potential jihadists. U.S. defense officials believe it’s "no coincidence" that ISIS forced hostages featured in brutal execution videos wear orange jumpsuits, which defense official Brian McKeon says is "believed by many to be the symbol of the Guantanamo detention facility." And U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, who was murdered by ISIS in September 2014, mentioned Obama’s failure to close the site in seemingly prepared remarks in his execution video. Guantanamo mentions aren’t limited to video. Al-Qaeda’s English-language magazine "Inspire" contains a handful of references to the detention center, according to Foundation for the Defense of Democracies senior fellow Thomas Joscelyn. But Joscelyn said Guantanamo tends to be referenced only in passing, like in a 2010 article by Osama bin Laden that’s mostly critical of climate change and capitalism. "I'm finding, once again, that it is infrequently mentioned (especially when compared to other themes) and the regular recruiting messages I've catalogued have nothing to do with Guantanamo," he said in an email. Researchers question the importance that terrorist groups like ISIS place on Guantanamo, especially since the facility stopped taking in new detainees in 2008. Rather, the site tends to be lumped in with prisoner torture controversies at the Abu Ghraib and Bagram detention centers, which fades in prominence given new issues and a complex, evolving situation in the Middle East. Brookings Institution researchers reviewed English-language publications from al-Qaeda affiliates and ISIS and found that terrorist groups mention the detention center much less frequently than in the throes of the Iraq War, and call Guantanamo at most a "supporting argument" to an overarching narrative. "And, while Guantanamo at times provides another instance of this crusade or serves as a counterpoint to U.S. claims of benevolence, the narrative of jihadi propaganda operates at a level far higher than that of any single facility in Cuba," the authors wrote in a post on the Lawfare blog. Author and nonresident Brookings fellow J.M. Berger said that things like expanded use of drones loom much larger than continuing operations at Guantanamo. "U.S. counterterrorism action, particularly drone strikes, are arguably much more important to recruitment and definitely more important to propaganda, but no one talks about shutting those down," he said in an email. A 2010 United States Institute of Peace report found that young men who are drawn to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda join more because it "removes the doubt that young men feel about their place in the world, replacing it with purpose and direction." Berger said recruiters can use Guantanamo as a "wedge issue" to further radicalize potential members, but there’s no hard evidence that it’s used as a primary recruiting tool. Joscelyn, who tracks mentions of Guantanamo in English-language al-Qaeda publications, says there’s a key difference between references and recruitment of future terrorists. "It is possible that some jihadist somewhere was influenced in some way by Guantanamo," he said in an email. "But the people who are arguing that it is being used as a recruiting tool, mainly President Obama and his administration, have not provided any evidence that it is explicitly being used as a recruiting tool (as opposed to passing mentions in propaganda)." Again, time dilutes the potency of Guantanamo as a rallying cry against American foreign policy, especially given Obama’s opposition to the site over the past seven years. "It’s not that great of an anti-U.S. message when our own president campaigned on closing it down," Northeastern University political science professor Max Abrahms said. Our ruling Heck said that there’s "no evidence" that terrorists use Guantanamo as a "recruiting tool." Terrorist groups routinely mention the detention site in both written and videotaped propaganda, but the argument is much murkier when it comes to the site’s effectiveness as a "recruiting tool." However, Heck saying blankly that there’s "no evidence" the site is used by terrorist groups isn’t entirely accurate. We rate the claim as Half True.

pomt-00433	"Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/23/west-virginia-republican-party/west-virginia-gop-largely-accurate-about-food-stam/	In a recent tweet, the West Virginia Republican Party praised President Donald Trump for his role in reducing the number of Americans who rely on food stamps. "Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million. Our economy is (in) recovery and more jobs are available! #WVGOP," the party tweeted Aug. 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is this correct? We looked at the official data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the program formally known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. When Trump took office in January 2017, there were 42.7 million Americans on food stamps. By May 2018, there were 39.3 million Americans collecting food stamps. That’s a decrease of 3.4 million -- an even bigger decrease than the tweet had touted. Measured another way, the number of households with at least one food-stamp recipient declined over the same period by almost 1.5 million. But the tweet drew a connection between Trump’s policies and the downward trend. Is there one? That’s less clear. Food stamp usage peaked in late 2012 and has been declining ever since -- under both Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The Agriculture Department wrote in an April 2018 report that the decline in 2017 "in large part" reflected "the continued improvement in economic conditions in recent years. Because eligibility for SNAP is based largely on a person’s financial situation, program participation is countercyclical, expanding during economic downturns when people lose their jobs and see their incomes fall, and contracting during periods of economic growth when unemployment falls and people’s incomes rise." The department’s report noted that in 2017, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, well below the 7.4 rate in 2013. And the share of Americans with incomes below the poverty line fell, from 14.8 percent in 2013 to 12.7 percent in 2016. Michael Wiseman, a professor of Public Policy at George Washington University said the biggest reason for the drop to "the ongoing economic recovery that begin in the first year of the Obama administration." No president can be fully credited with (or blamed for) economic conditions on their watch, but to the extent that a president can reasonably claim a share of the credit, both Obama and Trump can. There was no sudden turnaround after Trump took office. Another likely reason for the decline in food stamp usage was a tightening of restrictions on SNAP participation by those who fall into the category of "able bodied adults without dependents." Childless adults, aged 18 to 50, who aren’t employed or in a training program for at least 20 hours a week may only receive SNAP benefits for up to three months. However, these restrictions began before Trump took office. "While the Trump administration has proposed various restrictions on SNAP access, none have been implemented," Wiseman said. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million." That’s actually an undercount -- the number of Americans collecting food stamps has decreased by 3.4 million. But the decline began years before Trump took office, so it’s a stretch to attribute sole credit to Trump or his policies. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00902	According to the CDC, "110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/04/phil-robertson/phil-robertson-duck-dynasty-says-110-million-ameri/	At the annual CPAC convention -- a multi-day gathering that draws conservative politicians and activists to the Washington, D.C., area -- there were lots of speakers in suits and ties. And then there was Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the family featured on the A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, sporting his signature salt-and-pepper beard and a camouflage-colored bandana. Robertson, who was at CPAC to accept an award, gave a stemwinder of a speech on conservative values, which play a big role in his TV show. At one point, he brought up the topic of sexually transmitted diseases. "I got my facts from the CDC the day before yesterday," Robertson told the crowd on Feb. 27, 2015. "One hundred and ten million -- 110 million! -- Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness. One hundred and ten million? I’m looking at it, I said" -- here Robertson sighs -- "I don’t want you, America, to get sick. I don’t want you to become ill. I don’t want you to come down with a debilitating disease. I don’t want you to die early." Robertson’s CDC statistic certainly got our attention, since the entire U.S. population was roughly 309 million in 2012, according to the Census Bureau. This would mean that, for Robertson to be right, well over one-third of Americans must have a "sexually transmitted illness." And once you subtract children under 15, the percentage would rise to 44 percent. Those are big percentages. Is Robertson right on the numbers? The short answer is no, but we can see why Robertson thought his stat was correct. (We contacted A&E Networks, Robertson’s publisher and several speakers’ bureaus that feature Robertson, but we did not get any response.) The CDC prominently uses the number 110 million in reference to sexually transmitted diseases. In February 2013, the CDC published a document titled "Fact Sheet: Incidence, Prevalence, and Cost of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the United States." In it, the CDC wrote, "CDC published an overall estimate of the number of prevalent STIs (sexually transmitted infections) in the nation. Prevalence is the total number of new and existing infections at a given time. CDC’s new data suggest that there are more than 110 million total STIs among men and women across the nation." CDC also plays up the 110 million figure several times in the fact sheet’s headlines and graphical elements. Here's how Robertson used it incorrectly. Not Americans, ‘infections’ First, the study doesn’t refer to 110 million Americans -- it refers to 110 million infections. The distinction is everything. People can -- and do -- have more than one different infection, or they may contract the same infection more than once. To come up with the 110 million estimate, each of these infections would have been counted individually. The list of infections represented in the figure includes chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus type 2, HIV, human papillomavirus, syphilis and trichomoniasis. The CDC did not provide us the number of Americans who have a sexually transmitted infection, and it's not clear that such a number exists. Not necessarily an ‘illness’ The second issue with Robertson’s phrasing is that he uses the word "illness" instead of infection. In reality, while infected individuals can pass along an infection, and while they are at risk of getting sick themselves, the vast majority of individuals with infections are not actually ill. Simply put, you don't get ill just because you're infected. The lion’s share of infections -- almost three-quarters of the 110 million infections -- come from human papillomavirus, commonly known as HPV. This virus can cause several types of cancer, including cervical cancer, but only for a small percentage of people infected. The vast majority are not "ill" by any reasonable definition. According to CDC, "the body’s immune system clears most HPV naturally within two years (about 90 percent), though some infections persist. … Most sexually active men and women will get HPV at some point in their lives." By contrast, the four most worrisome diseases included in the study -- syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and HIV -- account for about 1.5 percent of the total number of infections. What the experts say How problematic is Robertson’s framing of the issue? Two experts we checked with expressed concern. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, called Robertson’s emphasis on the 110 million figure "fear-mongering." By way of comparison, Caplan said, "would be to say more than 200 million of us have viruses and bacteria that come from — breathing and touching each other! They are widespread, serious and sometimes fatal — flu, pneumonia, TB, measles, enteroviruses, respiratory viruses, MRSA, meningitis etc." So is the answer, he said, to "be a hermit? Do not breathe around others?" Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine, also cautioned against over-reading the CDC’s figures. "We have always had STIs in this country, and we have done some good things to reduce their burden on our citizens," Fekete said. Our ruling Robertson said that, according to the CDC, "110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness." The figure isn't out of thin air -- it has been touted aggressively by the CDC -- but Robertson describes its meaning incorrectly. There are 110 million infections -- not people who are infected -- and only a small percentage of infected individuals are considered to have an "illness."

pomt-06589	Says "as a share of the US economy, the government’s support for research and development (R&D) has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/26/rush-holt/us-rep-rush-holt-says-government-support-research-/	Two paths that could affect the future of science are diverging on Capitol Hill, according to U.S. Rep. Rush Holt. One -- the idea "that the federal government can play no substantive role in advancing science or technology" -- the Democratic congressman calls "grim and pessimistic." The other -- the idea that recognizes federally funded scientific endeavors can help the economy flourish -- Holt calls "far more hopeful." But, he said, it’s the former that’s taking root in Washington. "The argument is that the government has been ineffective, that "investment" is a codeword for wasteful spending, and that the only way forward is for the government to lower its sights, stop making new investments, and scale back spending," Holt, a physicist, wrote in an opinion article posted on NewJerseyNewsroom.com on Sept. 16. "This view is encapsulated in the recently enacted Budget Control Act of 2011, which demands $2.4 trillion in federal spending cuts. Considering that, as a share of the US economy, the government’s support for research and development (R&D) has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s, I have little doubt that R&D will bear more than its share of these latest cuts." Lawmakers are now wrangling over what funding to slash from the federal budget. As they do, PolitiFact New Jersey checked Holt’s statistic on federal support for research and development. The rocket scientist is right. Holt’s staff sent us a chart from a 2007 Congressional Budget Office report that illustrated spending on research and development in the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP is the value of all goods and services produced within the country; basically, it’s a measure of the nation’s economy. As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures for research and development peaked in 1964 at 1.92 percent, according to data from the National Science Foundation. In 2008, the most recent data available on expenditures, the percentage stood at .73 percent. That’s a decrease of 62 percent, or nearly two-thirds. So, Holt is correct. But it’s worth noting that overall spending -- including funding from government, industry, universities and nonprofit entities -- on research and development during that time frame did not see such a significant drop. In 1964, overall funding, as a percent of GDP, was at 2.88 percent. In 2008, it was 2.79 percent, a decrease of 3 percent. Statistics from the National Science Foundation show the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research. Business, however, foots the bill for the majority of applied research, at nearly 61 percent, and development, at 84 percent, according to 2008 data. What do those statistics mean? We reached out to several experts to find out. The loss of federal support has been cushioned by industry funding, according to Patrick Clemins, director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s R&D Budget and Policy Program. But, he said, "industry invests in late stage research, things that they can turn a profit on in a relatively short time frame," which results in "less big ideas, but less risk as well." Debbie Hart, president of BioNJ, said while industry is looking for both innovation and profit, they are "furthering their best shots on goal." With industry looking to fund projects near the finish line and government support as a percent of the economy dwindling, Hart poses two questions: "What are we missing? What are the missed opportunities?" If the decline in federal support for research and development continues, Michael J. Pazzani, vice president for research and economic development at Rutgers University, said we’ll see, "fewer people pursuing careers in academic research, fewer discoveries." Our ruling Congressman Holt claimed that as a potion of the nation’s economy, government support for research and development has "fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s." Data on federal expenditures from the National Science Foundation show that as a percentage of the gross domestic product, spending has dropped by 62 percent since 1964. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06946	"We have not had unemployment this high for this long since the Great Depression."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/19/marco-rubio/us-sen-marco-rubio-says-unemployment-streak-worst-/	Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio accused President Barack Obama of making "every aspect of life in America today" worse since his inauguration during a talk about the debt ceiling on CBS's "Face the Nation" on July 17, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer asked Rubio if he literally meant what he said, so Rubio continued: "Well, first of all, let -- every president has to be judged by the times in which he lives. This president has now been in charge for two and a half years, okay? He has increased federal spending by 28 percent. Washington went along with his prescription for joblessness, which was the stimulus package, and unemployment is higher than it was when he took over, significantly higher. In fact, we have not had unemployment this high for this long since the Great Depression, with no signs of it getting better." We noticed Rubio evokes a popular historical note of Republicans -- the Great Depression -- to characterize the country's dire jobs outlook. He isn't the first politician to link now with then, though he might be the first whose claim has a ring of truth. Previously, PolitiFact gave GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney a False for saying the United States is in the slowest job recovery since President Herbert Hoover (1929-1933). And Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus earned a similar False rating for claiming that recent unemployment rates rival those of the Great Depression. Rubio's claim comes with an important distinction. Instead of comparing recent jobless numbers with the 1930s, he says we have not had unemployment this high for this long since the Great Depression. Unemployment during that time was dreadful, as we've outlined before, rising to 15.9 percent in 1931 and then shooting up to 24.9 percent in 1933. It returned to 9.9 percent in 1941. Unemployment figures for the current recession first tipped above 9 percent in May 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rates mostly fell between 9 and 10.1 percent for the past 26 months, with the exception of dips in February (8.9) and March 2011 (8.8). The rate for June 2011 is 9.2 percent. How does that compare to other periods of time since the Great Depression? The Bureau of Labor Statistics only has unemployment data going back to 1948, which means we cannot analyze unemployment statistics from the years surrounding World War II. (We know, however, that unemployment was abnormally low during that time because of the war effort.) But since 1948, only one period of time comes close. Unemployment rates of 9 percent of more appeared in the United States in March 1982 and lasted through September 1983. During that 19-month period, the unemployment ranged between 9 and 10.8 percent -- including 10 straight months of unemployment rates higher than 10 percent. During the most recent economic downturn, the only time the unemployment rate nosed above 10 percent was for one month, in October 2009. So the current economic downturn has a longer period of unemployment rates above 9 percent, but the 1982-83 recession had overall higher unemployment rates. No other period in modern U.S. history compares. Rubio is right on about the country's current unemployment outlook not being "this high for this long since the Great Depression." But he fails to note a comparable period in the early '80s that -- while shorter by seven months -- had several months of higher overall unemployment. We rate Rubio's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14318	"There’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we (American businesses) go into China, whereas when China sells to us there’s no tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/trump-miscasts-impact-trade-chinese-taxes/	Donald Trump loves to tell voters he’s all about getting a better deal for America. It’s a theme he invokes repeatedly when it comes to trade. In a recent interview with two New York Times reporters, Trump called for a different mind set. "I do know my subject, and I do know that our country cannot continue to do what it’s doing," Trump said. "It’s very hard for us to do business in China, it’s very easy for China to do business with us. Plus with us, there’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, whereas when China sells to us, there’s no tax. I mean, it’s a whole double standard." We wondered, is there a hefty tax when American firms sell in China, while there’s no tax that Chinese firms face when they sell here? We asked the Trump campaign for background information on this and didn’t hear back. The trade experts we reached told us there two possible ways to interpret what Trump means by a "tax that we pay when we go into China." He might have meant China’s value-added tax, or VAT, or he might have meant China’s import tariffs. We’ll explore both. Value Added Tax This tax is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service, but with a refund mechanism for VAT paid on purchased units so the final burden falls on the final buyer or consumer. So for example, when a clothing wholesaler sells some shirts to a retailer, the tax is booked on the wholesaler’s mark-up. When the retailer sells the shirt to a customer, the tax is booked again. But the retailer gets a credit back for the tax paid by the wholesaler. China, along with about 160 other countries including Euro Zone members, has a VAT. The United States does not. China’s basic VAT is 17 percent, but some items, such as agricultural products, are not taxed at all, and some products face a lower rate of 13 percent. So in terms of a VAT, Trump has a point. But it isn’t one that has to do with a tax that uniquely raises the price of American goods and services sold in China. By and large, the VAT applies to all sales, regardless of where the product was made. It raises the costs for everybody. "VAT or not doesn’t make much difference," said John Graham, a professor of international business at the UC Irvine Paul Merage School of Business. An analysis of challenges in U.S.-China trade relations by the Congressional Research Service, the policy think tank of Congress, makes no mention of China’s value-added tax. The Office of U.S. Trade Representative’s 2015 report on China does mention China’s VAT, but only in the way the government used VAT rebates to reduce costs for Chinese exporters. "These practices have caused tremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products," the report says, especially for products where China is a leading world producer, such as steel, aluminum and soda ash. While that allows Chinese manufacturers to sell more cheaply overseas, it doesn’t make it more expensive for any foreign company to compete for sales in China. For the record, it is worth putting China’s VAT into context. With one exception, countries in the European Union charge a higher rate. Luxembourg’s is the same as China’s, but Germany’s is 19 percent, France’s is 20 percent and Italy’s is 22 percent. Tariffs Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports. On this front, China imposes higher rates than does the United States. Here’s how it breaks down, according to the World Trade Organization: Agricultural Products Non-Agricultural Products US tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the United States 2.5% 2.9% Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods sold in China 9.7% 5.0% There are different ways to summarize tariffs. The table above is adjusted for the volume of trade of different goods in each broad category, but regardless of how you cut it, China has higher tariffs than the United States. However, Trump said Chinese goods faced no tax in the United States. That’s inaccurate. For agricultural goods, the tax is 2.5 percent. For non-agricultural goods, it is 2.9 percent. "If Trump was referring to tariffs, which are a kind of tax, then it is clearly incorrect that Chinese products come into the U.S. tariff-free," said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. It’s also worth noting that as a member of the World Trade Organization, China treats all importers the same, except if it has a separate free-trade deal. So, all things being equal, every WTO trading partner pays the same import tariff as the United States. China does have a number of free-trade treaties with many Asian countries, plus ones with Australia, Chile and others. Julia Ya Qin, professor of law at Wayne State University, told us that it’s not unusual for the United States to have lower rates than China. "Industrialized countries generally have lower tariffs than developing countries," Qin said. "Hence, countries such as India, Turkey, Argentina have much higher average tariffs than the United States, the EU, Canada, Japan on industrial products. China is somewhere in between the two groups." Overall, while the United States and others have had trade disputes with China, they don’t hinge on tariffs or taxes. "Generally, they are not major problems even in most cases worldwide," said Stuart Malawer, professor of law and international trade at George Mason University. Malawer served on the Virginia governor’s trade mission to China. "The real problem are non-tariff barriers. China has a significant number of them. These are primarily regulatory." A leading example on the regulatory side has to do with beef. In 2014, China used food safety rules to block beef imports. Malawer reviewed the history of trade disputes between the United States and China and told us that tariffs and taxes "are not an issue between the U.S. and China." Our ruling Trump said "there’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, whereas when China sells to us, there’s no tax." If Trump was thinking of China’s value-added tax, he has something of a point. China has a basic VAT of 17 percent, while the United States has none. However, the VAT applies to most goods sold in China, regardless of where they are made. And the VAT affects domestic producers the same as foreign ones. If Trump was thinking of import tariffs, he has a different problem. Yes, China’s tariffs are higher than those imposed by the United States, but the Chinese exporters do face a tax when they sell in this country. So in terms of tariffs, Trump is wrong. No expert or report we found from impartial sources suggested that taxes of any sort presented a challenge to American firms that sell in China. There are problems, but they stem from other things China does. Whatever tax or tariff Trump had in mind, he either exaggerated the impact on trade or got the U.S. rate wrong.

pomt-12306	"When colleges and universities are added, education spending is the biggest item in the state budget — about 52 percent of all state dollars."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jun/23/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-notes-education-absorbs-52-percent-bud/	After Dan Patrick popped a statistic to back his contention that Texas state government spends plenty on education, a reader asked us to check the Republican lieutenant governor’s accuracy. Patrick, in a June 2017 commentary, extolled the state budget then about to be signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, specifying: "Texas spends $60 billion on schools in our two-year budget, including both federal and state funds. Of that, $41 billion is state funding. That is on top of the estimated $28 billion to $30 billion annually paid by local property taxpayers. "When colleges and universities are added," Patrick said, "education spending is the biggest item in the state budget — about 52 percent of all state dollars. Health care is second, accounting for most of the remaining dollars. It is disingenuous to suggest that we are, somehow, holding back funding that we could spend on schools." Our review of budget documents posted by the Legislative Budget Board led us to find Patrick’s figure solid though the percentage also proved historic in a low-end way not stated by Patrick. Patrick cites state budget summary Up front, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia responded by email to our inquiry about the basis of Patrick’s "52 percent" by pointing out a chart in the 2018-19 state budget, which takes effect Sept. 1, 2017. The chart shows that the budget puts $55.9 billion in general revenue toward public and higher education out of $106.7 billion in all such revenue — which breaks out to 52.4 percent of such spending. Next highest: Nearly $34 billion budgeted for health and human services accounts for 31 percent of state spending in the budget. SOURCE: Document, "Summary of Conference Committee Report for Senate Bill 1, Appropriations for the 2018-19 Biennium," Legislative Budget Board, May 2017 (accessed June 14, 2017) Some context: The chart shows that the nearly $41 billion in public school aid appropriated by the 2017 Legislature trailed $635.6 million, or 1.5 percent, behind what lawmakers budgeted for public schools the previous two years. On the other hand, the new budget increases state spending on higher education by $195.2 million, 1.1 percent, from the 2016-17 budget, according to the chart. We asked the Legislative Budget Board about Patrick’s percentage. By email, staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva responded by pointing out the same chart offered by Patrick. Separately to our emailed inquiries, Austin school-finance expert Joe Wisnoski, who works for a firm that represents school districts, and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials didn’t quibble with Patrick’s calculation. Wisnoski added, though, that the 52 percent conclusion "may not be the whole story." He also pointed out that from all funding sources--including federal aid--lawmakers devoted $80 billion to education, which represented 37 percent of the full $217 billion state budget. Alternate calculation For our part, we noticed one other way of gauging the share of state revenue budgeted for education. Another chart in the budget shows that lawmakers budgeted nearly $58.8 billion for public schools and higher education in state general revenue plus the smaller pot of money consisting of state revenue dedicated to particular expenditures. The combined amount, we found, also breaks out to 52 percent of the full budget’s $113.1 billion in state revenue and dedicated state revenue: SOURCE: Document, "Summary of Conference Committee Report for Senate Bill 1, Appropriations for the 2018-19 Biennium," Legislative Budget Board, May 2017 (accessed June 14, 2017) Other state funds? When we asked about Patrick's claim, Dominic Giarratani of the Texas Association of School Boards agreed it’s fair to focus on state general revenue to evaluate budgeted spending on education. By email, though, he also provided a calculation suggesting that public plus higher education accounts for 48 percent of non-federal spending in the budget. That’s correct, it looked to us, though it’s worth noting the additional spending captured by this alternate analysis folds in chunks of money not easily controlled by lawmakers--including $1.8 billion of earnings on the endowment that benefits institutions in the University of Texas and Texas A&M University systems; nearly $4.6 billion in local tax revenue projected to be provided by property-rich school districts, including the Austin district, to support the state’s school finance system; and nearly $3.6 billion in payments driven by a 2006 state-mandated reduction in school property taxes. Historic low? Next, we wondered how the 52 percent cited by Patrick for 2018-19 compares to the share of state GR devoted to education in previous budgets. To get a fix on that, we checked spending on education from non-dedicated GR in the previous 10 budgets. Such funds comprise the bulk of each budget and are most directly controlled by legislative decisions. Our finding: In the budgets, which encompass 20 years, no Legislature devoted less than 53 percent of general revenue to education. On average, education’s share of state spending through the budgets was 58 percent. State Revenue Budgeted for Education, Texas, 1998-99 through 2018-19 (By Percentage) BUDGET YEARS SHARE OF REVENUE* BUDGETED FOR PUBLIC AND HIGHER EDUCATION 1998-99 61 % 2000-01 63 2002-03 59 2004-05 59 2006-07 56 2008-09 59 2010-11 61 2012-13 57 2014-15 53 2016-17 53 2018-19 52 *State general revenue, excluding revenue constitutionally dedicated to particular purposes. SOURCE: PolitiFact Texas calculations drawing on state budgets adopted by Texas Legislature, 1997-2017 as posted by the Legislative Budget Board (accessed June 14-15, 2017) Our ruling Patrick, saying it’s disingenuous to suggest lawmakers held back on education aid, said 52 percent of state spending in the 2018-19 state budget was appropriated to public plus higher education. That’s an accurate percentage. Unclarified: Education also accounts for the smallest share of budgeted state spending in at least 20 years, which is as far back as we checked.

pomt-10150	John McCain said "he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/02/joe-biden/mccain-refused-to-commit/	During the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Joe Biden argued for a vigorous diplomacy and attacked John McCain's approach to foreign policy. "John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. I find that incredible," Biden said. Biden was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, to the White House. McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration — and now McCain — to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies. Here's the relevant portion of the interview: Q: Senator, finally, let’s talk about Spain. If you’re elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you? A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. I’m glad we’re now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House. Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself? A: Uh, I don’t, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both. Q: So, you have to wait and see if he’s willing to, to meet with you, or you be… able to do it? In the White House? A: Well, again… I, I don’t… All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and that’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region. Q: OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if you’re elected president? A: I’m willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not. McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it "a global champion of freedom." The U.S. State Department says "Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields." But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq. We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him "OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the president of Spain." But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with "any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are." We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but when the issue first came up during the campaign, the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional. "The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero — and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview," Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to the Washington Post and CNN. Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain "will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance." To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that "I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities" indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations. Which bring us back to Biden's statement. Biden said, "John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now." Our reading of the interview is that McCain won't commit himself in advance to meeting or not meeting with the government of Spain. That's very different from refusing to meet with Spain. Biden could have criticized McCain for that noncommittal stance and been more accurate. But instead Biden took it a step further and said McCain refused outright to meet with Spain. We rate Biden's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10434	Says Obama called Israel "a constant sore" that infects U.S. foreign policy.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/13/john-boehner/misquoting-obamas-remarks/	House Republican leader John Boehner waded into the presidential campaign on May 12, 2008, by attacking Sen. Barack Obama over comments the Illinois senator made about the Middle East. "Israel is a critical American ally and a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, not a 'constant sore' as Barack Obama claims," Boehner said in a news release from the Freedom Project, a Republican political action committee that he chairs. "Obama's latest remark, and his commitment to 'opening a dialogue' with sponsors of terrorism, echoes past statements by Jimmy Carter, who once called Israel an 'apartheid state.' It's another sign that Obama is part of the broken Washington Americans are rejecting." Boehner, of Ohio, was referring to an interview Obama gave Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic that focused on Israel, conflicts in the Middle East, and Hamas, the Palestinian group that wants to destroy Israel. Obama said in the phone interview May 10 that "there's no doubt that Israel and the Palestinians have tough issues to work out to get to the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security" but that he didn't agree with the suggestion by former President Jimmy Carter that Israel resembles "an apartheid state." That was followed by this exchange: Goldberg: "If you become president, will you denounce settlements publicly?" Obama: "What I will say is what I've said previously. Settlements at this juncture are not helpful. Look, my interest is in solving this problem not only for Israel but for the United States." Goldberg: "Do you think that Israel is a drag on America's reputation overseas?" Obama: "No, no, no. But what I think is that this constant wound, that this constant sore, does infect all of our foreign policy. The lack of a resolution to this problem provides an excuse for anti-American militant jihadists to engage in inexcusable actions, and so we have a national security interest in solving this, and I also believe that Israel has a security interest in solving this because I believe that the status quo is unsustainable." Boehner's statement alleges that Obama was saying that Israel, a key ally of the United States, is a "constant wound ... constant sore." But it's clear from the rest of the interview that Obama was referring to the Middle East conflict, not Israel. And Goldberg himself said in this blog posting "that Obama was clearly calling the Middle East conflict, and not Israel, a sore." Goldberg added sarcastically that he was sure Boehner would issue a corrected press release because during the interview, "Obama expressed — in 12 different ways — his support for Israel." Given the context for Obama's remarks and his repeated support of Israel throughout the interview, we find Boehner's statement to be False.

The narrator continues: "Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change." Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo does not support Trump but said he won’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.) We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Florida’s coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change. Trump on drilling Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasn’t always been clear. He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. "They've already got plenty in the Gulf," Trump said. "It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing." But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time. "We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies," he said in North Dakota in May. In September, Trump said in a fact sheet that he will "open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production" and will eliminate "unnecessary restrictions" on offshore oil and gas. ‘Curbelo supports drilling offshore’ While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction. Curbelo made a video of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015: "The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure," he said. But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by banning funds, research or testing. He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts. ‘Repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change’ The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbelo’s record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution. • In January Curbelo took a stand along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the "Waters of the United States" rule was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts. • In 2015, Curbelo voted in favor of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using "secret science" and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science. • The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a government climate model program in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said. • Curbelo also voted in favor of a bill to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015. Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change. In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a congressional resolution acknowledging climate change’s existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. "It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference," Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the Miami Herald Oct. 24, 2015. We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution. In December 2015, Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPA’s rules to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants. In July 2016, Curbelo opposed a vote by a Florida commission to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways. Our ruling The DCCC said,"Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change." Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Florida’s coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change.

pomt-02608	For "the past year, I was censored" and muzzled.	false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-wasnt-muzzled-or-censored-his-cooling-yea/	Was the some-would-say-irrepressible Ron Paul of Texas muzzled for a year? So the former congressman and past presidential candidate wrote in a Jan. 14, 2014, email blast soliciting contributions to Campaign for Liberty, a political group. "You may not know this…," the email opened. "But for the past year, I was censored. Believe it or not, federal rules governing former members of Congress for their first year after retirement limited my ability to mobilize Americans to advance liberty." Paul, whose last day in the House was Jan. 3, 2013, wrote: "Every communication had to be carefully crafted, and often even double-checked by C4L’s lawyers, to make sure I didn't violate federal law. But as of January 4th, the muzzle has been removed!" Paul’s email included a postscript beginning: "Due to my retirement from Congress, federal law has restricted what I could say and do for the past year. But the muzzle's been removed--and I'm now free to speak my mind." In the email, Paul proclaimed a 10-day "Freedom Bomb" with the goal of flooding Congress with 20,000 "Defend Liberty Directives" letting every member "know the R3VOLUTION is alive and well." Paul wrote, too, that the effort’s priority would be forcing the Senate to vote on a proposal to audit the Federal Reserve. Group cites House rules We asked Campaign for Liberty, which says it is devoted to promoting "individual liberty, constitutional government, sound money, free markets and a noninterventionist foreign policy," to illuminate how Paul was censored and muzzled for a year. By email, an unidentified staff member said Paul "was not allowed to talk about certain things during the past year because of House Ethics Rules. This requires that you stay quiet about certain things for 1 year after your retirement from the House of Representatives." The staff email included a web link to a document, revised in January 2012, presenting highlights of the House’s ethics rules and a section titled "Post-Employment Restrictions," which the section says apply to House members. According to the section, for one year after leaving office, a member may not communicate with or appear before a member, officer or employee of the House or Senate or any legislative branch office with "intent to influence official action on behalf of anyone else." Also, according to the section, a member "may not represent or advise a foreign government or a foreign political party" or "represent oneself, a state or local government, or the U.S. government as an official or employee of a government agency or entity." Finally, according to the section, a member "may not lobby the staff of a member in lieu of lobbying the member directly." Violations of the prohibitions, the section says, are felonies punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Experts say restriction doesn't leash free speech We spotted nothing there about being leashed from speaking your mind or coaxing others to do so. Experts agreed. Attorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, told us by email that Paul was restricted for one year under the standard one-year "cooling off" period for all House members and senior staff; senators face a two-year limit. "During that time," Gross said. "a former member may not appear before Congress on substantive matters but that restriction does not prohibit public appearances." By email, another expert, attorney Brett Kappel, who specializes in campaign-related laws, agreed with Gross’ analysis. Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which says it promotes ethics and accountability by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests, told us by phone the one-year restriction could extend to keeping Paul and other former House members from lobbying members by testifying before a committee. Then again, Sloan said, members could still be invited to offer their views on topics. By email, she noted a May 12, 2010, report by the advisory non-partisan Congressional Research Service stating: "The prohibition goes only to advocacy-type of communications, that is, communications ‘with the intent to influence’ a member or officer or employee of the legislative branch concerning "any matter on which such person seeks official action" by that member, officer or employee, or by either house of Congress. There are also several specific exceptions to the general prohibition, including, for example, exceptions for lobbying and advocacy work for state or local governments, testifying on matters under oath, and generally for representations or communications on behalf of political candidates, parties and political organizations." Upshot: A former House member must take a year off from advocating positions on issues with members of Congress. Sloan and Gross each said, though, that former House members aren’t restricted from generally speaking out. Paul, Gross said, "was permitted to make public appearances and espouse views. However, he was restricted in making one-on-one appearance(s) before and lobbying members of Congress and staff." After reading a portion of Paul’s email blast, Sloan commented by email: "From the missive, it appears Paul does have legislative interests. If he wanted to personally lobby Congress on these issues, he was prohibited from doing so for the past year... Sending emails to supporters trying to galvanize them around issues like auditing the Fed isn’t lobbying and would be permissible. So the concept that every word in these emails had to be reviewed by lawyers to comply with the lobbying ban is nonsense." Sloan said in a follow-up email: "I have trouble imagining what Paul wanted to do that he couldn’t do--if he wanted to write op-eds, appear on television, or have speaking engagements, all of that would have been allowed." Paul spoke out during year A search for news stories using the Nexis news database gave indications that Paul often aired his views in the year at issue. On April 23, 2013, Paul gave an interview to Bloomberg News covering the value of the dollar and also touching on his views of the bitcoin and immigration laws. On June 10, 2013, Paul gave thanks for leakers of documents revealing the government’s eavesdropping efforts, according to a CNN news blog post. A day later, Paul said in a telephone interview on Fox Business News that the government might kill leaker Edward Snowden with a missile. On CNN’s Aug. 15, 2013, "Situation Room," Paul questioned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s qualifications to be president and said his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was prepared to be president. His comments also touched on his concerns about central economic planning by the Federal Reserve. On Sept. 19, 2013, Paul appeared on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," offering his interpretation of an announcement by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. An Oct. 1, 2013, US News news story quoted Paul describing the temporary government shutdown as "less of an event than everyone’s claiming it to be." Paul said generally: "Republicans and Democrats are basically in agreement with authoritarianism. They believe that one way or another you have to be an authoritarian, to tell you how to spend your money [and] both of them tell you how to run your personal life. And they're both very excited about telling every country what to do, and giving them money if they behave or bombing them if they don't." In the year, Paul also helped launch the online RonPaulChannel, telling the Washington Times for a news story posted Aug. 8, 2013: "It will give me an opportunity to talk about the issues I've been talking about for 30 years. But it's in a different format. I won't be cut off from my subscribers because we plan to take their questions through email, interview individuals and go in-depth." The story quoted Paul as saying that the channel had pulled in 200,000 subscribers within hours of a publicity announcement that week, drawn by his personal guarantee they would not confront censors, or the "games and lies" of traditional broadcast and cable channels. The channel’s website has about 40 taped video messages from Paul that were placed online before the one-year cooling-off period ended, starting with an Aug. 15, 2013, commentary on Egypt and the United States extending to a Jan. 2, 2014, commentary on Iran sanctions. Our attempt to reach a spokeswoman for Campaign for Liberty about our findings was unsuccessful. Our ruling Paul said he was censored and muzzled for the year after he left the House. That's not factually supported. Far as we could tell, in contrast, Paul freely voiced his views on issues in most every way possible during the year, though he was barred, as a former member, from directly lobbying lawmakers.

pomt-15187	Says Michele Bachmann said, "The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/20/facebook-posts/no-michele-bachmann-did-not-say-there-are-no-illeg/	Donald Trump’s border wall proposal has earned him high praise from his political predecessor, former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., according to a meme circulating on social media. According to one version of the meme, Bachmann said, "There are those who say a border wall won't work. They just don't have the vision Donald Trump does. The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China." It’s a tidy confluence of past and present presidential campaigns, as Trump’s lead in the Republican field is often compared to Bachmann’s early success in the 2012 presidential election. Several readers asked us to look into whether Bachmann actually made the comments. We obliged and found no evidence backing the claim. We also reached out to Bachmann’s spokesperson, who said the former member of Congress never made the remarks. The first thing that had us raising our eyebrows was some of the text that accompanied the meme when it was posted on Facebook. "What do you think about a Trump/Bachmann ticket in the 2016 Presidential race?" it said. "Former Rep. Michelle Bachman (sic) told Fox News' Jenna Jameson she ‘admired Donald's leadership and vision’ and also complimented Trump on his reality show success, ‘If Donald can do for this country what he did for Arsenio Hall America will be great again.’ " Jameson is a former porn star, not a Fox News host, nor is she employed by the network in any way, said a Fox spokesperson. (Jameson did make a rocky appearance on a Fox entertainment program in 2013.) We also searched three comprehensive databases -- Nexis and CQ, which aggregate transcripts, and Critical Mention, which records video and closed captioning -- and found no record of Bachmann ever making those comments. To our knowledge, she hasn’t appeared on Fox News since Trump announced his candidacy. She has commented on and praised Trump in several interviews on different networks, though she has never mentioned his wall proposal. Here’s a rundown of her Trump-related remarks: • Aug. 6 on MSNBC’s Hardball: When asked if Trump will make for a good candidate, Bachmann said, "Well, that's what he’ll have to prove on the stage" at the first GOP debate. • Aug 8 on CNN Tonight: "He’s like the Rocky Balboa of politics. He’s a winner. He’s been winning all through his life." • Aug. 10 in an interview with conservative radio host Tony Perkins: "When he talks about the effects of illegal immigration on the United States, that resonates with the American people." • Aug. 17 on CBS News: "He’s getting it right. … Donald Trump has the secret decoder ring of what’s on voters’ minds. I think I had that too when it came to the repeal of Obamacare. Donald Trump understands people are not happy with massive immigration from third-world countries." Before Trump, Bachmann championed the idea of a border fence for years, but we couldn’t find an instance when she’s evoked the Great Wall of China. ButTrump has. "Well, 3,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China was built. We would like to have that wall. That wall, nobody gets through. That I can tell you. And that's 13,000 miles. right?" he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 18. "I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're going to call it the Trump Wall." Bachmann’s spokeswoman told us that Bachmann agrees with Trump’s views on immigration, adding, "Trump's emphasis on stopping the current tidal wave of immigration is in sync with a plurality of voters, as polls demonstrate a great majority of Americans believe." Our ruling A meme says that Bachmann said, "The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China." We found no evidence that Bachmann ever said this, and her spokeswoman said she did not, in fact, say it. The meme seems to have satirical origins but is now being passed off as fact.

pomt-10753	"I'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing, along with Russ Feingold, some of the toughest ethics reform since Watergate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/31/barack-obama/he-had-help/	At a Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Sen. Barack Obama boasted about his accomplishments on ethics reform. He said, "I'm glad Hillary is talking about it, but I'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing, along with Russ Feingold, some of the toughest ethics reform since Watergate, making sure that lobbyists could not provide gifts and meals to congressmen, making sure that the bundling of money by lobbyists was disclosed." Obama has indeed worked on ethics reform the past two years, which came in the aftermath of the Abramoff scandal amid a groundswell of support for reforms. But the other Democratic candidates have backed reform as well. It's an exaggeration for him to suggest that he was the only person on the stage in Philadelphia who had pushed for reform. Last year he cosponsored an ethics reform bill and was the Democratic point man for drumming up more cosponsors. Joining him in cosponsorship were his debate mates, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd and Joe Biden. That bill did not make it out of committee, but another, less stringent, ethics reform bill did pass the Senate. That bill, authored by Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., passed, but Obama can't take credit for that one. He didn't even vote for it because he objected to the lack of enforcement provisions. He did cosponsor a successful amendment concerning meals from lobbyists, but the main sponsor of that amendment was the allegedly inactive Dodd. Clinton, Dodd and Biden voted for the final bill. This year Obama cosponsored (and according to his campaign, helped draft) a bill further tightening ethics rules for Congress. Russ Feingold introduced it Jan 9, 2007. However, it was not that bill, but another one, sponsored by Majority Leader Harry Reid and introduced five days earlier on Jan. 4, 2007 that eventually became law. Obama was not a cosponsor, but he did successfully offer an amendment concerning lobbyist disclosure and the bill included some elements from the one he had introduced the previous year. Obama, as well as Biden, Clinton and Dodd all voted for it. In the House, Kucinich also voted for it. And so, given that Obama had some help with ethics reform, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-04895	"In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/06/jeff-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-race-republican-jeff-fitzgerald-s/	In the race for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin consistently portrays herself as a fighter for the middle class. And the four Republicans seeking to win the Aug. 14, 2012, primary to challenge her frequently remind voters that Baldwin is one of the most liberal members of the House. (In September 2011, we rated as Mostly True a claim that she is the most liberal.) With a July 26, 2012 news release, GOP candidate Jeff Fitzgerald took a different tack on Baldwin's record. "Without her extreme liberal voting record, you wouldn’t even know she has been in Washington for the last 14 years," the Wisconsin Assembly speaker said, adding: "In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law." The implication: Baldwin is ineffective. Fitzgerald's evidence Baldwin, who is unchallenged in the Democratic primary, entered Congress in January 1999. She is serving her seventh two-year term. Fitzgerald’s news release provided a term-by-term count of the 105 bills he said Baldwin sponsored, plus a summary of the three it said became law. (Baldwin’s campaign agrees with the numbers.) Baldwin’s House Resolution 1760, introduced in 2005, named a Madison post office for Robert LaFollette Sr., who served in the U.S. House and Senate, and as Wisconsin’s governor, in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Her House Resolution 1132, introduced in 2007, provided waivers relating to grants to expand screenings and follow-up services for breast and cervical cancer. And her House Resolution 797, also introduced in 2007, modified standards to allow more veterans to qualify for disability compensation for vision impairment. While the three did become law, none was a major piece of legislation. Baldwin response Asked to respond, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said most of her bills had Republican co-sponsors. And he argued that legislation she currently backs is being "obstructed by the GOP." Neither point refutes Fitzgerald’s claim on the number of Baldwin-sponsored bills that have become law. But Kraus also made a third point that goes to Fitzgerald’s suggestion that Baldwin has been unproductive. Kraus noted U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who also the entered House in 1999, has sponsored 75 bills, with two becoming law. (One named a post office and one modified excise taxes on arrows.) Neither of those measures qualifies as major legislation, either -- even though Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is prominent enough to be mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate in 2012. The implication: Looking strictly at bills passed doesn’t say much about the overall performance of a lawmaker. "The number of bills introduced that are enacted into law is a blunt and often misleading measure of legislative effectiveness," congressional scholar Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., told us. "Many of the most effective legislators seldom introduce bills themselves but work instead in committee and on the floor to influence the shape of legislation. Paul Ryan is a good case in point." We would add that many factors -- such as which party controls Congress and the White House -- affect whether a bill becomes law. And sponsoring legislation is only one of the myriad tasks a House member performs. On her House website, for example, Baldwin claims credit for bringing more than $100 million in federal money to her district. Our rating Suggesting that Baldwin has been nearly invisible in Congress, Fitzgerald claimed: "In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law." His statement is accurate, but it needs clarification. The number of Baldwin bills that became law is only one measure of her overall record -- and one that can be misleading when viewed in isolation. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-00963	The woman named Wisconsin’s 2010 "outstanding teacher of the year" was laid off by the Milwaukee Public Schools that year under "seniority and tenure rules" that were eliminated by his Act 10 changes.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsins-teacher-year-was-/	For years, Gov. Scott Walker has made high school English teacher Megan Sampson the face of Act 10 -- his signature bill that curtailed collective bargaining for most public employee unions. Sampson was a first-year teacher who lost her job in 2010 after Milwaukee Public Schools experienced a budget crisis. Walker cites her as an example of why his Act 10 reforms -- and the changes they made to how public employees can be hired and fired -- were needed. In essence, he says, an excellent teacher lost her job because of the union contract. Walker first brought national attention to Sampson when he mentioned her in the opening paragraph of a March 10, 2011 Wall Street Journal opinion piece. Now, Walker has been including a version of Sampson’s story in the speeches he is making as he moves toward a 2016 presidential bid. Here’s how Walker explained it Jan. 24, 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit. "In 2010, there was a young woman named Megan Sampson who was honored as the outstanding teacher of the year in my state," he said. "And not long after she got that distinction, she was laid off by her school district." Walker explained: "Her union contract said the last hired was the first fired; the last in was the first out." Is Walker right? Digging into the claim As evidence, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson cited a June 14, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that focused on Sampson and other MPS teachers who were laid off. Sampson, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, had taken her first job with MPS in the fall of 2009. She taught English at Bradley Tech High School. That year, the article noted, Sampson received the Nancy Hoefs Memorial Award for the Outstanding First-Year Teacher from the Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English. One week after receiving the award, MPS issued layoff notices to 482 teachers, according to seniority. Sampson was among those who got the notice under the seniority rules that were part of the contract with MPS and the teachers’ union. Such rules are common in labor agreements. In August 2010, the district attempted to rehire -- "call back" in union parlance -- Sampson, after numerous resignations and additional funding became available. However, by then she had accepted a position teaching English at Wauwatosa East High School, where she is still employed. So, on the layoff portion of claim, Walker is correct. Megan Sampson lost her job at Bradley Tech because of the union contract in place at the time. And Walker is also correct that Act 10 did away with such rules. The law limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises, and those have an inflation-based cap. The changes ended bargaining over benefits, overtime, work conditions -- including the use of seniority when it comes to layoffs. Other twists But Walker stretches things when he emphasizes Sampson’s honor, making the award more significant. As the original Journal Sentinel story noted, Sampson was named outstanding first-year teacher by the Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English. (Indeed, this is the story cited by Walker’s team as evidence of his claim.) Nine months later, in the Wall Street Journal piece, Walker called her "an Outstanding First Year Teacher in Wisconsin." That’s mostly correct. In Iowa, Walker described her as "the outstanding teacher of the year." That overstates the honor. Others have made the same observation. There are 50,000-plus public school teachers in the state. Only a percentage of those are English teachers. And first-year English teachers are a smaller group still. The state does name an outstanding teacher of the year -- there actually were four of them in 2010. The state Department of Public Instruction gave the high school teacher award to Claudia Klein Felske, an English teacher in the East Troy district. The award was presented Sept. 8, 2010 by state Schools Superintendent Tony Evers at an assembly in the high school gym. After Walker’s recent speeches, Felske posted an "open letter" to the governor criticizing his education policies. Our rating In Iowa, Walker said the woman named Wisconsin’s "outstanding teacher of the year" was laid off by the Milwaukee Public Schools in 2010 under "seniority and tenure rules" that were eliminated by his Act 10 changes. His point on the seniority rules and their elimination under Act 10 are on target -- though he does not mention that MPS had offered Sampson the job back. However, in seeking a stronger rhetorical point, Walker stretches the honor Sampson received. It helps make the story more dramatic, but less accurate. We rate Walker’s statement Half True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-10492	"McCain opposes a woman's right to choose."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/mccain-opposes-abortion/	MoveOn.org has attacked Sen. John McCain in an e-mail to its membership, urging people to email it to "friends, family and co-workers." The e-mail lists 10 items about McCain, beginning with the statement, "His carefully crafted positive image relies on people not knowing this stuff — and you might be surprised by some of it." The fourth item on the list states, "McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, 'I do not support Roe vs. Wade . It should be overturned.' " MoveOn is on solid ground here. McCain calls himself prolife. During the primaries in 2007, he asserted several times that he thought Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, and that message is featured prominently on McCain's campaign Web site. "John McCain believes Roe vs. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench," the Web site states. "Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of Roe vs. Wade , returning the abortion question to the individual states." We find MoveOn's statement about McCain's position on abortion to be True.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2008-04-08T00:00:00	2008-04-05	['None']
pomt-13997	"A trade war is something very different (than curbing new trade agreements). We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/06/hillary-clinton/shot-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-correct-about-ta/	During a speech in which she attacked Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas as "dangerously incoherent," Hillary Clinton reached back almost nine decades to make a Great Depression-era analogy. Clinton said she understood voters’ concerns about the negative impacts of free trade agreements -- a big driver of Trump’s electoral success so far. Still, pursuing large tariffs against such trading partners as China and Mexico -- as Trump has suggested -- would be dangerously misguided, Clinton argued. "I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements," Clinton said. "I do, too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful." We wondered whether there is widespread support among historians and economists for the idea that raising tariffs and enabling a trade war "made the Great Depression longer and more painful." When we asked the Clinton campaign for its evidence, they pointed us to a 2013 speech by Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke, whose expertise as an academic was the Great Depression. But we found additional support among other experts who have studied the period. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found. In a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.) Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here): "In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression." Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Clinton said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got even worse. Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 -- sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. -- raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. These moves, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own. So how accurate is the Clinton-Stein version of events? Several economists and historians who studied the period said that it’s quite accurate. Expert opinions Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said Clinton was "astute" in distinguishing between putting the brakes on future expansion of free trade, as Trump and Clinton have both at times advocated, and actually reversing established trade agreements by imposing new tariffs, as only Trump has suggested. "Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression, but I think saying it made it longer and more painful is actually quite well put," Irwin said. Irwin said there was "no real reason" to impose such tariffs, and that it was mainly done for "domestic political reasons." In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly, over the spirited objections of many economists. After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports. "Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump," Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that "if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time." Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office. Roosevelt "came in on the traditional Democratic platform that tariffs should fall, and his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, was practically a one-issue man on the subject of freeing up trade," said Eric Rauchway, a historian at the University of California-Davis and author of The Money Makers: How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression, Defeated Fascism, and Secured a Prosperous Peace. "The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 started the U.S. down that road, giving the executive power to negotiate agreements on tariffs. Hull used this power to bring down trade barriers." As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan. This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression. "Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small," said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century. For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade. Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression -- he points instead to insufficiently effective New Deal policies under Roosevelt -- the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said. "It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism," said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. "However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression." Alonzo L. Hamby, an Ohio University historian and author of For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s, agreed. "I think Clinton has a strong case for the proposition that it hurt an economy that already had moved into a deep recession," Hamby said. Our ruling Clinton said, "A trade war is something very different (than curbing new trade agreements). We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful." Numerous experts we checked with said the Smoot-Hawley tariffs and the resulting trade war weren’t the only factor to worsen the Great Depression. However, they agreed that the trade war undeniably had a negative impact. Clinton took care not to overplay this argument in her speech, so we rate her statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/70e79ee2-c021-4885-9526-ce33d8442f16	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-06T17:54:47	2016-06-02	['None']
pomt-13343	Says "Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate . . . a status of forces agreement."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-clinton-failed-keep-troops-iraq/	The vice presidential debate quickly dissolved into Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine interrupting and talking over each other to score points against the top of the ticket candidates. In an exchange about security in Iraq, Pence said, "Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate, Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement." "No, that is incorrect," Kaine shot back. The argument centers on a period in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to keep troops in Iraq. Called a status of forces agreement, it would have kept up to 10,000 troops on the ground beyond Dec. 31, 2011. Obama was working against a deadline signed by President George W. Bush late in 2008. Under the Bush agreement, American troops would be gone by the end of 2011. As 2011 began, military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. Its number was 10,000. But the Iraqis balked as well, so that number shrank. The New York Times detailed how the force grew smaller until negotiations failed altogether. According to the New York Times, Obama himself ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, dropping the number to about 3,500 troops. But even that lower figure hit a brick wall. The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force. But no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence. "When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible," al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. "The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided, and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started." Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, told PolitiFact in 2015 that al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi Parliament would not. There has been plenty of debate since then on whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement. Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said an Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament. "They said that the Iraqi government was too weak and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave," Preble told us in 2015. On Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel. Important to this fact-check, the State Department has overall responsibility for leading the U.S. government’s negotiation of status of forces agreements. However, while the U.S. ambassador to Iraq was involved (ambassadors work for the State Department), the key decisions and negotiations with Iraq took place inside the White House. At times, Obama himself was on the phone with al-Maliki. Our ruling Pence said Clinton failed to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq. It is accurate to say that negotiations failed. However, the claim suffers from a number of flaws. It puts too much emphasis on Clinton’s role, when the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders. The Obama administration wanted to insulate American troops from legal action in Iraq. That was a political minefield in Iraq. While there is room for debate on whether American negotiators could have found a way around that problem, there is no reason to believe the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq. The claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out much key information that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0674d59-28b4-4206-af4a-35dc9368b0ed	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-10-04T22:35:46	2016-10-04	['Iraq', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-04977	Says "Obamacare" is "the largest middle-class tax increase in history."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/23/jeff-fitzgerald/obamacare-largest-ever-tax-middle-class-gop-us-sen/	On the day the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, Rush Limbaugh called the law "the largest tax increase in the history of the world." The conservative radio talk show host earned a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact National. The law isn’t even the largest tax increase in U.S. history, although it does rank among the top five -- as a percentage of gross domestic product -- dating back to 1968. Other critics of the law, including Wisconsin Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, also reacted on the day of the June 28, 2012, ruling. Fitzgerald, the Wisconsin Assembly speaker and a candidate for U.S. Senate in the August 2012 primary, fired away on the Twitter social networking site. He said the Supreme Court "has revealed what Obamacare really is, the largest middle-class tax increase in history!" Fitzgerald’ claim is narrower, focusing on the middle class. Is he more on the money? Fitzgerald’s evidence Fitzgerald campaign manager Steve Stanek made two arguments in defense of Fitzgerald’s claim. 1. The law’s tax is 40 percent for a typical family. Fitzgerald cited an opinion column on Forbes.com written by Merrill Matthews of the Institute for Policy Innovation, a think tank founded by former Republican U.S. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. The Texas organization says it values "individual liberty, limited government, and free markets." But one problem for Fitzgerald is that Matthews claims the reform law is the largest tax increase in history, not the largest on the middle class. He argues that not only is the law’s penalty for not having health insurance a tax, but also that the requirement itself is a tax. Matthews then uses this math: The median U.S. family income is about $50,000, according to a USA Today news article; the cost of family health coverage "can easily run $20,000 a year"; and thus the insurance cost is 40 percent of the typical family’s income. Fitzgerald argues that a 40 percent hike "is clearly the largest on the middle class in U.S. history," although he offers no evidence of how the figure compares to other tax hikes. Hmmm. The column Fitzgerald cites describes a family that pays a premium to a private company in exchange for health insurance. That, obviously, is not a tax paid to the government. Moreover, the 40 percent figure doesn't measure a tax increase but rather an insurance premium's portion of a family's income. 2. The law raises taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years. Fitzgerald argues the reform law will raise taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years, using multiplication on a figure in the PolitiFact item on Limbaugh’s claim as his source. And he claims about "75 percent of those taxes will fall on the middle class," citing a Wall Street Journal opinion article as his source. But both articles are misquoted. In rating Limbaugh’s statement, PolitiFact National cited two nonpartisan federal agencies in reporting that by 2019, the reform law is expected to raise an additional $438 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation; or $525 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s a lot less than the $1 trillion Fitzgerald is claiming. Moreover, Fitzgerald’s claim was about taxes on the middle class, but he is citing figures on overall taxes in the health reform law. As for the Wall Street Journal opinion writer saying up to 75 percent of the "tax" would be on the middle class, he was referring not to the total revenue the law will bring in, but the penalty that would be paid by individuals who do not follow the mandate to get health insurance. The penalty is expected to raise $4 billion per year from 2017 to 2019 -- again, that’s a long way from $1 trillion. We asked Stanek about the discrepancies. He acknowledged the campaign misread the PolitiFact and Wall Street Journal articles. In short, Fitzgerald does not produce a figure for how much the reform law is projected to cost the middle class in taxes. Other considerations To be clear, the health reform law does raise taxes, as our colleagues have noted -- although two of the biggest hit high-income people, not the middle class: • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes go up for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. For other newly imposed taxes in the law, it’s not clear how the burden will fall -- and even less clear on how it will affect the middle class. PolitiFact National found these taxes include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); an annual fee on health insurance providers begins ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years). Two more things: The Washington Post Fact Checker found, using Joint Tax Committee data, that middle-class folks (individuals earning under $200,000) are expected to pay $64.6 billion in tax hikes (including penalties for not having insurance) under the health reform law -- but that they are also expected to receive $343 billion in subsidies and credits. And the Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office told us they do not have any listing of the largest middle-class tax hikes in history. Our rating Fitzgerald said Obama’s federal health reform law is "the largest middle class tax increase in history," but the two ways he measures it are deeply flawed. In claiming the law increase taxes on the middle class by 40 percent, Fitzgerald cites figures related to insurance premiums, not taxes. And if even the law would raise taxes by $1 trillion as he erroneously claims, that’s a total figure, not how much taxes would go up for the middle class. For making an extraordinary claim and offering painfully thin evidence, we rate Fitzgerald’s statement Pants on Fire.	None	Jeff Fitzgerald	None	None	None	2012-07-23T09:00:00	2012-06-28	['None']
pomt-08790	On lifting the U.S. Cuban embargo and allowing travel to Cuba.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/jeff-greene/jeff-greene-rethinks-position-cuban-embargo-and-tr/	On Aug. 17, 2010, Jeff Greene, vying for the Democratic bid for U.S. Senate, sat down for some cafecito and conversation at Miami’s famed Versailles restaurant -- a political rite of passage for any candidate hoping to score some votes with Miami’s Cuban exile community. Greene, who is running against U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek in the Aug. 24 primary, was met by some heckling from several of the restaurant patrons. "You say now that you favor the lifting of the embargo on Cuba and you want to come here and have Cuban coffee and get the Cuban vote? I don’t think so," a customer at the restaurant told Greene, according to the Associated Press. Greene might have fallen out of the good graces of some Cuban-Americans when recently voicing his willingness to open travel and trade back up to Cuba, but it’s a position that Greene himself has admitted to changing over the course of his campaign. "I have thought about this a lot, you know, the past few weeks and I’m really beginning to rethink my own opinion on that," he said during a televised debate against Meek on Miami’s ABC affiliate TV station WPLG-10 "I’m thinking now we have to take a close look at opening travel to Cuba, and the trade embargo." We decided to put Greene up against our Flip-O-Meter to determine if he had flip-flopped his positions regarding the U.S embargo against Cuba and travel restrictions to the island. PolitiFact Florida already ruled that Greene flopped on the issue of Cuba before. Namely, he gave varying accounts of a 2007 trip to Cuba. At first Greene denied traveling to the communist island, later he recanted and said he was there on a humanitarian trip with a Jewish group, and finally his campaign spokesperson said Greene’s yacht had docked at the Hemingway Marina due to mechanical issues with the vessel. To determine just how much Greene has reconsidered his position on Cuba, we decided to look at statements he has made on relations with the island compared to his most recent epiphany on the WPLG debate. June 15, 2010 -- In a Miami Herald story Greene says he supports President Barack Obama’s policy on allowing Cuban-Americans to freely travel to visit their families on the island. Aug. 1, 2010 -- During a televised debate with Tampa’s Bay News 9, Greene said he firmly supported the U.S. embargo of Cuba. Aug. 15, 2010 -- During a debate against Meek, Greene says he’s beginning to "rethink" his opinion, calling the embargo "a 50-year plan that’s failed." He added: "I’m not saying let’s open the doors tomorrow, but I’m saying when I get to the Senate I want to take a close look at considering making a revision to this, what is absolutely a failed policy." Aug. 17, 2010 -- Over Cuban coffee at the Versailles Restaurant in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, Greene defends his new-found position to several of the disgruntled Cuban exiles on hand. He states: "It’s a 50-year program that hasn’t worked." Aug. 19, 2010 -- In an interview with Rob Lorei on the talk show Radioactivity on WMNF-FM 88.5, Greene acknowledged his change of position, and elaborated on his view. "It's almost a 50-year embargo. The purpose was to do what, to get rid of the Castros, to free the Cuban people from communism so that they could have a democracy and have their rights restored. None of that has happened,'' he said. The embargo has impoverished Cuban citizens, left Fidel Castro in control, and the country is drawing tourists from Europe and Canada, he said. Without the embargo, German visitors might combine a trip to Havana with a stop in Orlando. There might be more trade, helping the Florida economy. When pressed, Greene said he's not ready to completely ditch the embargo. "I say I want to look at it,'' he said. Maybe lift a few restrictions, or go further. "The craziest thing is the Cubans have all the American products, they just get them through Canada,'' he said. "So the whole thing is, it's just accomplishing nothing.'' For his part, Meek says he supports the embargo. The congressman shares a close working relationship with Ileana-Ros Lehtinen, and Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, all Cuban-American Republicans from the South Florida congressional delegation. Republican Senate hopeful Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles, strongly supports the embargo and favors limiting travel to the island. Independent candidate Gov. Charlie Crist has said he supports the embargo, but is in favor of easing travel restrictions. Whether on the Senate floor or in cable television, Florida’s Congressional delegation is often asked to chime in on Cuba-related issues -- considering the state has the largest Cuban-American population in the U.S. (nearly 1.1 million according to Census figures). The issue of travel -- which older exiles staunchly oppose, but more recent arrivals approve, according to polls -- is brewing again as the Obama administration considers easing travel restrictions to the island. The administration may announce as early as this week plans to expand opportunities for American students, educators and researchers to visit the island. So back to the question at hand. Did Greene reverse course on his position regarding the embargo and travel to Cuba? From stating his firm support for the embargo during an Aug. 1 debate to calling the embargo a failure just 16 days later, we rule that Greene completed a Full Flop on his stance on U.S./Cuba policy issues.

pomt-09840	If you don't count illegal aliens, people who qualify for other insurance, and people who make more than $75,000 a year, "it leaves about 15 million people" who are uninsured.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/21/orrin-hatch/who-are-uninsured-hatchs-take/	During a recent interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News, Sen. Orrin Hatch made the argument that the American health care system works well for most people. "You know, why would we throw out a system that 85 percent of Americans have and basically approve of and exchange it for 47 million people?" asked Hatch, a Republican from Utah, referring to a frequently cited estimate of the number of uninsured in the United States. "By the way, of that 47 million people, when you deduct the ones who could have insurance through their employers but don't, you deduct the 11 million that basically qualify for CHIP or Medicaid but don't realize it (and) are not enrolled, you deduct those who are over $75,000 a year in income but just won't purchase their own health insurance, and then 6 million people who are illegal aliens, my gosh, when you put that all together, it leaves about 15 million people. So we're going to throw out a system that works for 15 million people." We were interested in analyzing Hatch's numbers for accuracy. When you subtract out all those groups, do you end up with only 15 million people? The basis for Hatch's statement is a chart created by the Republican Policy Committee, his staff told us. Hatch handles things a little differently from the chart: He adds 1 million to the number who qualify for Medicaid and SCHIP, and he doesn't mention legal immigrants, the way the chart does. But the numbers as he uses them add up. But let's take a closer look at the chart to see how it arrived at its conclusion. We asked the Republican Policy Committee for its supporting materials, and a lot of it is based on data from the U.S. Census, which conducts annual, large-scale surveys on income, poverty and health insurance coverage. Other data is based on research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source for nonpartisan information on health care policy. But the way the data is used raises questions. The biggest problem is that there's almost certainly some overlap between the different groups. How much overlap? Unfortunately, there's no way to tell. For clarity's sake, we're going review the different data points. The Republican analysis uses data from 2006, which is a year earlier than the most recent data. That year, the census found that 47 million were uninsured and that 10.2 million of them were noncitizens. Estimates from reputable sources indicate that roughly 6 million of those are illegal immigrants. So far, so good. (We examined Census data on the uninsured and estimates for illegal immigrants in a previous item, if you'd like to read a more in-depth analysis of this point.) The next number on the chart is households that earn more than $75,000 a year. Keep in mind this number represents household income, so it counts people who live in roomate situations, too, for example. But the number is right: The census does show that 9.3 million uninsured people live in households with income more than $75,000 a year. The next two categories come from outside the census, from research published by the Kaiser Foundation. The chart says that 10 million people are eligible for a government program like Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Fund, known as SCHIP or just CHIP. And it says 6 million people could get insurance through their employers but choose not to. The numbers are roughly correct, but these analyses were based on 2004 data, not the 2006 data. If you subtract each group separately from the total of 47 million, you get to 12 million. The chart seems to account for that, by saying it's 12 to 15 million who are insured. But there's no way to know if 3 million is a proper way to account for people who fall into multiple categories. Take for example a legal immigrant who comes to the United States to work at a high-paying job. News reports have mentioned that many of these immigrants are young people who come to work in the technology sector or the financial industry. A person like that who chose not to buy insurance through an employer would be subtracted three times here: Once as a legal immigrant, once as someone making more than $75,000 and once as someone who declined to get employer insurance. As another example, generally speaking, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal benefit programs. But there are exceptions. Some state governments have chosen to cover illegal immigrants, especially children, through programs affiliated with Medicaid and CHIP. So there may be duplication between the category of illegal immigrants and people eligible for Medicaid and/or CHIP. How many people? We don't know, and we couldn't find any analysis that could answer that question. The $75,000 number also poses questions. Remember, this is the total income for an entire household. We can envision scenarios where that number represents people living in the same household but each making a lower income, and they may not be able to afford insurance individually. But again it's hard to know. So we find that the individual numbers that Hatch uses are accurate or in the ballpark. Our concerns are with the methodology used to come up with his bottom line. It relies on a hodgepodge of different years and sources and leaves open the possibility that some people are double- or triple-counted. It would not pass muster in an undergraduate statistics class. So we find his statement is Half True.	None	Orrin Hatch	None	None	None	2009-08-21T17:10:51	2009-08-20	['None']

pomt-15152	"Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/30/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-saudi-arabia-has-third-largest-mili/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has so far centered his campaign around domestic issues such as income inequality, campaign finance reform and college affordability. In a Sunday interview on ABC’s This Week, however, host Martha Raddatz took the opportunity to ask the Vermont senator about an issue that isn’t even included on his campaign website -- foreign policy. Raddatz asked Sanders to explain his vote against the 1991 Gulf war and his opposition to increased military action in Syria and Iraq, compared to his support for military action in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2011. Sanders said he thought the United States could have forced Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait without invading, and that military action should be "the last resort, not the first resort." "The United States cannot do it alone," Sanders added. "In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world. They're going to have to get in and take on ISIS as well as other countries in that region. The United States should be supportive. We should be working with other countries. But the United States cannot always be the only country involved in these wars." We wondered about Sanders’ claim that Saudi Arabia, with a population roughly the size of Texas, has the "third-largest military budget in the entire world." Sanders’ campaign pointed us to the latest statistics from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), widely cited as an authoritative source for international security statistics. We looked at IISS figures for a separate defense-related fact-check last year. According to estimates from the IISS, Saudi Arabia did have the world’s third-largest military budget in 2014, at around $80.8 billion. Its budget was smaller than only those of China and the United States. Another reputable group, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), catalogues the security expenditures of 171 countries every year. On that list, Saudi Arabia ranked fourth in 2014, behind the United States, China and Russia. Why the difference? SIPRI estimates that Russia spent around $84 billion on defense in 2014, almost $14 billion more than the IISS estimates it budgeted. The dataset’s footnotes, however, make clear that Saudi Arabia likely spent much more than $80 billion on military-related activities in 2014. SIPRI says its numbers "may not include billions of dollars of military aid for Lebanon and Egypt that was announced in 2013 and 2014." Saudi Arabia hasn’t always spent this much on its military. Its defense budget has grown fourfold in the last 10 years, from around $20 billion in 2004 to $80 billion in 2014, an increase that reflects the intensification of the Saudis’ military involvement in the rest of the Middle East. For the record, SIPRI’s best estimates for military expenditures in North Korea and Iran are significantly below the budget of Saudi Arabia’s defense. Our ruling Sanders said, "Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world." While there are a few different ways to calculate this statistic, both studies we looked at placed the size of Saudi Arabia’s military budget at or near No. 3 in the world.

pomt-01446	"Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. (State Rep. Marilinda) Garcia opposes it."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/03/americans-responsible-solutions/gabby-giffords-group-says-people-nh-want-raise-min/	A gun reform group founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, has turned its focus to New Hampshire, running a TV ad that criticizes Republican congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia not only on gun ownership, which is the group’s main focus, but also on the minimum wage and equal pay for women. In a 30-second spot titled "Strange Ideas," Giffords’ group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, asserts that Garcia holds views different from a majority of New Hampshire residents. "Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas. Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it. Most people support guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work. Garcia’s against that, too. Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this item, we’ll check Garcia’s stance on a minimum wage increase. Garcia, a state representative, is challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, a Democrat, for the 2nd Congressional District seat. The Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC unveiled the advertisement in September, just as it stopped airing a controversial TV ad that accused a congressional candidate in Arizona of opposing legislation that aims to prevent convicted stalkers from buying guns. On-screen, the New Hampshire ad cites a WMUR-TV poll from February that found three-quarters of New Hampshire residents supported raising the state minimum wage to $9 an hour. That provides support for the ad’s claim, though it’s worth noting that a federal proposal supported by President Barack Obama and other Democrats would push it higher, to $10.10 an hour. At the time the poll was conducted, the New Hampshire Legislature was considering a bill (HB1403) to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25 in 2015, and then to $9 in 2016. The poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, found that 59 percent of residents strongly supported the increase and another 17 percent somewhat supported it. Eight percent strongly opposed it and 5 percent somewhat opposed it. Another 11 percent were neutral or don't know enough to say, according to WMUR. New Hampshire is the only state among its neighbors without a higher wage than the federal floor of $7.25, and it has the lowest minimum wage of any New England state. The minimum wage is $8.73 an hour in Vermont, $8 in Massachusetts and $7.50 in Maine. All told, it is one of 18 states have the same minimum wage as the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. About a month after the poll, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted to increase the state’s minimum wage by a vote of 173-118. Legislators voted mostly along party lines, with five Democrats voting against it and four Republicans voting for it. We checked the roll call to see how Garcia voted, but on three successive votes on March 12, 2014, related to the minimum wage bill, Garcia did not cast a vote. Later, in May, the Republican-controlled State Senate killed the bill, with all 13 Republicans voting against it and 11 Democrats voting in favor of it, a process in which Garcia played no official role. An earlier legislative battle over the minimum wage in New Hampshire also sheds light on Garcia’s record. In 2011, the New Hampshire legislature, with a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, passed a bill that deleted the state’s minimum wage, meaning that the state’s lowest wage would be the federal minimum. At the time, New Hampshire’s minimum wage was $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal amount, but critics said the bill was intended to keep the state’s minimum wage as low as possible. In the House, Garcia was one of 236 legislators to vote in favor of that bill, HB133. After passing the state Senate, Gov. John Lynch vetoed the measure. Both the House and Senate overrode Lynch’s veto, and Garcia was one of 261 members of the House to vote in favor of overriding the governor. So, while Garcia has no voting record on the 2014 minimum wage increase in New Hampshire, she did take a clear stand on the 2011 law tying the state’s minimum wage to the federal one. As further evidence of Garcia’s opposition to increasing the minimum wage, the ad cites an article from The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, which reported that Garcia opposes a minimum wage hike. That article, published June 9, introduced Garcia -- then considered an underdog in the Republican primary against state Sen. Gary Lambert -- to a national audience. The article reviews her record as a state legislator and points to how some GOP establishment figures had feared Garcia would be viewed as too conservative in a general election race. The article quotes Garcia saying in a March interview that while increasing the minimum wage superficially seemed like "a good idea," it wouldn’t "actually help anybody much more" and could in fact hurt. "It actually has negative outcomes in many areas. One would be, if we’re trying to encourage people to educate themselves further so they don’t have to stay in a minimum-wage job anymore, raising [the minimum wage] lowers the incentive to do that," she said. Garcia’s stance hasn’t changed since then. In an email message to PolitiFact New Hampshire, Kenny Cunningham, the Garcia campaign’s political and communications director, reinforced the position. "A one-size-fits-all minimum wage from Washington, D.C., is counter-productive. Economists agree it would increase unemployment, particularly amongst teenagers," Cunningham said. "Instead, Marilinda wants to reduce America’s highest-in-the-world corporate tax rates and rein in job-killing regulations." Our ruling An ad from the liberal Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC says most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage, but Marilinda Garcia opposes it. Polls from when the New Hampshire Legislature was considering raising the state’s minimum wage showed that a majority of residents surveyed supported increasing the wage from the federal minimum of $7.25 to $8.25 and eventually to $9 an hour. And Garcia has gone on the record criticizing attempts to raise the minimum wage, saying it’s effects could be "counter-productive" and could lead to "negative outcomes." She also cast several votes in 2011 that effectively kept the state minimum wage the lowest in the region. The claim needs a slight clarification. As backup for the assertion that "most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage," the poll cited a poll that asked residents about a $9 minimum wage. It’s not clear whether residents would support a hike to the higher level of $10.10, as the president and congressional Democrats are seeking. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-09873	"The Congressional Budget Office most recently came out and analyzed the current (health care) plan and said that it was not only deficit-neutral, but also that over 10 years it would create a $6 billion surplus."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/03/russ-carnahan/carnahan-misquotes-cbo-about-cost-health-care-refo/	During a town hall meeting, U.S. Rep. Russ Carnahan, a Democrat from Missouri, tried to reassure constituents that his party's health care reform bill would cost less than expected. "The Congressional Budget Office most recently came out and analyzed the current plan and said that it was not only deficit-neutral, which has been one of the important factors for the president and congressional leaders, but also that over 10 years it would create a $6 billion surplus," Carnahan told an audience on July 20, 2009, at Forest Park Community College in St. Louis. The audience laughed in response. (To see for yourself, fast forward this video to the 7-minute mark.) It's a claim that's been repeated by many Democrats since the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number crunching for Congress, released its cost estimate for the health care bill on July 17. In its report, the CBO estimated the bill will cost about $1.04 trillion over 10 years. That sum would be partially offset by $219.3 billion in Medicare savings and by $583 billion in tax increases over the same amount of time. Still, the bill would create a $239 billion deficit, according to CBO. We were perplexed: How could Carnahan proclaim a $6 billion surplus if the budget office was projecting a deficit? The confusion comes down to an accounting question about how to treat $245 billion in the House bill that would cover the cost of adjusting Medicare reimbursement rates so doctors don't face the potential of a 21 percent cut in fees. In 1997, Congress agreed that, should Medicare reimbursement rates grow faster than the economy, they would be cut. But instead of following its own rules, Congress has put off those cuts year after year with a Medicare "fix." CBO considers that sum as part of the cost of the bill. But many Democrats don't. Two days after Carnahan's town hall meeting, the House approved a bill that would require all new spending be paid for by new taxes or spending cuts to other government programs, a practice widely known as pay-as-you-go. That bill exempts the Medicare pay fix from these rules, which effectively reduces the cost of the health care reform bill by that same $245 billion. The pay-as-you-go bill is pending in the Senate. But in the meantime, CBO will continue to include it as part of the legislation's price tag until the pay-as-you-go rules are put into law. Back to Carnahan's math: If you accept his assumption that pay-as-you-go ultimately passes both houses of Congress and is signed into law, the health care bill will only cost $797 billion over 10 years. The $219.3 in spending cuts and the $583 billion in tax revenue total $802 billion, so that leaves $5.3 billion extra. (That's not quite $6 billion, but it's in the ballpark. We can assume this is the result of rounding.) Whether Republicans or Democrats are in charge, this kind of budget trickery is nothing new to Washington, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "It's the best way to do business in Washington," he said. "You inflate the baseline [of a bill] to make it seem like you're spending less." So as for Carnahan's statement, he is definitely misstating CBO's findings. The budget office did not say there would be a $6 billion surplus, it said there would be a $239 billion deficit. Only when Carnahan added some optimistic assumptions did the math work the way he claimed. We find his claim False.	None	Russ Carnahan	None	None	None	2009-08-03T15:15:51	2009-07-20	['None']

pomt-01905	"He’s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who (U.S. Sen.) Ron Johnson is."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/02/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-sen-ron-johnson-largely-unknown-democrat/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was out and about in June 2014. The Wisconsin Republican appeared on CNBC, on CNN and on a nationally syndicated radio talk show. He was quoted in the Huffington Post and in a Wall Street Journal blog, and featured in articles on national political websites such as Real Clear Politics and Salon. His name appeared in 10 articles and letters to the editor in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So, Johnson, a political newcomer when he was elected in November 2010, is pretty high-profile, right? Not according to the Wisconsin Democratic Party. On June 12, 2014, the party posted this on its Facebook page: "He’s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is." Total exaggeration? Not totally. Marquette poll The party cited as evidence a Marquette Law School Poll of registered voters in Wisconsin from March 2014, the most recent one to include such a question about Johnson. We took a look at the script used by the poll takers. The seventh question was preceded by this statement: "I’m going to read you a list of people and organizations. Please tell me if you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each of them or if you haven't heard enough about (him/her) yet to have an opinion. The first name is Barack Obama." The interviewer continued with the same question about several Wisconsin politicians, including Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). The interviewer would record the answer as Favorable, Unfavorable, Haven’t Heard Enough, Don’t Know or Refused. The figures for Johnson, as summarized in the results section of the poll data: Favorable 29 percent Unfavorable 27 percent Not Heard Enough 40 percent Don’t Know 4 percent Refused 0 So, 40 percent said they didn’t know Johnson well enough to have an opinion of him. (The 4 percent represented people who responded by saying don’t know, rather than saying they didn’t know enough to have an opinion.) In comparison, 27 percent of those polled said they had not heard enough about Baldwin to have an opinion of her and another 3percent said they didn’t know if they had an opinion. Baldwin was elected to the Senate two years after Johnson, but previously served 14 years in Congress and has gained national attention for being the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. It’s worth nothing that another Wisconsin poll also showed a relatively high percentage of residents weren’t sure how they felt about Johnson. But it also did not ask respondents if they knew who Johnson is; rather, the question was about job approval. In the latest poll by the St. Norbert College Strategic Research Institute, done in late March and early April of 2014, the interviewer said: "Now I’d like to ask you about some major political figures and your opinion on how well they are doing their job. For each of the following, please tell me whether you strongly approve, approve, disapprove, or strongly disapprove with the way the person is doing their job." On Johnson, 31 percent of the respondents said they weren’t sure, compared to 21 percent for Baldwin. Perspective For his part, Marquette poll director Charles Franklin told us there’s no way to know from his poll what percentage of the respondents "don’t know who Johnson is." That question was not asked. At the same time, Franklin said, the favorable/unfavorable question used by the Marquette poll is good as a general measure of the public’s awareness of, or familiarity with, a person. And the Democratic Party’s claim about Johnson, he said, "has a little bit of hyperbole, but it’s not a wildly misleading reading" of the results. We checked with three other experts: David Wegge of the St. Norbert institute, which is based at St. Norbert University near Green Bay; and John Stevenson and Chad Kniss of the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which does surveys for the UW community and other organizations and formerly did political polling for the Badger Poll. They agreed the Democratic Party's claim is not totally accurate, but not way off, either. If you’re surprised that 40 percent of the respondents didn’t feel they had heard enough about a nearly four-year U.S. senator to have an opinion of him, Wegge noted that St. Norbert’s Wisconsin surveys, which date back to 1984, show U.S. senators have less name recognition than governors. Senators are generally in the state less, get less Wisconsin media coverage and, of course, deal more with national than state issues, he said. Indeed, even near the end of Democrat Herb Kohl’s 24 years in the U.S. Senate, many Wisconsinites said they didn’t know enough about him to have an opinion, according to an April 2011 St. Norbert poll. Marquette’s Franklin added: "A lot of people are not so intensely engaged in politics that they follow these names day in and day out and form strong opinions about them outside of a campaign." That was borne out in two polls taken in the weeks before Johnson was elected -- the vast majority of registered voters said they had an opinion when asked by Marist College if they had a favorable or unfavorable impression of Johnson. In late September 2010, only 19 percent said they were unsure of their opinion of Johnson or hadn’t heard of him; by late October 2010, the figure was 18 percent. It doesn't stand to reason that nearly four years after Johnson's election, 40 percent of Wisconsinites don't even know who he is. Our rating The state Democratic Party said: "He’s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is." In the most recent statewide poll that asked about Johnson, 40 percent of registered voters said they didn’t know him well enough to have an opinion about him and another 4 percent said they didn’t know if they had an opinion of him. But that falls short of evidence that 40 percent don't even know who he is. We rate the claim Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.

pomt-07189	"Kasich’s budget increases state spending from $50.5 billion to $55.6 billion. This is the second largest, two-year spending increase in Ohio history."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/09/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-kasichs-budget-plan-c/	The irony behind Gov. John Kasich’s $55.6 billion two-year budget proposal is that a Republican leader who subscribes to the politics of limiting government spending is actually proposing to tap the state’s checkbook for a lot more cash than his Democratic predecessor ever did. That’s a fact not lost on state Rep. Armond Budish, a Beachwood Democrat, who grabbed a pen and paper last month to rail against The Columbus Dispatch’s endorsement of the governor’s proposal. "Despite the dramatic cuts targeted at schools and local communities, Kasich’s budget increases state spending from $50.5 billion to $55.6 billion," Budish wrote in a letter the newspaper published May 14. "This is the second largest, two-year spending increase in Ohio history." It is true that the governor’s budget makes deep cuts to public education and local governments, especially in larger urban areas. And it is true that the current state operating budget which covers fiscal years 2010 and 2011 passed under former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and expires on June 30, made just $50.5 billion in appropriations. It marked the first time in more than four decades that an Ohio biennial budget actually spent less than the previous budget. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Budish’s numbers. Ohio’s general revenue funds budget is part of a larger state fiscal document called an all funds budget. The general revenue fund is where state taxpayer money goes. It includes income, sales and other state taxes. The all funds budget, which is about double the general revenue fund, also includes money raised through various state licenses and fees and federal draw down funds for federally mandated spending and other items that lawmakers have little control over. Budish’s numbers refer to the general revenue fund. In another letter to The Dispatch, one written in response to Budish’s, state Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the GRF accounts for less than half of total state spending. Susan Ackerman, senior budget and fiscal analyst for the Center for Community Solutions, said that Amstutz is correct, but that Budish’s message is in better context. When thinking of the budget, the figure to focus on is the general revenue fund number, not the all funds figure, she said. "I think the budget to really watch is the GRF budget. The GRF budget is funded by Ohio’s tax revenues and it is the budget that lawmakers have the most discretion over, therefor it gives you the most accurate picture of what the state’s priorities are," Ackerman said. "The all funds budget is an important number, too," she said. "But the problem in Ohio is there is a lot of double counting in our all funds budget." For example, state tax refunds are counted as expenditures in the all funds budget even though the state is essentially just giving back money that taxpayers overpaid, Ackerman said. And sales of state goods from one state entity to another is considered an appropriation under the all funds figure even though the money never technically left the state’s coffers. "GRF is really where your tax dollars go," she said. But is the spending level proposed by the governor is the second highest increase in the state’s history. We started by asking where the House minority leader got his facts. Budish’s staff pointed us to a general revenue fund chart maintained on the Ohio Office of Budget and Management web site that lists the state’s operating budgets back to 1968. That’s just 43 years; not exactly inclusive of all Ohio history but enough information to test Budish’s point. Kasich’s proposal represents a $5.1 billion spending increase for a state still limping back from a crippling economic recession and deficit somewhere between $4 billion and $8 billion. The largest spending increase since 1968 came under Republican Gov. Bob Taft. The 2000-01 budget, which spent $40.4 billion, was $5.3 billion greater than the previous budget. We’re talking actual numbers here, not percentage gains or losses. Since information prior to 1968 is difficult, at best, to completely recapture, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to add some perspective for the numbers that are available. The 1968-69 budget spent just $2.4 billion, so it appears safe to assume that never in Ohio’s history prior had the state witnessed a spending increase greater than $5.1 billion from one budget to the next. From that perspective, Budish’s statement seems logical. Lawmakers and the public have traditionally focused on the general revenue fund because it is the figure that lawmakers have direct say so over how to spend. Knowing that the GRF represents part of all state spending, and that the all funds budget is much larger, is an additional point that provides clarification. And while Budish couldn’t provide documentation for his "Ohio history" reference, it is clear that Ohio has never passed a general revenue fund budget prior to 1968 that is anywhere in the stratosphere of what lawmakers are presently debating in the Statehouse. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Budish’s comment Mostly True.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2011-06-09T06:00:00	2011-05-14	['Ohio', 'John_Kasich']

pomt-11171	"El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año" / "The price of gas has increased 25% this year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/23/senate-democrats/have-gas-prices-soared-25-year/	Cable news is focused on the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump, but there’s an issue of intense interest to many Americans that has gotten relatively little media play recently — a rise in prices at the pump. On May 23, Senate Democrats tried to change the media narrative by holding a news event at a gas station near Capitol Hill. The Senate Democrats’ collective Twitter account documented the event. The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump. The Spanish-language text says: "El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump." In English, that translates as: "The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump." (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweet’s uploaded video clip, didn’t use those exact words and didn’t cite a percentage increase.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they haven’t risen by that much. We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse. We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. That’s an increase of 15.9 percent — a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said. When we looked at crude oil prices, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. That’s an increase of 19.7 percent. Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said. "All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies," Fielden told the website. Trump’s suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices "is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black." After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweet’s caption stuck closely to Menendez’ wording in the video, saying, "El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente." (That translates as, "The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president's policies.") The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a "math error" and has since corrected the report it came from. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling The original version of the tweet said, "El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año," which translates as, "The price of gas has increased 25% this year." Gas prices have risen, but not by that much — 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-12805	Of 1 million green cards issued a year, "almost none of those green cards are based on job skills or demonstrated economic needs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/14/tom-cotton/arkansas-senator-says-1-million-green-cards-issue-/	Republican Sen. Tom Cotton favors a new legal immigration system that’s less focused on extended family reunification and more aligned with bringing in skilled workers. Cotton, of Arkansas, contended on Fox News that of 1 million green cards issued annually, very few are employment-based. "Right now we have a legal immigration system that is not working for American workers. Blue-collar workers, people who work with their hands, on their feet, have seen their wages stagnate for decades," Cotton said Feb. 7 on Fox News. "At the same time, we’ve seen record levels of immigration in recent decades. A million green cards a year, the population of Montana added to this country every year, population of Arkansas added every year, almost none of those green cards are based on job skills or demonstrated economic need. So, of course they compete for blue-collar jobs and put downward pressure on working-class wages." There’s a lot of debate about the role immigrants play in the workforce and how they impact wages. For this fact-check, we were curious about Cotton’s claim that almost none of the 1 million green cards issued each year are based on skills or economic need. Data from the Department of Homeland Security supports his claim. Cotton filed a bill Feb. 13 to reduce the number of family-sponsored immigrants, to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program, and to limit the president’s discretion for setting the number of refugees admitted each year, among other things. Cotton’s bill parallels one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises to reform and limit legal immigration. 1 million green cards The Immigration and Naturalization Act allows for 675,000 legal immigrant admissions a year, but that number is flexible, and certain categories for legal permanent resident are exceeded, says a 2014 Congressional Research Service report. Admission preferences, according to the report, include: family-sponsored immigrants (about 480,000); employment-based preference immigrants (about 140,000); and diversity visa lottery immigrants (55,000). Refugees and asylum seekers who are adjusting their status are excluded from limit counts, the report said. As Cotton said, the United States issues about 1 million green cards a year, allowing recipients to permanently live and work in the United States. The majority of people who become legal permanent residents annually already live in the country and receive their green card as a result of an adjustment of status. The rest are new arrivals. The majority of green cards, about two-thirds, are given to individuals who have a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident in the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, in a 2013 post said the employment rate for family-based immigrants is 54 percent, excluding parents and minor children of U.S. citizens who are less likely to be of working age. Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton’s communications director, told us that when speaking about legal immigration reform, Cotton typically says only 1 out of every 15 immigrants come to the United States on a skills or employment-based visa and that his statement of "almost none" on Fox News was a modified turn of phrase. "Only 1 out of every 15 immigrant is coming here for employment reasons. If we really needed all of these people because of their skills, because they help the economy grow, they’d be coming here on say an EB1 or EB2 visa, but they are not," Cotton said in a press conference Feb. 7, the same day of his Fox News interview, as he presented his new legislation. Rabbitt presented us with a table noting the total number of green cards issued a year and the number and percentage of those that were skills-based (from 2001 to 2015). The calculations exclude green cards given to accompanying spouses and minor children. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Nowrasteh, from the Cato Institute, told us it’s fair to exclude spouses and children in this tabulation, "after all, they aren’t the ones who are supposed to work and they could have any level of skill, although the spouses are usually highly skilled." On average, 6.73 percent of green cards issued went to someone who came to the United States because of their skills, based on Cotton’s calculation using DHS data. That’s on par with a similar 2013 claim from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who then said 6.5 percent of immigrants come here based on labor and skill. Rubio’s statement was based on a 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution. The report was the best approximation of conflicting numbers, the brief’s author, Darrell West, told us then. (More on how he derived at 6.5 percent here.) West, who is vice president and director of Governance Studies and director of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact that individuals coming in through family connections also work, pay taxes and contribute to the overall economy. "Focusing just on those who enter through employment-based preferences ignores the economic contributions of other visa categories," West said, adding that many immigrants work in areas where there are employee shortages. The employment-based preference includes people adjusting their status and new arrivals and who fall under five categories, such as individuals with extraordinary abilities, professionals with advanced degrees and religious workers. "Needed unskilled workers" also falls within the employment-based preference for green cards. Our ruling Cotton said that of 1 million green cards issued a year, "almost none of those green cards are based on job skills or demonstrated economic needs." Cotton’s team told us the senator usually says one out of 15 green card recipients (about 6.7 percent) come to the United States for employment reasons. That estimate checks out with data from the Department of Homeland Security. But experts say focusing just on the employment category overlooks individuals who are also contributing to the economy, though they may have come under a different visa category. Cotton’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88f5a5e6-b694-467c-8622-2fbd5a67a4f4	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2017-02-14T15:28:55	2017-02-07	['None']
pomt-03892	"There's no plan from Senate Democrats or the White House to replace the sequester."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/04/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-obama-democrats-ha/	With no last-minute deal to avoid sequestration, the sweeping federal spending cuts have begun to take effect, and politicians have taken to the airwaves to explain where they stand. House Speaker John Boehner appeared on Meet the Press on March 3, 2013, and told host David Gregory he and his fellow Republicans have done all they can to break the stalemate over deficit reduction. It’s now up to President Barack Obama and the Democrats, Boehner said. "We've known about this for 16 months. And yet even today, there's no plan from Senate Democrats or the White House to replace the sequester," he said. "And over the last 10 months, House Republicans have acted twice to replace the sequester." No plan? That didn’t sound quite right. The White House plan It didn't take us long to find the White House plan. We found it on the White House home page by clicking the prominent button that says "SEE THE PLAN." It leads to a page titled "A Balanced Plan to Avert the Sequester and Reduce the Deficit." The plan cites deficit reduction of the past two years, which has included a $600 billion tax hike on wealthy households and $1.4 trillion in discretionary spending cuts. Going forward, Obama proposes $200 billion in reduced defense spending, new efficiencies in health care that would save another $400 billion, eliminating some agriculture subsidies and reforming the postal service, among other proposals. On the revenue side, the plan calls for closing tax loopholes and limiting deductions to 28 percent for the wealthiest Americans. The White House says the new deficit reductions total $1.3 trillion on top of what’s already been enacted. Senate Democrats’ plan On Feb. 26, Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski introduced the American Family Economic Protection Act of 2013, which would cancel the $85.3 billion sequester and replace it over several years with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The bill proposes to cut $27.5 billion from the defense budget and another $27.5 billion from agriculture funding. It would raise $55 billion in new revenue by implementing the "Buffett Rule" (which sets a minimum 30 percent tax rate on income above $1 million) and ending tax deductions for oil companies. On Feb. 28, the Senate voted on a motion to cut off debate, which would have brought the bill up for a full vote, but the motion failed 51-49 on a largely partisan vote (60 votes were needed to end debate). The explanation With both of those "plans" easily found in official records and news reports, we asked Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck how the speaker could claim that none exists. "A plan must demonstrate it has the ability to pass a chamber of Congress to be worth anything. We’ve twice passed a plan. We’re still waiting for the Senate to pass something, anything," Buck told PolitiFact in an email. He’s right that sequester replacement plans have twice passed the House, most recently in December 2012 by the previous Congress. The House plan would replace the defense cuts under sequestration, and find savings in other programs, including food stamps, a public health fund that’s part of Obamacare and other savings totalling $1.4 trillion. It includes no new revenue, which is the primary point of disagreement with Obama and Democrats. But we find his definition of the word "plan" to be ridiculously narrow. Congress often considers "plans" that don't pass either chamber. For example, Boehner was unable to muster the votes to pass his "Plan B" for the fiscal cliff, which Buck himself referred to as "a back-up plan to ensure taxes don't rise on American families." Our ruling Boehner said that the White House and Democrats in the Senate have no plan to replace the sequester. He’s wrong on both counts. Obama has a proposal for replacing sequestration cuts with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. And Senate Democrats have filed a sequester-replacement bill taking a similar approach.

pomt-10112	Barack Obama was "a trial attorney for ACORN."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/john-mccain/he-represented-them-in-one-case-/	John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee have launched efforts to connect Barack Obama and the community organizing group ACORN. ACORN was founded in 1970; its acronym stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ACORN's agenda includes left-leaning causes such as voter registration drives for low-income groups, initiatives to increase the minimum wage and programs offering help to victims of predatory lending. By all indications, ACORN operates within the American political mainstream, though clearly it favors the left side of the ideological spectrum. Its voter registration efforts tend to focus on the low-income, minorities and youth, all traditional Democratic constituencies. Obama received an endorsement from the group's political action committee in February 2008 when the Democratic primaries were in full swing. But that's not to say Republicans never support ACORN's efforts: McCain himself appeared at a 2006 rally in favor of immigration reform, sponsored in part by ACORN. The primary allegation against ACORN is that its voter registration drives result in many phony registrations. ACORN itself admits that some of its workers, in their attempts to meet registration goals, have turned in registration forms for people who do not exist or don't live in the geographic area. (Notorious examples include Mickey Mouse and the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys.) ACORN says the problems are isolated, and that it works with officials to correct them. They claim to have registered 1.3-million people to vote, so a small number of irregularities are to be expected. (For more on ACORN and the controversy surrounding its voter registration drives, read the St. Petersburg Times story here .) Several states are investigating the group's voter registration efforts. The McCain campaign issued numerous charges about Obama's connection to ACORN in an Oct. 10, 2008, memo. For other charges, read our full story. Here, we'll look at the allegation that Obama was "a trial attorney for ACORN." Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoir Dreams from my Father , and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work. Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN along with other plaintiffs in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois — Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named plaintiffs — to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as "motor voter," which allowed people to register to vote when they got their driver's license. Among the groups who sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996. Obama was making his first successful run for the Illinois state Senate in 1996; he would hold that office until he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004. Obama remained affiliated with the law firm while he served in the state legislature, but news reports say his actual legal work for the firm declined significantly as he focused on his elected office. So if McCain campaign's statement means that Obama represented ACORN, this is true. But the statement implies that Obama worked for ACORN as a staff attorney, or in a longer-term relationship. Yet he really only represented them once. So we find McCain's statement Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-17T00:00:00	2008-10-10	['None']

pomt-13992	"Under (Obamacare), you can’t reward a person for better behavior. You can’t have incentives to be healthier."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/08/paul-ryan/does-obamacare-ban-incentives-healthy-living/	The health care overhaul known as "Obamacare" is as complex as it is far-reaching, so it’s hardly a surprise that arguments over what the law requires or prohibits are lingering years after it took effect. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan drifted into those murky waters in an April 27, 2016, town hall meeting, asserting healthy people can’t be rewarded for their lifestyle under President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation. Ryan framed his criticism around a comparison to a hypothetical neighbor. "I’m 46, I stay in shape, I don’t smoke, I have a couple Miller Lites now and then, but I stay healthy, I work on it," Ryan said during the meeting at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. "My next-door neighbor could be (the) same demographic, same age, he could drink a case of beer each night, two steaks, you know, not run, be 100 pounds overweight." Then the claim about Obamacare: "Under the law, you can’t reward a person for better behavior. You can’t have incentives to be healthier. That makes no sense." Does Obamacare (officially the Affordable Care Act), really prohibit incentives that would charge less to healthier people? "Like Bill Clinton would say, it depends on what ‘you’ means," said Soeren Mattke, managing director of Health Advisory Services for the nonpartisan Rand Corp. think tank. A tale of two interpretations Indeed, insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act cannot require different rates based on a person’s health and lifestyle. The HealthCare.gov website even expressly states companies "can’t take your current health or medical history into account" when setting premiums. The one caveat lies in the definition of health history. The ACA allows five factors to be considered in setting premiums: location, age, plan category, whether dependents are covered and tobacco use. Tobacco use could fall into the health "behavior" category Ryan referenced, though smoking wasn’t among the unhealthy vices he laid out for the hypothetical neighbor. But Ryan’s claim doesn’t specify insurance companies. And if the "you" is interpreted as referring also to employers — that’s how many of the experts we consulted read it — the claim gets dicier. "The Affordable Care Act allows employers to vary premiums by up to 30 percent to be able to reward employees not only for participating in wellness programs but to achieve specific metrics of health," said Meena Seshamani, director of the Office of Health Reform at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The law even increased the maximum reward for involvement in a wellness program from 20 percent to 30 percent of the premium, also boosting the max to 50 percent for those in a smoking cessation program. Some 49 percent of Americans are insured through their employer, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. But not all employers have such programs, and then only a portion tie in financial incentives. Kaiser’s 2014 employer survey found 74 percent of firms offering health insurance have some kind of wellness program. Among those with programs, 36 percent of large firms and 18 percent of small firms offer financial incentives for participation. Ryan’s office didn’t respond to our inquiries seeking clarity on who he was referencing or evidence to support his statement. Wellness programs in dispute Despite the Affordable Care Act language, wellness programs remain a gray area of health care law — and a moving target. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued some companies over wellness programs they believed went too far with incentives or disincentives. Wellness programs are typically a combination of screening activities (questionnaires and/or clinical tests) and interventions to specifically address risks such as weight, smoking, fitness and drug use. One such case stemmed from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, where the EEOC alleged Flambeau, Inc., a plastics manufacturer based in Baraboo, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring employees to participate in a wellness program in order to get company health insurance. Judge Barbara Crabb dismissed the case in December 2015, however, agreeing with the company that the program fell under an exception allowing for activities related to administering an insurance plan. The EEOC is appealing the ruling, even as it issued a new rule in mid-May attempting to clarify how wellness programs can comply with the ACA, the disabilities act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This and similar EEOC lawsuits elsewhere are making employers hesitant to implement wellness plans that require certain benchmarks, said Tom Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. "It’s one thing to participate and be rewarded for it, it’s another set of hurdles if you start requiring people to succeed at achieving certain goals," Miller said. "It doesn’t mean you can’t do it, but there’s a lot of smoke in the air that discourages employers from going that far as a general rule." Our rating Ryan said, "Under (Obamacare), you can’t reward a person for better behavior. You can’t have incentives to be healthier." Ryan is largely on point if the "you" refers only to insurance companies, but there’s nothing in the context to justify such a narrow interpretation. The claim was broad and implied a ban on incentives. That’s not the case. Wellness programs, while not available to everyone, are specifically authorized by the Affordable Care Act as a means for employers to raise or lower premiums by up to 30 percent based on employees’ health-related behavior. For a statement that is partly accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-06-08T04:00:00	2016-04-27	['None']
pomt-09934	Contends that President Obama "literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/11/mike-pence/pence-claims-obama-said-energy-costs-will-skyrocke/	With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive. Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's Morning Joe on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy. Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction. "I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,'" said Pence. He added that Democrat "John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'" It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008. "Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket," Obama told the Chronicle . "Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers." While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. "The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important," Obama said. So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers. What's fuzzy, however, is how costly. PolitiFact has already looked into the issue and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family. Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony. It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the Chronicle nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget. Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would "necessarily skyrocket," and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ffafdf4-5637-4e52-8ff3-7d5f0ecab7f6	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-06-11T17:22:51	2009-06-10	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-13345	Says Tim Kaine "actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-accuses-tim-kaine-raising-taxes-leaving/	Republican Mike Pence accused Democrat Tim Kaine of being a big taxer during the 2016 vice-presidential debate. "He actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion," Pence said of Kaine’s record as Virginia governor from 2006 to 2010. Pence made a similar statement during an Oct. 3 rally in Ashland, Va. Stephen Cheung, a spokesman for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, emailed us that Pence was referring to three unsuccessful tax proposals Kaine made during his gubernatorial term. The first came days after Kaine took office. He rolled out a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for the state’s longstanding transportation woes. Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees and imposing steeper fines on drivers who got tickets. The registration fees are similar to a tax, since all drivers must register their cars. Pence takes license by including the higher driving penalties as a tax, since those payments could have been easily avoided. We should note that Senate Republicans that year unsuccessfully proposed a bill -- different from Kaine’s proposal -- that also would have raised taxes by $1 billion for transportation. Kaine’s second tax proposal came during the summer of 2008, when lawmakers gathered for a special transportation session. Ahead of the conclave, Kaine proposed a $1.1 billion plan that would have increased the titling tax to 4 percent from 3 percent, and hike vehicle registration fees by $10. Kaine offered his final tax hike in December 2009 -- his last full month in office. Virginia’s economy was reeling from the aftershocks of the Great Recession, and Kaine proposed raising state income tax rates for all brackets by 1 percentage point. Kaine’s plan, defeated a week after he left office in January 2010, would have generated $1.9 billion a year. That would have been offset by $650 million taxpayers would have saved by a companion proposal to end Virginia’s personal property tax on vehicles. So the net effect of his last-year plan would have been a $1.25 billion annual tax hike. All told, Kaine proposed $4 billion in annual tax hikes during his term, tempered by $650 million in cuts. That comes to a net total of $3.35 billion. Alternate route There’s another way to get to $4 billion in tax increases that Trump used during a July 25 rally in Roanoke, Va. The presidential nominee said that Kaine, during his first week as governor, "proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase." Trump’s campaign backed the statement by taking the $1 billion transportation tax hike Kaine proposed in 2006 and multiplying it over the four years of his gubernatorial term. It should be noted, however, that neither Trump in Roanoke, nor Pence during the debate, said they were referring to the four-year cumulative cost of one proposed tax increase. Our ruling Pence said that when Kaine was governor, "He actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion." Pence was referring to three unsuccessful tax hikes proposed by Kaine. Two of them, in 2006 and 2008, were for transportation. The third, in 2009, was to raise general funds for the state. Added up, they come to $4 billion in proposed tax hikes and fees. There’s a couple of issues, however. Kaine’s 2009 income tax hike was offset by a $650 million cut in the state’s car tax. So the net annual cost of all three tax and fee proposals was $3.35 billion. Secondly, Pence’s math double counts Kaine’s unsuccessful efforts to raise taxes for transportation. On the whole, we rate Pence’s statement Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53700feb-db9a-46ff-aa07-16acf582cf80	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-10-04T21:53:24	2016-10-04	['None']

pomt-02722	Federal law for Obamacare navigators "does not bar — or even require screening for — convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/20/pete-sessions/obamacare-law-didnt-mandate-background-checks-navi/	A Dallas congressman charged the Obamacare law with failing to bar convicts from helping Americans shop for health coverage. In an oped article written with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., Republican Pete Sessions suggested the patient "navigators" authorized by the Affordable Care Act could include individuals experienced in stealing identities. The article was posted online Dec. 15, 2013, by the Dallas Morning News. Under the law, navigators are groups or individuals entrusted with helping individuals as they shop online for health coverage to comply with the Obamacare law’s mandate that most Americans obtain health insurance. The federal government says too that a navigator may help a consumer complete eligibility and enrollment forms. "These individuals and organizations are required to be unbiased. Their services are free to consumers," the government says. However, Sessions wrote, the 2010 health-care law "does not bar — or even require screening for — convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud. This is particularly dangerous because navigators may have access to applicants’ personally identifiable information, including Social Security number date of birth, address, phone number and annual income. This poorly conceived program endangers families and individuals across the country by heightening the risk of identity theft or financial loss." Is that so? Law doesn't mandate Our review of the law yielded no sign of a mandate that navigators be subject to criminal background checks, though the law says the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services "shall establish standards for navigators… including provisions to ensure that any private or public entity that is selected as a navigator is qualified, and licensed if appropriate, to engage in the navigator activities described in this subsection and to avoid conflicts of interest." The law continues: "Under such standards, a navigator shall not... be a health insurance issuer; or...receive any consideration directly or indirectly from any health insurance issuer in connection with the enrollment of any qualified individuals or employees of a qualified employer in a qualified health plan." The law further says the secretary shall, in collaboration with the states, develop standards to ensure information made available by navigators is fair, accurate and impartial. On April 5, 2013, Health and Human Services proposed rules for navigators; we did not spot a directive to conduct background checks there, nor was there one in the final rules, dated July 17, 2013. And by telephone, analyst Stacey Pogue of the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has spoken up against proposed state rules imposing more training for navigators, pointed out that HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has spoken to Sessions’ claim. In a Nov. 6, 2013, hearing of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, the secretary was asked by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas: "Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background, even though they will receive personal -- sensitive personal information from the individuals they helped sign up for the Affordable Care Act?" Sebelius: "That is true. States could add an additional background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement." Cornyn: "So a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them." Sebelius: "That is possible. We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job." Republican staff inquiry Sessions’ spokeswoman Torrie Miller, responding to our request for the basis of his claim, pointed by email to a Sept. 18, 2013, preliminary report by the Republican staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform quoting Vicki Gottlich, described as overseeing the navigator program for the federal government until June 2013, as confirming in an April 18, 2013, response to committee staff that "convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft" could become navigators. According to the report, Gottlich also testified "there’s nothing that prohibited HHS from (requiring individuals to have gone through a background check)," but HHS "determined that it would be up to the individual grantee to comply with state requirements for background checks and investigations of their employees." According to Gottlich, the report said, "in many states, there would be sufficient checks" and "the cost (of background checks) might be prohibitive for some entities," while entities in rural areas might have difficulty with background checks and fingerprinting. According to the report, Gottlich also testified that the agency never considered banning convicted felons or individuals convicted of identity theft from being navigators. The report quoted her as saying that all such hiring decisions were "going to be up to each individual (navigator award) grantee," and, if a state’s laws allow, navigator organizations "can hire convicted felons including those individuals convicted of identity theft." Federal "excluded parties" list And what are the groups getting the navigator grants? Our search of the HHS website yielded a written statement prepared by a deputy administrator, Gary Cohen, for his May 21, 2013, appearance before a House subcommittee. Cohen said entities chosen to receive federal funds as navigators "will be subjected to a robust screening process before grants are awarded." A related footnote said: "Entities and individuals are not eligible for a federal grant, including a navigator grant, if they are on the Excluded Parties List, which is a list of any entities or individuals who have been suspended or debarred by any federal agency. Entities or individuals may be suspended from receiving federal grant money for up to one year based on indictments, information or adequate evidence involving environmental crimes, contract fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, poor performance, non-performance or false statements." The footnote continued: "Entities or individuals may be debarred from receiving federal grant money for a longer period of time based on convictions, civil judgment or fact-based cases involving environmental crimes, contract fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, poor performance, non-performance or false statements as well as other causes. This careful screening will help to ensure that individuals or organizations that pose a risk to the federal government are not awarded federal navigator grants." Texas grant recipient says it conducts checks In August 2013, according to a document posted online by the Texas State Library, the groups chosen to field navigator grants were: the United Way of Metropolitan Tarrant County; Migrant Health Promotion, Inc.; the National Hispanic Council on Aging; Change Happens, a Houston nonprofit; United Way of El Paso County; Southern United Neighborhoods, an anti-poverty group; the East Texas Behavioral Healthcare Network; and the National Urban League. Separately, the Texas Tribune said in an Aug. 15, 2013, news story that $10.8 million was awarded to the grant recipients with the biggest awardees being Tarrant County’s United Way ($5.8 million) and the East Texas network ($1.3 million). By email, an HHS spokesman in Washington, D.C., Fabien Levy, told us: "Navigator grants are given to trusted community organizations that have a track record of working in their communities and all navigators must complete a minimum of 20 hours of training and comply with privacy and security standards. We take any alleged impropriety seriously and take immediate action in cases where navigators have failed to live up to their responsibilities." It could be, too, that navigator grant recipients are conducting background checks already, though Miller of Sessions’ office told us by email that "we have no way of knowing how many have actually done so." A Dec. 3, 2013, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News said the Community Council of Greater Dallas and other partners in the navigator grant overseen by United Way of Tarrant County "voluntarily subjected all navigators hired to criminal background checks and additional training on privacy." By telephone, United Way spokeswoman Cassie McQuitty told us all of its 146 navigators underwent criminal background checks prior to being hired. By email, she said they also had been trained in consumer needs and privacy. Texas agency proposes mandatory background checks The News’ story noted, too, that the Texas Department of Insurance had proposed state-specific rules for navigators in the state. The agency’s Nov. 26, 2013, proposed rules state: "HHS does not conduct or require a background check on navigators or individuals who represent navigator grant recipients." The agency proposal says, too, that a measure passed into law by the 2013 Legislature authorized the state insurance commissioner to adopt rules providing that anyone who becomes a navigator not have a professional license suspended or revoked or have been the subject of any other disciplinary action by a financial or insurance regulator in the country--or been convicted of a felony. According to the agency’s proposal, TDI learned at a Sept. 30, 2013, Texas "stakeholders" meeting "that one navigator entity in Texas had taken steps to provide protections beyond those set out in federal standards. These steps included background checks on employees and extra training focused on Texas Medicaid and privacy." Sessions’ oped article said the "lack of federal oversight of the navigator program has already led to reports of improper and illegal behavior, including two instances in North Texas. In Dallas, a navigator recommended that an applicant lie about his income in order to qualify for additional subsidies to lessen the costs of his health care plan. In Irving, a part-time receptionist who worked at a navigator center encouraged an individual to lie about his tobacco use to keep his premiums down." A Nov. 12, 2013, Dallas Morning News’ blog post said that hidden-camera video taken by activist James O’Keefe evidently showed three Dallas navigators advising a consumer to lie about his income and whether he smokes as part of getting a better deal on subsidized health coverage in visits to offices in Irving and Oak Cliff in Dallas. The newspaper said the taped navigators advised a young man posing as a university student. "He says he has a $15,000 a year job and unreported income from odd jobs. They tell him not to report the outside income on his health insurance application, if he has not disclosed it on his income taxes," the News said. "They also urge him not to divulge that he occasionally smokes. "‘You lie because your premiums will be higher,’ one says." Later the same day, the newspaper reported, the Urban League of Greater Dallas and North Central Texas fired three navigator trainees and another employee in the wake of the incident. The proposed state rules would require navigators to: be 18 years of age; provide proof of U.S. citizenship or compliance with all federal laws pertaining to employment or to the transaction of business in the United States; provide proof of compliance with education requirements; and submit to fingerprinting and a background check. On its website, the department urges Texans to be careful while shopping for a policy. The agency further says: "Currently, the federal government oversees navigators and counselors that help consumers shop for insurance in the federal marketplace. To verify a navigator or counselor is certified by the federal government, call the federal marketplace at 1-800-318-2596 or visit www.healthcare.gov. In addition, TDI is in the process of developing rules to further regulate navigators, ensuring that consumers’ personal information is protected and that navigators are well-trained and qualified." A squib on another agency web page says: "Navigators are funded through federal grants and should not request any money from you, nor will they receive a commission from an insurance company for helping you purchase coverage." By telephone, agency spokesman John Greeley said the state rules are to be finalized after public hearings, the last one scheduled for Jan. 6, 2014. Other states Next, we wondered if other states were considering mandatory background checks of navigators. At Pogue’s suggestion, we reached Justin Giovannelli of the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute who said by email that at least a dozen other states have created or proposed some sort of required criminal background check of individuals seeking to be navigators: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin. Our ruling Sessions said federal law related to Obamacare navigators "does not bar—or even require screening for—convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud." That’s correct, but this claim is missing important meaningful information. For instance, it fails to note that the federal government has an Excluded Parties list that prevents grants from going to agencies not in good standing. Also, the claim doesn’t acknowledge that states are permitted to impose background checks. A Texas agency was already weighing such a mandate when Sessions made this claim while nationally, other states have done so or are considering as much. Finally, this claim fails to note that the biggest Texas contractor for navigators has reported conducting a background check of each navigator it hired.

pomt-00111	"During the Strickland-Cordray era, taxes were raised by $800 million and Ohio lost 400,000 jobs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/oct/29/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-ad-blames-rich-cordray-raising-taxes-a/	Ohio Republican Mike DeWine says Richard Cordray held statewide office at a time when the state bled jobs and hiked taxes. "During the Strickland-Cordray era, taxes were raised by $800 million and Ohio lost 400,000 jobs...," says a TV ad by DeWine, the current attorney general. "Richard Cordray will raise taxes. Kill jobs." Previously, we found that DeWine has misled by stating that Cordray will raise taxes. Here we will fact-check whether Democrats Cordray and then-Gov. Ted Strickland were in office when Ohio raised taxes by $800 million and if Ohio lost 400,000 jobs. These are similar to attacks we heard from Ohio Republicans in 2010, and like back then, they omit some context. The new attacks pertain to when Cordray was state treasurer from 2007 to 2008 and attorney general from 2009 to 2010. We found that it is misleading to blame Cordray for job losses or tax increases during his tenure because he had the responsibility for neither. "Taxes were raised by $800 million" This statement pertains to a decision by Strickland in late 2009 to freeze a scheduled 4.2 percent income tax cut, the final year of a five-year cut. But the attack ignores the context of the cancelled tax cut and provides no evidence Cordray had a role in it. The tax cut freeze was adopted after a plan to place slot machines at Ohio racetracks fell through, leaving a hole of more than $800 million in the budget, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate signed off on the deal, narrowly. Strickland had to find a source of revenue or would have had to slash programs to balance the budget. And part of the reason for the shortfall can be pinned on Republicans, who increased spending in seven consecutive budgets while also cutting taxes when they controlled the General Assembly. However, the cut was scheduled to be reinstated the next year. Whether deferring a tax break for a year is the same as raising taxes has been a point of contention. PolitiFact Ohio previously found that those who owed the state after filing their 2009 taxes owed a little bit extra thanks to Strickland’s tax freeze. Strickland’s decision cost a family of four earning $60,000 a year about $78. Deferring a cut isn’t precisely the same as a tax hike, and either way as attorney general Cordray didn’t have any responsibility for it. "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs." It’s true that Ohio lost jobs while Cordray was in office, but this ignores that he wasn’t to blame for the national recession. Ohio lost about 368,000 jobs between January 2007 and December 2010, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. During the 2000s, Ohio lost a lot of manufacturing jobs. Most of the state job losses between 2007 and 2010 can be attributed to the severe national recession, University of Akron Professor Michael Nelson said. "It is possible that a very modest amount of jobs could have been created had the scheduled state income tax cut gone through, but it would have minimal," he said. "The bottom line: A state economy is driven first and foremost by what is happening in the broader national/international economy." The Cleveland Plain Dealer compared the job record of Strickland with the current governor, Republican John Kasich, and found "in both cases, like every other period as long as Ohio has been electing governors to four-year terms starting 60 years ago, Ohio has done worse than the nation as a whole." Ohio consistently has gained jobs at a slower rate than the country, or in bad times, lost jobs faster than the nation. DeWine campaign cites Cordray’s comments about taxes The DeWine campaign did not provide any direct evidence that Cordray played a role in the tax freeze or job losses. Instead, the campaign tried to portray Cordray as an opponent of policies that would grow jobs or reduce taxes and tried to lump him together with Strickland’s tax policy. For example, spokesman Joshua Eck pointed to Cordray’s criticism in 2010 over JobsOhio, a proposal by Kasich to replace the Ohio Department of Development with a private nonprofit. That doesn’t mean Cordray was to blame for job losses, he just didn’t support a private takeover of the entity. Eck pointed to statements Cordray made during this campaign about taxes, such as slamming Republicans for cutting state taxes. But Cordray has also said several times that he doesn’t see a need for tax increases. Our ruling DeWine said, "During the Strickland-Cordray era taxes were raised by $800 million and Ohio lost 400,000 jobs." This is a case of misplaced blame. The ad tries to scare voters into portraying Cordray as a tax hiker responsible for job losses when in fact there is no evidence he deserves any blame. Then-Gov. Strickland delayed the fifth year of an income tax cut to fill a budget hole in 2009, but as attorney general Cordray had no role in that decision. Ohio did lose those jobs, but the national recession was to blame -- not anything done by Cordray as treasurer or attorney general. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-09673	52 jobs have been saved or created in Florida's 34th Congressional District.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/19/recoverygov/recoverygov-shows-jobs-congressional-districts-don/	The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. The Web site makes the case that the stimulus has created tens of thousands of jobs by listing money spent and jobs created or "saved." It uses sophisticated mapping to show where the projects are located. But it's also been a target for stimulus critics who contend that the site uses sloppy bookkeeping and overly generous assumptions to present data that they say is simply political propaganda. The critics were quick to highlight an ABC News report that the Web site shows jobs for Congressional Districts that don't exist. The Obama administration acknowledged the mistakes and said that some of the data was entered incorrectly. Two days after ABC News reported on the problem with Congressional districts, the Recovery.gov Web site had changed the data from imaginary district numbers to "unassigned" districts. But we were intrigued by ABC's report and decided to dig into the data a little deeper. We selected the state of Florida and noted, before the data was changed, that it listed congressional districts that don't exist. There are 25 Congressional districts in the state, but the site listed projects in the 34th, 35th, 53rd, and 88th districts. It also listed one project in the "00th" district. (See the page we archived here .) For our fact-checking purposes, we decided to select one of the non-existent Florida districts at random and see if we could discover what was going on. We selected the 34th District, which listed 52 jobs and $1,810,857. After searching Recovery.gov a few different ways, we finally found the project: It was for the Hialeah Housing Authority, an agency in South Florida, to modernize and update its public housing. "This funding can be expected to result in providing employment for construction workers and product manufacturers," said the project page on Recovery.gov. It said the money was being used for roofing and bathroom work and cabinet installations. The Congressional district was listed as 34, but it actually belongs in the 21st, which is represented by Republican Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. We couldn't reach anyone with the Hialeah Housing Authority. But there were four major contractors listed for the Hialeah Housing Authority's project, and we were able to find one of them, Greystroke Construction Inc. Owner Gustavo Blazquez confirmed his work for the authority, and said he assigned about six employees to the project. The work -- replacing cabinets in individual public housing units --had been going on for three months and he expected it to go for three more. Blazquez confirmed the project details listed on Recovery.gov, including that he was one of several contractors who got a piece of the grant. Hialeah is near Miami, and the construction industry there has been hit hard by the housing bust, he said. "We've got a bare bones crew, and we're trying to survive," he said. "It's helped us keep a small amount of employees, but for how long?" Blazquez said he's in the process of bidding for more work from the housing authority. The Hialeah project highlights some important caveats -- some might consider them flaws -- in the Obama administration's accounting. The concept of jobs "saved" is nebulous and raises questions. Those six people Blazquez employs are listed as jobs "saved or created" on the Recovery.gov Web site, but it is a contract for short-term work. Those six people could very well be out of a job in three months -- even though the Obama administration touts them as holding new jobs. Counting jobs "created or saved" is also under scrutiny from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that does investigations for Congress. The legislation that created the stimulus also charged the GAO with monitoring jobs reported, and the GAO filed its first report on Thursday. The report found that while agencies and employers were making good-faith efforts to report data, there was evidence that data reporting has been inconsistent. "Even recipients of similar types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they developed their jobs data," the report said. The guidelines require employers to report full-time equivalents, or FTEs, on a quarterly basis for the duration of the project. That means the total hours worked divided by the number of hours in a full time schedule, as defined by the recipient. This is to account for people who work part-time. The GAO report said that some employers and government agencies have been confused by the process and haven't followed the guidelines for determining FTEs, particularly using different time periods to calculate FTEs. In some cases, agencies didn't specify a time period to use. Housing authorities in particular had trouble because they have little experience with reporting employment data, according to the report. We can't independently confirm whether the Hialeah Housing Authority appropriately reported its data on jobs created. But we do know they misreported their Congressional district. Still, it appears to be construction work that should have some stimulative effect. When you hear the Obama administration cite the number of jobs saved or created, you may get the impression that they are referring to long-term, permanent jobs. But that is not the case. In many cases the jobs on Recovery.gov and cited by the administration represent contract jobs that are full-time but end after a short period of time. We should also note this isn't the first time that we've seen problems with the Obama administration's aggressive counting of jobs created or "saved" under its stimulus plan. Back in May, President Barack Obama said the economic stimulus has " saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs " in its first 100 days. That was an estimate created by White House economic advisers, and independent economists we interviewed said that it was far too early to create a definite projection with a high level of accuracy. So we rated his statement Barely True. On the other hand, our reporting has also found the stimulus is properly credited for contributing to 3.5 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product during the third quarter. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said all that was due to Cash for Clunkers and a homebuyers tax credit , but we found that Half True. Recovery.gov is a useful Web site for finding information on specific projects funded by the stimulus, but its rah-rah claims for job creation need some important context and explanation. We are not trying to suggest that the stimulus is doing nothing, but we don't believe that a six-month temporary job is what most people think of when they hear of a job saved or created. In the claim we're examining here, Recovery.gov reported that 52 jobs have been saved or created in Florida's 34th Congressional District. The 34th District doesn't exist, and that's the result of a data entry error. The jobs are actually in the 21st District, and we know that work is being done there after we spoke with one of the contractors. But those still are short-term construction jobs. In the example we chose, we've seen enough questions about the data to give us significant pause. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04089	"I am now the No. 2 member of this House in terms of length of service."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/18/bill-batchelder/william-batchelder-says-his-service-career-ranks-n/	State Rep. William G. Batchelder was re-elected speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives when the General Assembly met for the first time Jan. 7. The Medina Republican reviewed the work of the previous two-year assembly in traditional opening remarks, and he also mentioned an achievement of his own: "It has been my privilege to serve in the Ohio House of Representatives for more than 35 years," he said, "and I understand that I am now the No. 2 member of this House in terms of length of service." It's a noteworthy distinction, but it brought a question to PolitiFact Ohio: if Batchelder's claim is true, how is it possible in a state with term limits? We dug into the record. First, Batchelder was correct. He was elected to the House in 1968, starting his first term in 1969, and served until 1999. Elected again in 2006, he was re-elected to his fourth consecutive two-year term last November -- making him the most senior member of the House and giving him its second-longest tenure in state history. The longest-serving member was Robert Netzley, a Republican from southwest Ohio who died in 2010. He served 40 years until retiring in 2000, when he was term-limited. The longest serving member of the Senate was Ted Gray, who served a total of 43 years and retired in 1994. Ohio's term limits were approved by voters through a constitutional amendment in 1992 and became effective in 2000. They limit House members to four two-year terms, an eight-year cap, and state senators to two four-year terms, also eight years. There is no lifetime limit on terms. The cap is on consecutive terms, and the clock is reset when a member leaves the House or Senate. Nor is there a restriction or waiting period on jumping from one chamber to the other. An analysis by the Toledo Blade last July found that 18 active members of the total 132 in the General Assembly had served more than eight uninterrupted years in Columbus by making at least one jump between chambers. Rep. Ron Amstutz of Wooster, a budget expert who was named as the lawmaker with the longest consecutive service in the term limits era, has been in office for 32 years. He first ran successfully for the House in 1980. Batchelder, who left the House for a judgeship in 1999, now has served for more than 35 years. He has never served in the Senate. Term limits will prevent him from seeking another House term in 2014. And on the Truth-O-Meter, his claim about ranking No. 2 for length of service in the Ohio House rates as True.	None	William G.

pomt-10175	House Republicans "weren't part of the negotiations" on the Wall Street bailout plan.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/republicans-werent-shut-out/	The public is skeptical of the massive Wall Street bailout plan pending on Capitol Hill. So during the first presidential debate, both candidates were reluctant to say precisely where they stood on the proposal that is likely to cost about $700-billion. The same is true on Capitol Hill, where House Republicans sank a plan offered by a president from their own party, and offered one of their own that would include less taxpayer money. During the debate, John McCain complained that the House GOP members had been left out. "I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that," McCain said. "And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem." But they were and are. If McCain's point is that Republicans have felt that Democrats – and President Bush – have tried to rush a deal, there's more evidence for that. When Democrats and President Bush claimed a deal was at hand on Sept. 25, 2008, House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, said there was no deal. "There may be a deal among some Democrats, but House Republicans are not a part of it," he said. Soon, House Republicans revealed that they were pushing a rival plan that would offer government insurance to failing firms in place of Bush's strategy, which involves the government purchasing bad debts held by U.S. and foreign banks. Charges and countercharges flew. Republicans said Democrats were trying to rush a deal and prevent McCain – who had suspended his campaign to return to Washington to participate in the negotiations – from helping to forge an agreement. Democrats said Republicans were delaying unnecessarily in order to allow McCain to score political points. But later that day, as Congressional Quarterly reported, Boehner's tone had moderated. "The speaker and I have worked together to try and craft a bipartisan plan that will pass the House," he said. On its face, McCain's remark clearly is not accurate because Republicans were part of the discussion. But we'll give McCain a few points because it also is clear that Republicans didn't feel fully involved in negotiations because they expressed their frusration by killing the plan proposed by Bush. We'll rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12507	Says Bernie Sanders "is the most popular politician in America today."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/27/mike-crute/despite-losing-nomination-hillary-clinton-bernie-s/	Discussing the 2016 presidential race on April 19, 2017, a liberal talk radio show host in Milwaukee argued that Bernie Sanders would have "won a landslide victory" over Donald Trump. Then Mike Crute, who co-hosts "The Devil’s Advocates," exclaimed that Sanders "is the most popular politician in America today." Crute, whose show used to be based in Madison, didn’t say how he knew. So, we thought we’d check out his claim. Two recent polls Sanders finished as runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination. So the Vermont senator, an Independent, never faced Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump, of course, defeated Clinton, the former secretary of state, in the general election. The latest national survey on this question was the Harvard-Harris Poll, which is done by Harvard University’s Center for American Political Studies and Harris Insights and Analytics. Conducted online April 14 to 17, 2017 with registered voters, the poll listed the names of 16 political figures, without the titles of their governmental positions. Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of each, or had never heard of them. The 16 included prominent figures, such Sanders, Trump and Clinton, and the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, but also lesser-known Trump appointees. Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, director of polling at the Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said it is common in non-election years for the president, vice president, congressional leaders and perhaps a prominent senator or two to be included in such polls. But including presidential staff members "is dubious, as they are not known to a lot of voters," he told us. Sanders had the best showing in the Harvard-Harris survey, with 57 percent saying they had a favorable opinion of him. In fact, he was the only one of the 16 to get a majority favorable rating. Here are the ratings for the nine political figures who are not Trump appointees: Name Favorability rating Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. 57% Vice President Mike Pence 44% President Donald Trump 44% Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 42% Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. 38% House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. 34% House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 31% Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 27% Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 23% Sanders also had the best showing among eight elected officials in a Fox News Poll of registered voters conducted by telephone about a month earlier, from March 12 to 14, 2017. Sanders got a favorable rating from 61 percent of respondents. Pence was second among the politicians, at 47 percent, and Trump was third, at 44 percent. The others: Warren, 39 percent; Ryan, 37 percent; Pelosi, 33 percent; Schumer, 26 percent; and McConnell, 20 percent. Franklin also provided us HuffPost Pollster data on polls done since Jan. 1, 2017. Former President Barack Obama is included in those polls. Obama’s average favorability rating was highest, at 61 percent, with Sanders coming in second at 56 percent. But like Clinton, Obama is no longer an elected official. None of the other politicians in polls tracked by HuffPost Pollster had a favorability rating higher than 46 percent. Our rating Crute said Sanders "is the most popular politician in America today." The polls don’t specifically ask respondents for their favorite politician -- they provide a limited list of political figures and ask respondents whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each one. But based on that measure of popularity, Sanders finished comfortably on top among some major political figures in the latest national poll. And in an averaging of polls on favorability done in 2017, his rating was exceeded only by Obama, who perhaps could still be called a politician, though not an active one. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-06799	Says a poll found him the only Republican candidate who could beat Barack Obama in Texas -- and by eight points.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/14/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-poll-showed-him-only-republican-b/	As word surfaced Aug. 8, 2011, that Rick Perry was poised to join the 2012 race for president, fellow Republican Mitt Romney made what the New York Times called a veiled reference to Perry’s home-state appeal. "You know there was a poll, I guess it was about a month ago, that was a little surprising," the newspaper quoted the former Massachusetts governor saying during a New Hampshire campaign stop. "It had me as the only Republican candidate who in Texas could beat President Obama. I think I was ahead by eight points. No one else was ahead of him." Romney the only GOP presidential powerhouse in the Lone Star state? An online search led us to the results of a poll taken in late June by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which works with Democrats. The poll of 795 Texas voters, taken June 25-27, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Forty-four percent of the respondents identified themselves as Republicans, 35 percent as Democrats, 21 percent as Independents. And according to the poll, 50 percent of respondents favored Romney over Obama, who was backed by 42 percent -- indeed an eight-point edge. Summarizing, the pollster said Obama "performs weakest" against Romney. Contrary to Romney’s August recap, though, other Republicans also outperformed Obama. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, led Obama by 45 percent to 40 percent; U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann led Obama by 47 percent to 44 percent and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty narrowly bested Obama by 44 percent to 43 percent. According to the poll, Obama was tied with Republican Herman Cain, at 43 percent, and led Sarah Palin by 46 percent to 44 percent. Perry, who had recently acknowledged he would weigh a bid for president, trailed Obama 47 percent to 45 percent. In a press release accompanying the poll results, the polling firm said Bachmann was the most popular Republican contender in her own right and the only one in positive territory with a 39 percent to 36 percent favorable/unfavorable rating. Romney was viewed unfavorably by 43 percent of respondents, favorably by 37 percent. Perry, governor since late 2000, was approved by 43 percent of respondents but disapproved of by 52 percent -- though 52 percent of Republican respondents wanted him to run for president. Some 85 percent of respondents who voted for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008 preferred Romney to Obama; 78 percent preferred Perry to Obama. In an interview, the polling firm’s director, Tom Jennings, credited Romney with accurately reflecting his lead over Obama in the poll and that he fared better than other Republicans. While three other Republicans likewise bested Obama in the poll’s one-on-one hypothetical matchups, Jennings said, Romney was the sole Republican whose lead outpaced its margin of error. "He could argue he was the only one ahead outside the margin of error," Jennings said. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams echoed Jennings’ point about Romney being the only Republican whose lead over Obama in the June poll exceeds the poll’s margin of error. Williams said too that Romney, responding to a town-hall question about his appeal in the South, meant to point out he was the strongest Republican--not necessarily the only potentially winning Republican--against Obama, according to the poll. Finally, we came up empty on other polls matching Obama against individual Republican aspirants in Texas. However, a poll taken May 24-31 for the non-partisan Texas Lyceum, a statewide leadership group, gauged favorable/unfavorable ratings of candidates. Among the survey’s likely voters, 22 percent of 147 respondents planning to vote in the 2012 Republican presidential primary said they had not thought enough about the race to make a choice. Of those who had a preference, Romney was favored by 16 percent, Palin by 14 percent, Paul by 10 percent, Perry by 9 percent, Cain by 8 percent and Pawlenty by 7 percent. The margin of error on these choices was plus or minus 8 percentage points, "indicating that there is no clear favorite," the group said. Another poll, taken May 11-18 by the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune, showed 12 percent of polled Republicans preferring Palin for president, 7 percent for Romney, 10 percent for Paul and 4 percent for Perry. Some 14 percent said they did not know who they would vote for if the presidential primary were held then. More significantly eight months out from the Texas primary, the UT poll’s results reaffirmed the state’s Republican lean. Asked how they'd vote in a general election for president, 30 percent of polled voters said they would vote to re-elect Obama, while 48 percent said they’d vote for the Republican nominee, whoever it is. Jim Henson, the poll’s director, told us in an interview that barring unforeseen circumstances, any Republican is likely to best Obama in Texas. In the June poll, all told, Romney performed better in Texas than other Republicans against Obama, but contrary to his statement, he was not the only Republican to best him. He was the only candidate who did so by more than the poll's margin of error. But Romney is hardly the only Republican who could win the state. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Texas since 1976. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-06932	"Dubious taxpayer-funded" stimulus spending -- Part II.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/21/ocean-state-policy-research-institute/watchdog-group-critical-stimulus-spending-publishe/	When the Ocean State Policy Research Institute (OSPRI) published The 2011 Rhode Island Piglet Book last month -- ostensibly a report on government spending in our state -- we jumped at the opportunity to examine one of the "300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power" the group targeted. We found that the authors erred in saying that the state prisons used $250,000 in federal stimulus funds to convert from analog to digital TV. In fact, no stimulus money was used, so we ruled the claim False. That first look got us wondering about the 50 other projects that the Piglet Book highlighted as having benefited from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, more commonly known as the stimulus program. Did they actually get funded? What we found raises serious questions about the quality of the Research Institute’s research. For example, the report indicates the state spent $20 million from the stimulus program on "renovations for legislative office space" at 2 Capitol Hill, the building across Smith Street from the State House. But when we contacted Larry Berman, spokesman for the House of Representatives, he said, "The General Assembly has not done any improvements to any lawmaker offices." And Laurie Petrone, who oversees stimulus spending for state agencies as the director of the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, said no stimulus money was used to improve the building. What about another project with a hefty price tag -- $30 million to "install modern cyberinfrastructure" at Brown University? The university did not receive that grant, said Mark Nickel, director of news and communications at Brown. How about the Town of Smithfield? Did it receive "an overpriced overhaul courtesy of the American taxpayer... $4,565,000 in stimulus funds to revamp and add on to the hockey and ice skating facility?" Randy Rossi, Smithfield’s finance director, did undertake some improvements at the hockey rink. But Rossi, who was aware of the Piglet Book claim, said the town received no stimulus funds for the work. In fact, we found that many of the stimulus projects OSPRI lambasted were never funded: * $700,000 to plant 1,600 trees in Providence? "The city did not receive any stimulus funds," said spokesman David Ortiz. * $640,000 for new facilities at Goddard State Park, Colt State Park and the George Washington Management Area? "Didn’t get funded," said Petrone. * $300,000 for parking lot improvements on Capitol Hill? "No ARRA funds for that," Petrone said. * $3 million for improvements at Charlestown’s Cross Mills Village, $50,000 to take aerial photographs of the town and $45,000 to repair a sheep barn at the town’s South Farm Preserve? "We haven’t received any money at all," said Town Treasurer Patricia Anderson. For the work that the town did undertake (the photography, for example, was never done), "we used our own money." The problem, as we first found in our report on digital TV at the prisons, is that OSPRI relied on documents listing requests for stimulus money, not approvals. One document that OSPRI shared with us when we questioned the prison TV project was clearly titled in red type: "submitted requests under review." Petrone said the state compiled stimulus requests even before federal agencies wrote guidelines for the program. "We published every project that anyone had suggested for stimulus money. It was like the wish list," she said. Some wishes came true. Among the projects the Piglet Book listed under "stimulus shenanigans" were two at the University of Rhode Island. Spokesman David Lavallee directed us to documents confirming that the National Science Foundation gave $446,247 to URI for a six-week cruise to study the marine environment in the Arctic Ocean and $42,994 for an archaeological expedition to Iceland to excavate textile remains and study the role of women in early Norse culture. We won’t get into whether either was worthwhile. Our mission is to examine the accuracy of the Piglet Book’s stimulus claims, not to judge whether the money was well spent. A project at Rhode Island College also received SOME stimulus funding, but far less than the Piglet Book claimed. Under a section titled "frittering funds for fun," the OSPRI report said RIC received $12 million to renovate its recreation center. But spokeswoman Jane Fusco said that only $1 million came from the stimulus program, part of a $9.9-million grant to RIC to be used exclusively for fire-safety upgrades. We checked on 20 of the 50 projects listed in the report. In most cases, we tried to contact purported recipients, but we also visited recovery.org -- since renamed recovery.gov -- a federal repository of stimulus information and projects. Of the 20, we could verify only five that received stimulus money as described in the Piglet Book -- the two at URI and three highway projects overseen by the state Department of Transportation. The DOT jobs totaled $11 million and involved replacing some signs along the state’s major highways. Of the remaining 15 we checked, 13 of the purported recipients said they received no stimulus money whatsoever. That leaves two others. We already noted that RIC received a fraction of what OSPRI reported. In addition, Roger Williams University said it didn’t get the $8.2 million that OSPRI claimed it was awarded to expand its shellfish research center. The project cost about half that and was largely funded through other sources, said director Timothy Scott. A small amount of stimulus funds may have been used, but it’s possible none were, he said. The final tally: the Piglet Book was wrong on 15 of the 20 projects we checked. When we told OSPRI what we found, the organization acknowledged its error, but downplayed it. "The primary purpose of our Piglet report is to highlight the culture of out-of-control government spending that inevitably leads to waste, special-interest peddling and cronyism . . . ," it said in a statement. "While OSPRI recognizes that our report inadvertently did not properly distinguish between requested federal stimulus projects and completed projects, it does not lessen concern about the tax-and-spend mindset that encourages or would even consider some of these unconscionable requests . . . "OSPRI plans to submit an official record request to some of the entities in question and will publish an updated listing of the status of these projects on our website once the information has been gathered." In applying the Truth-O-Meter, we took into consideration that OSPRI said it made a mistake. But that’s not going to save their bacon here. OSPRI is clearly on a mission to ridicule government spending. You can’t miss the recurring inflammatory language in the report anymore than the message conveyed by its cover -- a cartoon of a large pig playing a violin and wearing a coat that says "R.I. Gov’t" as a background map of the state goes up in flames. OSPRI wants its 37-page report, with 411 footnotes, to be taken seriously. Yet the section that we examined, stimulus funding -- a controversial program whose merits should be debated based on facts -- is egregiously flawed. The group says it wants to highlight "out of control government spending," but most of the stimulus spending it cites never happened. Because OSPRI got so much so wrong, we’re thrusting a spit through the Piglet Book’s stimulus section and roasting it. This little piggy is going "Wee! Wee! Wee!" all the way to a Pants on Fire!

pomt-11443	Says that during the Supreme Court campaign, Michael Screnock has "vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/14/rebecca-dallet/did-wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-michael-scre/	With the Florida school shooting still fresh on many minds, the National Rifle Association became the focus of an attack in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The attack came from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals, against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is supported by conservatives. It was made during their televised debate in Milwaukee on March 2, 2018, a month before the April 3, 2018 election for a 10-year term on the high court. Screnock chafed at criticism Dallet made about activities he engaged in before becoming a judge. Then Dallet replied with criticism of his more recent behavior, saying of Screnock: "I’ll point out some things he’s done during the campaign, like vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA." Screnock did win the NRA’s endorsement. But did he "vow to uphold" the NRA’s platform? NRA queries candidates During the campaign, Screnock hasn’t said whether he believes two major gun rights cases were decided properly. Dallet said she thought the rulings — one by the U.S. Supreme Court, one by the Wisconsin Supreme Court — were made by "activist" justices. And while Dallet has backed tighter gun regulations, Screnock has said it isn’t up to courts to determine the best way to curb gun violence. The NRA, well known for fighting restrictions on the right to bear arms, describes itself as "America’s foremost defender of Second Amendment rights." Before the Feb. 20, 2018 primary election in the Supreme Court race, the group asked Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary, to submit a statement "stating your positions on Second Amendment issues." The letter said the NRA would use the responses in rating the candidates, and that the ratings would be communicated to NRA members. Only Screnock responded. NRA endorses Screnock To back Dallet’s attack on Screnock, her campaign cited a mailing the NRA sent to its members before the primary. The mailing, revealed by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, urged NRA members to vote for the "pro-Second Amendment" Screnock, saying in part: "Michael Screnock will interpret our Constitution the way our founding fathers intended and has vowed to protect your firearms freedom." So, there’s the word vowed that Dallet used. But that’s quoting the NRA and not Screnock himself, and it refers to firearms freedom generally, not any particular agenda. Now, to what Screnock actually said. Screnock’s response to the NRA letter We don’t know, of course, if Screnock had any private contacts with the NRA in connection with the campaign. What is available is his response to the NRA’s request, which Dallet and One Wisconsin Now had been calling on Screnock to release Nearly a week after the primary, Screnock released to the Associated Press the email he sent to the NRA in response to its request for his positions on Second Amendment issues. Key excerpts: I am a Judge, and I have served as an attorney, so I know firsthand the importance of upholding the rule of law, protecting public safety, and respecting the Constitution and the separation of powers. I also know about the dangers of legislating from the bench. Judges are not legislators, nor are we executives. Our job is to interpret and apply the law, based not on our personal or political beliefs, but by relying on statutes and the Constitution. Simply put, our job is to be arbiters of the law; not policy analysts or political activists. This of course includes the Second Amendment …. Having an independent judiciary comprised of justices with an unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law, to recognizing and respecting the separation of powers, and to interpreting the Constitution as it was intended is critical to preserving and maintaining our democracy and our republic …. On a personal note, I am a proud gun owner and enjoy carrying on our passion for the outdoors with my three adult sons. So, while volunteering that he is a proud gun owner, Screnock pledged to uphold the Constitution, including the Second Amendment, rather than to be a political activist. But he didn’t vow to take a position on policies or laws or cases that might be part of a broader NRA platform. In terms of the NRA’s agenda, its most recent calls for action include, while referencing the Florida school shooting, urging members to tell lawmakers to oppose new gun-control proposals, and stating opposition to proposals that would prohibit adults ages 18 to 20 from acquiring rifles and shotguns. Our rating Dallet says that during the Supreme Court campaign, Screnock "vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA." Screnock told the NRA his job is to be an arbiter of the law, including the Second Amendment, and not a political activist. But he hasn’t gone so far as to vow to uphold any particular platform. We rate Dallet’s statement Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Related fact checks Paul Ryan: "People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles." Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-10034	A new presidential helicopter "is now going to cost as much as Air Force One."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/john-mccain/presidential-helicopters-more-costly-air-force-one/	At a White House forum on fiscal responsibility on Feb. 23, Sen. John McCain complained to President Obama that cost overruns have dramatically increased the price tag for new presidential helicopters. "Just one area that I wanted to mention that I think consumed a lot of our conversation on procurement was the issue of cost overruns in the Defense Department," McCain said at the forum. "We all know how large the defense budget is. We all know that the cost overruns — your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One. I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money." We wondered if it was true that the Marine One presidential helicopter that carries 14 passengers could cost as much as the huge version of the Boeing 747 that is specially built for the president. The Air Force One cost comparison has been frequently cited by critics of the helicopter contract, which has nearly doubled in cost since Lockheed Martin won it in 2005. The original estimate was $6.1 billion for 28 helicopters, but it is now estimated at $11.2 billion. That works out to $400 million each. The two planes known as Air Force One, specially built Boeing 747 jets, were paid for in the late 1980s and delivered in 1990. We found a variety of price estimates for them. Several sources, including the book Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes by Kenneth T. Walsh, mention an overall cost of about $330 million per plane (in 1990 dollars). If that number is used for the comparison and adjusted to current dollars — about $517 million — then McCain is wrong because the plane costs more. But taxpayers actually paid only $200 million per plane (about $315 million in current dolllars), according to an Air Force spokesman. Boeing had a fixed price contract with the Air Force and had to absorb the cost overruns. So under that figure ($315 million for the plane vs. $400 million for the copter), McCain is close. In fact, he could have said the helicopter would cost more. So this one boils down to a question of what you consider to be the "cost" of Air Force One. It cost $550 million in current dollars to build , but the government paid just $315 million. We think most people would judge it on the cost that taxpayers paid, since that's the comparison being made with the helicopter contract (which is not a fixed price contract), but McCain could have been clearer if he had specified that. So we find his statement Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2009-02-27T15:00:53	2009-02-23	['None']

pomt-10313	"Obama will charge a 28 percent tax on all home sales."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/chain-email/not-obamas-policy/	A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false. Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about home sales. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read our full article here . The e-mail says McCain will leave the existing capital gains taxes at 0 percent on home sales of up to $500,000 per home for couples, while Obama proposes a 28 percent tax on all home sales. "If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes," the e-mail states. First, let's briefly explain what capital gains taxes are. A capital asset is "almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment," says the Internal Revenue Service. If you sell an asset and make a profit on it, that's a capital gain. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the tax filer's income and how long they held the asset, but generally taxes on capital gains are measured by the long-term rate for upper income tax brackets. Currently that rate is 15 percent. There are exemptions to the capital gains tax, however, and one of the best-known exemptions is on home sales. In general, if you own your home and sell it for a profit, you are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit if you are single, or on the first $500,000 of profit if you are a married couple. Neither McCain nor Obama have proposed changing this exemption. The e-mail says that McCain supports capital gains taxes of "0 percent on home sales of up to $500,000 per home for couples." Technically, this is inaccurate, because the sales price on its own doesn't matter. It's the profit that matters (what you paid for the home minus what you're selling it for). Profits up to $500,000 per couple are exempt, no matter what the sales price. The e-mail states "Obama will charge a 28 percent tax on all home sales." That's wrong. Obama intends to keep the same exemption for home sales as McCain. Most home sales under Obama's plan would also be taxed at 0 percent, unless, as we explained, profits on the home sale are more than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for couples. We don't want to give the impression that there is no difference between the two candidates on capital gains tax, but the e-mail gets all the details wrong. The true difference is that McCain intends to leave the long-term capital gains tax at 15 percent, while Obama intends to raise it to about 25 percent for taxpayers reporting income of $250,000 or more per year. But when it comes to home sales with the profits described above, McCain and Obama's policies are the same. The e-mail's statement that Obama will charge a 28 percent tax on all home sales is False.

pomt-13306	"You would receive a citation for taking a dildo to class" at the University of Texas.	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/oct/07/cocks-not-glocks/dildo-university-texas-class-could-lead-ticket-wou/	A student group at the University of Texas at Austin warned of legal repercussions for taking sex toys to class. The group, Cocks Not Glocks, was founded to highlight what protesters depicted as the absurdity of Texas’ campus carry law, Senate Bill 11, which as of Aug. 1, 2016 newly allowed students at public colleges and universities to bring concealed firearms into classrooms and campus buildings, except in areas excluded by school rules. Since 1995, licensed individuals had been allowed to carry concealed handguns onto public college and university grounds. On Aug. 24, 2016, UT’s first day of fall-semester classes, Cocks Not Glocks drew wide attention when it distributed about 4,000 dildos on campus in a show of opposition to campus carry. The group wrote on its Facebook event page, which showed almost 10,000 people pledging to attend the dildo distribution on the university’s Main Mall: "The State of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it DOES have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence. "You would receive a citation for taking a DILDO to class before you would get in trouble for taking a gun to class," the entry said. We’ve looked into the campus carry debate before, finding True a professor’s claim that prospective job applicants, students and guest speakers had decided to steer clear of the university out of concern concealed weapons might be present. But could one really get a citation for taking a dildo to class? A reader exhorted us to check. Group points to state obscenity law We messaged the Cocks Not Glocks Facebook page to ask for the basis of the citation claim and got a response from group founder and former student Jessica Jin, who wrote: "UT school rules cite Texas state law when it comes to obscenities and state law says that openly brandishing/distributing/promoting a phallic object in public is an offense." So a student who carried a concealed dildo to class, she acknowledged, "of course wouldn't be in any sort of trouble." Jin continued: "Our demonstration, which could be seen as an act of performance art also, if it weren't covered by free speech and demonstration protections that superseded state obscenity clauses, would have qualified as an obscenity in Texas." Specifically, she pointed us to the Texas Penal Code chapter 43, titled "public indecency," sections 21 and 22. So we pulled up the Texas Penal Code, noting section 43.21, which states that material qualifies as "obscene" if: —"The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex." --It "depicts or describes… the male or female genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal… or a device designed and marketed as useful primarily for stimulation of the human genital organs…" --"Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value." Next, section 43.22 of the code states that "a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly displays or distributes an obscene photograph, drawing, or similar visual representation or other obscene material and is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended or alarmed by the display or distribution." "An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor," it states. We looked up penal code chapter 12, "punishments," and found that a Class C misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of up to $500. Jin also told us that UT school rules cite state law as the basis for outlawing dildos. In the 207-page "general information" catalog, we flipped to subchapter 13-200, "prohibited expression," then to section 13-201, "obscenity," which states: "No person or organization will distribute or display on the campus any writing or visual image, or engage in any public performance, that is obscene. A writing image or performance is ‘obscene’ if it is obscene as defined in Texas Penal Code, Section 43.21 or successor provisions…" No evidence of citations So it looked like there’s a risk of getting into trouble for brandishing a dildo in class. So, can and would such tickets be issued? Our search of the Lexis Nexis news database didn’t turn up instances of Texans getting prosecuted for brandishing dildos. Across the board, the only apparent prosecutions for sex toy crimes were made under a state law, overturned in 2008, which banned the sales of "obscene" items. We emailed the University of Texas and asked if students would indeed receive a citation for taking a dildo to class, as school rules seemed to indicate. A top spokesman, J.B. Bird, responded by email that the university couldn’t speculate about a "hypothetical situation." Bird wrote: "The university works carefully to enforce its policies based on facts. In First Amendment situations, context also matters tremendously." So, maybe no citations. Then again, Bird wrote: "I can tell you that the university does enforce its rules." Speaking to the distribution of dildos by Cocks Not Glocks at the start of the fall 2016 semester, Bird said no tickets were issued because "the protests around campus carry earlier this year appeared to be examples of protected political speech." Reminder: The Texas penal code (based on the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Ruling Miller v. California) exempted material from obscenity restrictions unless it lacks "serious" political value. From outside UT, we heard back from the University of Houston Law Center, which referred our questions about whether citations would be issued for classroom dildos to Peter Linzer, a professor of constitutional law, who wrote back that there is no "definitive answer" on the legality of toting dildos into classrooms because two portions of relevant state law make the offense situational: "lacks serious, literary, artistic, political and scientific value" and "is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended." "Tell the students to ask if anyone is offended," Linzer wrote. "A cop would make a fool of himself (by issuing a citation) and I doubt that the Travis County DA would prosecute." Our attempt to elicit comment from Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney, ran aground. By email, she said her office only prosecutes felony charges. To get a fix on misdemeanor prosecutions such as citations for dildo possession, Lehmberg suggested we reach out to the city’s municipal courts. There, we were unable to identify anyone who could speak to charges leveled for wielding dildos on campus. Our ruling Cocks Not Glocks said students would get citations for taking dildos to class. Texas obscenity law allows citations to be issued to dildo toters provided the dildo is displayed and the person doing so is reckless about who could be offended and the display lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. That said, we failed to identify any instance of such a ticket being issued nor did UT officials say it was likely to happen--which leaves such a citation hypothetical and situational, it seems to us. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-00211	Says congressional candidate Dino Rossi once suggested "the state build homes for unwed mothers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/16/washington-state-democratic-party/did-washington-states-dino-rossi-really-want-new-h/	Say something odd, controversial or outlandish in politics and people will repeat it. Take this recent tweet from the Washington State Democratic Party: "When he was in elected office, Dino Rossi consistently showed disrespect and disregard for women. From suggesting the state build ‘homes for unwed mothers’ that sound out of 'The Handmaid’s Tale' … ." What? That was just one tweet in a thread of many, but it jumped out. Did Rossi, the Republican running for an open congressional seat in a district that extends east from Seattle’s suburbs, really suggest bringing back such a system? The question gains currency when considering that unmarried women account for about 40 percent of all births nationally today, and 32 percent in the state of Washington, according to the federal government’s National Center for Health Statistics. We sought out the quote in its full context to find out, and here’s what we learned. Another time Rossi, a former state senator, made the statement sometime in the 1990s, apparently during an early political run. He was asked to give his views on abortion and said, according to video available on YouTube: "I believe in the sanctity of innocent human life. That’s one of the reasons I voted against Initiative 120." This was a state voter initiative, passed in 1991, that put into Washington state law the right to abortion. Backers said they wanted the initiative in case the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision was ever overturned and states had to decide on the right. "Back 90, 100 years ago, we had options and alternatives," he said. "We had homes for unwed mothers. We had various different avenues, not just saying ‘no’ but giving alternatives. And I see that as the Right to Life movement moving towards that direction, which I think is healthy." What does that have to do with "The Handmaid’s Tale," which the Washington state Democrats mentioned? "The Handmaid’s Tale" is a novel and TV series about women, sexual servitude and forced adoption in a dystopian society. The title of the book by Margaret Atwood has become shorthand for a society that bans abortion and forces fertile women into childbirth. That time and beyond Homes for unwed mothers housed unmarried pregnant women in an era marked by scorn toward such pregnancies and stigma toward single parenthood. The homes had ties to adoption organizations, and when the mothers returned to their real homes, it was often to a hush-hush, childless life. In the years between 1945 and 1973, 1.5 million babies were "surrendered" in homes like this, said Ann Fessler, author of the book "The Girls Who Went Away," a history of the women who surrendered children for adoption in the decades before the Roe vs. Wade decision. "The social pressures of that time left women, especially middle class women, with very few options -- for most, no other option," she told us in an email. "To make a choice, you need options." Homes for unwed mothers largely disappeared in the 1970s, but a different kind of maternity group home gained popularity a few decades later and still exists. This model says it offers support, not coercion. Heartbeat International, a network of pro-life pregnancy support organizations, has about 100 homes across the country, and there are about 400 maternity homes nationwide counting all sponsor groups, said Andrea Trudden, spokeswoman for Heartbeat International. Some women come to the homes because they lack support from families, have abusive situations, are homeless or just need other help, but women come for a variety of other reasons, too, she said. How many women at today’s homes give up their babies for adoption? There do not appear to be solid statistics, and the modern homes -- many with direct links to the anti-abortion movement and ties with adoption agencies -- have skeptics as well. But we asked Mary Peterson, facilitator at the National Maternity Housing Coalition, which helps coordinate and train staff under Heartbeat’s umbrella. She said she’d guess only about 10 percent. "Most of the women are choosing to parent now," she said. What he meant Rossi, who has run for governor twice and U.S. Senate once, did not say he wanted to bring back the old-style homes. He did not say he didn’t, either, at least on the video in the public realm. But the video cuts off after his controversial comment and doesn’t appear to include the entire conversation. What exactly did Rossi mean, then? Did he really think it would "be healthy," as he said, to move back in the direction of the homes that existed 90 and 100 years ago, the homes that he specifically mentioned? His critics in Washington state have said so repeatedly. Sometimes the statement comes back to mock him, such as at a 2008 political event when Peggy Platt, a now-deceased Seattle comedian, said Rossi supported choice -- but only two: "abstinence, or a home for unwed mothers." A Nexis search of news articles shows no further explanation, with a campaign spokeswoman in his 2004 gubernatorial race telling a reporter that voters had more important issues to consider since "the governor doesn’t have a lot to do with this issue." Katie Rodihan, spokeswoman for his current political opponent, Democrat Kim Schrier, said in an email that Rossi "actively tries to avoid talking about social issues -- we must rely on the statements he has given in the past, such as the one in that video." What his campaign says So we asked Rossi’s campaign, and this is what spokesman Andrew Bell said in an email: "Dino hasn’t suggested that the state build anything of the sort. 20+ years ago he discussed historical examples without advocating that we go back to them—the point was providing pregnant women the option and ability of choosing alternatives to abortion. This is just a decades old, out of context attack." He added, "Dino has never advocated for the state to build homes for unwed mothers, and the short edited clip that I’ve seen clearly is in the context of providing choices to mothers, not forcing anyone into a home." Our ruling The Washington State Democratic Party said in a tweet that Rossi suggested the state build "homes for unwed mothers, which sounds right out of "The Handmaid’s Tale." It is true that Rossi wants to ban abortion except in cases of incest or rape or where the mother's life is at risk. But he did not actually suggest the state build homes for unwed mothers. He sympathetically spoke of them as an example of options from years ago, and said, "I see that as the Right to Life movement moving towards that direction, which I think is healthy." While Rossi’s critics speculate he means the direction of "The Handmaid’s Tale," his campaign says they have taken his comment out of context. The tweet had an element of truth but, just like Rossi’s statement, requires a lot of context to understand. Those are the very conditions under which we rule a claim Half True.

pomt-06730	Says the national debt and President Barack Obama's "refusal to control spending led to our nation's credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-national-debt-spending-under-obama/	A video posted on Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign website portrays the U.S. economy under President Barack Obama as deeply troubled. In addition to citing the nation’s housing and unemployment problems, the video's narrator states: "Record debt and the president's refusal to control spending led to our nation's credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history." For this article, we’re going to assess whether the recent downgrade was really unprecedented and whether Perry accurately recounted the factors behind it. Perry's video surely refers to Standard & Poor's Aug. 5 announcement that it had lowered its credit rating of U.S. long-term debt one notch from the top-rated AAA to AA+. S&P is one of the three major U.S. credit-rating agencies, which assess the riskiness of bonds issued by companies and governments. The agencies' ratings are designed to reflect the ability of the borrower (bond issuer) to repay its loans (the bonds). The other two major U.S. agencies, Moody's and Fitch, have not followed S&P's lead, maintaining the United States' top credit rating. Numerous news reports about the Aug. 5 downgrade described it as a "first" in history. We checked with the three major agencies. S&P told us that the U.S. had held its AAA rating since 1941, when the firm was created in a merger. Fitch said that it first assigned a credit rating to the U.S. in 1994 and that it has always been AAA. We didn't hear back from Moody’s, but several recent news articles have reported that it has assigned the U.S. government its highest rating since it began evaluating the country's debt in 1917. Interestingly, however, we learned in an Aug. 10 policy paper from the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that a small credit-rating agency based in Pennsylvania, Egan-Jones, downgraded the United States in mid-July. A couple of weeks later, "S&P followed suit, becoming the first major certified agency to downgrade U.S. long-term debt securities," the paper says. Also, according to our search of news reports, a rating agency in China, Dagong, downgraded its U.S. rating from in November and then again this month. The Egan-Jones downgrade came amid the tumultuous debate in Washington over raising the U.S. debt ceiling, the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. After hitting the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling in May, the U.S. Treasury Department said that it juggled accounts to buy time for further negotiations but that action was needed by Aug. 2. In its analysis, Egan-Jones said its downgrade was not related to the "delay in raising the debt ceiling but rather our concern about the high level" of the nation’s debt. The firm also cited the government's "difficulty in significantly cutting spending." It did not mention Obama. S&P’s downgrade followed by three days Obama's signing of a proposal enacting an agreement between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress to increase the debt ceiling while also reducing budget deficits. The deal, agreed upon two days before the Aug. 2 deadline, followed heated debate that was centered on whether deficits should be lowered solely through spending cuts, as advocated by Republican leaders, or through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, as urged by Obama. The final plan, which was intended to slow the growth of the nation’s debt, does not contain measures that raise revenue. About $900 billion in spending cuts were implemented with the passage of the bill. Additional cuts will be determined by a committee made up of 12 members of the House and the Senate, with six members from each party. Its goal is to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over fiscal years 2012 to 2021. It must recommend cuts by Nov. 23. It also could recommend revenue increases. The law enables Obama to seek an initial increase in the debt limit of $400 billion, with the possibility of two additional increases, for a total of $2.4 trillion. S&P’s Aug. 5 report explaining its downgrade presents two main reasons. One is that the size of the U.S. debt is very large and growing. And, the report says, the deal struck this summer doesn’t go far enough in controlling that growth. The deficit-reduction plan "falls short of the amount that we believe is necessary to stabilize the general government debt burden by the middle of the decade," the report says. S&P's second major reason is its view that politicians seem unable to agree on what steps to take to lower debt levels — typically measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the nation. S&P's report called the political process "contentious and fitful" and said the firm was "pessimistic" that the White House and Congress would be able to agree on measures to significantly reduce the debt soon. As noted in two PolitiFact Ohio fact-checks, S&P’s report criticizes both parties, but does not apportion blame or indicate which should bear more responsibility. Nor does the report name individuals. Also, it does not advocate specific steps to cut the deficit. So, S&P didn’t single out Obama in its rationale for the downgrade. Then how much is he to blame for the nation’s debt levels — the first of the ratings agency’s cited factors? That question is debated. Analysts Bill Hassiepen of Egan-Jones and Jason Peuquet of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us in interviews that both parties have contributed to the nation’s fiscal situation. Hassiepen said it's true that the debt has ballooned during the Obama administration but it also grew during the two-term presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. In dollar terms, gross national debt — made up of debt held by the public and debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security — increased about $5 trillion during Bush's eight years as president and rose by nearly $4 trillion in the first two years and seven months of Obama's presidency. Total debt as a percentage of GDP also jumped under both presidents, rising from 56.4 percent at the end of fiscal 2001 to 69.4 percent in 2008, 84.2 percent in 2009 (a fiscal year shared by Bush and Obama) and 93.2 percent in 2010. In a fact-check examining the increase in the national debt under Obama, PolitiFact New Jersey cited an April 2011 report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative that analyzed the difference in the CBO's projections of publicly held debt — the largest chunk of the total national debt — and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of the growth in publicly-held debt — expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product — resulted from new laws, some of which came to be under Bush. The report said tax cuts enacted under Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the 2009 stimulus legislation, signed into law by Obama, are three of the five "most significant legislative drivers" of the debt. But it also notes that "no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible" for the increase. Experts also point to the recent economic downturn as a factor in the growth of the debt. We asked Perry’s campaign for additional information about the statement in the video but didn’t hear back. So, where does that leave his statement? Some of it checks out. First, as far as we can tell, the recent downgrades of U.S. debt were historic. Second, Perry is correct that the nation's rising debt level was a major factor in the rating agencies' decision. However, the statement's focus on spending under Obama overlooks the fact that increases also occurred under Bush. And finally, Perry's claim ignores the primary factor cited by S&P for its downgrade, the political divisiveness in Washington that has sapped the firm's confidence that the United States will soon reach a consensus on tackling its debt problems. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-08-30T06:00:00	2011-08-13	['None']

pomt-00688	"There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/05/ben-carson/more-black-men-criminal-justice-system-college-pre/	Ben Carson -- who along with fellow Republicans Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee announced their candidacies for president this week -- made a provocative claim about young black men during a speech in Milwaukee on April 22, 2015.. Keynoting a fundraiser for an organization that tutors inner-city children, the retired Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon told the audience how schools and a strong mother helped lift him from poverty and brushes with crime. "Many have said the young black male in America is an endangered species. Why do they say that?" Carson continued. "Because of the high homicide rate, particularly in our large, inner cities; because there are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education." Are there more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in college? Previous factcheck To back Carson’s statement, a spokeswoman for his presidential exploratory committee initially cited a December 2014 factcheck from PolitiFact Rhode Island that touched on the first part of Carson’s statement. That factcheck was on a claim that there were more African-American men in prison or jail, or on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850. Our colleagues rated it True. But that rating doesn’t help Carson’s claim, given that the figures pertained to all adult black males in the criminal justice system, rather than young ones. When we contacted the spokeswoman again, she cited statistics for black males ages 18 to 24, which would correspond to young black males in college. The statistics cited for involvement in the criminal justice system are from a U.S. Department of Justice report on arrests in 2010. But that report counted the number of arrests of black people, not the number of black people arrested. Some people, of course, get arrested more than once in a year. Aside from that, there’s also an issue with using arrests as a definition for being involved in the criminal justice system. There’s no dispute that someone who is in jail or prison, or is on probation or parole, is involved in the system. But many arrests go away without any criminal charges being filed. And not all charges result in convictions. "Involvement in the criminal justice system is usually defined as being in prison or jail or being on probation, parole, or pretrial supervision," Craig Prins, research director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told us. "Even under that standard definition, it’s very difficult to say with certainty how these numbers stack up because the data rarely identify offenders across all three variables of age, race, and sex." Indeed, as we’ll see, the federal government does not produce many criminal justice statistics that count black males ages 18 to 24. Criminal justice system We contacted the Department of Justice about Carson’s claim and were referred to several reports for the latest figures. Arrests: There were nearly 3 million arrests of black adults in 2012. (And again, that’s a count of arrests, not people.) But there is no breakdown for black males ages 18 to 24. Prison inmates: There were 526,000 black males in state and federal prisons in 2013. About 14.3 percent, or roughly 75,000, were between the ages of 18 and 24. Jail inmates: There were 261,500 black people in local jails in mid-2013. But there was no breakdown for the 18 to 24 age group. Probation and parole: More than 4.75 million adults of all races were on probation, parole, or some other type of supervision in 2013. But no breakdown by age is available. So, there is only one solid figure -- 75,000 black males ages 18 to 24 in prison. We’re not aware of any recent counts of the black males in that age group who were arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at a particular time. Higher education The higher education part of Carson’s claim is easier to sort out. The U.S. Census Bureau counts by race and with age breakdowns the number of people enrolled in school. For higher education, that includes full- and part-time students in universities and colleges, technical colleges and other institutions that award two-year degrees, and professional schools such as law schools that award advanced degrees. The latest figures, for 2013, show there were 690,000 males in college, ages 18 to 24, who listed black as their race. The number grows to 779,000 if you include males who identified themselves as black and some other race, such as Asian. Our rating Carson stated: "There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education," later saying he was referring to the 18 to 24 age group. Carson did not provide evidence that backs his claim. The latest federal figures we found show 75,000 black males in that age group who were in prison in 2013 and in the range of 690,000 to 779,000 who were in college. We are not aware of any recent figures for the number of black males ages 18 to 24 arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at any particular time. If figures do surface, we’ll re-evaluate this item, but we rate Carson’s claim False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-14509	"Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ... There are 20,000 or 30,000 (ISIS fighters). The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/22/bill-maher/comedian-bill-maher-says-isiss-army-outnumbered-su/	Comedian and social commentator Bill Maher, in a Feb. 10 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, wanted to know why the terrorist group ISIS is doing so well in the Middle East when so many nearby countries with big militaries want it gone. "Why don't they fight their own battles? Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ISIS isn't 10 feet tall. There are 20,000 or 30,000 of them. The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people. So why do we have to be the ones leading the fight? Or be in the fight at all?" We were wondering if Maher's numbers were correct and Islamic State fighters are potentially outgunned by as much as 250 to 1 in the region. ISIS size In the past, we've found reliable estimates of the strength of ISIS, also known as ISIL, are hard to come by. United States intelligence data from May to August of 2014 put the number at 20,000 to 31,500 fighters. Media reports at the time, based on unnamed sources, put the number at anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000. Maher’s spokesman, Adam Schiff, said the comedian was going by that widely available U.S. estimate. The latest U.S. estimate is 19,000 to 25,000 released by the White House on Feb. 4. The Obama administration contends that the fight against ISIS has brought the number down. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the numbers show ISIS is finding it increasingly harder to find replacements for the thousands of fighters who have been killed. So Maher is still in the ballpark. Surrounding militaries But what about the militaries surrounding ISIS? We turned to the World Bank's website and its tally of armed forces personnel in various countries. The most recent counts listed are for the year 2013. The website says its source is "The Military Balance," published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. If you consider the countries bordering Iraq and Syria — Iran (with 563,000 armed forces personnel), Jordan (115,500), Kuwait (22,600), Lebanon (80,000), Saudi Arabia (251,500) and Turkey (612,800) — you get a total of 1.6 million. Add in Iraq (177,600) and Syria (178,000) themselves and that brings the total to 2 million. That's less than half of Maher’s figure. When we heard back from Maher's spokesman, he said the comedian was also including the armies of Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He's obviously using a broader definition of "surrounding" countries. Oman is about 560 miles from its closest border with Iraq. Putting that aside, if you add those five additional states into the mix, you're still 2 million soldiers shy of the 5 million cited by Maher. Schiff said Maher was relying on numbers from Wikipedia, specifically the "List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel" page. It lists the 2014 edition of "The Military Balance" as the source. Maher took the totals for those 13 countries and came up with 4.95 million. We wondered how both Wikipedia and the World Bank could cite the same data source and still be so far apart. The difference comes down to reservists. The World Bank total includes both military and paramilitary personnel on active duty serving full time. The totals on the Wikipedia page add in reserve forces who are not active military but are available for mobilization if necessary. If they're included as part of a country's army, the total for those 13 countries Maher wants to include rises to 4.95 million, as Maher said. If you don't include the reservists, the number of troops in the countries cited by the comedian only rises to 3.6 million. It all boils down to two questions. First, whether five countries cited by Maher, none of which share a border with Iraq and Syria, should be considered "surrounding" countries. Second, whether reservists should be considered part of a country's army. On that point, we will note that about half of the U.S. troops in Iraq in 2005 were reservists. All of the countries Maher is counting except Syria and Iran (which are waging their own efforts against ISIS) are part of a 66-country coalition that has pledged to eliminate the threat posed by the terrorist group. However, some may be doing little more than letting the United States use their country as a staging point for airstrikes. Surrounding countries have not played a major role in the campaign. Michael Desch, co-director of the international security program at the University of Notre Dame, said the Arab states either have inept armies or are preoccupied with domestic threats (or both). In addition, counter-insurgency operations typically require 10 to 20 as many troops to succeed. "Given all that, it is no mystery ISIS has proven to be a tough nut to crack despite its relatively small numbers," he said. Our ruling Maher said, "There are 20,000 or 30,000 (ISIS fighters). The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people." Maher based his ISIS estimate on a widely reported estimate, though the White House has downgraded the official estimate a bit. It’s Maher’s tally of surrounding armies that needs more explanation. He's including reservists — not just active military and paramilitary — in his definition of "army." The question of which nations to include as "surrounding" countries is more subjective. Maher is folding in five that don't share a border with ISIS' strongholds but nonetheless play key roles in Arab affairs. We think the statement needs that kind of clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bill Maher	None	None	None	2016-02-22T11:29:59	2016-02-10	['None']

pomt-13866	Says she "never received nor sent any material that was marked classified" on her private email server while secretary of state.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/	The results of an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state shredded Clinton’s most oft-recited defense — that she never sent or received information marked classified. Clinton made the case for a year and as recently as Saturday, hours after being interviewed by investigators. "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now," Clinton said July 2, 2016. "I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified." In reality, Clinton has made the same general claim two ways. At a Democratic debate in February, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material." Other times she’s added the qualifier that she never sent material "marked" classified. We previously found that Clinton was spinning what was publicly known about the FBI investigation and Clinton’s emails. We rated her claim Half True. (See an archived version of that fact-check.) Now we know it’s just plain wrong. At PolitiFact, our policy is that we fact-check statements and claims using the information available at the time. That policy stands. But in this case, while the evidence FBI director James B. Comey presented wasn’t available to us, it was available to Clinton through her own emails. She had every opportunity to present an accurate accounting in comments to the public and voters. She did not do that. We think it’s important to make the record abundantly clear. We’ve decided to look at Clinton’s claim again with the information that was available to her when she spoke but only became available publicly July 5. The claim In an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd hours after being interviewed by the FBI, Todd asked Clinton how her practices did not violate federal law. "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now," Clinton responded. "I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified." Comey’s statement directly contradicted that point. FBI investigators reviewed the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014. The investigation found "a very small number" contained classification markings at the time they were sent. The State Department confirmed July 6 that it was aware of two emails that were marked confidential, the lowest level of classification, when they were sent. An aide sent the two emails to Clinton to prepare her for phone calls with foreign leaders, according to the New York Times. State Department spokesman John Kirby said call sheets are often classified when they are prepared. But then at some point before the call is made, someone with the appropriate authority will declassify them. These two call sheets sent to Clinton unnecessarily retained their confidential markings due to human error, Kirby said. Even though just two emails out of many thousands were marked classified at the time they were sent, it’s more than the number Clinton cited: zero. In total, the investigation found 110 emails in 52 email chains containing information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. Eight chains contained top secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 chains contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. Most of these emails, however, did not contain markings clearly delineating their status. Even so, Clinton and her team still should have known the information was not appropriate for an unclassified system, Comey said. "There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation," Comey said of some of the top secret chains. About 2,000 additional emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was first emailed. This is a regular practice when documents are reviewed for release, according to transparency experts. Throughout this saga, Clinton has said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. But Comey said FBI investigators uncovered "several thousand" work-related emails that she had not handed over, and three of those were classified at the time they were sent, though they were not marked as such. Comey added that some work-related emails are still out there, but FBI investigators were unable to find them. It’s possible those emails could contain classified information. The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact they do not know which emails Comey is referring to and reiterated the fact that the State Department has not said any were classified at the time they were sent. The context Some of Clinton’s emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team talking about how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead have to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels. But the FBI investigation found that Clinton sent and received classified information over her private server. Why the disconnect? Experts say the story here is more about the dysfunction of government classification than about how Clinton regularly handled sensitive information. Agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified or not. As the email story has unfolded, the State Department has squabbled with the intelligence community over whether certain emails should be classified today and if it was classified back when it was sent during Clinton’s tenure. "The decision to mark a document is more art than science and leads to bureaucratic in-fighting on whether something should be classified or not," said Gary Bass, Bauman Foundation executive director and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization. Also, transparency advocates say the government regularly classifies more than it needs to. The government classifies incorrectly 70 percent of the time, according to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University said some of the classified material the FBI identified might not be particularly sensitive." There is not a line in any of Mrs. Clinton's emails that meets the smell test of classification, which is their release would be damaging to our national security," he said. Given these concerns, it’s reasonable to give Clinton a little benefit of the doubt regarding how she treated classified information that landed in her inbox unlabeled, said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. "If it had been marked as classified and she or her staff transmitted it through non-secure email anyway, that would have been an overt violation of procedures," Aftergood said. "If it wasn't marked as classified, then it could easily have been handled in good faith as unclassified." Our ruling Clinton said, "I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified." Clinton has made this claim over and over again. An independent FBI investigation has found that to be inaccurate. It’s important to remember that only "a very small number" of her emails, two, were marked classified when they were first sent, and just 110 out of the 30,000 she turned over were classified but unmarked. Evidence seems to indicate that Clinton generally dealt with classified information in an appropriate manner. But over the course of a year, Clinton and her staff have painted a picture of an email setup where absolutely zero classified information slipped through the cracks, case closed. We rate this statement False. Editor's note: The day after we published this fact-check, Comey testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 7. Comey said he believes three emails on Clinton's server contained information labeled classified at the time they were sent. This information was not properly marked in that the emails did not have a classification header, even though a "(c)" immediately preceded text in the body of the emails, designating confidential information. Without the clear classification header, it's reasonable to infer that Clinton did not realize these three emails contained classified information, he said.

pomt-11554	"Just in: 45 states just banned Sharia law"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/08/blog-posting/no-majority-states-did-not-ban-sharia-law/	A story appearing on Facebook repeated talk of Donald Trump’s 2015 proposed ban on Muslim immigrants but went too far in including a claim that the majority of U.S. states have banned Sharia law. "Just in: 45 states just banned Sharia law," said a Feb. 6 headline on viralusa.org. Similar fake stories have circulated for months on various websites proclaiming that many states, or Trump himself, banned Sharia law. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, and financial dealings. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the majority of states have not imposed such a ban. While the headline is a hoax meant to drive page views, some of the quotes in the article related to Trump’s proposed ban are accurate. We have been tracking Trump’s promise "for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims" entering the U.S. and rated his efforts, which have been bogged down in litigation, Stalled. The viralusa.org story that followed the headline makes no mention of states banning Sharia law. Instead, the brief story focused on Trump’s effort to ban Muslims. The story repeated a quote by Trump about the Muslim ban: "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on," he said. The story on viralusa.org didn’t explain the setting when Trump made that quote: he said it at a rally in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Dec. 7, 2015 pointing to a statement he made earlier that day. Viralusa.org then posted the response by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. who said on CNN "you know how you make American great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell." The story also quoted a reply from Ben Carson: "We do not discriminate on people based on religion" -- again, a real quote from CNN. (Graham and Carson were among Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary at the time.) While the vast majority of states haven’t banned Sharia law, 11 states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington -- enacted legislation regarding the application of foreign or religious law in state courts in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. These state laws generally ban the application of foreign laws if it violates a person’s fundamental rights such as freedom of religion or speech. Additionally, Texas adopted a law that requires the Texas Supreme Court to adopt rules and provide judicial instruction regarding the application of foreign laws in certain family law cases. Though most of the laws don’t expressly ban Sharia law, critics say that they could be viewed as anti-Muslim. In reality the practice of using foreign law in state courts is not uncommon and generally not controversial, experts told PolitiFact Florida in 2014. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements. A headline said that "45 states just banned Sharia law," but the story itself contained no information about any such state bans. While there have been some states that have enacted legislation to ban the use of foreign law, at least in some circumstances, it’s a gross exaggeration to say that the majority of states have banned Sharia law.

pomt-05122	Says Josh Mandel’s campaign is under FBI investigation	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/26/workers-voice/workers-voice-says-josh-mandel-faces-fbi-investiga/	Josh Mandel’s campaign is not under FBI investigation. But Democrats, labor unions and their allies keep suggesting the Ohio treasurer is. The latest comes from a "super PAC" affiliated with the AFL-CIO, called Workers’ Voice. The AFL-CIO helped form the political committee and administers it from its headquarters in Washington with donations from member unions and supporters, according to records it filed with the Federal Election Commission as well as press reports. The PAC spends money on political advocacy ads, such as a recent online ad that said that Mandel, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, is under investigation for shady campaign practices. Specifically, Workers’ Voice on June 19 announced it was spending $100,000 for an ad appearing on Cleveland.com (the online home of The Plain Dealer), the Akron Beacon Journal’s website, Google and Twitter. The ad was a spoof on Nike’s ad featuring LeBron James, which carried the theme, "We are all witnesses." The anti-Mandel ad’s title was, "Witness the Mandel investigation." This was a reference to an investigation of donations that employees of a North Canton direct marketing company made to Mandel’s campaign to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat. The ad says people should ask that Mandel "come clean on campaign cash," and the ad asks: "When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?" The problem here? Mandel’s campaign is not being investigated by the FBI. The FBI specifically told us this. Rather, the FBI is investigating employees of Suarez Corporation Industries who gave donations to Mandel totaling $105,000, and to U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. PolitiFact Ohio separately addressed the same claim when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made it against Renacci, and ruled it was False. The size, number and timing of donations to Mandel from Suarez employees on June 2, 2011, caught the attention of Democrats and reporters last summer. They wondered whether the employees could really afford the donations and if the employer had actually supplied the money and used his workers to hide that fact. If so, it would violate federal campaign finance laws that limit the size of donations and require the true identity of each donor. Suarez and his employees have denied wrongdoing. The Toledo Blade first reported on the contributions in August 2011. Facing ongoing criticism from Democrats, Mandel in May returned the donations, citing an abundance of caution. Critics say Mandel’s campaign should have suspected the donors might be in violation of the law when it first received the checks. That’s an assertion of judgment. PolitiFact Ohio is interested in assertion of fact. Is Mandel under FBI investigation? "No," Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of the FBI’s Canton office, told us on June 21. "He is not and he has not been. What we’re looking at is contributions to both campaigns from employees of the Suarez Corporation. Neither the Mandel campaign nor the Renacci campaign are under investigation." Brown, the incumbent senator, came close to making the same claim as in the Workers’ Voice ad, but he caught and seemingly corrected himself. In an interview with Findlay, Ohio, radio station WFIN-AM on June 21, Brown said of Mandel: "He is under FBI investigation," then quickly added, "or his campaign contributions are under FBI investigation." Even that milder assertion suggests Mandel is implicated. But you could tie yourself up in knots over Brown’s phrasing, whereas Workers’ Voice left no room for even that. While the ad states in one part that the FBI is investigating donations to the Mandel campaign, it then asks: "When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?" And it had the title, "Witness the Mandel investigation." We sent AFL-CIO spokesman Michael Gillis an email to ask about the wording. He replied, "Any contribution includes a contributor and a recipient. Josh Mandel’s campaign was the recipient, and is therefore being investigated by the FBI as a party in that transaction." The FBI presumably knows whom or what it is investigating, and was clear on this. It is not investigating Mandel. To say otherwise is False.

pomt-14796	"Here’s the simple and undeniable fact: The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/01/ted-cruz/are-overwhelming-majority-violent-criminals-democr/	During an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said most violent criminals are Democrats. It came after Hewitt brought up the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic that left three dead and nine injured in Colorado Springs, Colo., over Thanksgiving weekend. Hewitt told Cruz that he’d been doing anti-abortion events for 25 years and had never met "a single pro-life activist who is in favor of violence of any sort." Cruz agreed. "And I would note that this whole episode has really displayed the ugly underbelly of the media," Cruz said. "You know, every time you have some sort of violent crime or mass killing, you can almost see the media salivating, hoping, hoping desperately that the murderer happens to be a Republican, so they can use it to try to paint their political enemies. Now listen, here’s the simple and undeniable fact. The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats. The media doesn’t report that." We received dozens of emails from readers asking us to check the claim, so we took a closer look. We queried the Cruz campaign, but didn’t hear back. CNN reported that Cruz’s campaign, when asked, cited research by two academics, Marc Meredith, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Michael Morse, then of Stanford University. They published a paper in the January 2014 edition of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science titled, "Do Voting Rights Notification Laws Increase Ex-Felon Turnout?" (After we published our item, Cruz defended the statement to ABC News on the basis of that study.) The paper looked at the policy in some states of notifying newly released inmates about their ability to re-register to vote. The authors looked at data from New Mexico, New York and North Carolina and concluded that notification laws do not significantly increase rates of registration or voting among ex-felons. Cruz’s claim relies not on the general thrust of the paper but on some of the data contained within it. For instance, in New York, about one-third of felons released from prison registered to vote after their release. Of those, about 62 percent registered as Democrats and 9 percent registered as Republicans, with 26 percent registering as independents or with other parties. In North Carolina, about a quarter of those who were released registered after their release. Of those, 52 percent registered as Democrats, 19 percent as Republicans and 22 percent as independents or with other parties. And in New Mexico, 41 percent of those who were released registered to vote. Of those, 55 percent registered as Democrats, 10 percent as Republicans and 18 percent as independents or with other parties. So Cruz’s statement has some grounding in the research. But it significantly oversimplifies the case -- and introduces some inaccuracies. "Cruz is misinterpreting our research," the authors told PolitiFact. Here’s a rundown of factors that should give anyone pause: • "Violent" vs. "nonviolent." Cruz said that "the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats." But the paper didn’t break down their pool of ex-felons into those who had been incarcerated for violent offenses and those who had been incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. So the paper contains no support for this portion of Cruz’s claim. • A small sample of states. The paper focuses on three states out of 50, and the authors say it’s wrong to generalize from this small sample. In fact, in another academic paper, the same authors found that in Iowa, Maine and Rhode Island, the most common registration for discharged felons was not to affiliate with any party. "Ex-felons’ partisan affiliations vary across states, and we don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that the national ex-felon population is ‘overwhelmingly Democratic,’ at least in terms of party registration," the authors told us. • The paper studied "ex-felons," not "criminals." Cruz’s statement makes it sound as if Democrats are committing crimes. That’s not what the paper measured. Rather, the paper found that once felons are released from prison, they are likelier to register as Democrats. The data in the paper doesn’t speak to whether they were Democrats (registered or otherwise) when committing crimes. • The study doesn’t address ex-felons who don’t register to vote. Half to two-thirds of the voters in these states didn’t register to vote. • It’s hard to separate these figures from overall demographics. It’s no secret that, statistically, African-Americans are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. It’s also no secret that African-Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic. Put these two together and it’s not surprising to find higher percentages of Democratic registrations among ex-felons. Indeed, in a 2010 paper -- "Did Disfranchisement Laws Help Elect President Bush? New Evidence on the Turnout Rates and Candidate Preferences of Florida’s Ex-Felons" -- Traci Burch of Northwestern University found that African-American ex-felons did overwhelmingly register as Democrats. But the paper also found that white ex-felons did not follow the same pattern. Meredith and Morse said they have looked at updates of the data Birch studied and found that while African-American ex-felons still overwhelmingly identify as Democratic, non-African-Americans were only slightly more likely to identify as a Democrat than as a Republican. • Correlation is not necessarily causation. As we indicated above, it could be that high Democratic registration rates are inevitable results of a criminal justice system stacked against African-Americans. It's even possible that inmates’ experience in prison could "turn" an ex-felon Democratic. Perhaps ex-felons simply don’t like what they see as the Republican approach to criminal-justice policy. The bottom line is, despite Cruz’s belief that this is a "simple and undeniable fact," there are enough asterisks with this statement to make it anything but. Our ruling Cruz said, "Here’s the simple and undeniable fact: The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats." Research cited by the Cruz campaign supports the claim that, in at least three states, felons released from prison go on to register as Democrats at a disproportionately high rate following their release. However, there are important caveats. The study in question looked at both violent and nonviolent felons without separating out those two groups. It’s not clear whether the patterns holds in the other 47 states. Also, the study didn’t look at active "criminals" but rather those who had already served their time. Finally, it’s hard to draw a line between cause and effect, particularly given the disproportionately high population of African-Americans -- a traditionally Democratic group -- in the criminal justice system.

pomt-07595	On whether the United States should intervene in Libya.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-accused-flip-flop-libyan-no-fly-zone/	United States involvement in establishing a "no-fly" zone over Libya has prompted widespread commentary among politicians and pundits -- not all of it consistent. Yesterday, we looked at whether President Barack Obama had flip-flopped between a principle for U.S. military interventions laid down in 2007 when he was a presidential candidate, and actions he took this year, when he mobilized U.S. forces to implement a United Nations-backed no-fly zone targeting Libya’s long-serving dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Now, we’ll look at one of the candidates who may challenge Obama for the presidency in 2012 -- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Seemingly contradictory comments by Gingrich about the wisdom of imposing a no-fly zone prompted a flurry of commentary on the Internet and on cable news shows. It got to the point where Gingrich felt he needed to address his apparent rhetorical contradiction in a Facebook post titled, "My position on Libya." First, we’ll look at the two comments that drove the questions about Gingrich’s stance. The first comment came during a March 7, 2011, interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. Here’s an excerpt. Van Susteren: "First let me ask you about Libya. It's in the news. The president has said that military options with NATO are not off the table. What would you do about Libya?" Gingrich: "Exercise a no-fly zone this evening, communicate to the Libyan military that Gadhafi was gone and that the sooner they switch sides, the more like they were to survive, provided help to the rebels to replace him. I mean, the idea that we're confused about a man who has been an anti-American dictator since 1969 just tells you how inept this administration is. They were very quick to jump on Mubarak, who was their ally for 30 years, and they were confused about getting rid of Gadhafi. This is a moment to get rid of him. Do it. Get it over with. … "All we have to say is that we think that slaughtering your own citizens is unacceptable and that we're intervening. And we don't have to send troops. All we have to do is suppress his air force, which we could do in minutes. And then we have to say publicly that he is gone, that the military should switch sides now, and we should help the rebels. And if that means getting them weapons or whatever it means, the fact that there's no more Libyan air power and the fact that the United States has publicly come out for decisively replacing him, I suspect the military will dump him." Now let’s look at the second comment that attracted attention. It was made during a March 23, 2011, interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show. Lauer: "Do you think Moammar Gadhafi has to go as a result of this military intervention?" Gingrich: "I think that now -- let me draw a distinction. I would not have intervened. I think there were a lot of other ways to affect Gadhafi. I think there are a lot of allies in the region that we could have worked with. I would not have used American and European forces, bombing Arab and that country." In the blogosphere, critics on both the left and the right charged that Gingrich had flip-flopped. The liberal blog ThinkProgress wrote that "there is no other reasonable explanation for Gingrich’s complete flip-flop" than "opportunism and news media publicity." At the conservative blog site Hot Air, the anonymous AllahPundit suggested that Gingrich’s comments amounted to a flip-flop and asked, "Is this anti-Obama pandering or just a big misunderstanding?" We won’t address whether Gingrich’s position in either interview was accurate or justified. We’ll only look at whether Gingrich changed his position between March 7 and March 23, and if so, whether any extenuating circumstances can help explain his shift. In his March 23, 2011, Facebook post, Gingrich dismissed the notion that he had flip-flopped, arguing that the apparent contradictory positions in the two interviews were actually consistent. Gingrich’s argument hinges on a difference between what he would have liked to have done in theory, and what he felt he had to do given the actions Obama took. The key moment for Gingrich came on March 3, 2011, when Obama declared that Gadhafi had to go. "Going forward," Obama said, "we will continue to send a clear message: The violence must stop. Moammar Gadhafi has lost the legitimacy to lead, and he must leave. Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable. And the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom, democracy and dignity must be met." Gingrich said in his Facebook post that prior to the March 3 statement "there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without United States military forces. … The president, however, took those options off the table with his public statement. From the moment of the president’s declaration, he put the prestige and authority of the United States on the line. After March 3, anything short of a successful, public campaign for regime change would have been seen as a defeat for the United States. "That’s why during a March 7th Greta van Susteren interview, I asserted that the president should establish a no-fly zone ‘this evening.’ After March 3rd, the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone, while also making it clear the U.S. would welcome involvement from other nations." Gingrich concluded the post by reinforcing his support for the mission. "Now that we have U.S. forces engaged, any result less than the removal of Gadhafi from power will be considered a defeat," he said. "For that reason, I believe we must support the mission and see it through." Gingrich has not persuaded us that his comments were consistent. The best evidence supporting Gingrich’s explanation is that he did raise some of the themes from his Facebook post during the interview with Today. Gingrich reminded Lauer that "the president said on March 3rd Gadhafi has to go," and he raised the possibility that a failure could be harmful to the United States’ standing. "Having decided to go there, if Gadhafi does not leave power it will be a defeat for the United States," Gingrich told Lauer. "It will lengthen our engagement, it will increase our costs." However, if Gingrich’s position is that he was making two separate arguments -- a hypothetical one about what he would have done prior to Obama’s March 3 statement, and a practical one about what he would do once the U.S. had crossed the Rubicon of advocating Gadhafi’s ouster -- he didn’t do a very clear job of explaining himself. In neither interview did he frame the arguments in that fashion. So we think it’s reasonable for viewers to conclude that he’d flip-flopped on the issue of imposing a no-fly zone. So where does this leave us? Gingrich has a point that Obama’s March 3 declaration about Gadhafi had consequences, and if Gingrich had provided that context of his thinking in both interviews, he could have made a reasonable argument that the two statements were consistent. However, Gingrich didn’t clarify his comments in that way until after he started taking heat for having flip-flopped. Because he didn’t, we give him a Full Flop.

pomt-07222	We are looking at "150,000 barrels (of oil) per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after" because of the moratorium on new drilling enacted by the Obama administration.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/03/sarah-palin/palin-claims-gulf-oil-drilling-moratorium-responsi/	In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren on board her "One Nation" bus tour, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin took a shot at President Barack Obama's decision to place a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. "We cannot keep going with the flow, as we have been with a moratorium in the gulf," the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in the May 31, 2011, interview. "And then we're told by the White House there really isn't a moratorium. Yes, there is. The impacts of that moratorium, where 97 percent of our offshore has been locked up...what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after, because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf. They moved out. "So we're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the Gulf." We are going to break her statement into two fact checks. In a separate item, we looked at Palin's claim that the moratorium will mean that oil imports will cost the United States $8 billion a day. Here, we'll deal with the first part, Palin's claim -- that "what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after, because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf." Palin's political action campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the figures she used. Palin's numbers are pretty close to the official projections from the government's Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that keeps track of energy statistics. According to the EIA's short-term energy outlook report from May 2011, crude oil production from the Gulf of Mexico (Table 4a.) is projected to go from 1.64 million barrels a day in 2010; to 1.51 million barrels a day in 2011; and down to 1.32 million barrels a day in 2012. In other words, oil production from the gulf is projected to dip by 130,000 barrels a day this year; and another 190,000 barrels a day in 2012. So Palin's numbers were a little high, but in the ballpark. The bigger problem, however, is that Palin attributes the drop entirely to the moratorium. That's part of it, said Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the EIA, but "the factors behind the decline are not simply a matter of the moratorium." It's also due to a natural decline in production from existing wells, he said. In its May 10, 2011, report, the EIA spells out that the decline is "because of production declines from existing fields and the impact of last year's drilling moratorium and the subsequent delay in issuing new drilling permits." So how much of the drop can be attributed to the moratorium and how much to natural production declines from existing fields? The report doesn't say, but we think a similar EIA report from April 2010 (Table 4a) -- before the oil spill -- puts the issue into some perspective. Then, the EIA projected oil production from the Gulf of Mexico would drop by 100,000 barrels a day between 2010 and 2011. In other words, even before the oil spill and ensuing moratorium, the EIA expected a drop in oil production from the Gulf of Mexico. After the moratorium, the projected drop went from 100,000 barrels to 130,000 barrels a day. Since most of the forecast decline predates the oil spill and the moratorium, it is misleading to attribute it entirely to the moratorium. And so we rate Palin's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07751	Claims Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said: "It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/ed-garvey/activist-ed-garvey-says-wisconsin-senate-majority-/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker insists that the purpose of his budget-repair bill, which has become the focus of national debate, is to erase state budget deficits that are projected to exceed $3 billion by 2013. But some of his critics seem certain that what Walker and other Republican leaders really want is to get rid of public employee unions entirely. State Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) went so far as to say, like Hitler, the governor was abolishing unions. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire. But what if one of the GOP leaders actually did say that the true aim is to get rid of unions? Just such a bombshell was dropped Feb. 21, 2011 by Madison lawyer Ed Garvey, a former Democratic nominee for governor and U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. In a Capital Times opinion column about Walker’s bill, Garvey attributed this quote to one of the state’s top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald: "It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets." Garvey’s column, which was republished the next day on FightingBob.com, an opinion website run by Garvey, reported the statement as a direct quote from the Juneau lawmaker. If the quote is accurate, it would be a potentially explosive development in the stalemate over Walker’s budget-repair bill. Before we go further, let’s be clear about the Walker bill in terms of how it would affect public employee unions. We’ll rely on a breakdown we provided in a previous PolitiFact item. The bill eliminates all collective bargaining rights for thousands of public employees. For a much larger group -- including schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state workers -- collective bargaining could be done only for pay (and negotiated raises would be limited to inflation). Only state troopers and local police and fire employees would be exempted. The bill, of course, does not affect private-sector unions. Walker has argued the collective bargaining changes are needed not just for the short-term budget, but for future budgets at the state and local level -- to give local units of government flexibility in cutting costs. Union leaders say they are an unwarranted attack on public employees. We’re not trying to settle that debate. We’re looking at the quote Garvey attributes to Fitzgerald, that "it is necessary to eliminate unions" to balance future budgets. We called and e-mailed Garvey on Feb. 24 and 25, 2011, asking for the source of the quote he attributed to Fitzgerald. He did not reply. Since he did not reply, we turned elsewhere. Searches of Google and the Nexis database also turned up no such Fitzgerald quote. We put the purported quote directly to Fitzgerald, who said: "I have never said that." So, how does this all shake out? In an opinion column, Garvey attributed this quote to Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald: "It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets." It was a quote that, if accurate, would have gained much public notice. Garvey did not respond to requests for proof that Fitzgerald made the statement; we couldn’t find any; and Fitzgerald denied making such a statement. We rate Garvey’s claim as False. (Editor’s note: Garvey returned our call on Feb. 28, 2011, after this item was posted. He could not cite a source for the purported quotation. He said he heard Fitzgerald make it, perhaps on a cable television talk show. Garvey added: "In any event," he said of the quotation, "it's totally consistent with his position, as I see it.")

pomt-02659	A judge's order means there's a "Constitution exemption zone" if you live "within 100 miles of the United States border."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/13/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-constitution-exemption-zones-ex/	In 2014, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone travelling without a laptop or smartphone, whether it’s professionals toiling over PowerPoint graphs on planes or teenagers scrolling through Instagram in the backseats of cars. So when a reader asked PolitiFact to vet a Facebook post about travelling across U.S. borders with electronics, we were intrigued. "If you live within 100 miles of the United States border, then you're in what is being called, the 'Constitution exemption zone,’ " read the post on a page called World Must Wake Up. "U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ruled that authorities along the U.S border could seize and search laptops, smartphones and other electronic devices without a warrant (direct violation of the Fourth Amendment)." PolitiFact wanted to dig deeper into the notion of a Constitution exemption zone. The page’s creator didn’t respond to our request for comment. The Facebook post referenced a case in the Eastern District of New York, Abidor vs. Napolitano. U.S.-French dual citizen Pascal Abidor had his laptop searched and confiscated crossing into the United States from Canada. His laptop was returned 11 days later, when he found evidence that his personal files were searched. On Dec. 31, a federal judge dismissed the case, which followed a trend of previous cases regarding electronic privacy at U.S. borders. We learned that the loose rules for border searchers the post mentioned didn’t start here, or in the digital age at all. The history of border searches Loose search regulations at the border are old news. Really old news. In 1789, the First Congress passed an exception for border searches that authorized federal officials to search people crossing the border without a warrant issued after proof of probable cause. A couple of years later, the Fourth Amendment became law. That protects citizens from most searches except when a warrant is obtained by proving probable cause. Today, the exception for searches near borders is a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It’s not considered an exception to the Fourth Amendment as a whole, just to the warrant requirement. At an international border or the functional equivalent of one (for example, an inland international airport), officials can search a person and his or her possessions without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. There’s a similar procedure called an extended border search, where almost all the same rules apply. Within 100 miles of an international border, officials can search a person and his or her possessions, but here they have to prove reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause. Now, there’s a reason border officials have historically had more wiggle room to enforce their authority than other federal officials. The government wants to ensure that contraband, like illicit drugs, don’t enter the country. There are consequences for officers who abuse these privileges. "There’s some pretty stiff administration that is taken against the officer and the agency," said Victor Manjarrez, a border security and immigration professor at University of Texas at El Paso. "That’s a potential civil rights violation. It’s not taken lightly at all." Constitution-exempt? The American Civil Liberties Union first coined the term "Constitution-free zones." Historically, the ACLU created the term Constitution-free zones in reference to stops near the border for reasons other than criminal activity, like random inquiries on highways about immigration status. They don’t use that term in relation to inland electronics searches. ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump said the Facebook post on electronic privacy takes their argument (now many years old) out of context. They’ve filed two lawsuits regarding electronic searches at borders, including Abidor vs. Napolitano. "We don’t know of any instances in which the government has taken advantage of this suspicionless electronic device search policy to search people who aren’t at the functional equivalent of the border," Crump said. How technology fits in While the border search exception isn’t new, it’s safe to say technology has evolved over the last few centuries, and that’s what makes the more recent cases distinctive. Before travelers carried phones and laptops, a search of someone’s belongings could only go so far. But technology gives border officials information that reaches far beyond what a person has physical access to. "The notion of these electronic searches is, in and of itself, quite dramatic," said Fred Cate, an Indiana University cybersecurity professor. "Now, if you can search the laptop or the cell phone, you’re probably getting access to all of their emails, all of their business records." Officials can seize electronics and hold them for several days under the law. Of course, individuals and businesses can take precautions to limit or entirely prevent border officials from accessing private data. Manjarrez predicted that the issue would eventually end up in the Supreme Court, but for now electronic searches are here to stay. Our ruling A Facebook post said a judge's order means there's a "Constitution exemption zone" if you live "within 100 miles of the United States border." There is a border search exception, which long predates the district court ruling, that allows officials at or near borders to search people and their possessions without obtaining warrants. Experts say that’s not an exception to the whole Fourth Amendment. It's certainly not an exemption to the entire Constitution, which covers a wide range of rights, like freedom of the press and freedom of religion. The post has an element of truth but takes information out of context and requires a good deal of clarification. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06474	The Department of Energy’s "Billion Ton Study" has shown that wind and solar energy combined "could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/18/herman-cain/cain-says-solar-wind-energy-have-little-potential/	If you want a glimpse of America’s energy future under a Herman Cain administration, look no further than his new book, "This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House." Metro Atlanta’s would-be Republican presidential nominee wrote that we need to drill for oil offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and boost our nuclear energy capabilities. "Let’s face it, wind and solar energy development will not bring us to energy independence," the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO wrote. "Even the Department of Energy’s ‘Billion Ton Study’ has shown that these two sources combined could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs." Do solar and wind energy really have so little potential? We contacted the Cain campaign, which did not respond, so we scoured the U.S. Department of Energy’s "Billion Ton Study," a 2005 report whose official title is "Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry." As you might suspect, it’s about biomass, biological material such as plants or cow manure that can be used to produce energy. Like solar and wind energy, it’s "renewable," or comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished. It does not say what Cain said it did. In fact, the "Billion Ton Study" mentions only solar and wind energy in passing. The crux of the report is to explore whether there’s enough biomass in the U.S. to replace 30 percent or more of the nation’s petroleum use. (Their answer is "yes," assuming that certain policies and technologies are in place.) Now, just because Cain’s claim isn’t backed up by the "Billion Ton Study" doesn’t mean his broader point about solar and wind is wrong. We dug further. We found that under current government energy policies, the futures of solar and wind are limited, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks energy statistics. Unless policies change, by 2035 wind and solar combined will account for 4 percent of U.S. consumption of electricity, or the stuff that runs our TVs or washing machines, their projections show. Solar and wind will account for 2 percent of total U.S. energy consumption in 2035. This includes electricity as well as other forms of energy, such as fuel that powers cars. But these data do not describe what these technologies could do at their best, which was the main point of Cain’s statement. To get a better sense of this, we interviewed energy experts and read federal studies and peer-reviewed research. The scientific consensus is that there is more than enough sunshine and wind to supply the nation’s total energy needs, experts told us, thanks to the wind-swept Great Plains and Texas and sun-baked states such as New Mexico. "I don’t think anybody can contend there isn’t enough. There’s more than enough," said Noam Lior, who has studied solar and other alternative energy technologies and their potential at the University of Pennsylvania. But could it actually happen? Could solar and wind actually provide, say, 10 percent of the nation’s total needs? "It’s not just possible," said Daniel Matisoff, who studies environmental policy at Georgia Tech. "It’s likely." For instance, a 2008 Energy Department report said it’s possible for wind energy to provide 20 percent of the nation’s electricity supply by 2030, with significant upgrades in the nation’s energy grid, policy changes that support the growth of the wind industry, and some wind turbine technology improvements. Electricity, however, makes up only a portion of the nation’s total energy use. The country needs fuel to power its cars and trucks as well. Getting consumers to switch to plug-in electric cars might be tough because of their limited range, said Marilyn A. Brown, a Georgia Tech professor who studies energy policy. There are other big hurdles as well. The wind doesn’t always blow, and sun doesn’t always shine, so the U.S. would need to engineer systems that would keep a steady flow of electricity to homes and businesses. Electricity produced by fossil fuels is often less expensive than wind or solar. And lots of the nation’s wind and solar resources are in remote areas. The country needs to install expensive transmission lines to transport it. All in all, Cain has it wrong on solar and wind energy. The federal government’s "Billion Ton Study" did not say that wind and solar energy combined "could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs." Scientists think solar and wind alone can top 5 percent of the nation’s total needs with policy and infrastructure changes. They could even power the entire nation if the U.S. commits to an energy overhaul, though it would take a lot of resources, time, political will, and possibly some new technologies to get this done.

"IronStache," as he is known, is making his fourth run for public office in six years — arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And he’s taken leave from his job as an ironworker, collecting more than $6 million in campaign contributions along the way. But what about another Democrat running for the House — wealthy Dan Kohl, the nephew of multimillionaire and former 24-year U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl? He is seeking the east-central Wisconsin seat held by Republican Glenn Grothman. In not one, not two, but three TV ads released Sept. 4, 2018, Dan Kohl declares: "I'm not a politician." The National Republican Congressional Committee actually said in ripping one of the ads that Kohl is correct in saying he’s not a politician. But the group, which works to elect Republicans to the House, also cited to us evidence that he is a politician. So, let’s take a look. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. No clear definition As we noted in our Bryce fact check, dictionaries aren’t much help, given how widely the definitions of politician vary: Merriam-Webster Experienced in the art or science of government; especially one actively engaged in conducting the business of a government.

Vocabulary.com Campaigns for or holds a position in government. But the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician. Kohl’s resume Kohl has never held office, and has run only once before. So, that differentiates him from Bryce. But Kohl has been involved in politics, in a more behind-the-scenes way. Here’s more detail on Kohl’s professional life after he earned a law degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1992, based on information from his campaign website; the business networking site LinkedIn; Vote Smart, a website that backgrounds candidates and elected officials; and news accounts: 1992-2006 Works for the Milwaukee Bucks, a National Basketball Association franchise then owned by Herb Kohl. Dan worked in a variety of positions, ultimately serving as assistant general manager. 2008 Defeated in the Democratic primary in a run for a suburban Milwaukee seat in the Wisconsin Assembly. At the time, he was director of new schools development in Wisconsin for the Washington, D.C.-based SEED Foundation, which develops boarding schools for at-risk students. 2009-2012 Vice president of political affairs and political director of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group. According to Kohl’s campaign website, he "oversaw the development of the nation’s largest pro-Israel political action committee." J Street described Kohl as a veteran political activist and fundraiser "with close ties to the senior leadership of the Democratic party." He served as a "bundler" of contributions for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. 2013-2017 Senior adviser and lobbyist at BakerHostetler, a large law and lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. 2017 Settles in Mequon, an upscale suburb of Milwaukee, in May, announces his campaign for Grothman’s seat in June.

pomt-07559	Says that during the first 19 months of the Obama administration, the U.S. detained people from nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism on the southwestern border.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/01/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-us-arrested-people-nations-de/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, came to a committee hearing on homeland security armed with statistics about the nation’s southwestern border. Confronting Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on March 9, Cornyn cited information that he said was from the Border Patrol about people from countries other than Mexico who have been detained near the southwestern border for illegally entering the United States. Cornyn said there were about 45,000 arrests of people from 140 different countries, excluding Mexico, in the 19 months between the start of the 2009 fiscal year — Oct. 1, 2008 — and April 30, 2010. At least four of those nations "have been designated by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism," Cornyn said. "How can you possibly claim that the approach of the administration is working when it comes to border security, in light of these statistics?" He made a similar point the next day while questioning National Intelligence Director James Clapper at another hearing. "Would you agree with me, Director Clapper, that an individual with enough money and enough determination can penetrate our southwestern border and make their way into the United States … and that that does represent a potential terrorist threat to the United States?" Cornyn asked. Clapper’s response: "Yes, sir. I don't — I don't pretend, nor would, I don't think, Secretary Napolitano pretend that, you know, we've got an iron-clad perfect system." We wondered whether Cornyn was right. Did the U.S. Border Patrol arrest people on the Mexico border who were from nations that the U.S. labels state sponsors of terrorism? On the State Department’s website, we found that the only nations currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. "State sponsors of terrorism provide critical support to many non-state terrorist groups," says a 2009 department report on terrorism. "Without state sponsors, these groups would have greater difficulty obtaining the funds, weapons, materials, and secure areas they require to plan and conduct operations." Next, we looked into Border Patrol apprehensions near the southwestern border. We found that nearly all are of Mexican nationals, according to information the agency publishes on its website. In fiscal 2009, their 495,582 arrests accounted for 92 percent of the total. The rest of the apprehensions on the Mexican border are of people from countries other than Mexico. The Border Patrol, which is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the Homeland Security Department, publishes data on how many of those occur — but not by individual country. According to that information, there were 45,283 arrests of individuals from nations other than Mexico in fiscal 2009 and 50,912 in fiscal 2010. (It appears that Cornyn quoted only the fiscal 2009 number during the hearing.) In Homeland Security lingo, an "apprehension" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally. However, the number of people actually detained is smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once, according to a June 2009 fact sheet published by the department’s Office of Immigration Statistics. As support for the senator’s statement during the March 9 hearing, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a chart that he said his office had received from Customs and Border Protection. Unlike the Border Patrol’s published data, this chart lists a country-by-country breakdown of arrests "by citizenship" for illegal entry on the southwestern border during fiscal 2009 and the first seven months of fiscal 2010. That’s the same time period that Cornyn noted at the March 9 hearing. The southwestern border data from Cornyn’s chart show that there were 105 apprehensions of Cubans, 10 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and none of Syrians in fiscal 2009. In the first seven months of 2010, there were 48 apprehensions of Cubans, seven of Iranians, one of Sudanese and two of Syrians. All together, the apprehensions from those four countries represent 0.25 percent of the total arrests of non-Mexicans on the southwestern border over the 19-month period, according to Cornyn’s chart. (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras alone accounted for 84 percent.) Add Mexican nationals to the equation, and the percentage shrinks more: According to the numbers in Cornyn’s chart, apprehensions of people from the "state sponsor of terrorism" nations amounted to 0.02 percent of the 540,865 total arrests on the southwestern border in fiscal 2009. What about the other U.S. border areas? The Border Patrol also apprehends people for illegal entry at the northern border with Canada and in the coastal areas of Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana and other Gulf states. According to 2009 nationwide statistics that we received from the Border Patrol, there were 935 arrests of people from the four "terrorism" nations: 910 of Cubans, 15 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and four of Syrians. Subtract the 121 apprehensions that took place on the southwestern border that year, according to Cornyn’s chart, and that leaves 814 arrests, mostly of Cubans. So, 87 percent of the apprehensions of citizens from terrorism-sponsoring countries occurred away from the southwestern border. We asked the Border Patrol to confirm the information in Cornyn’s chart, but the agency declined. "For operational integrity and intelligence-based targeting, the Border Patrol does not specifically list country of birth to the location of apprehension," Border Patrol spokesman Mark Qualia said. To try to verify that the data were authentic, we asked Cornyn’s office to show us the accompanying e-mail from the agency; Brandewie declined. For a fact-checking outfit, that’s an impasse. However, Border Patrol statistics that the agency either publishes online or confirmed for us lend statistical support to Cornyn’s claim. For instance: The vast majority of apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico occur on the southwestern border, 86 percent in fiscal 2009. So it’s statistically likely that some of the apprehensions of people from countries that sponsor terrorism take place there, too. And while total nationwide Border Patrol apprehensions have dropped 72 percent over the past decade, arrests of people from nations other than Mexico increased 49 percent. Have arrests of people from the "state sponsor of terrorism" nations also gone up? Not as far as we can tell. We asked the Border Patrol for a country-by-country breakdown for fiscal 2005, midway through the Bush administration and one of the peak years for total apprehensions in the past decade, as well as other years. All we received was the data for 2005, when six nations had the "terrorism" label: Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Nationwide in 2005, there were 3,309 apprehensions of people from terrorism-sponsoring countries out of a total of 1,189,000. That compares to the 935 apprehensions in 2009 out of a total of 556,041. In fiscal 2010, the nationwide apprehensions of people from the four terrorism-sponsoring countries dropped again, to 736. What of Cornyn’s larger argument: that the arrests of people from Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria show that the federal government’s approach to security on the southwestern border is not working and that the border is vulnerable to penetration by terrorists crossing illegally? We’re not going to tackle the first point, which is a political bone of contention. We’re also mindful of the logic that any arrests are evidence that border security efforts are working. But we wanted to find out whether there is evidence of would-be terrorists entering the U.S. illegally through Mexico. Matthew Chandler, press secretary for the Homeland Security Department, told us that "at this time, DHS does not have any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the southwest border." Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, echoed that thought in a March 17 Texas Tribune news article, saying that the State Department’s most recent report on terrorism gave no indication that Mexico has become a launch pad for terrorists crossing the border illegally. "I suppose anyone that hates the U.S. would find a way to get in," he told the Tribune. "But so far, most of the cases (of those visitors who have sought to harm the U.S.) have been overstayed visas. They come in through the front door, not the back door." David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute, which studies border-related topics such as the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico on security initiatives, told us that although the U.S. has been arresting people at the border from countries associated with terrorism, that doesn’t necessarily indicate that those individuals were would-be terrorists. But Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, told us that Cornyn’s comments are "spot-on" and that there is reason to be concerned about potential terrorists coming across the southwestern border. As an example, he pointed to a June 3 Stratfor assessment noting that in late May, the Homeland Security Department "issued a lookout to authorities in Texas, warning that … (a) Somali purportedly linked to al Shabaab was believed to be in Mexico and was allegedly planning to attempt to cross the border into the United States." Al Shabaab, an Islamist militant group based in Somalia that has fought the nation’s transitional government for years, has been on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations since early 2008. Where does that leave us? Cornyn’s claim — that people from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism have been arrested on the Mexican border for illegally entering the U.S. — relies on Border Patrol statistics that the agency won’t confirm or deny. However, they appear to be consistent with broader data the agency has made public. And we have no reason to question the authenticity of the information we received from Cornyn’s office. But in the larger context of Cornyn’s concerns about security on the Mexican border, his own numbers show that 87 percent of the apprehensions of people from "terrorism" countries took place elsewhere. And our spot-check found that the Border Patrol made three times as many of those arrests in 2005, during the Bush administration, than in 2009. Because Cornyn's statement leaves out key details, we rate it Half True. UPDATE, 1:00 p.m., April 11: On Friday, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed March 25, we received information from Customs and Border Protection confirming Cornyn's data on the number of apprehensions of Cubans, Iranians, Sudanese and Syrians that took place on the southwestern border between Oct. 1, 2008, and April 30, 2010.

pomt-14457	U.S. global AIDS spending helped reduce "political instability and violence" by "40 percent" in recipient nations.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/tom-daschle/do-us-global-aids-dollars-build-stability-less-vio/	President Barack Obama’s final budget plan includes $4.65 billion to continue the country’s long-standing program to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide. Launched by President George W. Bush in 2003, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, called PEPFAR, now reaches 65 countries. PEPFAR got some bipartisan love from two former Senate majority leaders, Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn. In an op-ed in The Hill titled "Big-hearted, self-serving and right," Daschle and Frist argued that global health aid is in the national interest. "In a study for the Bipartisan Policy Center last November, we showed how the largest global health project in history, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has not only saved millions of lives but also improved America’s national security," they wrote. Among PEPFAR’s achievements, they said "our study found that in PEPFAR countries, political instability and violence have fallen 40 percent (compared to just 3 percent in equivalent non-PEPFAR countries), while economic growth has increased — and so has America’s reputation." There are many fine reasons for America to promote better health overseas, but we wanted to explore whether the data prove that reducing political instability and violence is one of them. As it turns out, it’s tough to make the case. Correlation is not causation The report Daschle cited used World Bank data to make some comparisons. It included the table below to show how 12 PEPFAR countries in Africa made more gains than 12 other African nations. The methodology behind this comparison is murky, if only because it’s unclear precisely how certain African countries were picked to contrast with the PEPFAR ones. We duplicated the study’s selection criteria and came up with a slightly different list of nations. That could alter the results in the table above. That aside, there’s a bigger issue. It’s one thing to say that two changes overlapped (corellation) and quite another to say that one thing caused the other (causation). Along those lines, the report offered some significant caveats. It noted that "a multitude of factors influence the quality of governance, making it impossible to assign causation." It also highlighted that, "PEPFAR was successful in Sub-Saharan Africa in part because it was launched during a decades-long period of development, whereby the quality of governance had been steadily improving in the region prior to and during PEPFAR’s introduction." In short, the report took a more cautious stance than Daschle and Frist did in their op-ed. We would note that in one place, the Bipartisan Policy Center report actually was as forceful as Daschle and Frist. In its opening summary of PEPFAR’s accomplishments, it said "PEPFAR has also played a role in security, stability, and governance." So the report made both strong and more circumspect statements. We asked the center staff to help reconcile what Daschle wrote and what the report contained. We did not hear back. Rachel Robinson, an associate professor at the School of International Service, at American University, said you can’t claim that PEPFAR produced those changes because Washington did not randomly pick the participating countries. "There were countries with high HIV prevalence not included in the original 15, Malawi, for example, and some of the original 15 had relatively low prevalence, such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, but were clearly of U.S. strategic interest," Robinson said. "So, looking at how things came out in PEPFAR countries vs. non-PEPFAR countries is ill-advised from a research perspective." Equally troubling, studies during the worst years of AIDS failed to find a connection between the spread of the disease and greater instability, said Bayard Roberts, a senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Conflict and Health. "There was a lot of rhetoric from the academic, policy, and NGO sectors on how AIDS could pose a security risk to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but this turned out to be vastly overstated and largely false," Roberts said. "The claim that reducing AIDS is linked to greater stability seems equally incorrect." Roberts questioned the fundamental logic behind Daschle’s claim. "From an epidemiological perspective, it is not reasonable to conclude that reducing AIDS is causally linked to greater stability and less violence," he said. "There are so many other, far stronger and more plausible reasons why political instability and violence decline." Robinson’s colleague at American University, Carl LeVan, raised another issue with Daschle and Frist’s claim. "It conflates security and governance," LeVan said. "In countries such as Uganda, the level of democracy has arguably declined while the overall levels of violence have gone down, too. I single out Uganda because it is considered one of the cases par excellence of an illiberal ruler (Yoweri Museveni) leveraging his willingness to be a leader on HIV in return for some latitude from donors on how he rules politically." Joseph L. Dieleman, assistant professor at the University of Washington’s Department of Global Health, said he knows of no study that shows PEPFAR or another large health intervention leading to greater stability and less violence. "This would be very hard to prove empirically," Dieleman said. "This doesn’t mean it isn’t true, just that these type of data make definitive proof very difficult to ascertain." Our ruling Daschle said that U.S. global AIDS spending helped reduce "political instability and violence" by "40 percent" in recipient nations. No one questions that the program did much to ease the burden of disease and helped many sufferers. But there are several reasons the argument that it led to political stability is difficult to make. As the report Daschle cited notes, many of the countries were on an upward path before PEPFAR began. On top of that, Washington carefully selected which nations to include in PEPFAR. Finally, experts knew of no study that shows a large scale health intervention reducing instability and violence. On the contrary, and specific to HIV/AIDS, no study has found that the disease causes instability. Daschle’s statement treats correlation as if it were causation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00034	"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/05/claire-mccaskill/checking-claire-mccaskill-gops-plan-pre-existing-c/	Sen. Claire McCaskill has been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, especially when it comes to protecting pre-existing conditions. Her opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is part of a lawsuit that is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would take away mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Hawley says he’s for protecting this coverage, just not through the current law. During their second debate, Hawley mentioned a bill on reinsurance as a way to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. McCaskill’s rebuttal was quite clear: "The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions," she said. So who is right? We reached out to the McCaskill campaign for evidence, which pointed to a CNBC article. We decided to check out the bill for ourselves. What the bill would do When Collins introduced the bill, she said it was "a bill that would allow states to protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of these high-risk pools." But the bill doesn’t actually contain the words "pre-existing conditions" — more on that in a second. The bill’s actual name is the Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017. It’s intended to "reinsure" insurance companies for taking on high-risk individuals. The bill would allow states to design their own reinsurance programs, which would then allow them to be eligible for federal funding. The bill would allocate $4.5 billion over two years, and states could use the federal funding to provide the reinsurance in a way that is up to them. At issue is the role of high-risk pools. That’s where people who have high premiums would be grouped, regardless of whether they have pre-existing conditions. The phrase "pre-existing conditions" doesn’t show up anywhere in the bill. Instead the bill uses "high-risk" as a qualifier for funding. Experts in health care whom we reached disagreed with McCaskill that pre-existing conditions would have nothing to do with the bill. Anup Malani, professor of law and medicine at the University of Chicago, said that many pre-existing conditions would qualify as a high-risk of using medical care. Alan B. Cohen, research professor at Boston University, believes there is no straight-forward answer, as reinsurance programs just shift the risk from one entity to another. Cohen brought up an interesting point that the bill does not mention in the definition of "high-risk" individuals. "It is plausible that a state could define high-risk individuals as those with pre-existing medical conditions, but there is no guarantee that will be the case." States would be in charge of making their own definitions of high-risk pools, and deciding whether to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions through this bill. So although the Collins referenced pre-existing conditions when speaking on the bill, there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a pre-existing condition. Also, this approach relies on adequate funding. States have tried high-risk pools before and they often fell short because they didn’t have enough money. The bill is an incentive for states to reinsure insurance companies to cover individuals who are high-risk. If the government covers the costs of high risk people, then insurance companies could keep low-risk individuals’ rates low, so the logic goes. Our ruling McCaskill said, "The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions." The bill would help insurance companies cover individuals who are high-risk, which is a category that many pre-existing conditions fall into. While the bill allows the states to make their own decisions -- meaning there’s no guarantee that pre-existing conditions will be protected across the board -- it is an exaggeration to say it has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.

pomt-05763	Says "Rick Santorum supported (Arlen) Specter over conservative candidates twice."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/29/mitt-romney/santorum-endorsed-specter-twice/	Mitt Romney’s campaign would like primary voters to remember that rival Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum once supported a "liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat." A February 2012 attack ad focuses on Santorum’s relationship with former Sen. Arlen Specter, the fellow Pennsylvanian he served with for 16 years in Congress. The ad, titled, "Arlen and Rick," says: Meet Arlen Specter: Liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat. The deciding vote on Obamacare. Rick Santorum supported Specter over conservative candidates — twice. (Santorum clip:) "I'm proud to endorse Arlen Specter." Santorum and Specter voted for liberal circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor. Santorum and Specter both sided with Big Labor, against right-to-work. If Rick Santorum couldn't say no to liberal Arlen Specter, can you really trust him to change Washington? A description of the ad on the Romney campaign’s YouTube channel says, "In 1996 and 2004, Rick Santorum supported Arlen Specter over conservative candidates." We decided we’d dig back 16 years to check: Did Santorum support Specter over conservative candidates twice? We reached out to campaigns for Romney and Santorum, in addition to Specter, now adjunct faculty at University of Pennsylvania Law School. None responded by our deadline. But there was plenty written as history unfolded to help us judge this claim. Santorum’s 1996 endorsement The first flashback takes us to the mid '90s, when Sen. Arlen Specter, 65, hopped briefly into the Republican race for president. Santorum, 37, was a freshly minted senator, elected in 1994 with a helping hand from Specter — who swallowed his opposition to the conservative, pro-life House member to ensure a Republican win over Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford. "It wasn't like Arlen wanted Rick. He didn't. But when he won the primary, he rallied around him," said Terry Madonna, an expert in Pennsylvania politics with Franklin and Marshall College. In 1995, as the junior senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum returned the favor, appearing on stage supporting his home-state colleague while Specter announced his candidacy for president. (So, the "1996" endorsement was in 1995, but for Specter’s short-lived attempt to face Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential race.) Did Santorum support Specter "over conservative candidates"? According to news coverage at the time, Specter said he was entering the race to challenge the party’s religious conservatives and speak in favor of abortion rights. He attacked conservative primary rivals during his speech — conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, leaders of the Christian Coalition — with Santorum on stage. The New York Times said, "So pronounced was Mr. Specter's attack that he spoke this line twice: ‘Neither this nation nor this party can afford a Republican candidate so captive to the demands of the intolerant right that we end up re-electing a president of the incompetent left.’" Santorum, for his part, didn’t play his supporting role flawlessly. The Times reporter noted that he "rolled his eyes more than once and limited his applause." A few days later, Santorum was quoted by States News Service: Santorum repeated his support of Sen. Arlen Specter's presidential candidacy, but it was hardly a ringing endorsement. "The reason I endorse Sen. Specter is because I work with him everyday," Santorum said. He then added, "and I think we agree on most things." Santorum’s 2004 endorsement Santorum’s second endorsement of Specter was more recent — and has a more infamous — history. A Washington Post blog recently called it "Rick Santorum’s greatest sin." Conservative Pat Toomey challenged Specter in the GOP primary. Republican leadership, fearing Toomey would struggle in a general election, lined up behind centrist Specter, starting with President George W. Bush. Santorum, who by 2004 ranked No. 3 in the Senate as the Republican Conference chairman — a job focused on keeping Republican seats — toed the line. With conservative backing, Specter just survived, keeping his Senate seat one more term. However, Santorum opposed Specter in other ways, such as in Senate votes over social issues. In 2004, Specter’s voting record got just a 43 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union, the Bulletin News’ Frontrunner report noted. In 2010, Santorum’s lifetime ACU rating was 88 percent, according to National Review. "On social stuff, he and Arlen were on very different planets," said Madonna, the Pennsylvania politics expert. In fact, most coverage of Santorum’s endorsement of Specter noted how their politics differed. For example, a 2004 Campaign & Elections article headlined, "The Power of Endorsements," noted: "Specter was helped by the endorsement of Santorum, his Senate colleague who is considerably more conservative. The men differed over abortion and stem cell research, among other issues. Santorum played down the differences in backing the incumbent and emphasized their agreement on judicial nominations and other issues. In a television commercial Santorum said, ‘I've heard people say they think Arlen Specter is a liberal. Well, let me tell you. . . Arlen is with us on the votes that matter.’" During the six-year term won with help from Bush and Santorum, Specter switched his party allegiance and began to caucus with Democrats. Although the ad describes Specter as a "liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat," Santorum's endorsements of Specter all occurred when Specter was a Republican. In 2010, Specter ran as a Democrat, and lost in the primary. Our ruling Romney’s ad says Santorum "supported Specter over conservative candidates twice." It’s true that Santorum endorsed his Pennsylvania colleague in 1995 and 2004 over more conservative primary challengers. In the first case, he was repaying Specter’s support for his own Senate candidacy. In the second, he was helping Republicans keep their Senate majority by supporting the candidate the party felt would be more competitive in a general election. The ad’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-29T13:08:11	2012-02-23	['Arlen_Specter', 'Rick_Santorum']

pomt-08254	Says over 25 percent of the Texas budget funds services to non-U.S. citizens.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/nov/12/kathie-glass/kathie-glass-says-more-25-percent-state-budget-fun/	Libertarian Texas gubernatorial nominee Kathie Glass finished third; she also didn't get to hand-deliver her letter to the re-elected winner, Republican Rick Perry, urging him to send troops to the Texas-Mexico border. Glass touted the letter during an Oct. 19 debate at Austin's KLRU-TV, Channel 18, then turned to the impact of illegal immigrants on state spending. "We have budgetary problems that are serious and (that are) going to get worse," Glass said. "These taxpayer-funded services going to non-citizens is over 25 percent of our (two-year) $180 billion (state) budget." Whoa! Non-citizens cost the state more than $45 billion every two years? Glass told us later she'd gleaned the 25 percent stat from an online post by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. We found Patrick's statement, dated May 1, on his Facebook page: "We need to control our border and determine who comes into our country. If we do invite workers to take jobs Americans will not take, we cannot allow those workers to bring entire families with them. While we do not have exact figure, an estimated 25 percent of our $180 billion budget goes to pay for illegals in Texas." In an interview, Patrick told us that no one knows the state costs of providing services to illegal immigrants. He said too that he should have said "up to 25 percent." Later that day, Patrick said his percentage speaks to all costs, including costs to local governments. "Is it accurate to say it's 25 percent of every state dollar? That may not be accurate," Patrick said. Patrick said factors behind his estimate include the number of public school students not proficient in English which, he said, can cost about 30 percent to 40 percent more to educate compared to English-savvy students. "On top of that, the law does not allow our principals to ask students how many are here illegally," Patrick said. "So we really don't know." Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Suzanne Marchman told us via e-mail that schools might ask into a student's legal residency status. However, she said, a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidated a state law restricting access to the schools to legal residents. Hence, she said, districts cannot exclude any student based on their immigration status. We were unable to verify the added cost percentages listed by Patrick, but we dug up some numbers on state aid to educate students with limited English proficiency. An agency pocket guide to public school statistics states that 17 percent of the state's more than 4.7 million students in 2008-09 had limited English proficiency; that's 799,000 students. Due to state school funding formulas, each district in 2010-11 gets an average adjusted allotment of $5,933 per student. Marchman said that each district fields an additional $577 -- a little less than 10 percent -- for each student with limited English proficiency. That makes for a statewide additional expenditure on LEP students of around $461 million. We wondered how many illegal immigrants attend Texas schools. Marchman said the agency does not know. This year, though, the Washington-based Pew Hispanic Center, whose declared mission is to "improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation," drew on 2009 population surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate that a little more than 500,000 Texas public school students are children of unauthorized immigrants, spokesman Jeffrey Passel told us via e-mail. Passel said almost 70 percent of those children are U.S. citizens, with the rest being unauthorized immigrants. Patrick said other factors include health care and criminal justice costs. As examples, he noted that at a Houston hospital, 70 percent of babies are born to mothers who aren't legal U.S. residents, a claim we confirmed earlier this year. Patrick also said nearly 15 percent of individuals in state prison for driving while intoxicated are illegal residents. Patrick's office later told us that, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 914 of 5,943 individuals in prison for DWI convictions, 15 percent, claim foreign citizenship. TDCJ spokesman Jason Clark told us Patrick's numbers reflected the prison system's DWI convicts claiming foreign citizenship as of May 31, 2010. In an e-mail, Clark said the state spent $47.50 a day on average per offender in fiscal 2008; a reasonable estimate of the total 2010 cost of imprisoning DWI offenders claiming foreign citizenship is nearly $16 million. We wondered if anyone had added up the overall costs of illegal immigrants to the state; some have tried. In December 2006, then-Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn issued a report on the economic impact on Texas of its undocumented immigrant population. It concludes that illegal immigrants paid more into state government in taxes and fees in fiscal 2005 than they cost the state, though local governments and hospitals spent nearly $929 million more on illegal immigrants than they recovered in revenue. Strayhorn's report says that state educational, health care and incarceration costs due to illegal immigrants totaled $1.16 billion that year, while state revenues collected from illegal immigrants totaled $1.6 billion--nearly $425 million more than state expenditures related to the residents. The largest cost factor to the state was education, followed by incarceration and health care. Consumption taxes and fees, the largest of which is the sales tax, were the largest revenue generators from undocumented immigrants, the report says. We made a run at applying the Strayhorn report to the latest state budget. Taking into account inflation, the comptroller's estimated state costs due to illegal immigrants would be $1.3 billion by 2010, while payments to the state by illegal immigrants would be $1.8 billion, for a net gain of $500 million. We then doubled the cost figure to estimate state expenditures on services to illegal immigrants for the 2010-11 state budget period. The resulting $2.6 billion equals 1.4 percent of $182 billion in state, federal and other funds budgeted by state legislators for the period. More recently, Austin consultant James Aalan Bernsen wrote a 2009 analysis of the costs of illegal immigration to Texas for the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, which advocates for stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States. Bernsen's 13-page report draws on U.S. Census population estimates and research by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says it seeks to improve border security and stop illegal immigration. The report lays out Bernsen's methodology for reaching an annual net cost to Texas estimate of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. We doubled Bernsen's high-end net cost to get a two-year estimate, with the result that services to illegal immigrants by his methodology account for about 7 percent of the 2010-11 state budget. In an interview, Bernsen termed not credible the "over 25 percent" figure aired by Glass; the cost to the state of serving illegal immigrants, Bernsen said, is "not to that extreme." Finally, we asked the Pew Hispanic Center and FAIR if they had estimated the cost to the state of Texas from serving illegal immigrants. Passel said the Pew center doesn't have that information. FAIR spokeswoman Kristen Williamson said that group estimates that illegal immigration in 2010 is costing Texas taxpayers nearly $8.9 billion a year, though Williamson said it has not broken out costs solely related to the state budget. "It could take one researcher four or five years to comb through the state budget to come up with all the costs," Williamson speculated. Summing up: Glass based her claim on a months' old Facebook post that she evidently didn't verify and that the senator who made the post says may be overstated. A 2009 analysis by an anti-illegal immigration group pegs the cost of services to illegal immigrants at a figure that's about 7 percent of the state's budget -- up to $12 billion over two years, well short of the $45 billion suggested by Glass. And the only relevant state agency report we found said that state revenue from illegal immigrants exceeded what they cost the state budget in fiscal 2005. Significantly, there's a paucity of information on which to ground such estimates. Regardless, we rate the statement so far off, it's ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01671	Says David Perdue made tens of millions of dollars piling a firm with billions in debt.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/19/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/democrats-claim-mischaracterizes-deal/	The battle to succeed retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss is being fought by two self-proclaimed outsiders who say their private sector experience will help whip Washington into shape. Michelle Nunn – the outsider whose dad was a U.S. Senator for 24 years – wants voters to see her nonprofit work as proof she can work across party lines and be a problem solver. David Perdue – the outsider whose cousin served two terms as Georgia’s governor – believes voters should view his time as a CEO and upper-level manager as the experience needed to tackle the financial issues before Congress. Not surprisingly, each side scoffs at the other’s experience, as evidenced by this recent press release from the Democratic Party of Georgia: "Perdue made $1.7 million in just a few months steering one company toward bankruptcy, led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas at another and made tens of millions of dollars piling yet another firm with billions in debt," the emailed release from July 28 read. PolitiFact Georgia already vetted that first statement about bankruptcy, which refers to the collapse of textile firm Pillowtex shortly after Perdue’s brief stint as CEO. We found blaming him for the woes of the long-struggling firm a stretch. We’re saving the question of outsourcing thousands of jobs for a new fact check soon so we can focus on Perdue’s most recent CEO job, as head of Dollar General. Perdue was the first person outside the founding family to serve as CEO of Dollar General when he took over in 2003. The company grew from 5,900 to 8,500 stores under his tenure, according to SEC filings. Michael Smith, spokesman for the state Democrats, pointed to separate filings that show the firm’s debt also grew by $3.8 billion in those four years. The figures speak for themselves, he said, declining further comment. The missing context, though, is why Dollar General’s debt ballooned from $346.5 million in 2002 (and $282 million in 2003, Perdue’s first year as CEO) to $4.282 billion in 2007. The debt came from a leveraged buyout, when Perdue successfully convinced the board of directors for Dollar General to be acquired by private equity firm KKR for $7.3 billion. As with all leveraged buyouts, it was KKR as the buyer, not Dollar General as the seller, that financed the deal - and the debt. Perdue acknowledged making $42 million over two years when KKR bought out his contract as part of the deal. But he defended the buyout, noting 99 percent of shareholders OK’d the deal that paid $22 in cash for each Dollar General share, a 31 percent premium. "It worked for everybody," Perdue said. "We saved thousands of jobs with that deal, and I feel like we did it responsibly." Smith pointed to several lawsuits from those remaining shareholders, alleging Perdue and other top executives undervalued the company in the deal. The discount chain paid out $42 million in 2009 to settle those suits. Dan Wewer, the managing director of equity research at Raymond James in Atlanta, described those lawsuits as common in nearly all leveraged buyouts. And in all such transactions, Wewer said, it is the private investors finance the deal. Perdue is off the hook for the debt, then. Wewer, who follows the retail industry, said a more critical look would assess why Dollar General was a target for a buyout in the first place. Dollar General’s operating profit margin was 7.5 percent in 2003, meaning 7.5 percent of revenues were profit before taxes. That dropped to 2.6 percent in 2007 under Perdue’s leadership. Likewise, pre-tax profit dropped from $487 million in 2003 to just $96 million in 2007, Wewer said. After KKR bought out Perdue’s contract and replaced him with its own CEO, Dollar General saw a lifetime high of 10.3 percent operating profit and $1.5 billion in pre-tax earnings in 2012. "Saying he added the debt at Dollar General is totally inaccurate," Wewer said. "But it is accurate to say he was the CEO during a period when the company’s profitability dramatically dropped and created a situation where a new buyer came in and replaced him with a CEO who was able to turn the company around." That was not the focus from Democrats, though. They look only at Dollar General’s filings to claim Perdue saddled the company with billions in debt at a time he made millions himself. The claim mischaracterizes how leveraged buyouts work, putting the buyer in debt instead of the seller. Perdue also could not act unilaterally to sell the firm but needed his board and shareholders to agree. Moreover, it was not up to Perdue to stay. KKR paid him $42 million to leave, so it could install its own CEO. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Party of Georgia	None	None	None	2014-08-19T00:00:00	2014-07-28	['None']

pomt-09957	"The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons, including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 'shoe bomber,' the 'Unabomber,' and many others."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/richard-durbin/durbin-correct-convicted-terrorists-are-federal-pr/	Republicans have been complaining for several weeks that President Barack Obama's plan to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would force the government to bring dangerous terrorists to prisons in the United States. They've even introduced a bill that would put restrictions on the transfers called the "Keep Terrorists Out of America Act." In response to the criticism, Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the assistant majority leader, declared on the Senate floor May 20, 2009, "The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons, including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 'shoe bomber,' the 'Unabomber,' and many others." We started by doing a little digging at the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Indeed, Richard Reid — a.k.a. the "shoe bomber" — is being held at the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., which, according to the bureau's Web site, "houses offenders requiring the tightest controls." It is the only one of its kind in the United States. The Florence facility houses several other people that Durbin mentioned and characterized as terrorists: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the "mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing," and Ted Kaczynski, the "Unabomber" who killed three people and injured 28 others in a string of bombings over the span of 18 years. So Durbin is right about them. Others convicted of terrorist crimes are housed in the same federal prison, including Wadih El-Hage, Osama bin Laden's former secretary, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his role in the 9/11 attacks. All told, the federal prisons hold 347 people convicted of international or domestic terrorism, according to Durbin's office, citing Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics. The Florence location is where the most violent prisoners — and those most likely to escape — end up. Living conditions are sparse; inmates are housed in 86-square-foot cells and have limited contact with other people. Democrats such as Durbin say facilities like the one in Florence are well-suited for detainees from Guantanamo Bay. "Some of my Republican colleagues argued that Guantanamo is the only appropriate place to hold the detainees because 'we don’t have a facility that could handle this in the United States' and American corrections officers would 'have no idea what they are getting into,'" Durbin said. "They ought to take a look at some of our secured facilities in the United States and they ought to have a little more respect for the men and women who are corrections officers." As for Durbin's claim, it appears he did his homework. Given that all the terrorists he named in his statement are in fact held in the United States, we find his statement True.

pomt-09425	"The economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/15/virginia-foxx/foxx-blames-recession-democratic-congressional-tak/	With the United States mired in its deepest recession in decades, Democrats and Republicans have sparred over which party bears the lion's share of blame. In a March 9, 2010, House floor speech, North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx made clear which party she thinks is most at fault. Foxx spoke after the conclusion of a speech by Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat. Connolly said Americans had lost $17.5 trillion in net worth from December 2007 through March 2009. From that point, Connolly said, Americans began to recover. "We are not out of the woods just yet," Connolly said. "Households lost value every month for the longest recession since World War II. But we have turned the corner, and Americans today have $5 trillion more in net worth because of our actions." After hearing Connolly's remarks, Foxx held off beginning her prepared statement on health care reform so that she could respond to what Connolly said. "Madam Speaker, I came to talk about health reform, but would first note that the gentleman from Virginia fails to mention that the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007. For 54 months before that, with a Republican president and Republican control of Congress, the economy was doing very well and growing." We decided to see if the data supported Foxx's claims. We turned to GDP figures because she specifically referred to the economy "growing." Foxx's second argument is a bit easier to verify, so we'll get that out of the way. Foxx said that for 54 months under Republican control of the presidency and Congress, "the economy was doing very well and growing." We aren't sure why she picked 54 months -- that takes us to July 2002, which was neither the start of George W. Bush's presidency (January 2001) nor the end of the Democrats' brief majority in the Senate (January 2003) -- but the key statistics don't differ much, so we'll stick to her timeline. During the 54-month period Foxx cited, growth in gross domestic product -- the basic measure of economic expansion for the nation as a whole -- remained in positive territory for every single quarter. During that period, the average of the quarterly annualized GDP growth rates was 2.8 percent -- not earth-shattering, but steady growth. And if you instead date the statistics back to the official start of the economic expansion -- that is, back to the fourth quarter of 2001 -- then the average growth rate was roughly the same, 2.7 percent. So we conclude that Foxx is right to say that the economy experienced growth during that entire period (although, contrary to what she suggested, the Democrats controlled the Senate for six months out of the 54). Now let's look at the notion that "the economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007." For the first four quarters of the newly Democratic Congress -- the four quarters of 2007 -- the annualized GDP growth rates were, in order, 1.2 percent, 3.2 percent, 3.6 percent and 2.1 percent. Each quarter showed positive growth, and the average for those four quarterly figures was 2.5 percent -- not much lower than the average growth during the previous 54 months. Officially, the recession started in December 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, GDP fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent. It rebounded briefly to 1.5 percent growth in the second quarter of 2008, then got really rocky in the third quarter of 2008. During that quarter and the following two, GDP fell by 2.7 percent, 5.4 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. If you date the "nose dive" to the first quarter of 2008 -- the earliest quarter with negative growth -- that was a full year after the Democratic takeover. And if you compare each quarter of 2006 (the last under GOP control) to the equivalent quarter of 2007 (the first under Democratic control), the pattern does not always favor the GOP. In both the first and fourth quarters, the 2006 level of growth under the GOP exceeded the 2007 level of growth under the Democrats. But in the second and third quarters, the Democrats did better in 2007 than the GOP did in 2006. We asked an ideological cross-section of economists what they thought of Foxx's claim. Karen Campbell, a macroeconomics policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that in her view, "no statistical causation between political party in power and economic growth was established" by Foxx's statement. Measured by economic growth, "the economy did not technically begin a nose dive when the Democrats took over." Economist Gary Burtless of the liberal Brookings Institution wonders what Foxx would say if the shoe were on the other foot. "The longest post-World-War-II business expansion ended in March 2001, one and a half months after a Republican Administration took office," Burtless said. "That new Republican administration also had the good fortune to have a House of Representatives and, at first, a Senate that was controlled by the same party. According to Rep. Foxx’s reasoning, the recession that began after March 2001 must have been 'caused' by the political change-over in control of the White House. Of course, I think this reasoning is specious, but it is equally ludicrous to claim that the recession which began in January 2008 was 'caused' by a change in political control of Congress that took place in January 2007." Most of the economists we spoke to agreed that the recession was caused most directly by long-term trends, especially a bust in housing prices and high energy prices, rather than by political factors. "The Democrats can be blamed for setting the economy on a bubble-driven path in the 1990s, but the Republicans cannot escape blame for continuing this path and allowing an even larger and more dangerous bubble to develop in the first decade of the 21st century," said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Is Rep. Foxx claiming that if we just left the Republicans in control, the housing bubble would still be growing so that we would have an even greater disaster to look forward to at the point when it finally collapsed?" Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that it's conceivable that fear of the Democratic takeover could have spooked the financial markets and pushed the economy into a recession by depressing household wealth, bank capital and the ability of firms to raise funds in equity markets. In reality, though, the Dow Jones Industrial average actually rose from about 12,100 just before Election Day 2006 -- when the Democrats took back the House and Senate -- to a high of 13,930 in October 2007, which was 10 months after the Democrats took control of Congress. (The Dow then fell precipitously until early 2009.) "Anyone who tries to link the ups and downs in business to something happening in D.C. is obligated to explain what it is that happened," Reynolds said. "Otherwise, it's likely random luck. Politicians are not as important as they like to think they are." We agree. The evidence shows that the economy did not "nose dive" for at least a year after the Democrats took control of Congress, and experts of various ideological backgrounds agree that long-term trends in the housing and energy markets played a bigger role in directly causing the recession. While what happens in Washington can certainly influence the economy, it is only one of many factors. We believe it is the height of partisan wishful thinking to imply that one party's accession to power in Congress is to blame for a major recession. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01040	Democrats have "lost more than 900 state legislators" since Barack Obama has been president.	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/25/cokie-roberts/have-democrats-lost-900-seats-state-legislatures-o/	If President Barack Obama’s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for middle-class tax cuts and programs won’t go anywhere in the new Republican Congress, why did Obama even spend time discussing it during last week’s State of the Union? "Because it’s something for people to run on," said Cokie Roberts as part of a Sunday pundit analysis on ABC’s This Week. "He’s lost almost 70 Democrats since he’s been president," Roberts said of Congress, "and more than 900 state legislators. So he needs to give Democrats something to run on." We had heard iterations of Democratic losses on the congressional level, but never such a large number of losses for Democrats in legislatures across the country. Turns out, Roberts is correct. Our analysis shows Democrats have lost 910 seats since Obama took office. (You can see the changes in every state here.) We took a state-by-state look of lost seats from the best source available, the National Conference of State Legislatures. Using the group’s data, we compared the number of Democratic seats in early 2009, when Obama took office, to the number of seats after the 2014 midterms. The bottom line: Republicans now control about 56 percent of the country’s 7,383 state legislative seats, up 12 percentage points since 2009. Thirty-five states posted double-digit seat losses for the Democrats in state legislatures, including more than 50 seats each in Arkansas, New Hampshire and West Virginia. Democrats actually gained a few seats over the course of Obama’s presidency in New Jersey (one) and Illinois (three), and the number of Democratic seats stayed the same in California. The GOP’s national and local resurgence under the Democratic-controlled White House is not surprising, in part, because of the historical trend for two-term presidencies. Political analysts say it’s a sure thing that a political party prospers when it wins the White House but loses its influence across the country soon after. Remember that before the 2010 and 2012 elections, Democrats made positive gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, said Larry Sabato, a political expert at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. "You have a pretty consistent pattern of surge and decline, and you can trace it throughout the two-party era in American politics," Sabato said. What is notable about losses under Obama is, with two years to go, they are worse than usual. Sabato and his colleague Geoffrey Skelley recently chronicled the trend of two-term presidents’ sour effect on their parties for Politico Magazine. Their analysis looked at the down-ballot effects of eight two-term presidents, which includes leaders who served two full terms (Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama) as well as the terms of leaders who died or resigned and their successors (Franklin Roosevelt-Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon-Gerald Ford). Obama’s record for losses, at least through the 2014 midterms, is historically bad having overseen two horrible midterm elections for Democrats. Overall, Sabato wrote, Democrats during Obama’s presidency lost 11 governorships, 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 House seats, and 913 state legislative seats and 30 state legislative chambers. (Our analysis of legislative seats is off from Sabato’s by three. The small discrepancy is likely due to run-offs and recounts.) The shedding of U.S. House seats, state legislative seats and statehouse control is at least twice the average two-term losses from Truman through George W. Bush, Sabato said. The Democrats’ "presidential penalty" is rougher than usual for a few reasons, Sabato explains. First, voters in midterm elections tend to be older and whiter, thus more conservative. Groups that are overwhelmingly Democratic, such as young people and minorities, are more likely to turn out in stronger numbers for presidential elections. Also, Democratic losses in 2010 could not have come at a worse time given redistricting across the country. With more Republicans in control of statehouses, they have authority over the lines that delineate seats for U.S. Senate, House and legislative races. "There is a heavy amount of gerrymandering," Sabato said. Finally, voters and candidates are moving away from centrist voting habits that dominated the 1970s through ‘90s, when voters would deviate from party lines after making their presidential pick. In recent years, Sabato said, "more and more people will stay in the same column from the White House to the courthouse, voting for either Democrats or Republicans." Sabato is not alone in documenting this trend. Looking at how parties performed in down-ballot races just under the last three presidents, PolitiFact’s Louis Jacobson also found that losses under Obama were more severe for a column in Governing. Jacobson said the Democratic losses reached 36 percent in governorships and "a stunning 59 percent in fully controlled state legislatures." Our ruling Roberts said Obama sought to inspire Democrats across the country in his State of the Union address in part because the party lost "more than 900 state legislators" since he took office. We ran the numbers, and Roberts’ claim checks out. Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, Democrats have lost 910 seats in statehouses across the country since 2009.

Rep. Chris Collins says a trade dispute with the Canada has forced New York state farmers to dump their milk "into ditches" because they can no longer sell it across the border. "They’ve now taken something they call ultra-filtered milk. They effectively with a pricing move, our dairy farmers are no longer able to get that product into Canada," Collins said in an interview with Bloomberg. "They are now dumping milk into the ditches. The travesty there is beyond belief to see tankers of milk being dumped because there’s no market to sell them in." The dispute began last year when the Canadian dairy industry created a new pricing class for ultra-filtered milk, a protein-heavy version of the milk you buy at the supermarket. It’s typically used to produce yogurt and certain cheeses. The new pricing class lowered the price of ultra-filtered milk from Canadian dairy producers, making it cheaper for companies in Canada to buy the product domestically instead of importing it from New York state. The new pricing class took effect at the beginning of April. Both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and President Donald Trump have criticized Canada for the action, saying it hurts the state’s dairy industry. But is Collins right that the dispute has forced farmers to dump milk into ditches? Dairy processors A spokesman for Collins’ office could not point to any farms that have dumped milk because of the trade dispute, but did say the congressman was talking about farmers in New York state. There are two major processing facilities in New York state that export ultra-filtered milk to Canada: Cayuga Milk Ingredients in Auburn and O-AT-KA Milk Products in Batavia. O-AT-KA is mostly supplied by Upstate Niagara Cooperative but also receives milk from Dairy Farmers of America. Cayuga Milk Ingredients, itself a cooperative, receives milk from 30 local dairy farms. The cooperatives are responsible for marketing their members’ milk to processors and elsewhere. If a member’s product has to be dumped, the loss is spread across all members of the cooperative instead of an individual farmer. Craig S. Alexander, vice president for dairy ingredients and regulatory affairs at O-AT-KA, said no milk from Upstate Niagara Cooperative has been dumped because of the Canada issue. "We haven’t dumped any milk yet," Alexander said. "However, it’s an evolving situation and the milk supply hasn’t peaked seasonally yet so it’s really week to week to see if we can make ends meet." Alexander says the dispute could lead to a loss of $20 million for the company if it’s not resolved. Dairy Farmers of America did not reply to our inquiry. The situation is similar in Auburn. "We’ve been close to dumping but we’ve been able to manage it," said Kevin Ellis, CEO of Cayuga Milk Ingredients. "I’m responsible for marketing the milk, and I’ve been able to effectively market it." Ellis says the trade dispute threatens $30 million of its annual sales to Canadian markets, about 25 percent of total revenue. The New York Farm Bureau, the Northeast Dairy Producers Association, the Northeast Dairy Foods Association, the American Dairy Association Northeast, and the state Department of Agriculture did not know of any farmers dumping milk because of the problem. Dumping data Some milk has been dumped in the Northeast. Neither the state nor federal Departments of Agriculture tracks how much milk is dumped by state, but federal data shows the amount of milk dumped in a specific region. In the region that includes part of upstate New York and other states in the Northeast, 44.8 million pounds of milk were dumped in the first three months of this year, about 40 percent of the total milk dumped in the U.S. during that time. That’s more than twice the amount of milk dumped in the first three months of last year, but still less than 1 percent of the milk produced in the region. The numbers include more than just milk that was dumped because it couldn’t be sold. It includes milk dumped in all circumstances, like milk used for animal feed. Dumping milk is rarely a total loss for farmers. Processors will often take the cream from milk to sell, leaving only the skim part to be dumped. When processors have no demand for any part of the milk, cooperatives will dump the extra product. But there are rules for how this is done. State regulations require farmers to dispose of excess milk by either adding it to their manure storage structure or by directly applying it to fields to recycle the nutrients. Any dumping that may lead to a waterway, like a ditch, would be a violation of the state Environmental Conservation Law. Our ruling Collins said farmers "are now dumping milk into the ditches" because of a trade dispute with Canada. The Canadian dairy industry's new pricing for ultra-filtered milk affects dairy processors and farmers in upstate New York, but we could not find any who have dumped their milk because of the trade dispute. It has been more difficult for dairy producers to find a market for their product for the last few years because of a persistent milk glut in the United States. Collins points out the dispute has made it harder for processors to bring milk to market. Indeed, farmers might begin dumping their milk soon if the trend continues. But we found no evidence, and he has not provided any, that it has happened yet. We rate his claim False.

pomt-01307	"You cannot get (Ebola) from just riding on a plane or bus."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-you-cant-get-ebola-riding-bus-or/	President Barack Obama has sought to assuage fears about Ebola in the face of panic and misinformation. In his Oct. 18 weekly address, he called on people to "be guided by the science and "remember the basic facts." "Ebola is actually a difficult disease to catch," Obama said. "It's not transmitted through the air like the flu. You cannot get it from just riding on a plane or a bus." That last line, repeated often by the administration in various forms, has caught the ire of critics, who believe the statement is too cavalier. It’s also at odds with some advice from health officials that people who may have been exposed to the virus should avoid public transportation. So we decided to take a look at it ourselves: Can you get Ebola from "just riding" on a plane or a bus? As Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine, told us, "There is no ‘infection free’ zone just because you're on a bus or a plane." However, Fekete and others said the likelihood that someone would contract Ebola while flying or using public transportation is small. Extremely small. It would take a lot more than just sitting next to or sharing air with an infected individual. Let’s explain. How Ebola spreads People infected with the virus are not contagious until they are showing symptoms, according to experts and research. Symptoms are, first, a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, which usually occurs between 2 and 21 days of contracting the virus. Risk of contracting Ebola is greatest if you come in direct contact with "blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people," according to the World Health Organization. These fluids contain high concentrations of the virus that can result in infection if they are exposed to your eyes, mouth, nose or a cut on your skin, even for a relatively short amount of time. There is also some risk, albeit low, that the virus can be spread by "being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time," or by touching surfaces contaminated by bodily fluids of an infected patient. However, there is little evidence to date that Ebola spreads this way. Studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that "all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients," the World Health Organization noted. What the government says Some critics say that Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sending mixed signals about the virus. While Obama says you can’t simply catch it from riding on a plane or bus, the CDC at the same time has cautioned people experiencing symptoms to "limit your contact with other people" and "avoid public transportation." The CDC also advises people who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus to remain in controlled movement, which means, in part, "These individuals should not travel by commercial conveyances (e.g. airplane, ship, long-distance bus, or train)." CDC director Tom Frieden recently addressed this on a conference call with reporters: "I think there are two different parts of that equation. The first is, if you're a member of the traveling public and are healthy, should you be worried that you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone? The answer is no. Second, if you're sick, and you may have Ebola, should you get on a bus? The answer to that is also no. You might become ill; you might have a problem that exposes someone around you. Because the risk is so low, we think there is an extremely low likelihood that anyone who travelled on this plane would have been exposed, but we're putting into place extra margins of safety and that's why we're contacting everyone who was on that flight." Experts told us this appears to be a case of the CDC taking extra precautions to be safe. "The risk comes from the direct contact with the human secretions and is greatest in the hospital when the secretions are heavily contaminated with lots of viable virus or in an intimate home setting for the person in the earliest stage of illness when no one thinks to take any precautions because it seems like a ‘regular’ illness," Fekete said. "But none of these things describe what happens on bus or plane rides." Planes, trains and automobiles So how might someone get Ebola from riding on a bus or train? Ebola is not airborne. So you would have to be in close proximity to someone who is infected with Ebola and at least has a fever. On top of that, you would have to come in direct contact with bodily fluids from the infected individual. The most realistic scenario we could think of is someone sitting next to you is really sick and throws up on you. It’s an upsetting situation, to be sure, and without thinking you touch your nose or your eyes before you’re fully disinfected. However, people who are sick enough to be vomiting are also very unlikely to be in a state where they can take public transportation or fly, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. That’s why so far the only individuals who have contracted Ebola in the United States have been health care workers. "The thing about Ebola is that at the point that you’re really infectious to other people is when you are in the later stages of your illness, when you have really terrible diarrhea and nonstop vomiting," Rimoin said. "And nobody is going to be in contact with somebody who has Ebola at that stage under any kind of normal situation." What about a sneeze or cough? Stephen Gire, a researcher at the Harvard Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology who studies the Ebola genome, said if someone who is showing symptoms sneezed directly on you from within 3 feet, it could, technically, transfer the virus. But people further away wouldn’t have to worry about those particles lingering in the air. We should add coughing and sneezing are not symptoms of Ebola and there’s no documented evidence the disease has ever been transmitted this way. What if bodily fluids from an infected individual ended up on a bus seat or a plane armrest? Could you get the Ebola virus that way? Under very limited conditions the virus could survive outside the body, Gire said. First, the fluid would have to remain in liquid form. Once it dried up, the virus would die. Second, it would have to be a very cool and dark setting. "It has to be a highly engineered environment for Ebola to survive in this environment," Gire said. "Stable temperature; on the right type of surface; not exposed to light, etc. These are highly, highly unlikely scenarios in nature and normal environments, and should not be seen as something that is likely to happen." Our ruling Obama said, "You cannot get (Ebola) from just riding on a plane or a bus." He’s right in the sense that you can’t get it "just" from being on a plane or bus with someone who is infected. It would take additional steps: The infected person must be showing symptoms and you must have direct contact with that individual’s bodily fluids, i.e. blood or vomit. Could that happen? Hypothetically, sure. Experts confirmed as much, and the CDC goes so far as to warn people exposed to the virus that they should not take public transportation. But it’s also a very unlikely scenario. It’s rare that one would ever come in direct contact with bodily fluids from sick people while riding on a bus or plane. And someone in that stage of the disease is likely too sick to fly or ride. Experts said the probability of such a transmission occurring is so small that the sentiment is largely accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-10-29T14:45:59	2014-10-18	['None']
pomt-14891	"Everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2015/nov/09/luis-alejo/claim-says-all-california-drivers-are-insured/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Convincing all California drivers to carry insurance has vexed state officials for decades. The most recent estimates show that 4.1 million drivers, or about one in seven on the state’s roads, were uninsured as of 2012. A state law that went into effect in January has suddenly wiped away that problem, according to Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas. Alejo announced in September that more than half a million undocumented state residents had obtained a driver’s license under AB 60, which he authored. He went on to say his law erases any worry about uninsured motorists rumbling down California’s roads. "I am proud to have authored this historic measure for not only the millions of hard working undocumented Californians that call California home, but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured," Alejo said in a press release. We wanted to fact-check the head-scratching claim that "everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured," with a focus on the insurance portion. We started with some sobering data from the California Highway Patrol, which enforces the state’s requirement that all drivers carry insurance. In the first eight months of this year, its officers issued more than 66,000 citations statewide to drivers who failed to show valid insurance. *NOTE: The 2015 figure is a projection. As of Aug. 31, 2015, the CHP has issued 66,003 citations to improperly insured drivers. Source: CHP Clearly, uninsured motorists are still keeping the CHP busy. Eric Lin, a professor who studies insurance at Sacramento State University, called Alejo’s statement wishful thinking. "First of all, it’s inaccurate," Lin said. "I think that it’s a goal that all of us should be trying to get to." The professor cited an Insurance Research Council report from 2014 that estimates California had the most uninsured motorists in the nation in 2012, with 4.1 million. While the report centers on trends from three years ago, Patrick Schmid, the council’s research director, said there’s no doubt people are still driving without insurance in California. "The fact of the matter is there are motorists out there both nationally and within the state of California that are making the unwise decision to drive uninsured," Schmid said. We asked Alejo’s office to explain the lawmaker’s claim. His spokeswoman responded in an email that the statement "should have been a little more precise." "In retrospect," she added, "it should have read: "…but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California’s roads will be properly licensed, tested and insured." Assemblyman Luis Alejo. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Lin said he’s "not optimistic" that Alejo’s prediction will come true. "This uninsured motorist problem is perplexing. It’s very difficult to mitigate," the professor said. He said AB 60 has the potential to reduce uninsured driving in California, though he and state insurance and motor vehicle officials said it was too early to say whether the law is having that impact. California does not require proof of insurance to obtain a driver’s license. It does, however, require insurance to register a vehicle. Insurance experts say Alejo’s claim about "everyone" being insured on California’s roads is far from true. But they point out that the percentage of uninsured motorists has been falling in recent years. Nationwide, it dropped from 14.9 percent of drivers in 2003 to 12.6 percent in 2012, according to the research council. Compared with a few years ago, Schmid said the cost of auto insurance is less and more people are working, both of which persuade people to carry insurance. The CHP data also point to fewer uninsured motorists. It shows a significant drop in citations issued for drivers who failed to show proof of insurance in each of the past five years. Our ruling Assemblyman Luis Alejo says "everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured." This statement is clearly a dream, with no basis in fact. While indicators show the number of uninsured motorists is dropping, CHP officers are still very busy citing uninsured drivers. They wrote more than 66,000 tickets for uninsured drivers from January through August. Insurance experts call Alejo’s claim inaccurate and wishful thinking. They also strongly doubt the problem will ever be fully solved. We rate the claim Pants On Fire, which we define as a statement that is "not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."

pomt-00288	"PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/27/steve-west/missouri-house-candidate-misses-mark-vaccine-prote/	Steve West, the Republican challenger for Missouri’s 15th House District in North Kansas City, has made headlines recently for his incendiary claims regarding Jews, homosexuality and Muslims, among other things. His platform includes the long-debunked claim of links between vaccines and autoimmune disorders. The medical establishment, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has found no link between vaccines and autism, but a vocal minority continues to push to make vaccines voluntary. (Generally, if you want to attend school you must have proof you have been vaccinated.) Under the subheading "Vaccines Should Be Voluntary" on his website, West says developments in plumbing and private transportation have eliminated the need for vaccinations. West also states that the U.S. has an autoimmune epidemic and that it began after vaccines were introduced in the mid-1900s. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there have been cases where it was presumed that a vaccine caused a dormant autoimmune disease to show up; however, there is no conclusive data to prove that vaccines are a root cause of autoimmune disorders. The academy and other studies have said that vaccination is proven to be beneficial for children. One part of his website that caught our eye is a statement that "PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!" Given his past record of making controversial statements, we decided to take a look. While West is correct that manufacturers of vaccines have certain legal immunities, his use of the term ‘prosecution’ implies criminal activity, and civil protections carry caveats. Legislation to protect drug companies When we reached out to West for evidence of his claim, he referenced a Wikipedia entry on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. A reading of the act shows it was created to allow a compensation program for cases involving vaccine-related injuries or death to be settled. The goal was to stabilize the supply of vaccines in a time when lawsuits were numerous. The law created a no-fault system, which means that a company isn’t legally responsible for what happens to those who take the vaccine. Victims of vaccine-related injuries or death can file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program. This program shields the vaccine manufacturing companies from liability while paying for vaccine related injuries or deaths. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is in charge of what constitutes a vaccine-related injury and can recommend changes to vaccines in place. Looking deeper, there was also a Supreme Court ruling in 2011, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, that said pharmaceutical companies have federal shield laws to protect them from product-liability shield lawsuits. The Supreme Court’s decision left the legality of vaccines to federal agencies, notably the Food and Drug Administration, to determine if a vaccine is in fact harmful to children. These laws do have exceptions. Vaccine manufacturers have to properly manufacture the vaccines and could be found liable if they knowingly released a tainted vaccine. For example, under the Public Readiness Preparedness Act, a manufacturer of a vaccine may still be held liable, even after a PREP Act declaration, for "willful misconduct." We should note that pharmaceutical companies produce many other drugs that are not protected from civil lawsuits. For example, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals was successfully sued in 2016 for "bundling" one of its drugs in sales to hospitals, thereby discouraging patients from switching to other, cheaper options. What’s prosecution However, neither the law nor the ruling address criminal action — the action suggested by West’s reference to "prosecution." Usually, prosecution relates to criminal charges, rather than civil actions, according to Merriam-Webster. The 1986 law and the Supreme Court decision say nothing about what would happen if criminal charges were brought up. A search through the the U.S. Health and Wellness code showed that no vaccine manufacturer shall be held civilly liable. Although manufacturers are shielded from civil damages, we could find no law that protects them from criminal prosecution. We should note that the word "prosecute" does sometimes come up in civil actions. If a party in a lawsuit doesn’t show up, for instance, a judge can dismiss the suit for "failure to prosecute." This definition of "prosecute" does add an element of confusion to interpreting West’s statement, but the more common usage of the term is for criminal law. Our ruling West said, "PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!" Federal law and a Supreme Court ruling protects pharmaceutical companies from being held liable under civil law for damages due to their vaccines. But West said vaccine-makers are safe from "prosecution," and we found no indication that a vaccine-maker or its employees were shielded from prosecution under the law if they faced a criminal charge. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Steve West	None	None	None	2018-09-27T15:02:09	2018-09-27	['Pharmaceutical_industry']
pomt-02064	"For every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/28/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-75-have-joined-food-stamp-r/	A reader recently asked us to check out a meme circulating on social media that is critical of President Barack Obama. It reads: "Obama Fun Fact #301: For every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps." Here’s a fun fact: The numbers here are wildly inflated. A little Googling turned up what appears to be the source of this statistic: A release by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee headlined, "For Every Person Added to Jobs Rolls Since January 2009, 75 People Added To Food Stamp Rolls." This release was picked up in a Nov. 2, 2012, post by the conservative Weekly Standard. When the committee released its data, it said the most recent figures were 194,000 jobs created between January 2009 and October 2012 and 14.7 million added to the food stamp rolls between January 2009 and July 2012. That would be roughly a 75-to-1 ratio -- but it’s also a snapshot in time. Since the committee wrote that, employment has increased by 4 million jobs while the number of food stamp recipients has remained about the same, making the comparison grossly out of date. In fact, late 2012 was pretty much the only point in time during Obama’s tenure where the ratio was that bad. Prior to that, job growth was negative, so the calculation wouldn’t have made any sense. Shortly after, the number of jobs (the denominator) began growing as the number of food stamps (the numerator) stagnated, making the ratio fall consistently over time. So what is the correct number? The standard way of counting how many jobs were created during a specific time span is to use seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ payroll survey for total non-farm employment. The one tricky part is to determine when to start the clock for Obama. We chose three possible points: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; July 2009, when the recovery from the last recession officially began; and February 2010, the post-recession low point in employment. We compared each of these dates to the most recent month available, April 2014. Regardless of the time frame, Obama has overseen a net increase in jobs, though the amount of the increase varies. From January 2009-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 4,276,000. From July 2009-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 7,635,000. And from February 2010-April 2014, the number of jobs increased by 8,597,000. Now let’s look at the statistics for food stamps, a program now known officially as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The average monthly number of beneficiaries for fiscal year 2009 -- which was split between the tenure of Presidents George W. Bush and Obama -- was 33,490,000. So far in fiscal year 2014, the average is 46,788,311. That’s an increase of 13,298,000 people. Now, looking at as the meme does -- as a ratio -- the number of food stamp beneficiaries was between 1.5 and 3.1 times higher than the number of new jobs. That’s not the type of statistic Obama is apt to broadcast on the hustings, but it’s also far smaller than the 75-to-1 ratio claimed in the Facebook post. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said she can’t think of any other way to make the calculation that would make the meme’s math work. "I can't see a way that this is anything other than false," she said. Anyone continuing to circulate this meme is hereby warned that it is no longer accurate. Our ruling The meme claims that "for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps." The actual ratio is far smaller -- between 1.5-to-1 and 3.1-to-1. That doesn’t put the administration’s economic record in a very flattering light, but the ratio is far lower than the meme suggests. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05451	"Bank of America could create 878,300 jobs with benefits if they spent their 2010 bonuses on job creation."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/25/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-bank-america-bonuses-are-big-en/	We recently noticed a Facebook post that channeled popular anger over bonuses for people who work in the financial industry. It said: "Bank of America could create 878,300 jobs with benefits if they spent their 2010 bonuses on job creation." We wondered if that was accurate. After some Internet searching, we found what appeared to be the source of this factoid. It’s a report called "Big Banks, Bonus Bonanza," released by a coalition of five groups, led by the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU. Here’s an excerpt: "Despite unleashing havoc on the global economy, Wall Street is once again getting ready to pay astronomical bonuses this year. The nation’s six largest banks alone are on track to pay their bankers a staggering $143 billion in bonuses, benefits and compensation ("bonus and compensation"), more than enough to fill the $130 billion total budget gap for all 50 states in (fiscal year) 2011. If Wall Street pumped this money directly into the economy instead of paying it to its bankers, it could create 3.6 million new jobs, and lower the unemployment rate by 2.3 percent. Bank of America tops the list, with $35 billion in bonuses and compensation set aside for its bankers." At the end of the report, the authors added an appendix titled "Potential Job Creation by Bank." The appendix said, "See below to see how many good-paying jobs with benefits big banks could create if they spent their bonus on job creation instead of banker bonuses." In a footnote, the authors added that the figures are "based on a cost of $40,000 per job," although they don't say why $40,000 was chosen. The figure listed for Bank of America? Exactly 878,300 jobs -- essentially the result you get if you divide $35.1 billion by $40,000. But there’s a problem. We were confused by the report’s use of the words "bonus and compensation," since the Facebook post (and the SEIU appendix) referred only to "bonuses." It turns out that the $35.1 billion figure is not simply bankers’ bonuses -- it’s all compensation paid by the company (encompassing salaries, benefits and bonuses) to every employee of Bank of America. That means it includes all compensation paid to executives, tellers, janitors and anyone else you can imagine who works for BofA. The $35.1 billion figure can be found in table 5 on page 27 of the 2011 Bank of America annual report. We confirmed with a company spokesman as well as two outside experts that "noninterest expense" for "personnel" -- which is how the annual report labels the $35.1 billion figure -- means salaries, benefits and bonuses for everyone employed worldwide at Bank of America. Knowing all this, we can calculate how many jobs $35.1 billion in compensation actually created. It’s 288,000 -- the current number of employees at Bank of America. What if you just looked at bonuses alone? How many $40,000 jobs could you get from just by divvying up the company’s bonus pool? The company doesn’t officially release its bonus data, but we did find a Bloomberg news report that estimated that Bank of America paid its investment banking employees about $4.4 billion in bonuses for 2009, citing "a person close to the bank." Dividing this bonus pool into $40,000 increments gets you 110,000 jobs, far less than the 878,300 claimed in the Facebook post, though it’s quite a bit more than the 10,000 people the investment-banking unit actually employs -- many of whom probably earn more than $40,000. Our ruling The Facebook post -- and the SEIU report it was almost certainly based on -- incorrectly said that a pot of money consisted of bonuses when it in fact included all forms of compensation for all employees at the company. That made the mathematical calculation meaningless. Using just the company’s investment banking bonuses would create 110,000 jobs costing $40,000 for a year -- only one-eighth the number claimed in the post. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05816	The cost of a gas tank fill-up has risen $30 since Barack Obama became president.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/20/george-allen/president-doesnt-control-gas-prices/	U.S. Senate candidate George Allen has been reminding voters of sticker shock at the gas pump. In a recent interview, Allen took at shot at President Barack Obama’s energy policies and recalled a time when things were better for American motorists. "We have high gasoline prices which are costing us about $30 more for each fill-up than the cost was when President Obama came into office," Allen, a Republican, said in a Feb. 6 audio interview with the conservative Bearing Drift website. Is that right? Let’s look at the numbers. Dan Allen, a senior advisor for the Allen campaign, pointed to weekly fuel price data from the federal Energy Information Administration, which tracks gas prices. On Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was inaugurated, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $1.83, according to the EIA data. On Feb. 6, 2012, the day Allen’s interview was posted on Bearing Drift, that cost had risen to $3.44. So between those two dates, the price of gas per gallon increased by $1.61. To measure how that translates into higher costs for each fill-up, Dan Allen also sent us links to a Department of Energy website listing the fuel-tank capacity for various vehicles. A 2012 Ford Explorer, an SUV, has an 18.6 gallon tank, which means the cost of filling up is about $29.95 more than when Obama took office. A Dodge Caravan minivan with a 20-gallon tank costs $32.20 more to fill, and a Buick LaCrosse, a mid-size car with an 18-gallon tank, costs $28.98 more to fill up. In the compact car category, Allen’s campaign noted a 2012 Camaro has a 19-gallon tank. That means the Camaro owner is paying $30.59 more. Those are all close to Allen’s number. Of course there are many cars on the road with fuel tanks that hold less than the 18-20 gallon capacities that Allen cites. The gas tank capacity of the Toyota Corolla, which Edmunds.com says is the world’s best selling car of all time, is 13.2 gallons for the 2011 model. That means the owner of that car is paying $21.26 more for each tank of gas than they were when Obama entered the White House. That’s higher than January 2009, but still less than the figure Allen cites. Allen’s statement also implies that Obama deserves blame for the higher gas costs. We ran that past a couple of analysts to see what they thought. "(The president) has very little control over gas prices," said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at gasbuddy.com. "It has less to do with the president’s policies and more to do with supply and demand and the fundamentals of the industry." DeHaan acknowledged that prices risen considerably since Obama took office. But he was quick to add there should "be a massive asterisk" next to that statement. A big reason prices were so low to begin with when Obama became president was because he entered the White House as the U.S. was coming out of an economic downturn, which depresses gas prices, DeHaan said. Ben Brockwell, the director of data, pricing and information services at the Oil Price Information Service, said it’s ridiculous to pin gas prices on any president, Republican or Democrat, saying fuel costs are a "market phenomenon." Brockwell noted that under former President George W. Bush, the price of gas hit its all-time high of $4.16 on July 16, 2008. And, Brockwell noted, Bush wasn’t to blame for that situation either. "The fact of the matter is Obama is no more to blame than Bush was in ‘08 when (oil) prices went to $150 a barrel," Brockwell said. Our ruling Allen said the cost of filling up a tank of gas costs $30 more now than when Obama took office. The price of a gallon of gas is nearly twice what it was when Obama took office. Allen’s use of the $30 figure is a bit of a broad brush, since that assumes the capacities of 18-20 gallon tanks, and many cars have smaller gas tanks. But we don’t think the $30 extra fill-up costs is an unreasonable figure to use, because it would be the higher cost for many cars on the road. But that doesn’t mean Obama is to blame for motorists’ pain at the pump. Analysts told us presidents in general have little impact on the gas prices. The numbers are correct. But Allen is misrepresenting the cause of the increase. Therefore, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-02-20T09:27:57	2012-02-06	['None']
pomt-05095	"(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/30/ron-ramsey/ramsey-says-all-coal-tennessee-above-2000-feet/	For years now, state legislators have been arguing over whether to prohibit "mountaintop coal mining" in Tennessee and the debate is likely to continue next year since the bill failed again in the 2012 session. In the Legislature's off season, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey spoke at a rally for coal mining supporters and criticized a central provision of the bill. "(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet," said Ramsey, as quoted by the Kingsport Times-News at the Abingdon, Va., rally in early June. The Senate speaker has made similar comments in other discussions of the bill (SB577), which prohibits that state Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) from issuing any surface coal mining permits on a site above 2,000 feet in elevation. Where did that figure come from? Dawn Coppick, an attorney, who as legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), helped draft the bill and lobby for passage, says the 2,000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of "ecological subregions." That amounts to a distinct area, in effect counting as a mountain in Tennessee. Basically, everything above 2,000 feet on the Cumberland Plateau is deemed within such a subregion by the Forest Service and, thus, provides a "scientifically sound rational basis" for drawing a line, said Coppick. If the law were passed and challenged in court, judges would look to whether there is a "rational basis" for distinguishing one coal-bearing area from another, she said, and the "ecological subregion" would meet the legal criteria. The Ramsey remark suggests that the legislation, if passed, would effectively block coal mining in Tennessee because all coal is above 2,000 feet in elevation. Is that accurate? Well, no. Supporters of the bill, opponents of the bill and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation uniformly say there is lots of coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. And there are maps that show it.. A TDEC map of the state's coal-mining areas with the 2,000-foot elevation marked shows relatively small portions of the overall coal reserves would be included in the proposed ban. LEAF has a map on its website that is more generalized while making the point more clearly to the viewer. But Chuck Laine, president of the Tennessee Mining Association, says there's an underlying basis for Ramsey's comment in that the only marketable coal that can be gathered by surface mining is above 2,000 feet. A ban on mining above 2,000 feet, he contends, would have the practical effect of prohibiting surface mining in Tennessee. Coal is classified in different grades based on BTUs generated when it is burned, sulfur content, PH balance and moisture content.Currently, Laine said, the only marketable coal is that in the higher grades, known as "thermal coal," which meets Environmental Protection Agency specifications for generating electricity in steam plants such as those operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. "We couldn't sell our lower-grade coal," he said. "It's just not usable... For higher-grade coal, you have to go above 2,000 feet in Tennessee." Coppick, on the other hand, says she knows of no evidence to back up that assertion. Without getting into the merits of the legislation, it still may be appropriate to note the regulatory environment for coal mining in Tennessee. TDEC spokeswoman Meg Lockhart gave this explanation in an email: "TDEC’s authority at mine sites is limited to regulation of discharges and other impacts to waters, which the department controls through the use of permits issued under Tennessee’s water quality law. The United States Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM) issues the permits for the actual coal mining operation. The federal SMCRA permit authorizes the mining of coal as well as the method or type of mining used. "While OSM does allow mining companies to remove earth to reach coal seams, Tennessee does not allow mine spoil to be deposited in Tennessee streams as some other states do -- regardless of the ridge line elevation. Therefore, mountaintop removal mining is not permitted or practiced in Tennessee as it is in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia. "Again, Tennessee water quality laws do not allow mining companies to fill valleys with the spoil as it would impair streams. Instead, this waste rock must be stored and returned to its approximate original contour. This mining method is called cross-ridge mining and the correct term for the activity allowed in Tennessee. Additionally, the spoil must be stored while the coal is removed, then replaced and re-vegetated once mining is complete. During this process, ponds must be engineered to capture runoff and control sedimentation." At present, TDEC has issued 30 permits for coal mining in the state but about half of them are apparently not in use with coal prices down from levels a few years back. The Knoxville office of OSM, in its annual report last year, listed 15 active Tennessee coal mines – five underground and 10 surface. While no breakdown of mine locations by elevation was available from TDEC, Laine says that all of the surface operations are above 2,000 feet. We invited Ramsey and his staff to defend or elaborate on his statement after explaining that it appears to be mistaken. There was no response. It appears the lieutenant governor has erroneously extrapolated from the coal industry's assertion that there is no marketable coal below the 2,000-foot elevation to declare there is no coal, marketable or otherwise, below that level in our state. We rate the statement False.	None	Ron Ramsey	None	None	None	2012-06-30T13:50:52	2012-06-02	['Tennessee', 'Environmentalism']
pomt-05956	"(Newt Gingrich) voted in favor of establishing the Department of Education, and yet he gets in a debate and says we should get rid of the Department of Education and send all the education issues back to the states."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-newt-gingrich-voted-education-dep/	Mitt Romney, who has been accused by Newt Gingrich's campaign of inconsistency, fired back Jan. 23, 2012, in Florida, calling the former House speaker "erratic." One example: "(Gingrich) voted in favor of establishing the Department of Education, and yet he gets in a debate and says we should get rid of the Department of Education and send all the education issues back to the states," Romney told reporters in Tampa. We wondered, did Gingrich vote under President Jimmy Carter to establish the Education Department, then advocate three decades later for its elimination? The vote We asked Romney's campaign for support for his statement. Spokesman Ryan Williams provided us with a record of Gingrich's vote for the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979, which established the federal Education Department. The congressman from Georgia did vote, "Aye," according to GovTrack.us, a website that relies on government sources. We also reached out to Gingrich's campaign but didn't hear back. The debate So, Gingrich voted in favor of establishing the federal department. Did he recently say we should get rid of it? Williams pointed us to the former lawmaker's comments at the Sept. 22, 2011, debate in Orlando. A voter named Stella Lohmann asked candidates a question via video clip, concluding, "What as president would you seriously do about what I consider a massive overreach of big government into the classroom?" Gingrich said: "I think you need very profound reform of education at the state level. You need to dramatically shrink the federal Department of Education, get rid of virtually all of its regulations. "And the truth is, I believe we'd be far better off if most states adopted a program of the equivalent of Pell Grants for K-through-12, so that parents could choose where their child went to school, whether it was public, or private, or home-schooling, and parents could be involved. Florida has a virtual school program that is worth the entire country studying as an example." He didn't say he wanted to "get rid of the Department of Education," as Romney claimed. He said the department needed to "dramatically shrink." What did Gingrich say he would "get rid of"? "Virtually all of its regulations," he said. Not the same thing. Gingrich's campaign website expands on his debate response, saying that he would "shrink the federal Department of Education and return power to states and communities. The Department's only role will be to collect research and data and help find new and innovative approaches to then be adopted voluntarily at the local level." So he did advocate sending "education issues back to the states," as Romney said, though not "all." Gingrich would reserve some limited powers for the federal government. That's not to say Gingrich's positions on education haven't shifted over time. For example, a story this month in the nonprofit-funded Education Week pointed out that Gingrich backed a Republican effort in 1995 to get rid of the Education Department or merge it with the Labor Department. In 2009, he joined with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and civil rights activist Al Sharpton to "call for raising academic standards, lifting state caps on high-quality charter schools and greater accountability." Our ruling Gingrich did vote to establish the Education Department. But he didn't say in a September debate that lawmakers should get rid of it. However, Gingrich's record includes some support for Romney's larger point, that the long-time Washington politician has adapted his positions on education and the Education Department.

pomt-01998	"In Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-iran-1979-extremists-hijacked/	Befitting her previous position as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton’s new book, Hard Choices, ranges across the globe, occasionally looking back into history long before she took the helm at the State Department. For instance, Clinton writes that "in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy." We had always closely associated the Iranian Revolution with Islamic fundamentalism. Was Clinton’s summary correct? We checked in with several scholars who have studied the region, and their consensus was that Clinton was broadly correct, despite a bit of oversimplification. First, some background. The revolution began in the late 1970s, amid simmering discontent among Iranians about Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the autocratic leader who operated a feared secret police. Even as he maintained generally (but not uninterrupted) good ties to the West, his standing at home was deteriorating. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric living in Paris, courted support among critics of the Shah. After a series of strikes and protests, the Shah in January 1979 left for an "extended vacation," never to return home. The handpicked leaders the Shah left behind tried to prevent Khomeini from forming a government, but after the cleric returned to Tehran in February 1979, unrest grew. In mid February, supporters of Khomeini declared a revolutionary state, and within two months, Khomeini won a national referendum. "The strongest images of Iran's revolution come from those early years" of 1979 to 1982, wrote Robin Wright in her 2000 book, The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran. "Many still linger in the minds of outsiders: The demonstrations by rifle-toting mullahs and chador-clad women. The morgue slabs with bullet-riddled bodies of officials from the monarchy and other loyalists who were summarily executed in the course of revolutionary justice. The seizure of the United States Embassy and 52 hostages who, over the next 444 days, were often paraded with crude blindfolds in front of cameras as effigies of Uncle Sam were burned in the background by angry youths. This was the delirium." Largely lost in this popular image is the fact that the revolution’s supporters were not exclusively Islamist -- perhaps not even primarily Islamist. The Shah’s regime had made enemies of leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, democrats and the moderately religious. All of these groups, to one degree or another, were supporters of revolution against the Shah. Clinton "is absolutely correct that the revolution of 1979 was a broad-based revolution against the Shah," said Mohsen M. Milani, executive director of the University of South Florida’s World Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies. "In fact, it was one of the most popular revolutions of the modern era." Gary Sick, an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and author of All Fall Down: America's Tragic Encounter With Iran and October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan, agreed. "The fact is that most of the millions of Iranians who took to the streets to oppose the Shah did not think they were going to replace him with a theocratic state," Sick said. "That was the work of Khomeini and his followers, and it was actively opposed by many of the secular -- and even clerical -- revolutionaries." Some of the historians we checked with took mild issue with the phrase "hijacked," since Khomeini -- who for many Americans personifies Islamic extremism -- was always the central player in the revolution. After all, it’s hard to hijack a revolution you’d always led. But there’s an explanation for this paradox: Initially, Khomeini had openly stated that he was not pursuing a theocracy. "Iran's emergence as a modern theocracy was never written in the heavens," Wright wrote in her book. "Quite the contrary. In earlier pronouncements about a just government Ayatollah Khomeini actually said he didn't advocate clerical rule. … In one of his last interviews before leaving Paris, Ayatollah Khomeini told Le Monde, ‘Our intention is not that religious leaders themselves should administer the state.’ "Once the tumultuous fanfare of his return died down, the Imam seemed almost uninterested in day-to-day government affairs. The ayatollah, already in his late seventies, instead went back to the dusty theological center of Qom. He seemed content to leave politics to the first revolutionary government of secular technocrats. His role was limited to settling disputes." That changed with the effort to write Iran’s Constitution in the fall of 1979. "Fearful that other changes might further marginalize or even exclude them, Ayatollah Khomeini's followers introduced a process to vet candidates' credentials -- a precedent that time and again allowed them to manipulate future elections, too," Wright wrote. "It worked. They won a majority. And the final draft (of the constitution) ended up thoroughly Islamic." Even then, the Islamic revolution wasn’t complete, Wright wrote: "For the first presidential election in January 1980, a full year after the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that no clerics could run for president -- further proof that he still didn't intend to establish a total theocracy. Over the next 18 months, however, Iran was wracked by bloodshed as the ruling clergy and their adjutants gradually eliminated former partners -- leftists, nationalists and intellectuals--from any claim to power." Iran became fully Islamist in October 1981, when the cleric Ali Khamanei won the third presidential election -- the first election in which clerics were allowed to run. "As of October 1981," Wright wrote, "the mullahs were no longer only the supervisors and shadows of the state. They now dominated all its branches." The experts we talked to quibbled slightly with Clinton’s claim, saying it’s a bit oversimplified. Notably, Clinton inaccurately compresses the time frame. The changes she’s talking about didn’t just happen immediately in 1979 but rather played out in an evolutionary fashion for two years after the Shah fell. "If you have to do the whole history in 19 words, it's probably okay," said John Limbert, historian and political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of Iran: At War with History. Stephen Kinzer, a Boston University professor and author of the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future, said Clinton is generally correct that "the Iranian revolution was broad-based, and one faction later seized control, establishing a brutal theocracy." Our ruling Clinton said that "in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy." She’s generally correct, experts say, despite questions over whether "hijacked" is the right word and whether she used an overly broad time frame. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-03024	Says Oregonians for Food and Shelter "proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/11/rick-north/do-two-state-agriculture-groups-have-ties-biotech-/	During the Oregon Legislature’s most recent special session, one bill stuck out as an oddity. Four of the five bills dealt solidly with fiscal policy -- taxes and the Public Employees Retirement System. The fifth, though, addressed whether local governments could regulate genetically modified crops. The bill was thrown in as something of a bargaining chip. Gov. John Kitzhaber needed Republican support for his other four endeavors, and the GMO bill was one way to reach a compromise. This deal, however, rubbed environmentalists the wrong way. They began calling the bill the "Oregon Monsanto Protection Act." One of the bill’s critics was Rick North, the former project director of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility's Campaign For Safe Food. In a piece he wrote for BlueOregon, a liberal political blog, he called out two of the local -- and wholesome sounding -- groups that were big advocates of the legislation. "Oregonians for Food and Shelter and the Oregon Farm Bureau, biotech puppets who have most state Republican legislators in their back pocket, jumped into action," he wrote. "OFS proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies." We were curious about the board member and funding claims, so we decided to take a look. The first bit, that Oregonians for Food and Shelter has board members from those two leading biotech firms was easy to check. We simply went to the group’s website and found, listed along with 34 other voting members, these two names: Michael Diamond, the director of government affairs for Monsanto, and Danelle Farmer, who was most recently listed as a senior state government relations manager at Syngenta. The names aren’t difficult to find -- and they’re listed along with their corporate affiliations. Naturally, we reached out to Oregonians for Food and Shelter to see if they had extra information we might consider. Scott Dahlman, the executive director, said it is unabashedly the group’s position to defend "the right to responsibly use pesticides and biotechnology." Next we checked out the Oregon Farm Bureau funding statement. We started by speaking with the bureau’s spokeswoman, Anne Marie Moss. She said it was probably true because the group has a political action committee that accepts donations from any and all groups. Moss stressed, however, that the Farm Bureau is a largely grassroots organization that takes positions based on what county members -- all of whom are required to be involved in agriculture or ranching -- vote to take up on the state level. "We have members on both sides of that issue as well, but it's like a democracy," Moss said. "Majority rules." Generally, she said, the group tries to support all sorts of agriculture, whether organic or genetically modified, but often members come down on the side of fewer restrictions. "We believe in the whole big tent of agriculture, all types are welcome," she said. There is already "a lot of regulation so, as a whole, we try to push back. We don't want our members regulated out of business." We took a look at the campaign finance records for ourselves and found that both Monsanto and Syngenta had contributed a significant sum to the group. Since 2006, the Oregon Farm Bureau has reported receiving about $440,000 in cash contributions. Of that, Monsanto has contributed $103,500 and Syngenta has given more than $19,000. That means those two companies represent a combined 28 percent of the total reported cash contributions. This year, Monsanto donated $10,500 -- $4,500 in mid-September. During our conversation, Moss noted that while the money is appreciated, "Monsanto couldn't come in and give us a command directive." Indeed, we found donations from other sources, including individual farms and nurseries. For our final stab at due diligence, we called North to let him know we’d looked into his claims. We asked him why he thought this information was important given that both groups consider themselves to be grassroots. "I don't know that it's anything more complicated than ‘Follow the money,’" he said. In an opinion piece for BlueOregon, North said Oregonians for Food and Shelter "proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech." We’ve checked out both claims and found them to be accurate. We rate this statement True. Tell us what you think, by heading over to Oregonlive and leaving us a comment.

pomt-00494	"New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/07/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-ad-claiming-kevin-nicholson-made-1-m/	U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin used a TV ad to attack both Republicans who are seeking to unseat her, but the Wisconsin Democrat trained her heavier fire on former Marine Kevin Nicholson. Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are vying in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary. The winner will take on Baldwin Nov. 6, 2018. In Baldwin’s ad, released online on July 31, 2018, the narrator asserts: New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people. So, Baldwin is portraying Nicholson as being paid big money to play a role in shutting down plants and laying off people. There is a connection. But there is less here than meets the eye. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Associated Press story To back up the narrator’s statement, this headline from an Associated Press news story is shown on the screen: "Nicholson consulted for companies that shed jobs." The AP said in the story, posted eight days before the launch of the ad, that the story was based on information provided by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad. According to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas. Examples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs. To be clear: The article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns. But it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions. The article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns. All of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. What we don’t know An executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies "interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership" and "has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs." And Nicholson’s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a "liberal hack." But Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership. The AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on "management assessment and organizational change initiatives." Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson’s campaign has described his work as "helping companies solve their toughest problems." In short: We simply don’t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. Our rating Baldwin says: "New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people." An Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states. And it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn’t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. In short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don’t know whether Nicholson’s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns. There’s simply no evidence of what he did for those companies. Baldwin’s statement contains only some element of truth — our definition of Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-08-07T09:20:58	2018-07-31	['Wisconsin']

pomt-11161	Says "Obama paid FBI informant over $1 million to do it to Trump."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/24/blog-posting/fake-news-says-obama-paid-informant-trump-russia-p/	As President Donald Trump tweeted that the Russia investigation is fake news, USbreakingnews.net flashed the headline, "BOMBSHELL!! Obama Paid FBI Informant Over $1 MILLION To Do It To Trump!" Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Is it true? No. The facts behind this claim The FBI informant in question has been reported by the Washington Post and others as American foreign policy academic Stefan Halper. According to news reports, the FBI asked Halper to talk to several people involved with the Trump campaign during the summer and fall of 2016. Halper had conversations with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, then foreign policy advisers to the Trump campaign, and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis. Early on in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians in 2016. Trump has said the informant got a "massive amount of money," but we don’t know if the FBI paid him at all. It’s simply unknown at this point. Where is the money coming from? Here’s what the USbreakingnews story got right: Halper received over $1 million to do work for the U.S. government. Washington’s spending database shows the government signed four contracts with Halper totalling $1,058,161 between 2012 and 2016. The dates fall during the Obama administration. Award ID Amount Start date End date Funding office HQ003416P0148 $411,575 9/29/2017 3/29/2018 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003415C0100 $244,960 9/24/2015 9/27/2016 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003414C0076 $204,000 7/31/2014 7/31/2015 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003412C0039 $197,626 5/30/2012 5/29/2013 DOD Office of Net Assessment In the key period in 2016, Halper worked on a study of Russian-Chinese relationships. But the money came from the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment, not the FBI. The Pentagon describes the Office of Net Assessment as "an independent organization within the Department of Defense charged with identifying emerging or future threats and opportunities for the United States." The USbreakingnews piece gets a bit confused on this point. It asks, "Why would anyone receive that kind of money ($1,058,161) from the DOJ?" But the money did not come from the Department of Justice, where the FBI sits. It came from the Pentagon. The article then asks why "someone like Halper" would get such money. Halper’s professional biography gives a few answers. He’s professor emeritus at Cambridge University in England where he lectures on international security issues. He served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Political-Military Affairs in the Reagan administration. The headline says Obama had a direct hand in the payments, but it offers no evidence that Obama had anything to do with the contract awards. Some money came before Trump announced he was running The article’s math is also off. About 40 percent of the money was awarded before Trump even got into the race in June 2015. So even if there were a tie between the contracts and Halper’s conversations with Trump campaign advisers – and there’s zero indication of that — the amount would be less than $1 million. The article strings together a handful of facts to gin up a compelling headline, but nothing holds together. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08151	Last year, Beaverton School District had the highest number of homeless students ever recorded in Oregon.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/04/city-beaverton/beaverton-school-district-claims-record-number-hom/	Beaverton brings to mind terrific Asian restaurants, good schools and traffic hell on the Sunset Highway. It doesn’t often conjure images of homeless children. Yet a recent press release for a city of Beaverton toy drive says the Beaverton School District reported a record 1,580 homeless students last year, as well as other sobering facts belying the district’s wealthy image. "One out of ten children in the Beaverton School District lives below the federal poverty line and more than 37% of the school district's students (over 13,000 kids) receive free or reduced lunch benefits. Last year, Beaverton School District had the highest number of homeless students in the state, 1,580 homeless students, which was also the highest number ever recorded in Oregon." PolitiFact Oregon did a simple search at the state schools superintendent website and found that the figure is correct. The Beaverton School District reported 1,580 homeless students in 2009-10, ranking No. 1 of all school districts. But is that the highest number of homeless students ever reported in the state? The previous year’s figures show that’s not so. In 2008-09, Portland Public Schools -- the state’s most populous school district -- reported 1,706 students without permanent shelter, followed by the Medford School District with 1,126. Beaverton was third with 1,114 homeless students. The 1-2-3 line-up was the same in 2007-08. So last school year, Beaverton was No. 1. Medford maintained its No. 2 spot with 1,139 students homeless. Portland ranked No. 3 with 1,043 students homeless -- about 700 fewer than reported in 2008-09. And no, it’s not as if those students miraculously found low-cost shelter overnight. Apparently, Portland district officials dropped the ball on properly counting heads, as reported in this story by The Oregonian. In other words, we don’t expect Beaverton to hold the top spot when the state education department releases its report next year. Also, while the raw number is big in Beaverton, smaller districts routinely report higher percentages of homeless students. Nearly 13 percent of Klamath Falls’ 3,408 students lack steady housing, and more than 9 percent of Medford’s students are homeless. About 4 percent of Beaverton students are homeless. Asked to clarify, city spokesman Jordan Imlah said, "Our phrasing was off. What we meant was the Beaverton School District had the highest number of homeless students recorded in 2009-10 and the highest ever recorded for the Beaverton School District." Certainly, there are a lot of homeless children in Beaverton, but it’s not accurate to say it was the largest on record in the state. Imlah said he would correct the claim. We rate the statement False. Comment on this item.	None	Beaverton	None	None	None	2010-12-04T06:00:00	2010-11-17	['Oregon']
pomt-04061	Says U.S. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., celebrates gun ownership even in the face of school shootings.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/25/coalition-stop-gun-violence/anti-gun-group-misfires-attack-barrow/	The war over gun control is heating up. Attacks from both sides have been almost continuous since a deranged gunman killed 26 people -- mostly children -- at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. The furor intensified last week after President Barack Obama unveiled a package of legislative proposals and executive orders targeting gun violence. A day after Obama’s announcement, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence got into the fray by attacking a Georgia Democratic congressman on his ties to the National Rifle Association and his opposition to Obama’s gun legislation. The coalition uses U.S. Rep John Barrow’s own 2012 campaign commercial in an attack on him and the NRA. The Washington-based coalition of 48 religious organizations, lobbyist groups and other associations refers to itself as seeking "to secure freedom from gun violence through research, strategic engagement and effective policy advocacy. " Barrow’s original ad, "Nobody," features him brandishing guns owned and used by his grandfather and father. He used it in his last campaign, when Republicans considered his seat vulnerable. Barrow also touts his endorsement from the NRA in the ad. He ends the spot with the comments, "I approved this message because these are my guns now, and ain’t nobody gon’ take ‘em away." The coalition’s video intersperses selective parts of Barrow’s original ad (and comments) with horrific images and news voiceovers from the Newtown massacre. As the video ends, audio from news reports of the names and ages of some of the children killed at Newtown provide a voiceover for the text, "Shame on you, Congressman John Barrow. ... Tell Congressman John Barrow to reject NRA blood money." The coalition put out a news release with the video. In the release, the coalition’s executive director, Josh Horwitz, says that Barrow "has decided to put his love of the NRA above his concern for his fellow Americans." The group noted that during Barrow’s eight-year congressional career, he has received $27,250 in campaign contributions from the NRA. (The coalition has used similar pressure tactics against U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who also criticized Obama’s gun-control policies.) Further examination reveals that the anti-gun group has left out key parts of Barrow’s statements from the original ad. For example, Barrow begins the ad by saying: "I’m John Barrow, and long before I was born my grandfather used this little Smith and Wesson here to help stop a lynching." But the coalition ad leaves off the words "to help stop a lynching." Barrow’s ad also says: "my father always had this rifle real handy just to keep us safe." But the coalition ad leaves off "just to keep us safe." The coalition ad also leaves out a key line Barrow says in his ad: "That’s why I support the Second Amendment." The gun-control group said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia that it stands by the ad. The statement said the coalition was "disturbed to see Congressman Barrow double down on his support of the NRA in the wake of the tragedy at Newtown." The coalition’s goal was to highlight Barrow’s legislative record on guns and his strong ties to the NRA, said Ladd Everitt, the coalition’s communications director. Everitt characterized Barrow’s original ad as insulting to the constituents in his district. Everitt said his group couldn’t find evidence to prove Barrow’s grandfather helped quell an attempted lynching. Barrow’s ad seemed to indicate that it was white armed citizens who vindicated the civil rights of black citizens in the Deep South, and "that narrative of history is a bogus one," Everitt said. Barrow’s original "Nobody" ad was rolled out in October during a highly scrutinized re-election campaign for the conservative east Georgia district. Barrow, the last white Democrat in the U.S. House from the Deep South, is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate, mostly Southern, Democrats that often breaks with the party leadership. The coalition first took note of Barrow last year when he was one of a handful of House Democrats to vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to turn over documents in the botched Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation, Everitt said. The coalition noted that several members of Congress who supported the contempt vote had received campaign contributions from the NRA, including Barrow. The group also disagreed with his comments about Obama’s gun-safety package. "I strongly disagree with proposals that would deny law-abiding citizens their Second Amendment rights," Barrow said in part about Obama’s proposals. The ad’s use of the Newtown images implies that his pro-gun stance is directly related to the Newtown massacre. For his part, Barrow posted a short Facebook message on the same day of the shooting telling his followers that he was "shocked by the news" and asking for prayer for the victims and their families. Barrow declined to comment on the coalition’s ad. But that’s not surprising, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. " I think (Barrow) probably correctly senses that in that district being endorsed by the NRA is probably an advantage," Bullock said. "For a Blue Dog to survive, they have to distinguish themselves from the rest of the Democratic Party. He’ll probably say, ‘yes, a liberal group is saying that I’m tied to the NRA.’ " Being attacked could actually help him win over some voters, Bullock said. So what to make of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence’s ad? The group was attempting to put pressure on pro-gun Democrats critical of the president’s gun-control policies. It took a Barrow campaign ad, doctored the video by splicing in scenes and sounds from the Newtown mass shooting and adding a "shame on you" tagline. Even more egregious, the coalition chose to selectively edit Barrow’s original statements, leaving out key elements that helped explain the congressman’s stance on gun rights. By leaving those parts out, the coalition changes Barrow’s central message supporting gun ownership for protection and self-defense. The group attempted to target Barrow with a highly emotional ad. But it comes across as the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight. The coalition gets our lowest rating on this one. Pants On Fire.

"BREAKING NEWS: Donald Trump On His Way To Donate Kidney To Melania Trump," said a May 14 headline on news-hawaii.com. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Melania underwent kidney surgery May 14, but the story takes the saga further by claiming that a second kidney replacement became necessary after doctors found out during the surgery that both her kidneys were destroyed. "Trump would be undergoing medical examination and if declared fit as a donor, he will proceed to donate to save his wife Melania," according to the story. The story cites a White House press statement as evidence of the procedure, but that was made up, too. We did not find any mention of it on the official White House website. And no other major news outlets reported anything about it. Trump actually tweeted May 14 (the same date the hoax published) that Melania was recovering well after her procedure. "Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!" he tweeted.

pomt-05138	"As Virginia lost over 65,000 jobs, (Tim) Kaine put partisan ambitions first" by serving as DNC chairman during the last year of his governorship.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/22/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-says-virginia-lost-65000-jobs-/	American Crossroads, a conservative advocacy group, is airing a TV ad accusing U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine of abandoning Virginia in 2009 when he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Kaine, in January 2009, was entering the last full year of his governorship when, at President Barack Obama’s request, he agreed to also run the national party. The ad has footage of an airline jet in the sky, a man putting up a "Sorry we’re closed" sign on a business door and a hand pushing a note across a desk saying "You’re Fired!" "As Virginia lost over 65,000 jobs, Kaine put partisan ambitions first" by serving as DNC chairman during his final year as governor, the announcer says. The commercial then shows footage of Kaine speaking with excitement about becoming Democratic chairman. We were curious if Virginia did lose 65,000 jobs during the final year of Kaine’s governorship and, if so, whether the loss can be tied to him becoming DNC chairman. Kaine became DNC chairman on Jan. 21, 2009. His last day as governor was Jan. 16, 2010. American Crossroads -- a political action committee affiliated with Karl Rove, who was senior political adviser to former President George W. Bush -- backed its claim by citing seasonally adjusted job data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS, based on household surveys, estimated that the number of unemployed people in Virginia rose from 240,953 in January 2009 to 306,635 in January 2010. That’s an increase of 65,682. Economists usually rely on different BLS data, gleaned by surveying businesses on their numbers of workers, to measure changes in the number of jobs. A BLS quarterly census of jobs and wages shows a drop of 84,197 drop employees in Virginia between January 2009 and January 2010. So, yes, Virginia lost more than 65,000 jobs during that last year of Kaine’s governorship. But is Kaine to blame? The ad implies he focused on being DNC chairman and left the state defenseless against the job losses. What happened in Virginia, however, was no different from what occurred nationwide. The U.S. was limping out of a severe recession that started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. From January 2009 to January 2010, U.S. unemployment rose by 2.9 million people, according to the seasonally-adjusted BLS figures. The national unemployment rate soared from 7.8 to 9.7 percent during that time, an increase of 1.9 percentage points. In Virginia, the unemployment rate increased 1.5 percentage points during that span -- from 5.8 to 7.3 percent. BLS figures show that every state saw an increase in the number of unemployed residents during the timeline Crossroads cites. The 1.5 percentage point rise in Virginia’s unemployment rate was lower than the jobless rate jump in 31 states. As we’ve noted many times, economists tell us governors have a small impact on their state economies. Governors tend to get too much blame when the economies are doing poorly and too much credit when things are going well. Our ruling American Crossroads said that while Kaine was governor and chairman of the DNC, Virginia lost more than 65,000 jobs. That number checks out and we could make an argument that the job loss was higher. But every state saw unemployment rise from January 2009 to January 2010. Virginia’s unemployment rate remained well below the national average. Governors have little control over their state economies in good times or bad. The suggestion that Kaine could have inoculated Virginia from a national recession had he not been DNC chairman is unrealistic. On balance, we rate American Crossroad’s claim Half True.

pomt-08044	"In 1998, nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders were functionally illiterate. Today, 72% of them can read."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/03/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-touts-education-gains-wall-street-journal/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is taking to the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal to offer some unsolicited advice to the nation's new crop of governors. Tend to the economy, he says, but don't ignore education. In an opinion article published on Jan. 3, 2011, Bush wrote that states need to better hold teachers and students accountable, and discussed Florida's successes in implementing standardized testing and expanding school options for some students through voucher programs. Bush said the programs are showing results. "In 1998, nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders were functionally illiterate," he wrote. "Today, 72% of them can read." In this fact check, we're seeing whether Bush is right. Bush made education issues a hallmark of his two terms as governor, and has continued to push education reforms since leaving office. He founded the Foundation for Florida's Future, an education think tank that supports increased school options for students through voucher programs and holding schools and teacher more responsible for student outcomes. The foundation was a vocal supporter of SB 6, the controversial "teacher tenure" bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed in 2010. Foundation spokeswoman Jaryn Emhoff said Bush's statistics come from the National Center for Education Statistics, a data-collecting arm of the U.S. Department of Education. The center each year charts students' progress in different subject areas through a National Assessment of Educational Progress, which measures students periodically in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography and U.S. history. Which students are tested and in what subject varies each year. Fourth-graders were tested in reading in 1998, like Bush said. Their most recent test was in 2009. The test groups students into one of four performance levels -- "Advanced," "Proficient," "Basic" or "Below Basic." In 1998, Florida had one of the lowest average reading scores for fourth-graders in the country (Only Hawaii and the District of Columbia had scores that were significantly lower), according to the assessment. Only 23 percent of students received scores that rated "Proficient" or "Advanced," while 31 percent of test takers received a score on the test that rated "Basic." The rest of the test takers, 46 percent, received a score of "Below Basic." Now contrast that with 2009. That year, only 27 percent of test takers received a score of "Below Basic" -- a 19 percentage point improvement. That means 73 percent scored "Basic," "Advanced" or "Proficient." And the average test score in Florida in 2009 was among the top 10, according to the assessment. The average nationwide score also improved since 1998, but not as much. Bush's numbers are backed up by education department statistics, but we also have to check his characterization that fourth-graders who receive a rating of "Below Basic" are "functionally illiterate." What is "functionally illiterate?" This gets a little confusing -- whether you're literate or not. First, there is no definition of "Below Basic" that accompanies the National Assessment of Education Progress. Instead, the assessment has definitions for only the other three ratings. See for yourself here. Andrew J. Kolstad, a senior technical adviser for the assessment division at the National Center for Education Statistics, said the rating is simply meant to indicate that a tester is less than "Basic." Here's an explanation of what a "Basic" rating means: Fourth-grade students performing at the Basic level should demonstrate an understanding of the overall meaning of what they read. When reading texts appropriate for fourth-graders, they should be able to make relatively obvious connections between the text and their own experiences and extend the ideas in the text by making simple inferences. For example, when reading literary text, they should be able to tell what the story is generally about — providing details to support their understanding — and be able to connect aspects of the stories to their own experiences. When reading informational text, Basic-level fourth-graders should be able to tell what the selection is generally about or identify the purpose for reading it; provide details to support their understanding; and connect ideas from the text to their background knowledge and experiences. Kolstad said, for instance, that a student can be able to decode the words of a text, or "read," but not be able to make obvious connections between the text and their own experiences. That wouldn't make them illiterate, Kolstad said, but would mean they receive a "Below Basic" rating on the assessment. Emhoff, with Bush's foundation, said she believes that "Below Basic" is defined as functionally illiterate, while "Basic" is reading at grade level. And so on. That leaves us with trying to define functionally illiterate, which isn't so easy either, especially for a fourth-grader. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines a functionally illiterate person as "one who cannot engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his own and the community's development." That doesn't mean they can't read, necessarily. Our ruling All this may seem like semantics, but the definitions here are important. Here's what Bush wrote: "In 1998, nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders were functionally illiterate. Today, 72% of them can read." The contrast here can be read to mean that nearly half of Florida's fourth-graders couldn't read in 1998, and now, 72 percent can read. But that's not true. Close to half of fourth-grade students in Florida failed to meet a "Basic" level of reading as defined by the federal government in 1998. In 2009, that number fell to 27 percent -- meaning 73 percent of test takers were able to make the "Basic" reading level. Those are more complex definitions compared to being functionally illiterate and being able to read. That said, Bush's column also makes the broader point that reading scores in Florida have improved dramatically since 1998. And there's no question about that. Florida has gone from almost the worst to one of the best. In trying to boil down a complicated topic for a mainstream audience, Bush probably picked the wrong words. But his point is valid.

pomt-01637	"The growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas has nearly doubled that of the nation since President Obama has taken office."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/26/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-celebrates-growth-women-owned-business/	In an email blast, Greg Abbott’s campaign said Texas businesses owned by women flourished with Barack Obama in the White House. Abbott, the attorney general and Republican gubernatorial nominee, wasn’t saluting the Democratic president. In the July 10, 2014, email message, Kim Snyder, Abbott’s deputy campaign manager, called Texas the "land of opportunity – especially for women." Texas does better than other states, Snyder wrote, adding: "Let’s compare: the growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas has nearly doubled that of the nation since President Obama has taken office." A reader, bringing the email to our attention, wondered about the described growth rates. To our inquiry, Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta said by email Abbott’s near-doubling reference was based on reports by American Express OPEN, which American Express describes as the leading payment-card issuer for small U.S. businesses. According to the 2013 State of Women-Owned Businesses report, Huerta said, there were 8,617,200 woman-owned U.S. firms, including 737,300 in Texas, in 2013. In 2007, AMEX said there were 7,793,139 woman-owned firms nationally and 610,007 in Texas, Huerta said. "Based on these numbers during the 2007-2013 period, which is approximately the time President Obama has been in office," Huerta wrote, "the number of woman-owned firms grew by ~10.57% nationally, and by ~20.87% in Texas – nearly double the rate of growth." A hitch in this giddyap: Obama’s first term as president began in 2009. Still, we spotted the cited estimates in the report, which said its tallies were based on an outside firm's extrapolations starting from U.S. Census Bureau business surveys taken every five years; the government’s latest available figures trace to the 2007 surveys. The report said: "Data from the past three census surveys – 1997, 2002, and 2007 – were collated, analyzed and extrapolated forward to 2013, factoring in relative changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) not only nationally but also at industry and state levels," with the GDP data coming from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Upshot: Nationally from 1997 to 2013, the report said, the number of women-owned firms increased by 59 percent – and women-owned firms in Texas increased by 93 percent, the second-highest growth among the states behind the 112 percent surge experienced in Georgia. "The states with the greatest number of women-owned firms are, naturally, the most populous states," the report said. "California is home to the greatest number of women-owned firms in the country, and is the only state in which there are 1 million or more women-owned firms... California is followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Rounding out the top ten are Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Michigan," the report said. Nationally, women-owned firms account for 29 percent of all enterprises, the report said, but women-owned firms also only employ 6 percent of the country’s workforce and contribute just under 4 percent of business revenues—roughly the same share they contributed in 1997. To our inquiry, the Michigan-based researcher behind the report, Julie Weeks, said by phone the growth in women-owned businesses in Texas has outpaced growth nationally, but it’s meaningful to look at how states compare in the number of employees in women-owned firms and annual revenues, a metric that Weeks folds in with growth rates as "combined economic clout." By her clout measure, averaging together rankings of growth in the number, revenue and employment of women-owned firms, Texas ranked 11th among the states and the District of Columbia for 1997 through 2013, according to the 2013 report. Weeks told us an updated report, drafted at the time Abbott’s camp sent out its email blast, shows Texas ranked ninth in 2014 by the clout measure. A March 26, 2014, press release announcing the 2014 edition said Texas enjoyed a 98 percent spurt in women-owned businesses from 1997 into 2014, a growth rate second only to Georgia’s 118 percent. Among the nation’s 25 most-populous metropolitan areas, San Antonio had the No. 1 combined economic clout score from 2002 into 2014, the release said. A spokeswoman for AMEX Open emailed us a chart showing trends in the growth of women-owned firms nationally and in Texas from 1997 into 2014. From 2007 to 2014, the figures indicate a national growth of 17 percent in women-owned firms; Texas saw a 24 percent increase. However, AMEX spokeswoman Elisha Stavropoulos said state-by-state figures weren’t published at the time Abbott’s email blast went out; see the report, posted online in August 2014, here. Source: AMEX Open, August 2014 Another perspective For another assessment, we reached California-based economist Alicia Robb at the recommendation of the advisory National Women’s Business Council, a federal body. In April 2014, Robb co-authored a paper for the council cautioning that less than 30 percent of U.S. businesses are owned by women and only 12 percent of the firms employ anyone other than the owner herself. Only 2 percent of such firms have 10 or more employees, the paper said. By email, Robb told us Weeks’ methodology was adequate for estimating the growth rate in women-owned businesses, but she said that indicator alone isn’t very meaningful since any growth would look impressive considering how few businesses were previously women-owned. It’s "a bit misleading in that the NUMBER of businesses is increasing at a faster rate, but that is more a reflection of the lower base," Robb said. "If you look at growth in sales, employment, and payroll, women-owned businesses are actually growing more slowly" nationally "based on the most recent" data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A chart in the 2014 paper indicates women-owned firms generated 4 percent of all U.S. business receipts in 2012, amounting to no change from five years before. Nationally, according to the paper, the number of women-owned businesses escalated by 65 percent from 1997 into 2012, outpacing the 44 percent increase in all businesses. Then again, the 66 percent growth in receipts for women-owned-firms trailed an estimated 91 percent growth in total U.S. business receipts, the paper said. Our ruling Abbott said the "growth rate of women-owned businesses in Texas has nearly doubled that of the nation since President Obama has taken office." A reasonable estimate shows the described growth rate in Texas was nearly double the national rate from 2007 into 2013. Then again, Abbott’s trumpeting of Texas under Republicans versus the country under Obama also pokes at the last two years of George W. Bush’s presidency, which the Abbott email didn’t acknowledge. Also, the implied message that women-owned businesses are booming ignores that most women-owned firms remain extremely small and don’t generate huge revenues. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01384	"Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman (Bruce) Braley has been there by 2.7 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/15/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-praises-iowa-economy-compares-it-weak-u/	During an Oct. 11, 2014, debate, Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley -- who are facing off in one of the nation’s most pivotal Senate races -- sparred over the economy. At one point in the debate, Ernst compared "Washington, D.C., ways" with "Iowa values." She pointed to "records of failure coming from this administration, and followers like Congressman Braley, versus our Iowa values and the way we have conducted business in the last four years. With my good supporter, (Republican Gov.) Terry Branstad, we have implemented strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job-killing regulations, and a balanced budget, and we are putting more of our hard-working Iowans back to work with new, good-paying jobs. Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent." But we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States valid? We took a closer look. (Ernst’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) 'Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States.' On the first part of the claim, Ernst has a point, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal government’s official source of data about personal income. In the most recent quarter for which data is currently available -- the second quarter of 2014 -- personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 percent over the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states had faster growth -- Nebraska (2.7 percent), North Dakota (2.7 percent) and Idaho (2.5 percent). But some context serves to undercut the significance of this achievement. The statistics for such short periods of time tend to be "noisy" -- that is, the numbers bounce around a lot. As an illustration, let’s look at the statistics for the couple of quarters before the 2.4 percent increase. Moving backward one quarter at a time, personal income growth in Iowa clocked in at -0.6 percent, -0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa. To effectively detect genuine trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let’s take a look at how Iowa did for full-year periods rather than quarters. Between full-year 2012 and full-year 2013, Iowa had the 18th-highest percentage change in personal income among the 50 states, which is quite a bit weaker than the fourth-place finish Ernst cited. Iowa fared even more poorly between 2011 and 2012, when the state ranked 43rd nationally. This, too, is quite a different picture than the one she painted in the debate. 'Nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years … by 2.7 percent.' Not if you look at median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly wage nationally in 2013 -- the most recent full year available -- was $776, up from $671 in 2008. Once you adjust the 2006 figure for inflation in 2013 dollars, it works out to be $775.37 -- meaning there was basically no change at all between 2006 and 2013. It’s virtually the same if you inflation-adjust the data for 2005 -- there’s no significant change in median weekly earnings between 2005 and 2013. "What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of employed Americans started rising again in 2010, is that real wages are basically flat," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Meanwhile, the comparison Ernst offered -- of strong Iowa growth amid national stagnation -- is flawed, for two reasons. • She’s comparing two different statistics. Personal income and real wages aren’t the same thing. Real wages are a component of personal income, but not the only one. They are derived from separate data sources, and they use very different methodologies. • She’s comparing two different periods of time. You can’t simply compare the most recent quarter with the past eight years and get a meaningful contrast. It’s comparing apples and oranges. All this said, Ernst does have a point: Real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years then they have nationally. If you start the clock in 2005, real wages in Iowa increased by 1.6 percent by 2013, and if you start the clock in 2006, they increased by 1.8 percent by 2013. And she also has a point that stagnant real earnings growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she exaggerates by blaming this situation on Braley. (Lots of factors shape the economy beyond just one minority-party member of Congress.) Our ruling Ernst said that "Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent." Iowa did rank fourth nationally in personal income growth, but only for the most recent quarter, and when compared to earlier quarters, this high rate seems like a statistical anomaly. Meanwhile, she’s wrong that real wages declined by 2.7 percent over the past eight years, although she does have a point that Iowa did somewhat better on this score than did the nation as a whole. Equally problematic, Ernst’s comparison between Iowa’s economy and the nation’s is questionable because it appears to compare quarterly data for one statistic to eight years of a different statistic. Economists say this isn’t a sound method. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08257	"The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/11/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-workers-paid-120000-private/	During the 2010 campaign, some Republican candidates criticized the federal workforce for being overpaid and bloated during a recession. Rand Paul, the newly elected senator from Kentucky, reprised the theme in the Nov. 7, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year," Paul said. "The average private employee makes $60,000 a year." We investigated this question 10 months ago, when we looked at a statement by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., that "federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts." At the time, we ruled it False. But we're taking a fresh look. We found that the answer to whether federal workers are paid more than private-sector workers is actually pretty nuanced. Right off the bat, we need to mention that while Paul's statistics are based on real numbers, his phrasing is problematic. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal statistics-gathering agency, federal worker compensation in 2009 averaged $123,049, which was double the private-sector average of $61,051. That's a gap of almost $62,000 -- and is pretty close to what Paul said on This Week. However, that figure includes both salary and benefits. This is a legitimate number to raise, but using it requires more explanation than Paul gave it. Since most people usually think about how much they, their spouses and their colleagues get paid in salary alone -- not salary plus benefits -- we think most people hearing this statement would assume that Paul means that the average federal employee gets paid a salary of $120,000. That's simply not true. That said, there's still a gap between federal and private-sector pay if you strip out the portion that's in the form of benefits. BEA found that federal civilian employees earned $81,258 in salary, compared to $50,464 for private-sector workers. That cuts the federal pay advantage almost exactly in half, to nearly $31,000. Case closed? Not at all. Several additional caveats are required. The first is that there's an imbalance in the types of jobs that make up the federal workforce compared to the private-sector workforce. The federal workforce is disproportionately composed of employees with higher educational attainment. Think of all the low-wage burger-flippers, gas station attendants and domestic workers in the private-sector economy. The federal government has some of these types of employees but proportionately far fewer -- especially after nearly two decades of aggressive contracting-out of duties that need not be handled by salaried federal employees. This has further expanded the federal government's disproportionately large numbers of lawyers, scientists and other highly skilled professionals. If the federal sector today is hiring a lot of people with specialized expertise and the private sector is hiring a lot of people with skills that don't require a college, or even a high school, degree, then it's no surprise that the average salary levels in each sector are going to be at odds. So the fairer way to compare pay is by an apples-to-apples comparison of equivalent jobs. A widely referenced study by USA Today attempted to do this. The newspaper found that "overall, federal workers earned an average salary of $67,691 in 2008 for occupations that exist both in government and the private sector, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The average pay for the same mix of jobs in the private sector was $60,046 in 2008, the most recent data available." Doing this calculation reduces the federal pay lead over the private sector even further, to $7,645. More strikingly, however, the USA Today study found that federal pay was higher than private-sector pay in four out of every five job categories that existed in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors. This would seem to be strong evidence that the federal government pays better than the private sector. But caution is warranted here, too. This comparison involves jobs with the same title, but nothing beyond that. And there are any number of factors -- employee seniority, job duties and the number of employees in the comparison -- that could explain the pay differences in jobs with the same title. So the data is not a perfect match. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that "there are certainly many positions where the federal job is compensated less generously than comparable positions in the private sector. These tend to be the most demanding jobs in the federal service -- doctors, attorneys, scientists and senior executives. The U.S. Secretary of Education, for example, is paid far less than the presidents of major public and private universities, even though he has far greater responsibility." Despite Paul's exaggeration of the numbers, critics of federal compensation patterns do have some valid points. For instance, Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that federal pay has risen faster than private-sector pay in recent years, despite the recession. "BEA data show that average federal salaries rose 58 percent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 percent increase in the private sector," he writes. But let's return to Paul's assertion. Paul said that the "average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year." Most people hearing that would assume he was talking about salary alone, but he was talking about total compensation, including benefits such as retirement pay and paid holidays. Although studies show federal employees typically earn more than their private-sector counterparts, the difference is nowhere near as much as the doubling Paul says. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-08304	Says Nick Kahl made it harder for many families to cover basic health care expenses.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/31/matt-wand/republicans-try-turn-health-care-tax-and-children-/	Just a couple weeks back, House Democrats were picking on one Republican incumbent for sponsoring a bill that would have ended a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums -- and, as a result, cut off the funding stream used to insure 80,000 Oregon children. Now Republicans are trying to turn the tables and use that 1 percent tax -- and children -- against Democrats. In a recent mailer, Republican candidate Matt Wand in Oregon’s 49th District tells voters that his Democratic opponent was making it harder for children to get insured. Wand’s mailer -- and a similar one sent by Mark Johnson in the 52nd District -- features a young, wide-eyed boy and the words "His illness just got a little harder to pay for." The mailers go on to say that (depending on the district) either Nick Kahl (49th) or Suzanne Van Orman (52nd) "supported a new tax on health care, making it harder for many families to cover basic heath care expenses." Since we had so much fun checking out the initial health care ad, we figured why not look into this one. First things first: According to legislative records, Kahl, along with Van Orman, did indeed vote for House Bill 2116. That bill instituted a "health insurance premium assessment." For those of you who like government speak in plain talk (we sure do) that’s the 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums levied against insurance companies but ultimately passed onto consumers. As Johnson sees it, that means less money in Oregonians’ pockets, and therefore less for paying medical bills. "I don't think there's any way to deny that employees ... will have fewer dollars to take home," he said. But this 1 percent tax -- and its impact on families -- is begging for some context. In terms of insurance premium increases, a 1 percent bump may not exactly be welcome, but, according to the state, it’s a small part of what typically are higher annual rate increases. Not all of the increases for 2010 have been submitted, but so far they range from 8 to 17 percent, according to the Insurance Division of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. In 2008, some Oregonians saw increases of nearly 30 percent. Again, a 1 percent increase isn’t negligible, but given these numbers, it doesn’t account for most of the increases Oregon families see. "Not every consumer can afford to pay the increase," Wand says. "How many additional children have become uninsured as a result of the increases in premiums?" But there’s one last thing to consider in this debate: the cost of the uninsured. That 1 percent tax went toward eventually insuring 80,000 children. Now, it might not seem as though insuring those kids has any sort of effect on anybody other than those kids, but there are some indications that say otherwise. Yet another health care report, this one by John McConnell of Oregon Health & Science University and Neal Wallace of Portland State University, says the cost of caring for the uninsured -- which often takes place in hospital emergency rooms -- accounts for 6 to 9 percent of the average health insurance premium. Numbers about how much children contribute to that total are hard to come by, but a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation study from 2004 looked at numbers from 1998 through 2000 and estimated that, overall, there was about $40.7 billion in uncompensated health care spending during those years. Of that, $5.4 billion came from uncompensated care for children. Those figures are in 2004 dollars. Because of this indirect cost, Democrats could -- and do -- argue that insuring these 80,000 children will, over time, lead to a slowdown of premium increases. Of course, as Wand points out, that’s no help to families today. Now, for the ruling. While it’s true that the new 1 percent tax is being passed onto consumers, it’s also true that this tax is helping insure 80,000 children. What’s more, the 1 percent is small compared with average premium increases, and there’s an argument to be made that insuring these children will eventually lower the cost for everybody. There’s a grain of truth in the Republicans’ claim that their opponents are "making it harder for many families" to cover basic health care expenses, but it’s missing so much context that we rate this claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11156	"Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/25/shannon-watts/do-more-7-10-police-bullets-miss-their-mark-gun-co/	Calls to arm school teachers grew louder after a gunman at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school on May 18 killed eight students and two teachers, and injured 13 others. Second Amendment proponents, with backing from President Donald Trump, say putting guns in the hands of volunteer personnel would make schools safer. But gun control advocates argue the proposal would lead to dangerous unintended consequences. "Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers," Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, tweeted May 21. "It's on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We're sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers' profits." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Watts may have a point that the average armed teacher might be less accurate than a trained cop. But her claim that trained police hit their target "less than 30 percent of the time" is not as clear-cut as Watts suggests. New York Police Department For starters, national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available. But we found data on some individual jurisdictions, including several major metropolitan police departments. An aide to Watts pointed us to a 2008 Rand study that looked at the accuracy of New York Police Department officer-involved shootings. The key data point is the "hit rate," the number of rounds that struck a suspect divided by total shots fired. The Rand study looked at NYPD firearm-discharge reports from from 1998 through 2006. Some of the findings point in Watts’ favor, while other data refutes her point. Hit ratios were below 30 percent for gunfights (18 percent) and from long ranges (23 percent from more than seven yards away). However, in cases where suspects did not return fire, NYPD officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time. Accuracy levels were above 30 percent when the target was seven yards away or closer (37 percent). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Recent data shows a further uptick in the NYPD’s hit rate compared with the Rand study. Inspector Kevin Maloney, who headed up the NYPD unit that oversees police-involved shootings, told the New York Daily News in December 2017 that the NYPD fired a record low number of rounds that year. The department’s hit ratio also exceeded those in the 2008 Rand study in 2017. NYPD cops fired 170 shots and hit their targets 75 times, for a hit ratio of 44 percent for the year, as of Dec. 21, 2017. In 2016, police landed 107 of a total 304 shots fired, a hit ratio of roughly 35 percent. Again, Watts said the hit rate was less than 30 percent. Los Angeles Police Department Recent data from the Los Angeles Police Department further undermines Watts’ claim. According to the LAPD’s 2016 report, the average annual hit ratio from 2012 through 2016 was 33.4 percent, with a substantial uptick in 2016. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com "With a lot of training and reform, LAPD has a hit rate of 48 percent (in 2016). That is likely at the high end of hit rates," said Gregory Ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. "Their number of rounds per incident is also way down in the last five years." Other jurisdictions In a 2006 study, Michael D. White, a criminology professor at Arizona State University, provided a roundup of hit ratio data from various jurisdictions and timeframes. (This data is quite old but we provide to give a broader cross-section of jurisdictions.) JURISDICTION HIT RATIO TIMEFRAME 155 Michigan police departments 27% 1976 to 1981 New York Police Department 26% 1987 New York Police Department 31% 1988 New York Police Department 23% 1990 Los Angeles Police Department 56% 1970s Los Angeles Police Department 28% 1980 to 1988 Metro-Dade, Florida 31% January 1984 - June 1988 Memphis 25% 1991 San Antonio 100% 1991 San Francisco 100% 1991 "Hit rates vary notably across police agencies but rarely exceed 50 percent," White wrote. "The research examining shooter accuracy overwhelmingly debunks the Hollywood myth of police officers as sharp shooters who can wing suspects in the shoulder or leg or shoot weapons out of suspects’ hands." Firearms training varies across jurisdictions. Some major metropolitan police departments require officers to qualify up to four times a year on handgun marksmanship and undergo simulated training exercises. Police experts say that armed teachers should also be forced to undertake specialized and repeated training regimens. "Simply putting a gun on the premises and hoping someone’s going to do the right thing with it is baseless," Chris Grollnek, a former law enforcement officer who specializes in security issues told the PBS Newshour. "All you’re doing is signing people up for PTSD." Trump first proposed arming teachers following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 14 students and three staff members, and wounded 17 others. Administration officials in March said the White House wants to partner with local official to give teachers and other volunteer school personnel "rigorous firearms training," but offered few details on a concept that has been embraced by the National Rifle Association. Neither the White House nor NRA responded to requests for a comment. Our ruling Watts said, "Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time." By saying less than 30 percent, Watts is distorting the facts. A national figure for police marksmanship is not readily available. Overall, data from some jurisdictions supports Watts’ claim, while other data refutes it. This claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-12175	Says Scott Walker "wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives" to Foxconn "to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/02/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsin-offering-pay-more-it-will-collect-taxes-/	Amid the euphoria over the announcement that a company promising $10 billion and 13,000 jobs will set up shop in Wisconsin, questions have been raised about whether the state is giving away too much in incentives in order to close the deal. "Diligence Required on Foxconn Job," warned a headline on a July 28, 2017 blog post from One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group that claims 96,000 online supporters. But the post itself went further, opening with this salvo: Gov. Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue. Think about that. Gov. Walker proposes we pay about $70 million more a year in incentives to a foreign corporation than will flow back to our state coffers. Does that sound like a good deal to you? So is that really the deal: Taxpayers pay up to $250 million a year to get the manufacturing plant, but get back only $181 million a year in tax revenue? This claim is essentially correct on the two numbers, but it leaves out a big part of the equation. The deal Two days before the blog post, Walker joined President Donald Trump and other officials at the White House to announce that Foxconn, after considering several other states, had decided to put the first liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing facility in North America in Wisconsin. The displays would be made for computer screens, televisions and the dashboards of cars. Walker tweeted that the company, perhaps best known for making Apple’s iPhone at factories in China, would be bringing 13,000 jobs to the state. We rated his claim Half True. Foxconn itself has said only that the plant will create 3,000 jobs, "with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs." Much hinges on the company’s pledge to invest $10 billion, in exchange for $3 billion in incentives from the state. The numbers To back its statement, One Wisconsin Now pointed us to reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said the $3 billion in incentives could be doled out at a rate of $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years; and that the state expects to collect $181 million in state and local tax revenue annually. But it stands to reason the state wouldn’t approve a losing deal without expecting something more. And that’s what we heard from the economic and tax experts we talked to. They agreed that Walker is making the deal not only to get the Foxconn plant, but the many other businesses, jobs and related economic activity that is expected to be triggered by such a massive development. The Walker administration estimates "at least 22,000 indirect and induced jobs throughout the state" and an economic impact of least a $7 billion per year. The massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue. "That’s what the state is banking on," Marquette University economics professor Abdur Chowdhury said, referring to what some call the "multiplier effect." Whether Foxconn follows through in full on its promises, and to what extent it will generate other economic development in Wisconsin, of course, remains to be seen. Chowdhury cited Foxconn’s promises in other places that didn’t come to pass. And two other experts -- Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., and Steven Deller, interim director of the Center for Community and Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin Extension -- told us they think estimates on the Foxconn multiplier effect are too rosy. But whether Wisconsin is making a good deal isn’t part of this fact check. Our rating One Wisconsin Now says Walker "wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives" to Foxconn "to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue." Walker does want to offer $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years in incentives in order to get Foxconn to put its plant in Wisconsin, and the estimate is that the project will produce $181 million per year in tax revenue. But what’s left out of the statement is that Walker and others are pursuing the deal in large part because the massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue.

pomt-00514	"After (Jeb) Bush’s two terms in office, Florida’s graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/24/dan-gelber/after-jeb-bush-floridas-graduation-rate-was-dead-l/	Jeb Bush often talks about how Florida’s graduation rate was abysmal when he became governor and has since risen. But former state Sen. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, says that the state's graduation rate was nothing to brag about when Bush left office -- or today. "In 1998, when a newly elected Gov. Bush and a compliant Legislature started Florida’s ‘education revolution,’ our graduation rate was among the lowest in the nation," Gelber wrote in a June 21 Miami Herald op-ed. "After Bush’s two terms in office, Florida’s graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom." He’s right that Florida’s graduation rate was among the lowest in the nation when Bush entered office in January 1999. But when Bush left in January 2007, was the state’s graduation rate "dead last," and does it remain near the bottom today? The answer depends upon which ranking we examine. Was Florida’s rate ‘dead last’ when Bush left office? Bush did battle over what the state’s actual graduation rate was while in office. And Gelber was on the other side of that fight. In 2005, multiple news reports stated that Florida ranked 50th in graduation rates at 56.8 percent. The ranking came from Kansas-based Morgan Quitno Press, which compiled data to come up with annual state rankings on multiple topics. It used data from the National Education Association and the federal government to examine the number of public high school graduates compared with the number of ninth-graders four years earlier. (Morgan Quitno was later acquired by Congressional Quarterly.) Back then, Bush pointed to the Florida Department of Education’s data that showed a graduation rate of 71.9 percent. Florida counted GEDs and special education diplomas, boosting the rate above Morgan Quitno’s, which only counted standard diplomas. That method drew criticism, and now the state only counts standard diplomas. Overall, Bush disputed the rate cited by Morgan Quitno but not the ranking. However, in 2005 Bush announced that Florida signed a compact with 48 states to create common definitions for graduation rates to allow for state-by-state comparisons. Gelber said he found that the state held the 50th-place ranking in 2004 through 2006 using the Morgan Quitno annual data. There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates but those that are most often cited in recent years are methods used by the U.S. Education Department and by Education Week, a respected education publication. To see if Florida was "dead last" when Bush left office, we looked at those measures, and by both methods, when Bush left office, the state’s graduation rate was near the bottom of the pack but not "dead last." The Education Department’s average freshman graduation rate provides an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate within four years of starting ninth grade. Florida was at 62.1 percent in 1997-98, the school year before Bush took office. It was 63.6 percent in 2005-06, Bush’s last full year in office. Four states were lower than Florida in 2005-06, making Florida 45th: Mississippi: 63.5 percent; Georgia: 62.4 percent; Louisiana: 59.5 percent; Nevada: 55.8 percent; South Carolina: 61 percent (based on a projected graduation rate). Education Week does its own analysis of graduation rates based on standard diplomas. (Read about their methodology here about their cumulative promotion index). In 2005-06, Florida’s rate was 57.5 percent, placing it 47th, ahead of New Mexico, Georgia and Nevada. So Florida wasn’t dead last according to two major rankings, but it did rank low. "I think the big picture here is that every data series you use shows the same basic trend – Florida is real close to the bottom, however the numbers are added up," University of Iowa education professor David Bills said. We sent Gelber a summary of our findings. "Any argument that we were 49th or 48th versus 50th under other equally reliable calculations doesn't alter in any way my statement and, more importantly, doesn't change the sorry state of Florida education after Jeb's alleged education revolution," Gelber responded. Does Florida’s graduation rate remain 'near the bottom' today? To examine if Florida’s graduation rate remains near the bottom, we turned to the most current data we could find comparing states’ graduation rates. Since 2010-11, the federal government has used a cohort method, which examines how many students receive a standard diploma within four years. Florida's rate was 76 percent in 2012-13, below the national average of 81 percent. Only seven states had a lower rate -- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon -- while two, Mississippi and Washington, were tied with Florida. This isn’t to say that Florida hasn’t made any progress. The graduation rate has increased in Florida since Bush started in office, but it has also risen nationally, which means Florida’s ranking compared with other states hasn’t changed that much. Richard Rothstein, a research associate at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that it’s not a good idea to attribute changes in graduation rates to any particular governor. "The biggest predictor of graduation rates is the preparedness with which children come to school in kindergarten. If you know how prepared they were, you can predict graduation rates 12 years later. To the extent Bush had any influence on graduation rates, you should look at rates a decade after he left office. And for rates when he left office, look to the social, economic, and educational environment of the previous governor." Bush left office in 2007. Our ruling Gelber said that "after Bush’s two terms in office, Florida’s graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom." Gelber cited Morgan Quitno data which showed Florida was 50th in 2004-06. But other data sources -- the federal government’s method and Education Week -- showed that Florida was near the bottom of the pack in Bush’s last full year but not dead last. Gelber is on more solid ground when he said that Florida "remains near the bottom." In 2012-13, only seven states had a lower rate, while two were tied with Florida, according to the federal cohort method. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01884	The Obama administration estimates the number of children at the border is "going to increase to 150,000 to 200,000 next year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/08/raul-labrador/rep-labrador-administration-predicts-150-200000-ch/	As the number of children stopped at the southern border passed the 50,000 mark so far this year -- and as public concern and media attention surged -- the Obama administration asked Congress for an additional $3.7 billion to turn the numbers around and avert a humanitarian and political crisis. The tensions between treating children as children and fending off partisan sniping over immigration policy were evident when Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared this Sunday on Meet the Press. Johnson repeatedly refused to say whether most of these unaccompanied minors would be be deported. Johnson’s go-to phrase was that the goal "is to stem the tide." This led U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, to accuse Johnson of "making things up." "He's saying that he's going to be able to stem it, and it's not going to reach 90,000 or between 60,000 and 90,000 children," Labrador said. "That's not going to happen. The own administration estimates are that it's going to be about 60,000 to 90,000 this year, that it's going to increase to 150,000 to 200,000 next year. These are their own estimates." Labrador’s comment drew a lot of attention and we wanted to check whether the administration predicts that 150,000 to 200,000 children will come to the United States, illegally at the southern border. (We can’t know, of course, what the number will ultimately be; here, we’re simply checking whether the administration offered those numbers.) There are estimates and there are estimates Labrador’s spokesman, Todd Winer, said the source was a May 2014 internal memo from Deputy Border Patrol Chief Ronald Vitiello. According to news reports, the memo said that "90,000 minors would be apprehended this year and 142,000 next year." Both the Washington Times and the Washington Post carried that story. Winer argued that since about 16 percent of people crossing the border evade detection, the actual figure would be higher. We did the math. If 142,000 children were stopped at the border in 2015, then the total who made the attempt would be nearly 170,000. However, the 170,000 figure does not come from the administration -- it is Labrador’s extrapolation from an internal memo. So Labrador's low-end figure is higher than the number in the memo. To add another wrinkle, the agency in charge of the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told PolitiFact that it has no estimate for 2015. "How many will be coming, we don’t know," a spokesperson said. "It’s a fluid situation, and we just don’t have a number right now." When the internal memo became public in June, an agency official said it was "an internal, incomplete working document, neither signed nor made official." Still, if the administration lacks an official estimate, this is nonetheless an unofficial estimate within the administration and it is using current trends to build a budget for next year. In May, the Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee to put them on notice that the money requested for 2015 would be $2.28 billion, about two and a half times more than previously expected. The letter said these numbers were uncertain and "given the fluidity on the ground, could increase or decrease over time." That projection was based on the "assumption that the month-over-month rate of increase in arrivals that we have been experiencing over the past year will continue." Based on Customs and Border Protection data, the number of children at the border doubled between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014. (Fiscal year 2014 has not ended, so they used the same months from both years.) If the flow stays the same through the rest of the year, we might see about 72,000 children at the border for all of fiscal year 2014. If the rate continued to rise between 2014 and 2015 as it did in the previous year, the total could would double again, or reach about 144,000. That suggests where the Border Patrol chief might have derived the estimate in that internal memo and why the White House suggested it might need twice as much money. A fluid situation Jeanne Atkinson is executive director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network and was part of a delegation from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that visited Central America last fall. She said there is a great deal of speculation about where the numbers will go. "I have heard numbers over 100,000," Atkinson said. "I’ve not heard the 200,000 number, and given all the changes the administration is talking about, the goal is to reduce the number." The government is talking about processing these children more quickly, warning parents in the key Central American nations these children are fleeing from (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) and taking other steps to reduce the flow. We checked with several law professors who focus on immigration and none of them had heard of the estimate Labrador cited. Kevin Johnson, a law school dean and professor of immigration and refugee law at the University of California-Davis said, "I am not aware of any careful statistical analysis of past and current migration trends that support any reasonable estimates of future flows of migrants from Central America, much less any reliable statistical analysis at all suggesting that we would see 150,000-200,000 migrant children coming from Central America next year," Johnson said. David Martin, who teaches at the University of Virginia School of Law, also expressed skepticism. "I’d guess this is just a straight-line projection applying the growth rate we’ve seen this year," Martin said. "But the administration is trying hard to break and reverse that trend." Our ruling Labrador said the administration’s own estimates predicted that 150,000 to 200,000 unaccompanied children would show up at the southern border. Labrador’s spokesman pointed to an internal memo that suggested 142,000 children might arrive in 2015. But that’s a smaller amount than 150,000 and much smaller than 200,000, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection says that memo was a working document and not an official estimate. A preliminary budget request was based on the assumption that past increases would continue, but it did not state a particular figure for the number of children and noted that the money needed would change depending on the shifting situation on the ground. Labrador’s numerical range could be right if you add the percentage of people who cross the border without getting caught. But even if you do, that is not the administration’s "own estimate." And experts we interviewed cast doubt on Labrador’s figure. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Raul Labrador	None	None	None	2014-07-08T16:56:07	2014-07-06	['None']

pomt-04184	Says Texas passed a state ‘Dream Act’ before any other state.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/12/juan-hernandez/juan-hernandez-says-texas-was-first-pass-state-dre/	Texas’ political future isn’t necessarily painted Democratic blue, according to Juan Hernández, the co-founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas. Asked by the Dallas Morning News in a Nov. 8, 2012, interview whether demographics will soon change the state’s Republican hue, Hernández said, "No, because I see Texas [Republicans] moving very quickly to incorporating Hispanics." Among his examples: "Texas passed a state DREAM Act before any other state in the nation," he said. "So Texas is different." By phone, Hernández confirmed that he was talking about a law PolitiFact Texas has examined several times. In 2001, Texas lawmakers passed (almost unanimously) and Gov. Rick Perry signed into law a measure allowing certain immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children to attend state colleges and universities at the tuition rates charged to legal in-state residents. Hernández, a Fort Worth native and Mexican-U.S. studies professor who was tapped in 2001 to be Mexico’s special adviser on migrant affairs, said he was among many who supported the legislation. Though sometimes called the "Texas Dream Act," the law is much narrower in scope than the national DREAM Act proposed in various forms since 2001. The federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, said a June 22, 2012, PolitiFact story, also pertains to certain children brought to the United States illegally by parents or relatives. But the national legislation would create a new way to give those immigrants legal status and avoid deportation, if they have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military. State law does not (and cannot) change their legal status. Texas’ law only requires that the students sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. Twelve other states have tuition laws like Texas’, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures website, enacted in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. One provision in the act sought to prevent states from giving a tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to all legal U.S. residents -- that is, legal residents of other states, who pay a higher "out-of-state" rate. But the language was unclear, the NCSL site said, and "there is no guidance in congressional report language or in federal regulations." Some states reacted by passing laws to allow the tuition benefit for certain illegal immigrants -- typically those who had attended high school in the state and intended to apply for citizenship. Other states, the NCSL site said, passed legislation banning illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates. Both types of law have been challenged in court. The national DREAM Act includes language to repeal the murky federal provision. Was Texas first to put the tuition benefit into law? Yes. "In June 2001, Texas (HB 1403) was the first state to pass legislation allowing in-state tuition for immigrant students," says the NCSL site in a report updated Nov. 28, 2012. Next, it says, were California, Utah and New York in 2001-02; Washington and Illinois in 2003; Kansas in 2004; New Mexico in 2005; Nebraska in 2006; Wisconsin in 2009; Maryland and Connecticut in 2011. Oklahoma granted the benefit in 2004, then rescinded it in 2008. Texas barely edged out California, though. According to California’s legislative information site, Assembly Bill 540 was approved by both Senate and Assembly on Sept. 14, 2001, then signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Oct. 12, 2001. Texas House and Senate journals for the 2001 session show that versions of House Bill 1403 cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1 on April 23, 2001; the Senate amended it, then approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001. Three days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2. Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001. Was this state law a "Dream Act," even though it could not change students’ legal status? Perry spoke of the "Texas dream" in a speech soon after he signed the law, telling the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it "so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in‑state tuition and take part in the Texas dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future." A Nov. 15, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas law is "commonly referred to as the Texas Dream Act." We trawled through more news stories on Nexis.com, where the first such reference we spotted was a 2004 description of "Texas’ Dream Act." Thereafter, we found many in other states, usually referring to similar in-state tuition proposals. In California and New York, however, stories from 2007 through 2011 reserved the term for legislation going further than the tuition laws already on those states’ books -- granting eligibility for financial aid or drivers’ licenses, for example. Hernández agreed the Texas law is not equivalent to the national legislation. When he was helping advocate the state law, he told us, "we didn’t call it the Dream Act." But there is common ground, he said. "We’re talking about the same kids, and we’re talking about finding ways to live a life in this nation," he said. "I think that’s why many of us say it’s a type of Dream Act." Our ruling Hernández said Texas was the first to pass a state DREAM Act. Texas was the first state to permit in-state tuition for certain children in the country illegally. But like other states’ laws, its measure did not -- could not -- go as far as federal versions offering a possible path to citizenship. The state laws are not DREAM acts.

pomt-03532	Says the word "Dhimmitude" is on page 107 of the health care law and means "Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/30/chain-email/dhimmitude-page-107-health-care-law-exempts-muslim/	Have you ever heard of "Dhimmitude"? A chain email claims "dhimmitude" is on page 107 of the health care law, and it means Muslims will be exempt from the health care law. We don’t want to keep you in suspense, so we’ll tell it to you straight: The word "dhimmitude" is not in the health care law. We know this because of our previous reporting on the law, and also because we did a full-text search on both the main law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and a companion law (the Health Care and Reconciliation Act). It’s not in either one. What is "Dhimmitude"? Well, here’s what the email claims: Dhimmitude -- I had never heard the word until now. I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting. It's on page 107 of the health care bill. I looked this up on Google and yep, it exists. It is a REAL word. Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam. ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States. Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be ‘gambling,’ ‘risk-taking,’ and ‘usury’ and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivable, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude. I recommend sending this on to your contacts. American citizens need to know about it. We turned to a reputable reference book, The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. It does not contain the word "Dhimmitude," but it does include the word "dhimmi." The dictionary says that dhimmi is a historical term used to describe a "non-Muslim under protection of Muslim law," which could include Jews, Christians or Hindus. Adult male dhimmis were required to pay taxes and follow regulations on dress, occupation and residence. In return, dhimmis received "security of life and property, defense against enemies, communal self-government, and freedom of religion practice." The dictionary notes that dhimmi status has lost relevance in the present day because of the rise of nation-states and modern legal codes. Some call "‘dhimmitude" the condition of non-Muslims being subject to Muslim rule, but the word seems to be a recent coinage of academics and commentators. We won’t dwell at length on the concept of dhimmis or of dhimmitude, since neither word is part of the health care law. The email goes on to claim that the health law specifically exempts Muslims. But that’s not the case either. The health care law has a general exception for religious conscience (see page 128). But it does not mention any particular religion, denomination or sect. During the debate over the law’s creation, the people most often mentioned as wanting an exemption were adherents of Christian Science, a faith that prefers prayer to conventional medical treatment. Our fellow fact-checkers over at Factcheck.org dug even deeper into the question of religious exemptions. They looked at religious groups that have filed for religious conscience objections over Social Security’s payroll taxes; the health care law defines the criteria for religious conscience exemptions in a similar way. Using a Freedom of Information Act request, Factcheck.org found in 2010 that no Muslim groups have requested religious conscience exemptions for payroll taxes. Moreover, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations told Factcheck.org that he had never heard of Muslims having religious objections to health insurance. "I have health insurance. We give health insurance to our employees. Every Muslim group I know of does the same thing," he said. Finally, we’ll note that the email claims Christians who don’t want insurance will face "crippling IRS liens" or "face hard prison time." This is also plain wrong. Members of Congress did not want the penalties for going without insurance to be too strict, so the law specifically states that people who fail to pay the penalty "shall not not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty" nor may government officials "file notice of lien with respect to any property" (page 131). In fact, this email is wrong on just about everything: The word "dhimmitude" is not in the law. Muslims are not specifically exempted. And if anyone is exempted, it’s a small number of Christian groups. For promoting absurd notions and wild fabrication, we have three words: Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c1619e80-19f5-4804-a3c6-94a8a875f051	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-05-30T17:40:18	2013-05-29	['None']

pomt-04602	"Since President Obama took office, over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/20/americans-tax-reform/americans-tax-reform-claims-88000-ohioans-have-los/	Jobs numbers are among the most common statistics used in political claims because they have proven to be a potent issue in campaigns. Americans for Tax Reform -- the group led by Grover Norquist that is best known for its Taxpayer Protection Pledge opposing all tax increases -- makes a jobs number the most prominent claim in a brochure it mailed to Ohio voters this month. "Since President Obama took office, over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs," the brochure states in large type. It links the figure to "wasted spending" by the federal government and "not enough jobs." PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim. The brochure cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment statistics, as the source for its figure. PolitiFact Ohio contacted Americans for Tax Reform. Its staff said it specifically used the area unemployment statistics for Ohio from January 2009, the month Obama was inaugurated, and July 2012, the most recent figure that was available on Aug. 29, the day it accessed the data. The BLS table shows that there were 5,440,511 employed Ohioans in January 2009, and 5,351,943 employed in July. Simple subtraction shows 88,568 fewer employed Ohioans, a net loss of jobs that backs up ATR's claim. But fully understanding the ATR claim requires putting that number in context. As the mailer says, "it’s important for Ohio to get the whole picture." In this case, context is important because the brochure criticizes Obama for what it says is wasteful spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the ‘stimulus,’ that didn’t yield jobs that were promised. It urges voters to call the president and "tell him to help the economy by cutting government spending and reducing taxes, and urge him to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge." Some background will help: The Great Recession started in December 2007, before Obama took office, and had its official end in June 2009. Job losses in Ohio started in February 2008 and continued every month until December 2009, when Ohio employment hit bottom, according to BLS data. Almost twice as many jobs were lost in Ohio in the year before Obama's inauguration -- 173,632 -- as happened on his watch, in the time frame used by ATR's brochure. Because Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office. That month also was when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus specifically cited in the brochure -- was signed into law, on Feb. 17, 2009. That’s important to know because ATR surrounds the job-loss claim with examples of stimulus projects to bolster the notion of wasteful spending. The timeline ATR used for job losses in Ohio predates the stimulus law by a month. Using the February figure of 5,414,966 working Ohioans reduces the total job losses through July 2012 to 63,023, more than 28 percent below the claim in ATR's brochure. Why such a big difference? The months surrounding the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included some of the most rapid job losses of the recession. Meanwhile, a seasonal comparison of employment figures, from July 2009 (the first month after the official end of the recession) to July 2012, actually shows Ohio has added more than 42,000 jobs. It's worth noting that several other figures also appear on the BLS table. They show the number of unemployed Ohioans dropping by 93,472 -- from 511,409 to 417,937 -- between January 2009 and July 2012. Ohio’s labor force also shrank in that period, from 5,951,920 to 5,769,880. The unemployment rate, which hit its low of 10.6 percent in July 2009, dropped from 8.6 percent in January 2009 to 7.2 percent last July. So where does that leave the Americans for Tax Reform claim that 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs since Obama took office? The statement is partially accurate. It correctly cites the number of jobs lost in Ohio between January 2009, the month Obama was sworn in, and July 2012. But including January in that count also means including a month in which Obama was not president for the first two-thirds of it. And it includes a month and one-half of time that predates enactment of the stimulus law, something the brochure clearly is targeting. And the statement ignores the trend line of an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs when Obama took office but began heading upward, albeit slowly.

pomt-04434	Says Julie Parrish "voted to divert $160 million from public schools to private for-profit schools."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/13/carl-hosticka/did-julie-parrish-vote-send-160-million-private-pr/	One of the fiercest legislative fights in 2011 had to do with a bill that loosened enrollment restrictions at online charter schools. It was a battle mostly along party lines and now House Bill 2301 has cropped up in a competitive House race in Clackamas County. Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, is the freshman incumbent. Her Democratic opponent is Metro councilor Carl Hosticka of Tualatin. In a September guest column published in the West Linn Tidings, he listed a number of Parrish’s many legislative failings -- in his view -- including this one: "During this time of cuts in public education, my opponent voted to divert $160 million from public schools to private for-profit schools," Hosticka wrote. Parrish asked for a PolitiFact ruling, with this tart remark: "Online schools are public schools, not private. And I'm not sure where he gets the $160M diverted to for-profit schools as again, while they are contracted out, these are still part of the Oregon public school system." Solid questions. Both major party candidates are claiming to be the education advocate in the race. We plowed on. The controversial legislation was approved as part of a compromise deal involving charter school advocates in the House Republican caucus and Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. What readers need to know for this PolitiFact is that the legislation loosened restrictions on online enrollment, authorizing up to 3 percent of a school district’s population to attend a virtual school. There are an estimated 560,000 Oregon public school students in grades K-12, which means the legislation would allow up to 16,000 students to enroll in online academies. However, there’s nowhere near that number in virtual schools; enrollment grew from 4,200 students in the year before the legislation to 5,400 students the year after. Enrollment figures for this fall are not available yet. In Oregon, the money follows the student, from the state to school districts, and then from the school district to a traditional school or charter school. For charter schools, the amount is roughly $5,200 a student a year, compared with $6,000 for a student at a traditional school. The 5,400 enrollment figure translates into $28 million going to online schools in a single year, 2011-12. That is a fraction of the $160 million estimated over two years, a budget period that Hosticka didn’t clarify in his statement. We do, however, find his $160 million estimate based in fact, since 16,000 students multiplied by $5,200 comes out to $166 million for a two-year period. So if the maximum number of students allowed by the legislation were to enroll in online schools, at least $160 million would go toward those online schools over two years. We’ll put aside the question of whether that’s cherry-picking on the part of Hosticka. We want to know whether those schools are "private for-profit?" The answer is no. By definition, charter schools -- both brick-and-mortar and online -- are public schools. They are sponsored by a public school district, or the state. They use public money to educate students, who pay nothing. (Private schools, on the other hand, charge tuition and can do such things as require students to attend religious services, which a public school could not do.) Where does the "private for-profit," language come from? There are fewer than a dozen online-only schools in Oregon and most number enrollment in the hundreds, if that. The largest virtual school is Oregon Connections Academy, out of Scio. The school is run by a nonprofit corporation and board, but it’s part of the Connections Academy network, whose parent company is Connections Education, which is now part of Pearson. Connections Education LLC is a private, for-profit entity based in Baltimore, Md. The second-largest virtual school is Oregon Virtual Academy, out of the North Bend School District, which contracts with K12 Inc. Hosticka stands by his statement that $160 million will be diverted from public schools. "She’s trying to hang me on a technicality, whether it’s a public school or a for-profit school. You can make the argument it’s an amalgam of both," he said. "It’s technically a charter school, but then they contract with a for-profit company for education. I’m prepared to stand by this statement that $160 million would end up at for-profit schools." We ran the statement by various education groups in Oregon, and received two very different responses. "In terms of a diversion, absolutely. You’re taking from one pot and putting it in another, taking it from neighborhood schools that are already struggling and passing it to for-profit, private, out-of-state companies," said Becca Uherbelau, spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, the union that represents school teachers but not the ones at charter schools. Then there’s Sue Levin, executive director of the advocacy group Stand For Children. She is not an advocate of charter schools or virtual charter schools, and she offers no opinion on their quality. But the schools are part of the public school system. "He’s trying to create an impression that in a tight budget, actual dollars were taken out of the state schools funds but that is absolutely not the case. That is misleading, and particularly in the environment that schools are in, it’s pretty inflammatory," Levin said. Clearly there’s a wide difference of opinion on what deserves to be part of our taxpayer-paid public school system. There are arguments that online schools are not very effective as well as arguments that they are a lifesaver for children who can’t attend a physical school. But Levin, who doesn’t particularly champion them, is right. Like it or not, online charter schools are public schools, so we’re not sure how $160 million can be "diverted" from public schools. The money cited is also the maximum amount, should 16,000 children overnight enroll in online classes, which nobody expected to happen and which didn’t happen -- so $160 million is overblown. Hosticka’s statement contains an element of truth, we’ll give him that. The two largest online charter schools in Oregon exist because of private companies that want to make money. But charter school advocates have the Oregon Department of Education on their side: Online schools are public schools. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13438	Says Hillary Clinton and millennials have the same positions on climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability. "Donald Trump doesn't."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/18/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-millennials-agree-clinton-not-trump/	Young voters carried Barack Obama to victory in the past two elections and felt the Bern for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. But polls show they’re not exactly transferring their enthusiasm to Hillary Clinton. The 69.2 million millennials — typically defined as adults under age 35 — now make up the second-largest age block in America after the Baby Boomers. While Clinton still leads Donald Trump among young voters, polls show sizable portions of millennials now backing Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson and Green Party’s Jill Stein. (In comparison, third party candidates received about 3 percent of the vote in 2012.) Clinton’s trouble connecting with millennials prompted NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press to ask Clinton’s running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, how the campaign could rebuild the Obama coalition and win swing states without them. Kaine agreed that that young voters are crucial, but laid out "five litmus test issues" that should convince them to get with her. "Do you believe in climate science or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe women should be able to make their own health care decisions, or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in immigration reform or don’t you? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in LGBTQ equality? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. And finally, do you have a plan to deal with college affordability? We have one. Millennials need one. And Donald Trump, with Trump University, has ripped off students," Kaine said. Does Clinton have more in common with the youth than Trump on the five issues Kaine laid out? We asked the Clinton campaign and Trump campaigns for data showing how millennials feel about the various issues. We didn't hear back from the Trump side. A Clinton spokesman sent us a report that surveyed millennials in only 11 swing states. In addition, it used questions phrased to favor Democratic talking points, such as asking about "making the wealthy pay their fair share" and "implementing common sense gun safety rules." We will not be using those results. But the campaign later sent us other polling data. In addition, we did our own search. Here's what we found. Climate science Kaine’s assertion on climate change is largely accurate. Recently, a 2014 Gallup survey found that 58 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds believe global warming's effects have already begun. About a year later, a national poll conducted in 2015 by Harvard's Institute of Politics found that 55 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet is warming and emissions "from cars and industry facilities" are to blame. But 20 percent said that, although the planet is warming, natural changes in the environment are to blame, which is at odds with the consensus of the experts. Twenty-three percent believe global warming is a "theory that has not yet been proven." Clinton has called for more pollution controls, investing more in clean energy and cutting "wasteful" tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Trump's website doesn’t include a position on climate change. However, the site has reposted a PBS Newshour article that says Trump regards climate change as a hoax. And as we reported in June, during a May 26 energy policy speech Trump advocated rescinding "all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan" and said he would "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs." Women's health care Kaine said that women should be able to make their own health care decisions. Few people would disagree that women — or men for that matter — should be able to make their own health care decisions. In a political context, Kaine’s comments indicate Clinton’s position in favor of abortion rights. A 2014 poll by the nonpartisan organization PRRI (formerly the Public Religion Research Institute) in Washington found that 55 percent of millennials thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The same level of support is seen in people under 68. Only older Americans showed less support for abortion, with 43 percent of people over 67 saying it should be legal. Similarly, when Gallup surveyed abortion attitudes in 2015, it found that 53 percent of people age 18 to 34 identified themselves as "pro choice," versus 52 percent of 35- to 55-year-olds and 47 percent of people over 55. Once again, that puts millennials in the Democratic camp, but not by an overwhelming amount. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin subsequently directed us to a Fox News survey taken last week that found 61 percent of registered voters under age 35 reported being pro-choice. Clinton, as with most Democrats, supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion. Trump doesn't address abortion on his website, but he’s said in interviews that he opposes abortion in most cases. In a March interview, he said women who have an abortion after it’s outlawed should received "some form of punishment," but he backtracked on the idea after widespread criticism. Once again, the Clinton-Kaine team seems to be in synch with at least a bare majority of millennials. Immigration Immigration is another issue where the stances of Trump and Clinton diverge dramatically. Trump has made the removal of illegal immigrants his signature issue. He wants to build a wall across the southern border and change the law that dictates that if you are born in the United States you automatically become as U.S. citizen. Clinton, in contrast, has called for legislation to allow some of those living in the United States illegally to remain, especially young adults brought to the United States as children. Most — criminals are a major exception — would be eligible for an eventual path to citizenship. On the issue of the wall, millennials are firmly against Trump. According to a 2016 PRRI survey, 70 percent oppose it, compared to 52 percent of people age 65 and older. Only 11 percent of Americans age 18 to 29 support identifying and deporting illegal immigrants (it's 23 percent for people age 65 and older), according to a 2015 PRRI poll; and 69 percent of younger voters support a path to citizenship, as do 58 percent of seniors. More recently, a Fox News poll taken in last August found that 87 percent of respondents under 35 favored setting up a system for illegal immigrants to become legal. Only 11 percent supported deporting as many as possible. Also, Trump seems to be out of step with the younger people in his own party, 63 percent of whom support a path to citizenship and only 20 percent want mass deportation. LGBT equality Polls show millennials overwhelmingly support gay rights, which is a plank of Clinton's platform. But Kaine is exaggerating when he suggests Trump is totally against LGBT equality — the Republican nominee has given mixed messages on the issue. An August GenForward survey, conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago and the AP-NORC Center, found that young voters (defined as age 18 to 30) strongly supported LGBT individual rights including equal employment rights (90 percent), HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (92 percent) and LGBT adoption (80 percent). According to a May 2016 Pew report, 71 percent of Americans born after 1981 favor same-sex marriage (as do 55 percent of all Americans). Clinton’s LGBT promises mirror the attitudes of millennials in the GenForward survey. She calls the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage in 2015 as a "landmark victory" for the country. Kaine, for his part, signed an executive order that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in Virginia in 2006, his first year as governor. Equality Virginia, the commonwealth's LGBT organization, called him a friend and major ally in an editorial to the Advocate. Trump, meanwhile, has vowed that he "will do everything in my power to protect LGBT citizens" in his speech at the Republican National Convention. He often criticizes the Clinton Foundation for taking donations from governments that oppress gay men and women. But Trump opposes gay marriage and has said in interviews during the Republican primary that he would appoint judges that would reverse the Supreme Court ruling or allow states to decide. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights groups that endorsed Clinton, points out that Trump’s running mate is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who passed a 2015 law that allowed businesses to refuse to serve gay and lesbian customers based on religious freedom; the law was modified after an uproar. College affordability Trump isn’t against making colleges more affordable, but polls show millennial attitudes on higher education costs are more closely aligned with Clinton’s than Trump’s. Many millennials say college affordability is a top issue, according to a USA Today/Rock the Vote survey, and the vast majority say higher education should be debt free (77 percent in a poll commissioned by Bankrate Inc., a financial services company). Under Clinton’s college affordability plan — retooled with input from Sanders in June 2016 and seen as a grab for his millennial voters — families with incomes less than $85,000 will pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities, with the income cap increasing to $125,000 by 2021. Clinton’s plan also addresses student debt refinancing. Kaine focused on complaints lodged against Trump University in his Meet the Press interview. We found that Trump University received a D-minus rating from the Better Business Bureau in 2010, the last time the consumer watchdogs gave any rating at all. Trump has been vague about his own college affordability plans. In an Iowa town hall in November 2015, he suggested he would create "some governmental program" to help lower-income families pay for school. He promised to "work with all of our students who are drowning in debt" during the Republican National Convention. His website does not list college affordability as an issue, but Trump’s policy advisor Sam Clovis floated a few ideas in a May interview with Inside Higher Ed. Clovis said the campaign thinks student loans should be "market driven," and said colleges should "have skin in the game" and share the risks associated with student loans. Clovis rejected proposals for free higher public education. Our ruling Kaine said Hillary Clinton and millennials believe in climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability but "Donald Trump doesn't." Reputable polls back Kaine’s claim, though the VP nominee is overstating the extent of Trump’s opposition to gay rights and college affordability. Millennials agree decisively with Clinton’s position on immigration, gay rights and college affordability, and by narrow margins on climate change and abortion rights. We rate Kaine’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cb26be5e-6bc8-40b9-8ea0-d1b04acf2a8a	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-09-18T18:18:13	2016-09-18	['None']

pomt-06587	Says "our taxes have doubled" with Rick Perry in office.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/sep/26/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-our-taxes-doubled-under-rick-perry/	CORRECTION, 4:45 p.m. Jan. 17, 2012: This fact check originally presented per-capita state and local sales tax collections for 2000 and 2010 attributed to information from the U.S. Census Bureau. But, as a reader helpfully pointed out, those figures solely reflected state taxes. This article has been revised accordingly. The changes do not affect our rating of the statement. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, asked if he credits Texas Gov. Rick Perry for job gains in their home state, replied : "Not quite." At the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express Republican presidential debate, Paul continued: "I'm a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he's been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple." We’ve reviewed claims about spending and debt in Perry’s decade-plus as governor. For instance, state spending from all sources went up nearly 79 percent between 2000-01 and 2010-11, though adjusted for population and inflation, the increase was 18.2 percent. Also, as we noted last year, raw debt doubled, though last month we rated Mostly True Perry’s claim that Texas has the fourth-lowest per-person debt of any state in the nation and the lowest per-person debt of the big states. Until Paul piped up, we hadn’t heard that taxes doubled under Perry. Paul’s campaign offered no direct backup to his tax claim, though spokesman Gary Howard pointed out news and opinion articles on Perry’s 1987 vote as a Texas House member for the biggest tax increase in state history and on 2006 legislation Perry signed into law that increased cigarette taxes by $1 a pack, overhauled the state’s business franchise tax and changed how the state taxes the sale of used cars, all toward covering the costs of a statewide one-third cut in local school property taxes. Later, Paul’s campaign told us he’d been referring at the debate to a doubling in his own franchise taxes. We requested, but did not field, elaboration. The Perry-approved revamp of the state's corporate franchise tax shifted businesses from a 4.5 percent tax on a company's profit to a new approach. The change reduced the so-called margins tax rate to 1 percent while broadening its application to the annual revenue of qualifying companies minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, the cost of employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue. When it was adopted, the revamped tax was expected to bring in $5.9 billion in fiscal 2008—about a 90 percent increase (not quite double) over fiscal 2007. In fact, the tax brought in $4.5 billion that first year, a 45 percent increase. The tax continues to underperform. Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, cautioned against judging the franchise tax in isolation, reminding us by email that the 2006 changes "never would have been proposed, and most certainly never would have passed, had (they) not been linked to a $7 billion (statewide) property tax cut." Craymer’s point: "The overall package was a net tax cut. It was intended to be a $2.5 billion a year tax cut, but ironically because the franchise tax proved to be a smaller tax than anticipated, it ended up being a $4 billion tax cut." We’re not suggesting that Perry has a no-new-taxes’ record. As noted in a November 2010 fact check, Perry approved other tax hikes as governor including a 2 percent tax on the retail sale of fireworks to help fund a rural volunteer fire department insurance fund and a 1 percent tax on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. And tobacco users were hit again in 2009, when the Legislature voted to tax smokeless tobacco on weight rather than price, "generating additional revenue of $105 million over two years," according to a May 28, 2009 Dallas Morning News news article. According to a December 2009 report from the Legislative Budget Board, some of the new revenue helps repay medical-school loans for doctors who agree to practice in under-served areas of the state. The rest was to be used to help offset franchise tax revenue that was lost when the Legislature temporarily exempted 40,000 businesses. Phew. Take a breather? Our previous reporting did not gauge whether taxes doubled. To explore this aspect, we turned to annual cash reports from the Texas state comptroller’s office. In fiscal 2001, the year Perry succeeded George W. Bush as governor, the state collected $27.2 billion in taxes. In fiscal 2010, the latest completed fiscal year, the state gathered $35.4 billion in taxes. So, unadjusted for inflation, state tax collections increased over most of Perry’s time as governor by about 30 percent. The annual reports also include per-person calculations, yielding another way to compare changes. In fiscal 2001, the state collected $1,283 per resident. In fiscal 2010, the state reaped $1,404 per resident, an increase of about 9 percent, not adjusting for inflation. Separately, the U.S Census Bureau calculated per-capita state taxes collected until a few years ago. In 2000, the bureau says, state government in Texas collected $1,315 per person, a rate that was the 49th lowest among the states. In 2010, state government collected $1,567 per person; we reached this figure by dividing the bureau’s tabulation of Texas state taxes collected that year, nearly $39.4 billion, by the state’s April 2010 population of 25.1 million. Another approach: The non-partisan Tax Foundation, based in Washington, annually estimates how much residents of each state cough up for state and local taxes. In 2000, the foundation says, Texans were taxed at an effective rate of 7.1 percent; meaning that many cents of every dollar in income went to state and local taxes. That year, the foundation says, each resident paid about $2,214, on average. In 2009, the latest year checked, Texans paid an effective rate of 7.9 percent; the per-person amount of taxes paid was $3,197--up 44 percent from 2000, though that’s 17 percent adjusted for inflation. Foundation economist Mark Robyn agreed there doesn’t appear to have been a doubling in taxes. He added in an interview: "I’m not saying there’s no possible way you can slice the data to get a doubling... I don’t know if there is a way." We sure didn’t find one. The most that Texas taxes might have increased while Perry was governor is 44 percent, which is 17 percent when inflation is weighed. Maybe Paul’s personal taxes doubled and he can show that’s also Perry’s fault. Paul provided no such evidence. Generalized, his claim about taxes under Perry is so far off, it’s smokin’.

pomt-09856	"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/barack-obama/obama-has-praised-single-payer-plans-past/	At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., President Barack Obama was asked about his support of a "universal" health coverage and whether his plan would result in the government taking over health care. In his answer, Obama made a point that caught our attention: "I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter," Obama said. That raised some eyebrows here in the PolitiFact newsroom because we recently spent a fair amount of time analyzing Obama's statements on single-payer. Before we delve into that, here's the exchange in Portsmouth: Question: "Mr. President, you've been quoted over the years — when you were a senator and perhaps even before then — that you were essentially a supporter of a universal plan. I'm beginning to see that you're changing that. Do you honestly believe that? Because that is my concern. I'm on Medicare, but I still worry that if we go to a public option, period, that the private companies, the insurance companies, rather than competing — because who can compete with the government; the answer is nobody. So my question is do you still — as yourself, now — support a universal plan? Or are you open to the private industry still being maintained?" Obama: "Well, I think it's an excellent question, so I appreciate the chance to respond. First of all, I want to make a distinction between a universal plan versus a single-payer plan, because those are two different things. "A single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all, or the kind of plan that they have in Canada, where basically government is the only person — is the only entity that pays for all health care. Everybody has a government-paid-for plan, even though in, depending on which country, the doctors are still private or the hospitals might still be private. In some countries, the doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government. But the point is, is that government pays for everything, like Medicare for all. That is a single-payer plan. "I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive. So what would end up happening would be, a lot of people who currently have employer-based health care would suddenly find themselves dropped, and they would have to go into an entirely new system that had not been fully set up yet. And I would be concerned about the potential destructiveness of that kind of transition. "All right? So I'm not promoting a single-payer plan." (His answer continued at some length as he explained his plan. You can read the full transcript of the town hall here .) We see two major points that contradict Obama's statement in different ways. First, at several town halls this year, Obama has been asked by single-payer supporters why he doesn't propose a single-payer system. Obama's consistent answer has been that if he were designing a health care system "from scratch," he would go with a single payer system. So that certainly indicates philosophical support for the idea, even if Obama has also consistently concluded that single-payer is not politically feasible. But there's also the matter of a YouTube video from June 2003, when Obama was a state senator in Illinois and a longshot candidate for the U.S. Senate. Back then, he plainly indicated he supported a single-payer system. "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program," Obama said. "I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House." We previously delved into this video in great — some might say excruciating — detail, even discovering the identity of "Jim." You can read more about the politics of health care in Illinois from that time by reading our complete item, " Obama statements on single-payer have changed a bit. " Suffice to say, Obama's public remarks and statements have moderated since 2003. In other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers. In February 2004, about a month before the primary election in the U.S. Senate race, the Associated Press reported the stance of all the candidates on universal health care. "Obama says he supports the idea of universal health care but does not think a single-payer government system is feasible. He says the government should be the health care provider of last resort for the uninsured." In a rundown of all the candidates' positions, the Associated Press summarized Obama's position as "Support, but 'probably not at this stage,' a single-payer government system." In his book The Audacity of Hope , published in October 2006 when he was a U.S. senator, Obama described single-payer as the hope of the left, while those on the right wanted a market-based approach. "It's time we broke this impasse by acknowledging a few simple truths," Obama wrote, suggesting a system much like the one he supports today. In April 2007, a few months after he declared his candidacy for presidency, the Chicago Tribune reported, "Obama has pledged that, if elected, all Americans would have health care coverage by the end of his first term. He has said he is reluctant to switch to a 'single-payer' national health insurance system because of the difficulty in making a quick transition from the employer-based private system." But the 2003 video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above. After weighing all the evidence, we concluded that Obama, as a candidate who was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate, took a strong position on single payer, but then over the years moderated his position to appeal to a broader national audience. We rated him a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter, a tool we use to gauge when political leaders and others change positions. Getting back to Obama's statement in Portsmouth, he said, "I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive." But he has said in the past he supports a single-payer plan, and the questioner was correct that Obama's thinking has evolved over the years. Obama's answer strikes us as too artful. The 2003 YouTube video shows at one time he supported a single-payer system with little to no reservation. We agree that Obama does not support single payer now, but it's not correct to say that he has never supported it, which is certainly the impression you get from the answer he gave at the town hall. We rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-08-12T15:04:07	2009-08-11	['None']

pomt-14102	On how to respond to Puerto Rico’s debt crisis.	no flip	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/13/sean-duffy/did-sean-duffy-flip-flop-what-should-be-done-about/	House Speaker Paul Ryan is not the only Wisconsin Republican being targeted by The Center for Individual Freedom for supporting a measure aimed at helping Puerto Rico resolve its debt crisis. The center, a conservative non-profit based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors, claimed in a TV ad that Ryan’s support for a measure from U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wausau, amounted to backing a "bailout" for Puerto Rico. We rated that claim Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. In a separate radio ad, the center argues Duffy flip-flopped on what Congress should do to help resolve Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. We’re going to put that one to our Flip-O-Meter. Our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter simply measures whether a political figure has been consistent, not whether any change makes for good (or bad) politics or policy. So, has Duffy changed his views on how to respond to Puerto Rico’s debt crisis? The ad The one-minute ad, launched April 22, 2016, paints a bleak picture for Puerto Rico -- which is $72 billion in debt and now defaulting on debt payments -- then shifts its attention to a critique of Duffy. "In February, Congressman Sean Duffy warned against Super Chapter 9 for Puerto Rico. Duffy said granting Puerto Rico Super Chapter 9 would pave the way for overspending states like California, New York, and Illinois to also declare bankruptcy." The ad maintains Duffy has "flip flopped," and is now "leading the fight" for Super Chapter 9 bankruptcy for Puerto Rico. Unlike the 50 states, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, isn’t covered under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy system, which grants various public bodies -- including municipalities and public utilities -- the right to declare bankruptcy. Duffy highlighted that point in a Feb. 17, 2016 keynote speech to the American Action Forum, which is part of the conservative advocacy organization American Action Network. "I think bankruptcy should be the priority over a taxpayer bailout," Duffy said in the speech. "I put out a state-based Chapter 9 bankruptcy proposal -- just like you have in Wisconsin, just like you have in Texas -- so municipalities and public corporations in Puerto Rico can file for bankruptcy just like they can in Wisconsin. "But the general obligation bonds of Puerto Rico proper can’t access bankruptcy." That is a key point in this discussion. "Super Chapter 9" has become a loaded phrase in Washington, but may carry different meanings for different people. For instance, in the radio ad itself, the definition seems to be applied to any measure that allows the territory of Puerto Rico itself to declare bankruptcy -- not just municipalities or smaller government units on the island. Indeed, it goes so far as to declare Duffy’s bill is "Super Chapter 9." Duffy, for his part, defined Super Chapter 9 as "allowing bankruptcy for the general obligation bonds." He said allowing this in Puerto Rico would amount to a "tee-up" for bankruptcy of general obligation bonds in high spending states like Illinois and California. But that provision is not in Duffy’s bill. For the purposes of this item, we can actually set aside the differing definitions, since we are looking at whether Duffy has changed his stance. We will also focus in on the period since February 2016, since that is the benchmark used in the ad. The bill Let’s look at the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. This is the measure -- supported by Duffy -- that is in question in the radio ad. The bill, introduced April 12, 2016, would create an oversight board as an entity within the Puerto Rican government to aid in reforming the territory’s financial crisis. The board could facilitate restructuring of debt with creditors and, as a last resort, seek court supervised restructuring. In our item examining whether the measure amounted to a bailout, we noted the measure would allow Puerto Rico to pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed. In terms of the impact on American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts. So, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us. Thus, the measure has some bankruptcy-like qualities. But that, too, does not change the bottom line when it comes to whether Duffy has been consistent in his stance. His position has been that, just like the 50 states, Puerto Rico itself should not be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Rather, municipalities and governmental units in the territory should be placed on par with those in the 50 states, and they should be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Our rating From the beginning, Duffy warned against allowing Puerto Rico as a territory to declare bankruptcy. Despite the suggestion of the radio ad, the bill he is sponsoring does not allow bankruptcy for general obligation bonds. We rate Duffy’s position on the issue of what to do about Puerto Rico’s debt as No Flip.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-05-13T05:00:00	2016-04-22	['None']
pomt-10185	"Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment…Ban use of firearms for home defense."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/23/national-rifle-association/yes-and-outlaw-apple-pie-as-well/	(Published Sept. 23, 2008) In a hard-hitting direct-mail piece to its members, the National Rifle Association detailed an alleged plan by Sen. Barack Obama to transform gun-ownership regulations. Obama's "plan" appeared on a section of the mailer designed to be cut out and carried around in a wallet. The front of the wallet card said, "Barack Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment." The reverse listed the 10 parts of the alleged plan, starting with, "Ban use of firearms for home defense." An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the mailer, which first appeared in early August 2008, but would not provide details of what its claims were based on. For that, she referred us to various NRA Web sites. We could find no support on any of them for the allegation that Obama has a plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense. What we did find, and what we suspect is the root of this allegation, was information about a vote Obama cast as an Illinois state senator in May 2004. (See this essay by NRA executive vice president officer Wayne LaPierre.) The bill in question was a response to the case of Hale DeMar, a Wilmette, Ill., man who shot and wounded a burglar in his home in December 2003. Prosecutors did not charge him for the shooting, since they determined that he acted in self-defense, but they did fine him $750 for violating the local handgun ordinance. An outcry of sympathy for DeMar prompted the state legislature to take up a bill that would let people claim a self-defense protection for using a gun in their homes in violation of local weapons bans. Obama voted against the measure. The legislature passed it, and later overrode the veto of Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Like Blagojevich, Obama framed that debate as a home-rule issue. He told the Associated Press at the time that he voted against the measure out of respect for local governments' authority to set gun policy. Here's what LaPierre wrote about the vote: "When Obama turned thumbs down on the bill, he voted against the most basic element of the Second Amendment — the right of defense of self and family — the reason that millions of Americans own firearms." That's a bit of a leap. In concrete terms, Obama's thumbs-down was a vote against the state legislature tweaking a local gun ban. In any event, there's no fair way to interpret it as evidence that Obama has a future plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense. Moreover, there's ample evidence to the contrary. Here's Obama speaking at a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008: "I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it’s important for us to recognize that we’ve got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families (emphasis added). We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage…We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people’s traditions.” That doesn't sound to us like someone planning to "ban use of firearms for home defense." Quite the opposite, actually. Ignoring that sort of evidence, and instead extrapolating from one vote on a jurisdictional debate in Illinois a broad-ranging plan to ban guns for home defense, is not just misleading, it's intentionally dishonest. That is, Pants on Fire wrong.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2008-09-23T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']

pomt-05303	Says Democratic recall opponent Mahlon Mitchell sent a letter "encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/20/rebecca-kleefisch/wisconsin-recall-lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-cha/	The memory might be dim now. But one of the flashpoints in the 2011 fight over public employee unions in Wisconsin was a boycott of businesses that supported Gov. Scott Walker. The effort was launched in the days before and after Walker signed a bill that sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. That was back in March 2011. But in a Milwaukee TV interview broadcast May 13, 2012, less than a month before Wisconsin’s historic recall elections, GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch reignited the boycott issue in the context of one of the recall’s top issues: jobs. Sitting alongside Mahlon Mitchell, her Democratic challenger, Kleefisch spoke on WISN (Channel 12) about the importance of creating jobs. Then she turned to Mitchell, who is president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, and this exchange ensued: Kleefisch: "Sir, when you send out a letter encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies as the head of the firefighters union, I don't know how that helps job creation." Mitchell: "That’s just not true, that’s just not true. I didn’t send out a letter to boycott a hundred companies. You show me that letter because that’s not true." Kleefisch: "Sure." We’d like to see the letter, too, as we examine what role Mitchell, a political newcomer, played in the boycotts. Indeed, it was Mitchell’s role as a sharp Walker critic -- and the fact he opposed Walker’s collective bargaining changes even though his union was exempt from them -- that first gave him political prominence. To back Kleefisch’s statement, Kleefisch campaign manager Rachel Pecor provided a letter that was dated March 10, 2011 and signed by Mitchell and six other public employee union leaders. The letter was sent to Tom Ellis, president of what was then the Milwaukee-based M&I Bank. M&I has since been acquired by BMO Financial Group. The letter noted that Ellis was a campaign contributor to Walker. It demanded that M&I Bank publicly oppose Walker’s reform law, which limited most state and local government employees to collectively bargain over wages only. If M&I didn’t comply, the letter said, the letter signers would "publicly and formally boycott the goods and services provided by your company." M&I clearly is a single business, although it had well over 100 branches in Wisconsin. Pecor also provided a March 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article reporting that Mitchell and the other signers of the M&I letter made the same demand a day later in a letter to the Kwik Trip convenience store chain. Kwik Trip is a family owned company with more than 100 stores in Wisconsin. So, it’s clear that Mitchell signed not one but two boycott letters. Kleefisch claimed they urged boycotts of more than 100 "companies," which isn’t technically correct, although the two targeted companies each had more than 100 business locations. Pecor also provided a Journal Sentinel article from later in March 2011 indicating that, according to the state chamber of commerce, the boycott had targeted additional businesses; and another Journal Sentinel article reporting that a state employees union was circulating letters to businesses threatening a boycott. Pecor acknowledged there wasn’t proof that Mitchell had signed any other letters urging boycotts beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. But she argued that the larger boycotts were "encouraged" by the Mitchell letters. She also cited a list of more than 100 businesses that, according to the pro-recall Scott Walker Watch group, were targeted for boycotts. Mitchell campaign spokesman Kevin Benish said Mitchell signed only the two boycott letters because M&I and Kwik Trip had received government aid but mistreated employees. Benish tried to downplay the letters, saying they didn’t actually threaten boycotts, though they clearly did. Benish said Mitchell didn’t endorse and couldn’t control any boycotts efforts undertaken beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. Asked whether Mitchell opposed any of the other boycott efforts, Benish didn’t provide any evidence that Mitchell had. Our rating Kleefisch said Mitchell sent a letter "encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies." Mitchell signed boycott letters to two businesses, each of which had more than 100 locations. Eventually, the boycotts targeted more than 100 individual businesses. That was the thrust of Kleefisch’s statement, although she overreached by saying Mitchell sent a letter specifically encouraging a boycott of more than 100 companies. In short, her statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2012-05-20T06:00:00	2012-05-13	['None']

pomt-12536	Says the T.R.U.M.P. Act, which would force presidential candidates to release their tax returns to run in North Carolina, "has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/19/jay-chaudhuri/even-state-trump-won-nc-lawmaker-says-most-people-/	President Donald Trump has continued to break with decades of precedent in refusing to release his tax returns. Trump has said voters don’t care about his taxes – which PolitiFact ruled False, based on public polling both before and after the election that found most people do think he should release them. But have even voters in states that Trump won been clamoring to see his tax returns? One North Carolina lawmaker said they have. And he proposed that if Trump runs for re-election in 2020, he’ll have to release his taxes to get on the ballot in this crucial swing state. Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Democrat from Raleigh, introduced a bill with that requirement. In case its target was unclear, he called it the "Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act," or the T.R.U.M.P. Act. "I filed the T.R.U.M.P. Act because I believe every presidential candidate, including Donald Trump, should disclose their tax returns," Chaudhuri told The News & Observer. "I did so for three reasons. First, every major party presidential candidate for the last 40 years has made his or her tax returns public. Second, such disclosures allow the public to know whether these candidates have conflicts of interest. For example, does Donald Trump have business dealings with Russia? Finally, this bill has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties, including Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina." We won’t check Chaudhuri’s claim about every major modern presidential candidate releasing tax returns, since the work has been done for us. Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin previously ruled that same claim, as made by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, as Mostly True. But we were intrigued by Chaudhuri’s final claim, that "this bill has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties." Political polarization Chaudhuri’s sentence was phrased somewhat vaguely. It appears he’s talking about "a majority of North Carolinians and (some) members of both parties." Yet it’s also possible to read it as saying most members of both parties. But that’s unlikely, since if he had meant that he wouldn’t have needed the first part of the sentence, and in the end we interpreted it as some members of both political parties. In Congress, some barely even cuts it. Rep. Walter Jones was one of only two Republicans not to vote the party line last month, when Congress voted down an attempt by Democrats to pass a national bill similar to what Chaudhuri is proposing for North Carolina. But partisan polarization in Congress often doesn’t accurately reflect their constituents. So we’re more interested in what Chaudhuri had to say about public opinion statewide, since he’s promoting a state-level bill. His T.R.U.M.P. Act is likely a long shot, just like that doomed national bill, since Republicans also control the N.C. General Assembly. Some politicians and legal experts have also questioned whether such a bill – which has also been introduced in at least 24 other states – would even be constitutional. Nevertheless, it would be intriguing if Chaudhuri is right about widespread support behind this idea. So we began researching opinion polls to find out. A majority for or against? We discovered only one polling firm has asked voters in North Carolina this issue. But its research backs up Chaudhuri’s claim. Most North Carolinians do want Trump to release his taxes and would support a law that require all presidential hopefuls to do so, according to Public Policy Polling, a liberal-leaning firm based in Raleigh that has polled the topic multiple times. Its polling results mirror national polls (which recently have found between 53 percent and 74 percent want Trump to release his taxes). So it doesn’t appear to be an outlier. But since it’s the only firm polling on this topic in North Carolina specifically, we take its findings with a grain of salt. PPP polled North Carolinians in August 2016 and January 2017 on whether Trump should release his taxes. The August poll found 58 percent said yes; the January poll found 60 percent said yes. That backs up Chaudhuri’s claim about "a majority of North Carolinians." And the poll’s crosstabs back up his point about some support from both sides politically. In August PPP found 76 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of unaffiliated/other voters wanted Trump to release his taxes. There was no majority view among Republicans, of whom 37 percent said Trump said should release his taxes, 49 percent said he shouldn’t and 14 percent were undecided. That poll surveyed 830 likely voters, with a margin of error of 3.4 percent. The overall January numbers were similar – a total of 60 percent support – although increasingly polarized. Support among Democrats and unaffiliated voters rose by several points, while Republican opposition rose by several points. That poll surveyed 954 registered voters, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent PPP’s January poll also found 54 percent of North Carolinians would favor "a law requiring that a candidate for President release 5 years of tax returns in order to appear on the ballot," which is precisely the type of law Chaudhuri proposed several months later. PPP found most Democrats and independents would support the bill, while there was no majority view among Republicans. The poll reported 31 percent of Republicans would support such a bill, 49 percent would oppose it, and 20 percent were undecided. Our ruling Sen. Jay Chaudhuri proposed a bill that would require future presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to get onto North Carolina’s ballot. The bill was clearly aimed at Republican President Donald Trump, but Chaudhuri said it "has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties." According to one polling firm, Chaudhuri is correct that most North Carolinians want to see Trump’s tax returns, and that the majority also would support a law requiring all presidential candidates to release their taxes. He’s also correct that both issues have bipartisan support, including most Democrats and independents, and about a third of Republicans. However, only one pollster has explored this question at the state level. That’s an important piece of information that Chaudhuri doesn’t mention, so we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-13107	Says Donald Trump "says organized crime runs wild on reservations."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-says-organized-crime-/	Speaking in Arizona -- the battleground state with the largest population of Native Americans -- Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of speaking ill of Native Americans. "Imagine a president who insults Native Americans, says organized crime runs rampant on reservations, and mocks Sen. Elizabeth Warren by calling her Pocahontas again and again," Clinton said at a rally in Tempe. (See it here, around 21:25.) We know that Trump does call Warren "Pocahontas." We wondered whether Clinton is correct to say that Trump "says organized crime runs rampant on reservations." When we searched through Google and Nexis, we found that Trump did make that particular charge in a radio interview, and when he testified to Congress about Indian casinos in 1993. Seven years later during another fight with Indian casinos, Trump was linked to an advertising campaign that warned that drugs and crime would follow the expansion of Indian gaming. But we can’t find any more recent examples -- including during the current campaign -- of Trump saying that organized crime is pervasive on reservations. This calls into question Clinton’s use of "says" in the present tense. The Imus interview In the early 1990s, Trump’s business was heavily dependent on his portfolio of Atlantic City casinos. He apparently feared losing business if Indian reservations opened casinos throughout nearby states. So he actively opposed loosening laws that governed where Indian casinos could operate. Part of his argument had to do with stopping the spread of organized crime. Appearing on Don Imus’ radio show on June 18, 1993, Trump said that "a lot of the reservations are being, in some people's opinion, at least to a certain extent, run by organized crime and organized crime elements, as you can imagine." At another point in the program, Trump referred to Indian tribes as "all chiefs and no Indians," and mocked tribal citizenship by suggesting that he "would perhaps become Indian myself." (Imus, for his part, referred to native Americans as "drunken injuns.") The comments led the National Indian Gaming Association and the Association on American Indian Affairs to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. The congressional testimony A few months later, Trump traveled to Washington to testify before the House Natural Resources subcommittee on Indian Affairs on Oct. 5, 1993. At the time, Congress was considering rewriting the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. "Organized crime is rampant on the Indian reservations," he testified. "If this continues as a threat, it's my opinion that it will ... blow sky-high and it's going to destroy an industry, a legitimate industry." He added, "That an Indian chief is going to tell Joe Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me. I think it's obvious that organized crime is rampant -- and I don't mean a little bit -- on Indian reservations." Then-Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., asked Trump to corroborate his claim. "I have many incidents," Trump said. "You folks know that." "This will be the biggest crime problem in the nation's history," Trump also testified. "I believe you folks have created a monster." At another point in his testimony, Trump said some Indians seeking casino licenses "don't look like Indians to me and they don't look like Indians to Indians." Then-Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., responded, "Thank God that's not the test of whether or not people have rights in this country, whether or not they have passed your look test." Miller added, "I don't believe I've ever heard more irresponsible testimony than I've heard from this panel." Then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sided with Trump, pointing to "22 serious allegations" of wrongdoing in Indian gaming operations, some involving ties to organized crime, that he had culled from published accounts, the Associated Press reported. "We are close to breaking the back of organized crime, but this is like tossing them a lifeline just as they are drowning," Torricelli said. But Jim E. Moody, the FBI’s organized crime and drug operations section chief, dismissed the idea that organized crime had deep tentacles in Indian gaming. He said the agency had found only one case in which "organized crime forces have been convicted for attempting to control" Indian gaming. The 2000 advertisements So Trump is on record twice -- once on Imus’ show, once before a House subcommittee -- explicitly saying Indian reservations were tainted by organized crime. And in one additional instance, he implied that drug dealing would follow the expansion of casinos on Indian land. That was in 2000, when Trump’s casino holdings were facing the renewed prospect of competition from Indian casinos. That year, New York state was considering allowing Indian casinos in the Catskill mountains. But TV, newspaper and radio ads sponsored by the opaquely named New York Institute for Law and Safety accused the Mohawk tribe of having mob ties. The Los Angeles Times reported that the institute "was the brainchild of Trump’s longtime lobbyist and consultant, Roger Stone, and Trump himself was hands-on — not just paying the bills, but signing off on ad copy or radio scripts depicting the tribe as violent criminals and drug dealers. When Stone hired private investigators to dig up dirt on the Mohawks, Trump secretly paid the bills. ‘Roger – This could be good!’ Trump scrawled across one ad that included a picture of hypodermic needles and lines of powder." The 2016 campaign So Trump explicitly linked Indian reservations and organized crime in 1993, and implied something similar as late as 2000. That’s either 23 years ago or 16 years ago. We couldn’t find any more recent examples in our searches, and when we checked with the Clinton campaign, they did not provide any more recent example, either. Trump has repeatedly called Warren, one of his most outspoken critics, "Pocahontas" for once claiming that she had Indian blood. Family lore held that she had Indian ancestry, but later research cast doubt on that conclusion. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Clinton said Trump "says organized crime runs wild on reservations." Trump did say that at least twice -- but that was 23 years ago. He later implied such a connection in 2000. But there’s no indication he said that publicly in the past 16 years, including during the 2016 campaign. So Clinton’s use of the present tense -- "says" -- and her decision to cite it in the same breath as Trump's "Pocahantas" insult, which did occur during the 2016 campaign, is inaccurate. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3ef845b-e230-43ee-a977-bb3012e6d13f	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-11-04T14:41:01	2016-11-02	['None']
pomt-10634	Says Time magazine called him "one of America's best governors."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/10/mike-huckabee/top-5-in-fact/	Mike Huckabee's new TV ad in Michigan portrays him as an energetic governor with lots of accomplishments in health care, education and tax-cutting. We've examined the education and tax-cutting claims before, so here we'll examine whether the ad is right when it says Time magazine called him "one of America's best governors." Indeed, in November 2005, Time featured him in a story headlined "America's 5 Best Governors." (The others were Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Janet Napolitano of Arizona, Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and Mark Warner of Virginia.) The article said Huckabee "approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation" and cited his accomplishments with children's health care and economic growth. It called him "a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats." Time isn't the only publication to honor him that month. Governing magazine (which is owned by the same parent company as PolitiFact) named him one of its "Public Officials of the Year."

pomt-07527	The ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing today is "an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/steve-moore/steve-moore-says-ratio-people-working-government-m/	In an April 1, 2011, op-ed column, Steve Moore -- the senior economics writer for the Wall Street Journal editorial page and a longtime conservative activist -- wrote a column titled, "We've Become a Nation of Takers, Not Makers." In it, he bemoaned divergent trendlines for government employment, which he described as increasing, and manufacturing, which he described as decreasing. "If you want to understand better why so many states — from New York to Wisconsin to California — are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, consider this depressing statistic: Today in America there are nearly twice as many people working for the government (22.5 million) than in all of manufacturing (11.5 million). This is an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960, when there were 15 million workers in manufacturing and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the government. … We have moved decisively from a nation of makers to a nation of takers." Several readers asked us to take a look at Moore’s column. We’ll focus on his contention that the ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing today is "an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960." We turned to the historical employment data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: Total government employment, January 1960: 8,307,000 Total government employment, March 2011: 22,166,000 Total manufacturing employment, January 1960: 15,687,000 Total manufacturing employment, March 2011: 11,667,000 To us, all of these numbers appear quite close to what Moore wrote. So he’s right on the numbers. But is he correct that today’s numbers show "an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960"? That’s less clear. We found a somewhat different story if you swap out Moore’s raw employment numbers and instead use the numbers for each of the sector’s share of total U.S. employment. Doing it this way takes into account the increasing size of the American work force over more than 50 years -- it grew from 54.2 million workers in 1960 to 130.7 million workers in 2011. Here are the percentages: Total government share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 15 percent Total government share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 17 percent Total manufacturing share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 29 percent Total manufacturing share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 9 percent What this shows is that government’s proportion of the work force has increased -- but by a relatively modest rate. Meanwhile, manufacturing -- for countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology -- has fallen off a cliff during the past 50 years. To us, the comparison of jobs in government and manufacturing looks less like "an almost exact reversal," as Moore puts it, than two largely unrelated changes. We’ll add a final point of context. Several other employment sectors grew at faster rates over the 50-year period than government did. The leisure and hospitality sector, for instance, grew from 6.3 percent of the workforce in 1960 to 10 percent in 2011, and professional business services roughly doubled, from 6.8 percent in 1960 to 13.1 percent in 2011. So, other types of private-sector employment -- jobs that don’t "make" anything -- took up some of the slack from manufacturing’s decline. So where does this leave us? Moore’s raw employment numbers for manufacturing and government are accurate, but adding context about the size of the labor force as a whole weakens the notion that the trendlines are an "exact reversal." On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Steve Moore	None	None	None	2011-04-06T14:12:21	2011-04-01	['None']

pomt-03730	When the NECAP proficiency test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, harder questions are taken out.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/14/eva-marie-mancuso/ri-board-education-chairwoman-eva-marie-mancuso-sa/	The plan to make high school students pass -- or at least show some improvement on -- a proficiency test before they can graduate from high school continues to cause controversy. During the April 7 edition of the WPRI-TV program "Newsmakers," the chairwoman of the newly formed Rhode Island Board of Education, Eva Marie Mancuso, was asked about the basic test, known as the New England Common Assessment Program. High school students can it take a second or third time, if necessary, to demonstrate that they have learned enough for a diploma. Mancuso said it was important to note that "the second and third NECAP test that's given is not the same NECAP test that they're given originally. . . . You know those really hard questions that are on the front page of the paper that we all look at and say, 'Oh my goodness, how could anybody pass these?' Those are there to weed out and to show what our excellent students are doing. So when the test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out." We were under the impression that students who had to re-take the NECAP test to demonstrate proficiency didn't take a less-challenging form of the test, so we decided to check her statement. Mancuso's office sent us to her spokesman, Mike Trainor. While we were waiting for his response, we contacted Elliot Krieger, spokesman at the Rhode Island Department Education. Krieger said although questions on the NECAP change from year to year -- as they do for most standardized tests -- the test is not dumbed-down if students need to retake it in the beginning of their senior year. It's the same NECAP test high school juniors are taking. But seniors who fail to show enough improvement on the second test and need to take a third will be given a stripped-down version of the NECAP, a version that is still under development. "It will be a shorter version, have less degree of difficulty because it's single purpose will be to determine whether students at the low-scoring level have shown improvement," said Krieger. "There may be some difficult questions, but they will be fewer." "We haven't designed it yet. It's more than a year away. But that's the plan," he said. When Trainor got back to us, he said Krieger had the correct information and Mancuso supports that. Our ruling Rhode Island Board of Education Chairwoman Eva Marie Mancuso said, "When the [NECAP proficiency] test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out." Seniors who retake the NECAP should find that the second test is just as difficult as the first because it's the same test that juniors are taking. It's only in the third test, given to seniors who fail the second, that the number of questions will be fewer and harder questions -- ones designed for more advanced students -- will be removed. At least, that's the plan. Because her statement is only partially accurate, we rate it Half True.

pomt-08751	In Rhode Island "there are 150 different pension plans for public workers."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/30/kernan-kerry-king/king-says-rhode-islands-public-employees-have-150-/	Kernan "Kerry" King, the Republican candidate for general treasurer, believes the public employee pension system is too complicated. "In Rhode Island today, our little state, there are 150 different pension plans for public workers. That's absolutely crazy," he said during an appearance on Newsmakers. "We need to have one plan for all workers, whether you're a judge, whether you're a state trooper, whether you work for the city of Warwick as a maintenance person. One plan should fit every single person." One hundred fifty is a lot of pension plans, even for a state with 39 cities and towns. So we first checked with the general treasurer's office, which handles the state-run programs. Chief of Staff Mark A. Dingley said the state has four such programs and he sent us the latest audit reports for all of them. Most state employees and teachers are covered by the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI). The state employees portion of that system was funded at 59 percent for 24,661 employees and retirees as of June 30, 2009, the most recent figures available. The teachers portion was funded at 58.1 percent for 25,904 employees and retirees. Ideally, both should be at 100 percent. Then there's the State Police Retirement Benefits Trust, which covered 182 people as of June 30, 2009. It has 79.8 percent of the money it should have to be fully funded, according to last year's actuarial valuation. Third is the Judicial Retirement Benefits Trust for the state's judges and retired judges. There were 55 in June 2009. The plan is funded at 88.3 percent. Fourth is the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System (MERS) which covers 109 pension programs within various cities, towns or region. As of last year, it covered 7,952 employees and 4,389 retirees. All 109 programs are funded separately to various degrees by their municipality. Thirty six are funded at 100 percent or higher, and 10 have less than 70 percent of the money they should have. The four programs actually represent 113 different named pension plans, if you count the program for teachers and other state employees as two separate ones. Dingley said all 113 have very similar provisions. On the state level, there are five different designs of pension plans. But wait, there's more. There are 36 municipal pension programs in 24 communities that are administered by their respective cities and towns. "They would all have different designs," said Dingley. For information on them, we went to the Office of the Auditor General and found its March 2010 report assessing their health. Nearly two thirds of those plans are considered at risk because they don't have enough money to cover projected expenses. Only 11 have at least 70 percent of the funding they need and 19 are funded below the 50 percent level. "Some are so small they only cover one or two people," Dingley said. That brings the total to 149, or 148 if you include the state teachers and state employees plans as one. Dingley said he's not sure how easy it would be to combine them, as King is recommending. The ones that cover police and fire "are designed very differently because of the hazardous nature of the work. You don't want to see a 60-year-old fireman or policeman still working, because they can't go up the ladder and carry someone down, or they're not effective against young criminals, etc. "Likewise for judges, who tend to be appointed later in their careers, so those designs take that career track into account. Those have traditionally been different," said Dingley. "But aside from that, there is a strong argument to be made that the rest should have a uniform design." The bigger question, given how poorly-funded some of the plans are, "is who makes up the huge deficits," Dingley said. Ultimately, King's count of the number of public pension plans in Rhode Island isn't perfect, but it's close enough for us, so we rate his statement as True.

pomt-13350	"The Virginia population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/03/virginia-first-foundation/several-problem-virginia-firsts-claim-about-soarin/	A conservative group says Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have failed to harness state spending. The Virginia First Foundation is lamenting a recently revealed $1.5 billion projected budget shortfall. It posted a game show-themed video on its website. The narrator asks what’s behind "Window Number 1?" The answer is this claim: "The Virginia population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent," the group’s video says. The video identifies three House Republican leaders as "big spenders": Speaker Bill Howell of Stafford; Majority Leader Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights; and Chris Jones of Suffolk, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We wondered whether the foundation’s statistics are right. Let’s start with Virginia’s population increase. U.S. Census Bureau tallies show the state’s population stood at nearly 7.6 million in 2005 and rose to more than 8.3 million in 2015. That’s an increase of about 10 percent, a bit higher than the foundation says. Now, let’s move to the foundation’s claim about a 38 percent increase in state spending per capita - the amount of state spending divided by the number of people in Virginia. Steve Waters, a founding board member of the foundation, pointed to a couple of sources to show that state spending per person has spiked over the past decade. The first is a table from the 2004-06 budget which says that when fiscal 2005 ended in mid-2005, the state’s per capita spending in its operating budget was projected to be $3,894. Waters also points to a chart from BallotPedia, which says that the state’s per capita spending in fiscal 2015 was $5,483, a number culled from a figures compiled last year by the National Association of State Budget Officers. Those per capita figures amount to a 41 percent increase from 2005 to 2015 - a bit higher than the foundation’s estimate. We also looked at state spending by examining annual reports by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, a watchdog agency. Using tables on the state’s annual population and overall operating expenses in a given year, we came up with a trend line similar to the foundation’s. Our calculations show per capita state spending was $3,861 in 2005 and rose to $5,642 in 2015 - a 46 percent increase. So in raw dollars, the foundation’s state spending figures are in the ballpark and, if anything, underestimate the increase. But there’s a big factor these calculations ignore - the effects of inflation. A dollar in 2015 wasn’t worth as much as a dollar in 2005. When we ran our figures through the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, we found the increase in per capita spending instead was about 21 percent - nearly half the size of the foundation’s growth rate. There’s another point to consider. All of the computations are based on total spending figures in the state budget. But legislators directly control only about 40 percent of the budget called the general fund. The fund, about $20.4 billion this year, is predominantly raised through state income and sales taxes and is used to pay for education, public safety and health programs. The remainder of the budget, more than $30 billion called the non-general fund, comes from sources over which legislators have limited or no control, such as college tuition, federal grants and hospital fees. These distinctions are important to note when looking at the context of the foundation’s claim, which blames GOP lawmakers for poorly reining state spending. JLARC noted in a report last year that the main driver of higher state spending were non-general fund increases in federal dollars; tuition payments to colleges that set their own rates; and child support payments. So to get to the bottom on this claim, we looked at per capita spending in the general fund over the 10-year period that the foundation cited. JLARC figures show it rose by 20.5 percent in raw dollars - from $1,819 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. When adjusting those figures for inflation, the spending actually declined by about 1 percent - from $2,207 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. Our ruling The Virginia First Foundation says the state’s "population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent." The conservative group specifically faulted three GOP lawmakers for not holding the line. The population increase, we should note, is closer to 10 percent. In raw dollars, the increase in per capita spending is 46 percent - a little higher than the group says. But the group’s calculations omit some key factors. When adjusted for inflation, the per capita increase for the entire state budget falls to 21 percent. Even then, the figure still holds state lawmakers responsible for a major portion of the state budget over which they have little or no control. If we focus on the portion of the budget that legislators fully direct - the general fund - per capita spending in raw dollars increased by 20 percent from 2005 to 2015. When adjusted for inflation, it actually decreased by about 1 percent. So the foundation’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That’s makes it Half True.

pomt-13608	"One in four inmates is an illegal immigrant."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/15/lisa-boothe/republican-strategist-says-25-percent-inmates-are-/	The United States should be paying attention to immigration and public safety issues in Europe and taking notes on how to handle them in America, argued Republican strategist Lisa Boothe. Terrorists have been apprehended at the U.S. southern border, and immigrant incarceration rates are significant, she said. "You also look at the criminal justice system. One in four inmates are illegal immigrants," Boothe said July 26 on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor. She was reacting to an earlier interview about border security O’Reilly had with Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., during the second night of the Democratic National Convention. We wondered if 25 percent of inmates are people who are in the country illegally. Boothe told us her comment was based on a Heritage Foundation analysis about illegal immigration and border security. Citing a U.S. Government Accountability Office, the foundation noted that "one of every four inmates in federal prisons is an illegal immigrant." The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, referred to a March 2011 GAO report on incarcerations, arrests and costs of criminal immigrants. That report says that "in fiscal year 2005, the criminal alien population in federal prisons was around 27 percent of the total inmate population, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 remained consistently around 25 percent." But the report’s definition of "alien" is broad and includes people here legally. It defines criminal aliens as "noncitizens who are residing in the United States legally or illegally and are convicted of a crime." So, about one in four inmates in federal prison is not a U.S. citizen, but not necessarily with an illegal immigration status. The accurate number is likely less than one in four, but precise data on the immigration status of inmates is hard to come by. Related data is collected differently by federal agencies and not inclusive of all facilities. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told us her agency does not have data on the number of inmates who are in the country illegally. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also told us it does not track data on immigration status of its inmates. But it does have statistics on inmate citizenship. About 22 percent of the bureau’s inmates are not U.S. citizens, based on information updated June 25, 2016. Its count of noncitizen inmates includes people who may be deported. As for state facilities, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report published in September 2015 said that by year-end 2014, there were about 1.56 million prisoners in both state and federal correctional facilities. About 69,000 of them — or 4 percent — were not U.S. citizens. But it didn’t break down the noncitizen category by legal or illegal immigration status. That data excludes noncitizen inmates in local jails under jurisdiction of state or federal correctional authorities and noncitizens in privately contracted facilities. The private facilities house deportable immigrants serving federal sentences and once they finish their sentences, they are turned over to ICE. Overall, there doesn’t appear to be an absolute number of incarcerated undocumented immigrants. "There is no definitive source that reports legal status of those arrested or incarcerated," said Anne Morrison Piehl, a professor of economics and criminal justice at Rutgers University, who has researched the relationship between immigration and crime. Unlike race, age and gender, the immigration status of an inmate isn’t often asked, said Ramiro Martinez, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University. Most inmates are native-born and most states have a small foreign-born population, so immigration status is not relevant to most of the prisoner population, Martinez said. And most immigrants in state and federal prisons are in for property or immigration offenses, Martinez added. Studies by Piehl and a colleague also have found that immigrants have much lower incarceration rates than the native-born population. "There is no reason to think that immigration in general presents a particular crime threat," they concluded. Our ruling Republican strategist Lisa Boothe said on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor "one in four inmates is an illegal immigrant." The data Boothe cited included immigrants who were here legally and illegally. So it’s likely that number is at least somewhat inflated. Federal agencies say they don’t track data on inmates in the country illegally, and several immigration experts told us there’s no definitive source for that specific number. We rate Boothe’s statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b111d18-9eae-40c2-9430-4a50717931e1	None	Lisa Boothe	None	None	None	2016-08-15T13:33:54	2016-07-26	['None']
pomt-01441	"In the last six years of Cianci’s administration violent crime was down in the United States. It was down in the region. It was down in Rhode Island. But it was up in Providence."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/06/jorge-elorza/jorge-elorza-ciancis-last-years-mayor-crime-provid/	During the Sept. 30, 2014, Providence mayoral debate, when Democrat Jorge Elorza was asked why he has said he’s embarrassed by independent Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. running for office again, he said he would rather look forward and focus on his vision for the city. "Let’s leave behind all of the corruption and what led the ex-mayor to go to jail," Elorza said of his rival. Elorza, however, couldn’t leave quite all that behind and immediately criticized Cianci whose last stint in office ended in 2002 with a federal conviction for racketeering conspiracy. "In the last six years of Cianci’s administration, violent crime was down in the United States," Elorza said. "It was down in the region. It was down in Rhode Island. But it was up in Providence." Elorza made the same claim in a news release on Friday, so we were curious -- did Providence really buck national and regional trends when it came to violent crime in the late 1990s and early 2000s? We went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collects data on crime from across the country as part of its Uniform Crime Reporting program (UCR). Under the program, four offenses are classified as violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The FBI tallies the total numbers of violent crimes in widening geographic areas: cities and towns, states, regions and the nation as a whole. The agency also calculates rates for given areas by working out the number of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. For our analysis, we used the period from 1997 to 2002, the last six years of Cianci’s most recent time in office. Nationally, the violent crime rate fell from 611 crimes per 100,000 people in 1997 to 494.4 in 2002, according to the UCR data. It also fell for the Northeast region, from 536.4 in 1997 to 416.5 in 2002, and for the smaller New England region, from 441.1 in 1997 to 346.9 in 2002. And for Rhode Island, it also went down, from 333.5 in 1997 to 285.6 in 2002. So what about Providence? The violent crime rate did indeed go up, from 674.8 in 1997 to 734.9 in 2002. It wasn’t a steady progression for those six years. The rate actually rose and fell a couple times over that period. If you graph those numbers, it would look a little like a rollercoaster. But the end result was a number in 2002 that was 8.9 percent higher than it was in 1997. We also looked at other major metropolitan centers in New England to see how they fared between 1997 and 2002. Of the nine other cities that round out the top 10 in the region by population (a list that includes Boston, Hartford and New Haven), only Waterbury, Conn. also experienced an increase, a slight one, in the violent crime rate for that period. Elsewhere in the country, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. saw a drop in the rate. Houston and Philadelphia experienced increases. Politifact Rhode Island has explored crime trends in past items, attributing the drop in crime rates nationally in the 1990s and 2000s to an aging population, community policing, the crackdown on guns and other factors. Providence police officials blamed the increase in the city’s violent crime rate over the same period to more people and more traffic in the downtown, according to Journal stories from the time. It’s worth noting that Elorza chose only a portion of Cianci’s time in office to make his point rather than the entire period of his opponent’s second stint in office, which started in 1991. Could it be because the crime rate cumulatively fell over those 12 years in office -- and did so quite dramatically? Despite the increase at the end, Providence saw a net drop -- and a very large one -- from 1,274 violent crimes per 100,000 people to 734.9. In fact, the 42 percent drop in Providence’s violent crime rate between 1991 and 2002 trumped the 35 percent drop in the national rate for those same years and the 38 percent drop in the Rhode Island rate. However, David Ortiz, a spokesman for Elorza, said that the upward trend at the end of Cianci’s time in office was significant because it ran counter to what was going on elsewhere. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that the violent crime rate was up in the final years of Cianci’s second period as mayor while similar rates for the state, the region and the nation were all down. While Elorza carefully picked a time period between 1997 and 2002 to illustrate a point, that doesn’t mean the point isn’t valid. The rate of murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults went up for those years, even though -- and this is what makes the claim notable -- it was falling elsewhere. But Elorza’s claim does ignore the larger context, which is that the increase didn’t erase the gains seen in the earlier years of Cianci’s second stint as mayor. If Elorza had chosen the entire 12 years Cianci was in office the second time around, he couldn’t have made the same claim. If he had chosen eight years, he couldn’t have either. Because the statement needs clarification, we rule it Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-01225	"My position hasn’t changed" on using executive authority to address immigration issues.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-position-immigration-action-through-e/	President Barack Obama is on the verge of announcing significant executive actions that could affect at least a portion of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. As is often the case these days, rumors and pieces of the plan have floated through the media for a couple weeks now, and Obama appears ready to announce the full details Thursday night in an address to the nation. The decision to act unilaterally without going through Congress is not only controversial, but could it also be a change in direction for the Obama administration? Obama doesn’t see it that way. The Democratic leader was asked about his immigration plan during his trip to Australia for the G20 Summit on Nov. 16. Jim Avila of ABC asked, "In 2010, when asked by immigration reform advocates to stop deportations and act alone on providing legal status for the undocumented, you said, ‘I’m president, I’m not king. I can’t do these things just by myself.’ In 2013, you said, ‘I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.’ Mr. President, what has changed since then?" Obama replied: "Well, actually, my position hasn’t changed. When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress. And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws." First, Obama is revising history. While at one point he used the "I am not a king" line to rebut those who asked why his administration wasn’t doing enough to address comprehensive reform, as you’ll see, he continued to use it when asked about other, more limited uses with his executive powers. Second, taking any additional executive actions, no matter how limited, is still a reversal from his positions over the past few years. Revising history Let’s go to the first interview Avila mentions, a 2010 exchange with Eddie Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision station. This interview took place well before the Senate passed an immigration overhaul that stalled in the House. Sotelo: "Mr. President, you were able to pass a health care plan and you worked a lot for that. And most of my listeners, they haven't seen that, the same way that you worked for health care for immigration reform. The same effort." Obama: "My cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've gotta have some partners to do it." The second conversation Avila references was from a Google Hangout town hall that Obama conducted in February 2013. Obama was asked by a participant what he was going to do until immigration reform was passed "to ensure that more people aren’t being deported, and families aren’t being broken apart." Obama replied: "This is something that I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that, you know, I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. The question wasn’t a request for "duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress," as Obama characterized it this week. The bipartisan Senate bill involved billions of dollars in border security measures and a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Instead, he was asked what he can do as executive to slow deportations and keep families together, a much more limited request (and, according to reports, exactly what he will address tonight). Similarly, a month earlier, Obama was asked why he couldn’t do for an undocumented mother of three what he did for DREAMers. Obama replied, "I’m not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. ... But to sort through all the possible cases — of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell — is very difficult to do." Change in position In the absence of a comprehensive bill passed by Congress, Obama on Nov. 19 said what he is "going to be laying out is things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better" during tonight’s national address. According to various media reports, that will include a plan to remove the threat of deportation for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The bulk of those affected would be individuals who are parents of children born in the United States that are currently living in the country illegally. That provision could expand further if the parents of the so-called DREAMers — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children — were allowed to remain as well. We’ll see if that comes to fruition. Regardless, that Obama is promising to take any steps to address undocumented immigrants still represents a significant change. As Obama told Avila this week, his announcement will address, "what’s within our authority to do in reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can’t do everything." Earlier this month, Obama told reporters that when House Republicans expressed they would not take up an immigration bill this year, "What I indicated to him is I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse." Juxtapose that with his previous statements. In the 2013 Google town hall, Obama said, "we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can." Similarly, in March 2011, as pointed out in fact-checks by the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org, Obama was asked in a Univision town hall whether he could grant temporary protective status to undocumented students. He first explained why he could not, and then he addressed the idea of immigration through executive action more broadly. "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed," Obama said. "Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. "There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president." In September 2013, Obama was asked during an interview with Noticias Telemundo whether he could consider freezing deportations for parents of deferred-action kids. Not only does Obama say he cannot, but he throws cold water on the idea of having "the president sign something." "What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. We're not going to have them operate under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option." On Nov. 18, White House press secretary Josh Earnest was asked about this interview and told reporters, "Since this interview aired, the president did direct the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the law to determine what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address." Our ruling When asked to explain why he suddenly feels he can use executive action to address immigration issues, Obama said, "My position hasn’t changed." Obama has been asked about his ability to use his office to change immigration rules in the U.S. in many ways throughout the years. Sometimes, he has been asked broadly, but other times, he was asked about very specific measures, such as not splitting up families or freezing deportations for parents of DREAMers. In answering those questions, Obama’s position has clearly changed. Whereas he used to say his ability to take action ended at deferring action on DREAMers, he now is saying there are at least some things he can do and intends to do. Even absent the specifics of his plan, it’s very clear his tune is much different now. We rate the claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-11-20T17:15:04	2014-11-16	['None']

pomt-14650	"In reality, gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/24/environmental-justice-league-ri-environmental-just/could-fracking-be-worse-climate-coal/	The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts that a new liquefied natural gas facility at Fields Point would accelerate climate change. The league’s position paper, posted at RIFuture.org, predicts that the storage facility proposed by National Grid would increase emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. "While the oil and gas industry and their supporters like to present ‘natural gas’ as a ‘cleaner’ alternative or a ‘bridge fuel’ towards a renewable future, in reality, gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal," the paper says. So coal is cleaner than natural gas? The primary source for this material is Cornell University’s Robert W. Howarth, who has researched the climate-warming effects of methane that escapes into the atmosphere during the lifespan of fracked gas — from drilling to combustion. In fracking, water is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale to free up gas or oil. Methane is released in the process. The impact of gases — methane from coal-burning plants and carbon dioxide from automobiles — depends on how potent they are and how long they remain in the atmosphere. Methane is 100 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas during the 10 years following its emission, according to Howarth. But methane stays in the atmosphere for a little more than a decade, while carbon dioxide, some say, hangs around for 1,000 years. The point, Howarth says, is that global warming has moved into a critical period. It’s urgent, he says, to stave off what he calls "runaway global warming" — a scenario he believes is possible during the next 20 years. In the short-term, fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal-burning. Reducing methane emissions, he wrote to us in an email, is the only way to keep atmospheric temperatures below the 2 degrees Celsius mark set during last month’s accord at the Paris climate conference. "Methane emissions from fracked shale gas are horrendously high; so yes, it’s unequivocally worse for the climate than is coal," Howarth says. Other scientists disagree. In 2014, Raymond Pierrehumbert, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, presented research that shows carbon dioxide "is in a class by itself" among greenhouse pollutants. The lifetime of carbon dioxide, says the paper, can’t even be characterized, and the gas’s significant greenhouse effects "persist for millennia." Pierrehumbert likens the greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide to irreversible lead poisoning and the effects of methane gas to a hangover. "The important thing to note," Pierrehumbert was quoted as saying in an online post for The New York Times, "is that essentially all of the climate effects of methane emissions disappear within 20 years of cessation of emissions. In this sense, the climate harm caused by methane leakage is reversible. In contrast, CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, ratcheting up the temperature irreversibly, at least out to several millennia." In a different online Times post, Louis A. Derry, a Cornell colleague of Howarth’s, and an associate professor in earth and academic sciences, was quoted as saying that between 2007 and 2011, the climate impact from increased carbon dioxide was 13 times greater than that of methane. "For me, the picture is pretty clear," he wrote, "Displacing coal emissions with gas emissions is beneficial from a climate standpoint." Another prominent climate expert, James Hansen of Columbia University, recently acknowledged that gas can serve as a temporary alternative to burning coal. Does this mean natural gas, including fracked gas, is better for climate than coal-burning? Hansen said that he would need to know more about methane emissions. "I'm not sure anybody has it nailed down," said Hansen, the former NASA climatologist whose testimony before Congress in 1988 helped spread awareness of global warming. If he had to guess, Hansen said, the negative side effects of producing natural gas are small compared to those of burning coal, "or they could be made small." Pierrehumbert, Howarth, Hansen agree on one thing: the safest path is to develop more renewable energy such as wind and solar. Our ruling The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts: "...in reality gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal." The chairman of the University of Rhode Island’s geosciences department, David Fast-Ovsky, agrees with Pierrehumbert and shares many of Howarth’s concerns, too. But without appropriate historical context, he says he isn’t ready to say that fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal. That is a very aggressive statement to make, he says. The Justice League did not qualify its claim with a nod to the transient nature of methane emissions. The league mentioned a concern about the potential for "runaway climate change," but did not give the historical context behind Howarth’s assertion that a failure to control methane emissions in the short-term, within the next 20 years, makes fracked gas more damaging to climate. This is complicated stuff and the League oversimplified. "The statement is not false and it’s not exactly true because it’s not well-constrained," says Fast-Ovsky. We agree with Fast-Ovsky.

pomt-10363	"The legislation ... that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/02/bob-barr/while-on-big-brother-watch-barr-hits-mccain/	Libertarian presidential candidate and ex-Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr may have turned his back on his old party, but he hasn't abandoned his crusade to limit the reach of federal law enforcement. Asked on Fox News about the differences between himself and presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain, Barr pointed to a compromise plan to overhaul electronic spying rules that the Senate took up before the July Fourth recess and that McCain supports. The legislation is intended to address some of the privacy concerns that arose after the 2005 disclosure of the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program. It would rewrite the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA – the law that governs surveillance of foreign terrorist suspects – and permit warrantless eavesdropping on foreign targets who may be communicating with people in the United States, although with some court supervision of the surveillance procedures. The House passed the bill in a 293-129 vote on June 20. What most irks civil libertarians like Barr is the way the plan leaves it to the government to decide if it's violating Americans' privacy rights. "The legislation that is now pending before the Senate, that just passed the House, that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity," Barr said. Barr's characterization is essentially correct. The plan allows the attorney general and director of national intelligence to authorize surveillance of a suspect for up to one year without a warrant if the target is "reasonably believed to be located outside the United States (and) to acquire foreign intelligence information." That would include conversations between the target and people in the United States, including citizens. There is no requirement that the suspect be explicitly connected to any terrorist or criminal activity, though the bill's definition of foreign intelligence information includes sabotage, international terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Before any surveillance begins, a secret FISA court would have to review the executive branch's targeting process. But the administration could begin surveillance before the court review if it declares "exigent," or urgent, circumstances. Though the government has argued its activities are only directed at foreigners overseas, skeptics such as James X. Dempsey, policy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology, contend it is virtually certain that some suspects will communicate with people in the United States, where constitutional protections apply to national security activities. To assure the expansion of surveillance powers won't gut Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, many critics believe the government should first establish probable cause, by obtaining a warrant from a court that decides whether the activities are reasonably designed to intercept terrorists' communications while not infringing on the rights of innocent Americans. However, the administration and its allies in Congress have continuously resisted requirements for prior court reviews of surveillance procedures, citing, among other things, the president's constitutional authority to protect the United States and a 2001 law authorizing the use of force against groups or nations involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Democratic leaders in Congress reluctantly went along in the current debate, saying the compromise was preferable to a White House-backed plan that would have required less court and congressional oversight. The FISA law, as it's informally known, does not permit the targeting of a U.S. citizen overseas without such a warrant. And the plan under consideration in Congress contains some safeguards to protect "reverse targeting" of Americans while outlining so-called "minimization" procedures intended to limit the information that can be retained and disseminated on U.S. citizens. Still, as written, the plan would permit the government under certain circumstances to listen to Americans without a warrant. And it would not require the executive branch to demonstrate that a suspect is engaged in terrorist or criminal activity. For these reasons, we deem Barr's claim True.

pomt-13131	Chris Koster "opposed protecting the women of Missouri" because he "was one of only four senators to vote against" a bill ending the practice of making rape victims pay for their own rape kits.	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/02/eric-greitens/greitens-misses-bigger-picture-kosters-domestic-vi/	In a September press release, Eric Greitens, Missouri’s Republican candidate for governor, said his opponent, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, voted against legislation protecting women from sexual assault and domestic violence. Greitens said Koster voted against a 2007 bill mandating that the state pay for "rape kit" medical exams, not the victim of the assault. Koster was a state senator at the time the bill was proposed." Chris Koster is always quick to tout his ‘experience.’ But he is totally silent about his record on issues related to sex crimes and violence against women, probably because it is so bad," the release reads. It continues: "He opposed protecting the women of Missouri." We wanted to know more about Koster’s stance on the bill, so we decided to investigate Greitens’ claim. More about the bill The legislation, House Bill 583, became law. Besides mandating that the state paid for rape kits, the bill also classified repeated instances of first-degree domestic assault as a Class A felony and established a designated address for sexual assault victims in order to protect their privacy. Greitens is right — Koster was one of four senators who voted against the bill. The Senate passed it with a vote of 29-4. It passed in the House 133-19. But Greitens’ release doesn’t provide the full story. We reached out to Koster’s campaign, who sent us a statement about why Koster opposed the bill. "The idea Attorney General Koster wants rape victims to pay for their own rape kits is beyond ludicrous," the statement read. "This bill contained a blanket provision that could allow convicted murderers whose trials occurred decades earlier to get out of prison, based on potentially manufactured evidence. He couldn't support that and for that reason opposed the bill," the Koster campaign said. The bill allows the Department of Corrections to grant parole to inmates serving time in prison for murdering their spouse or "domestic partner" if the inmate can prove that he or she was the victim of repeated domestic violence. To get parole, the inmate must provide evidence of domestic violence, and that evidence could not have been used in the original trial. According to the bill, the evidence could include "witness statements, hospital records, social services records, and law enforcement records." The provision allows parole only if the inmate has served 15 years of his or her sentence. The parole board must determine that the prisoner will not break the law again. The inmate’s trial had to have begun before 1991, and the homicide has to have been the person’s first violent felony conviction. Koster’s campaign staff said Koster objected to witness statements being used as evidence of domestic abuse leading to the murder. Koster’s position was that under the wording of the bill, the parole board and not the original jury would decide the prisoner’s fate on the basis of the witness statements. "The bill doesn't provide a standard where the parole board weights (sic) the evidence, i.e. preponderance or without a reasonable doubt. This opens the door to manufactured evidence that would not be weighed by a jury," his campaign said. The Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the bill when it was in the legislature, said Colleen Coble, the coalition’s CEO. Coble said the bill’s aim was to allow imprisoned women who killed their partners following an act of domestic violence to have their cases reviewed by the parole board. Before 1991, evidence of domestic violence was not commonly presented as a defense in court, she said. Coble said Koster was supportive of the bill’s other provisions, including the measure to have the state pay for medical exams. Koster’s voting record We wanted to find out more about how Koster voted on other legislation related to sexual violence when he was a state senator. Koster’s staff provided us with more information. As attorney general, Koster assembled the Domestic Violence Task Force in 2010. The task force suggested 12 changes to Missouri’s domestic violence laws in a 2011 report to the Missouri General Assembly. One of the recommendations was to create more consistent definitions of "domestic violence," "abuse," "adult," "family" and "household member."Some of the suggestions were folded into a Senate bill that became law that year. As a state senator, Koster sponsored several bills related to sexual assault, though none became law. In 2006, he sponsored a bill that would increase penalties for sexual offenders who fail to register. That year, he also sponsored a bill that would have required lifetime probation for first-time sex offenders. In 2007, he sponsored a bill that would allow victims of sexual assault to register a designated address with the Missouri Secretary of State’s office to protect their privacy. That was one of the provisions of the bill Greitens referenced. He also sponsored a bill that year requiring people convicted of felonies to serve a minimum of three years in prison if they failed to register as a sex offender at the time of their crime as required. Our ruling Greitens says Koster voted against a 2007 bill requiring the state to pay for rape victims’ medical exams. In reality, the bill did more than that. Koster says he objected to wording that made it possible for convicted murderers to be granted parole by claiming they were victims of domestic abuse. Koster said the language made it possible for murderers to manufacture evidence to be released before the completion of their sentence. Greitens is cherry-picking one part of the legislation to paint his opponent as soft on domestic abuse.

pomt-05533	"98 percent of American families" make "under $250,000 a year."	true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/10/barack-obama/how-many-americans-make-less-250000-year/	How many Americans make less than $250,000 a year? According to tax statistics, it’s a pretty overwhelming number. President Barack Obama has been making the most of that statistic as he promotes what he calls the "Buffett Rule." "Florida, I've told you where I stand," Obama said at a campaign stop in Boca Raton on April 10, 2012. "So now it's time for members of Congress to tell you where they stand. In the next few weeks we're going to vote on something we call the Buffet Rule." Obama’s proposal is that people who have income of $1 million or more per year should be required to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent. "And if we do that, then it makes it affordable for us to be able to say for those people who make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, then your taxes don't go up," Obama said. Under current law, many high earners pay significantly less than 30 percent if their income comes from investments instead of earnings. Critics of the Buffett Rule note that it won’t bring in enough income to significantly dent the budget deficit. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the president wanted the rule to support the principle of tax fairness but conceded getting the rule passed would be an uphill battle in Congress. Here, we wanted to fact-check Obama’s statement that "98 percent of American families" make less than $250,000 a year. The White House’s prepared materials on the Buffett Rule included statistics released annually by the Internal Revenue Service that supported the point. Using statistics from the IRS website, we found that 137,988,219 tax returns out of 140,494,127 -- or 98.2 percent -- reported adjusted gross income of less than $250,000 a year in 2009, the most recent data available.

pomt-10843	"Iowa, for good reason, for constitutional reasons, for reasons related to the Lord, should be the first caucus and primary."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/10/bill-richardson/richardson-re-writes-bible-constitution/	States are battling for the lead-off spot in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, but Gov. Bill Richardson told an Iowa crowd on Labor Day that the Hawkeye State should get the pole position because God and the United States Constitution are on their side. "Iowa, for good reason, for constitutional reasons, for reasons related to the Lord, should be the first caucus and primary," Richardson said Monday, Sept. 3, 2007 at the Northwest Iowa Labor Council Picnic, according to the Des Moines Register. We consulted a battery of experts -- a religious leader, a political scientist who has studied religion and politics and a constitutional law expert -- who all were baffled by Richardson contention. "I'm from Illinois; I like Iowa," said Rabbi Daniel Zemel of Temple Micah in Washington, DC. He added, however, that Richardson is "on a different wave length with the Lord than the rest of us." David Campbell, a political science professor at Notre Dame University agreed. "I'm pretty sure that God has never said anything about the primary or caucus calendar," said Campbell, who has studied the relationship between religion and politics. James Madison and the rest of the Founding Fathers didn't even address the issue of allowing everyone to elect the president, let alone primaries, said Pamela Karlan, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University. "I'm trying to guess what the constitutional basis would be," she said. "I would be hard-pressed to come up with a constitutional basis." The Richardson campaign did not return a phone call seeking clarification. The Founding Fathers are dead. God was not available for his opinion. For these reasons and more, we give Richardson our "Pants on Fire" ruling.	None	Bill Richardson	None	None	None	2007-09-10T00:00:00	2007-09-03	['None']

pomt-06742	Says his hometown of Paint Creek, Texas, "doesn’t even have a ZIP code."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/27/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-paint-creek-texas-doesnt-have-zip-/	Introducing himself to out-of-Texas Republicans, Gov. Rick Perry spoke of his upbringing in the West Texas fly speck of Paint Creek. According to Google Maps, the Haskell County community is 57 miles north of Abilene, 160 miles southeast of Lubbock, about 170 miles northwest of Fort Worth and 288 miles northwest of Austin, the capital where Perry has lived since 1991. "It doesn’t even have a ZIP code," Perry said at an Aug. 14 dinner speech in Iowa, the day after saying something similar while declaring his candidacy for president at a South Carolina meeting. No ZIP code at all? How do they get mail in Paint Creek, via the Pony Express? Some background: ZIP codes (the acronym stands for Zoning Improvement Plan) were launched in 1963, the Postal Service says, so the delivery system could better handle increasing amounts of mail. The first number of each code represents a general geographic area of the nation — "0" in the East moving to "9" in the West. The next two numbers represent regional areas, and the final two numbers identify specific post offices. There are now more than 42,000 U.S. ZIP codes. Sam Bolen, a Texas-based spokesman for the postal service, it takes a minimum of 10,000 mail deliveries in an area for it to qualify for its own assigned ZIP code, though some existing codes cover areas with fewer deliveries. At the Haskell post office, about 10 miles northwest of Paint Creek, clerk Nancy Snelling told us that Paint Creek has a ZIP code; it’s 79521, which is also the ZIP code for Haskell, the county seat. Perhaps Perry means Paint Creek is not big enough to warrant its own ZIP code. In that vein, there’s an element of truth to his claim. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10373	"These steps (a middle-class tax cut, national health care plan, foreclosure prevention fund, Social Security fix and more) are all paid for."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/25/barack-obama/paid-for-without-real-money/	Lately economists have been fretting about how the candidates' economic plans would affect the budget deficit, which has soared to $357-billion following several years of surpluses through 2001. So Sen. Barack Obama caught our attention when he laid out a laundry list of economic proposals in a speech on June 16, 2008, and said they were all "paid for." Speaking at Kettering University in the faded manufacturing city of Flint, Mich., Obama ticked off several proposals he said would help working Americans: "It starts with a broad-based, middle-class tax cut — $1,000 per family — to help offset the rising cost of gas and food," Obama said. "A foreclosure prevention fund, to help stabilize the housing market and keep people in their homes. A health care plan that lowers costs and gives those without health insurance the same kind of coverage that members of Congress have. A commitment to retirement security that stabilizes Social Security, and provides workers a means to increase savings. And a plan to crack down on unfair and sometimes deceptive lending in the credit card and housing markets, to help families climb out of crippling debt, and stay out of debt in the first place." "Now these steps that I've proposed are all paid for," Obama said. It's that last phrase we're interested in. We interpret it to mean Obama would do all that spending without increasing the budget deficit, and has detailed how he would do so. Advisers and surrogates for Obama have said that more explicitly. "He (Obama) has proposed an entire domestic program that would not increase the deficit at all over the course of his first term in office," his economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said in a conference call on June 9. Obama "pays and proposes ways to pay for all of his tax cuts and all of his spending," his ally John Edwards said on the June 16 broadcast of ABC's This Week. Let's start by looking at the specific programs Obama referred to. The "broad-based, middle-class tax cut" he spoke about referred to his "Making Work Pay" tax credit, plus a new income-tax exemption for seniors making under $50,000, his campaign said. Those together would cost about $80-billion a year, according to both the Obama campaign and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The "foreclosure prevention fund" would be a one-time cost of $10-billion, the campaign said. The health care plan, under which all Americans would be able to buy coverage similar to what members of Congress get, will cost some $50-billion to $65-billion per year, the campaign said. His aides said it's not clear how much stabilizing Social Security would cost, because both parties would have to hash out a plan to do so. His plan to help workers save is about a $20-billion-a-year program of employer mandates and tax credits. Finally, there's his plan to crack down on unfair lending and to help families out of debt. That referred to regulatory changes, like a proposed rating system for credit cards and home loans, which the campaign said would not cost anything. Now — does he have a plan to pay for all that spending? Here's where it gets tricky. Some of the foreclosure-prevention fund would come from penalties on irresponsible lenders, the campaign's Web site says . The Social Security fix might be funded by more payroll taxes on high-earners, Obama has said. But most of the money would come from what the campaign calls "baskets" of savings and new revenues. They include savings from a broad range of policy changes, such as ending the Iraq war, letting tax cuts expire for people who earn more than $250,000, closing corporate tax loopholes and discouraging offshore tax havens. The campaign says all those changes would yield several hundred billion dollars a year. For example, ending the Iraq war — the first five years of which cost $600-billion, according to the Pentagon — would save between $90-billion and $100-billion a year, the Obama campaign asserts. All the savings together would be easily enough to pay for all the programs Obama mentioned, along with all the other new spending and tax cuts he plans, the campaign says. But are Obama's savings estimates realistic? We don't know. The campaign has not provided enough detail to validate them, said Greg Leiserson of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "They (the policy changes) could raise a lot of money, they could raise a little money, we just don't know," said Leiserson, who co-wrote an analysis of both candidates' tax plans. That undercuts Obama's claim that he has "paid for" his programs. There's another problem. Current tax law calls for President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 to expire at the end of 2010, and for the alternative minimum tax to be imposed on far more taxpayers than it is now. If that happened, the budget deficit would shrink and reach a surplus again by 2012, the Congressional Budget Office projects . (That projection assumes spending on existing programs, including the war in Iraq, continues, growing at the rate of inflation.) But Obama's plan calls for the tax cuts to be extended for everyone who makes less than $250,000. Overall, his tax plan would decrease revenue by $2.7-trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis . That seems likely to yield a large deficit rather than a surplus. Obama could always close the deficit by cutting spending, but he has not spelled out how he would do so. In fact, Obama's does not promise he won't leave a deficit. In interviews, his economic aides merely said he would leave less of a deficit than the $357-billion gap expected this year. They say that's the best measure of whether Obama's plan is "paid for." However, that the 2008 deficit is temporarily high because of a one-time economic stimulus. It's true that Obama has outlined in very general terms where he would get the money to pay for his proposals. And it may be true that those proposals will leave the deficit smaller than it is now, though we can't say for sure. More to the point, Obama can't say for sure. Until he fleshes out his economic plan considerably more, it's disingenuous to go around claiming his proposals are "paid for." And that claim is even more suspect considering that his proposals would leave a larger deficit than would the tax laws currently on the books. We find his claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06151	A study says Massachusetts has lost 18,000 jobs because residents were required to obtain health insurance under an act signed into law by Mitt Romney.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-study-found-massachusetts-lost-180/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry continues to hit fellow GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, over similarities between the state health care plan Romney signed in 2006 and the federal act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. At the Dec. 10, 2011, debate in Iowa, Perry said he was stunned by Romney’s earlier comment that he would have told President Barack Obama he was headed in the wrong direction on health care, because "that is exactly the path that you've taken Massachusetts." Perry continued: "The Beacon Hill study itself said that there’s been 18,000 jobs lost because of that individual mandate." Perry was referring to the requirement in the Massachusetts law, also found in the national one, that individuals buy health insurance or pay a fine. We wondered whether Perry was right about the study and the Massachusetts mandate's impact on jobs in the state. Fortunately, PolitiFact previously looked into a similar Perry claim, made in an Oct. 10 video posted online by the Texan's campaign: "Romneycare killed 18,000 jobs." "Romneycare" is a label that critics have applied to the Massachusetts health care law, which is similar in its broad outline to the national health care law. In addition to including an individual mandate, the Massachusetts and federal laws both leave in place the existing insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. Both also seek to reduce the number of uninsured residents by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help moderate-income people buy insurance. Companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. The state and national laws also each provide for voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. The exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. Both the statement in the Perry video and the statement Perry made in the Dec. 10 debate were based on a September 2011 study by the Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based economics research group that is affiliated with Suffolk University and supports "limited government, fiscal responsibility and free markets." Both statements suggest that 18,000 actual jobs were eliminated because of the Massachusetts law. In fact, however, the Beacon Hill study makes the more modest assertion that the law prevented 18,000 jobs from being created. The study is based on the idea that the Massachusetts law drove up health care costs for state government (through increased Medicaid spending) and for individuals and businesses (through higher health insurance premiums), which in turn dampened job growth. Using a computer program that models how policies could affect the state’s economy, the Beacon Hill researchers estimated that the state’s economy created 18,313 fewer jobs in 2010 than it would have without the health care law. To put the so-called uncreated jobs in perspective, the Massachusetts workforce was about 3.5 million people in July 2010, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployed numbered about 293,000. We should note here that reports like this one largely depend on the underlying economic assumptions behind the economic model that is used. Right-leaning and left-leaning groups often come up with different numbers when looking at the same policies. In this case, we were unable to find any other studies that looked at the effects of the Massachusetts health care law on employment. Our friends at Factcheck.org checked out the 18,000 number in September after Perry started making the claim on the campaign trail. They concluded that the figure was an estimate that could neither be proved nor disproved after gleaning mixed opinions in Massachusetts on whether the law hurt actual job growth. Separately, we recalled an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of how many jobs might be lost or gained nationwide because of the 2010 federal health care law. The analysis found that the law would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about 800,000 jobs, partly because businesses facing higher costs would decide not to add workers but mostly because people working jobs simply to retain their existing health insurance would be able to leave those jobs and buy insurance on their own. Our ruling In the Dec. 10 debate, Perry cited a study that found increased costs led businesses to create fewer jobs. That is certainly plausible, although we found no other research supporting that figure. More significantly, Perry's statement makes it sound as if the study says existing jobs in Massachusetts were vanquished. Instead, it asserts that 18,000 jobs were not created in the first place. Also, Perry’s claim blames one part of the health care law — the individual mandate — for the effect on employment, while the study considers the impact of the entire law. That is, it doesn't specify which parts most influenced the state’s economy. A single study gives Perry's statement an element of truth. But his claim leaves the misimpression that 18,000 existing jobs went away because of the Massachusetts law and incorrectly says a single part of the law was to blame.

pomt-06757	"Last year -- actually, this year in May -- we saw New Jersey Transit fares rise anywhere from 25 percent to 47 percent."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/23/albert-papp-jr/rail-transit-advocacy-group-president-claims-nj-tr/	As far as Albert Papp Jr. is concerned, any fare increase placed on commuters is a tax increase -- including the hikes that Papp said were imposed this year by NJ Transit. The president of the 31-year-old New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers, Papp appeared on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show this past weekend to provide his take on the toll hikes recently approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie had said a toll increase is not a tax increase, but Papp wasn’t buying that argument. "Our group believes that any fare increase is a tax increase. Last year -- actually, this year in May -- we saw New Jersey Transit fares rise anywhere from 25 percent to 47 percent," Papp told guest-host Luke Margolis. "Unfortunately, the petroleum tax, the gas tax in New Jersey, on motorists has stayed constant and we're now the third-lowest in the country. "So from our ridership perspective, from our membership's perspective, we basically think that we have seen a tax increase," Papp continued. "And the governor made a very, very strident point that under his administration, we would not see these tax increases. All we're trying to say is we want social equity for the mass transit rider, especially the rail rider." PolitiFact New Jersey checked out Papp’s comments on NJ Transit fares, and quickly found that he made two mistakes: fares increased in May 2010, not this year, and the increases for all NJ Transit services varied more widely than the figures provided by Papp. Papp acknowledged in a phone interview how, referring to when the fares increased, he made an "incorrect correction." "That was my fault," Papp said. "I was right the first time." First, let’s talk about those NJ Transit fare increases. Faced with an anticipated $300 million budget gap, NJ Transit officials last year hiked fares on buses and trains. Effective May 1, 2010, fares went up on average by 10 percent for local buses, light rail trains, and buses run by private carriers. Fares went up by 10 percent as well for the Access Link service for the disabled. Rail fares increased by 25 percent, and fares for interstate/commuter buses also rose on average by 25 percent. In July 2011, NJ Transit approved a spending plan for fiscal year 2012 that keeps fares frozen. So, Papp’s statement did not reflect the 10 percent increases, but how did he get to 47 percent? Papp told us that higher percentage is an average based on the fact that NJ Transit eliminated off-peak round-trip rail discounts. NJ Transit spokeswoman Courtney Carroll confirmed the impact of cutting the off-peak discounts. "Yes, the elimination of the rail off-peak discount resulted in an approximate increase of 47 percent (fare change plus discount eliminated) for some customers," Carroll wrote in an email. However, it’s worth noting that only about 13 percent of total weekday rail trips used the off-peak discount, according to Carroll. Off-peak discounts were utilized for 17 percent of total rail trips, Carroll said. In other words, the vast majority of people riding the rails were not impacted by those higher increases. The ruling Papp claimed that NJ Transit fares increased this year between 25 and 47 percent, but he was wrong about the timing of the increases. NJ Transit fares actually went up in 2010 and remain frozen this year. Papp did not mention the 10 percent hike for local buses, light rail trains and the Access Link service. But for the most part, his figures are on target for the rail passengers represented by his organization. At a time when the Port Authority’s tolls are on the rise, NJ Transit customers have been digging further into their pockets as well. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-01071	Says Nikita Khrushchev brought an extra shoe to a United Nations session in 1960, which he banged on the desk in protest.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/18/arthur-cyr/curious-case-khrushchev-shoe/	Adults of a certain age -- those who lived through the Cold War, specifically the era in which the Soviet Union was ruled by Nikita Khrushchev -- will remember hearing how the volatile leader demanded attention during a session of the United Nations by taking off a shoe and banging it on his desk. The History Channel website refers to it as "one of the most surreal moments in the history of the Cold War." In a Dec. 26 commentary in The Providence Journal, Arthur Cyr, a professor at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis., offered an intriguing detail about the incident. While discussing Cuba and President Obama's effort to reestablish ties with the country, Cyr mentioned the relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union. Cuban leader "Fidel Castro highlighted alliance with the Soviet Union by joining Nikita Khrushchev in a raucous 1960 visit to the United Nations. The New York session was punctuated by the Soviet leader publicly pounding a shoe on a desk (while wearing two shoes)," Cyr wrote. The shoe Khrushchev famously pounded on the table at the U.N. was a spare? That struck us as a surprising historical footnote -- so surprising we wondered why we hadn't heard about this third shoe before. Why bring a special shoe to a debate when you're wearing two that would easily serve as makeshift gavels? Intrigued, we sought details. We thought we might find some information at Wikipedia. Sure enough, there's a whole page devoted to the "shoe-banging incident." But it makes no mention of a third shoe. More surprisingly, it turns out that there's good reason to question whether Khrushchev ever banged his shoe at all. First, we emailed Cyr, asking for the source for his twist on the story. He said it came from "The Soviet Union 1917-1991" by Martin McCauley, a senior lecturer at the University of London. Cyr quoted page 273 of the book: "It was all premeditated. Careful examination of the shoe-bashing incident reveals he was wearing two shoes at the time." We wrote back to Cyr, asking if McCauley cited any source that might indicate what type of "careful examination" was done, especially when there are questions about whether the shoe bashing occurred at all. Cyr never responded. So we bought the book. McCauley, who has 41 footnotes for that chapter alone, lists no source for the factoid. Nor does he offer any specifics about the "careful examination." So we emailed him. "My source for the Khrushchev shoe banging episode was a Russian," he responded. "Unfortunately it is too long ago to remember who gave me the information." Thus, there's no hard evidence a third shoe was used in an attempt to clog the debate, as it were. And we noticed something else. In his book, McCauley reports that Khrushchev "shouted, laughed and interrupted speakers and even banged his shoe on his desk during Harold Macmillan's speech." Macmillan was the British prime minister at the time. That's interesting because, according to U.N. records, Macmillan didn't address the General Assembly on the day of the alleged footwear incident, and the New York Times, which reported the story on the front page of its Oct. 13 edition, gave a very different account. On Oct. 12, the Times says, "Mr. Khrushchev was apparently infuriated by a statement by Lorenzo Sumulong, a member of the Philippine delegation. . . . Mr. Khrushchev thereupon pulled off his right shoe, stood up and brandished the shoe at the Philippine delegate on the other side of the hall. He then banged the shoe on his desk." Not only does the Times say Khrushchev used his own shoe, but the paper identifies it as his right shoe. Nonetheless, as we noted earlier, questions have been raised about whether the shoe-banging occurred at all. It's clear that there was a shoe. The Oct. 13 Times story is accompanied by a photograph of a shoe on Khrushchev's desk. The question is whether he ever used it as a gavel. As the Wikipedia article and the sources it cites make clear, there are many versions floating around. So many, in fact, that the affair sounds like it might be an urban legend. A photograph of the Soviet leader holding up a shoe, which was run by Time magazine, has widely been discounted as a fake (Wikipedia has the undoctored and doctored images). In fact, despite of all the media covering the session, there is no photographic record of Khrushchev banging his shoe. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, who has lived in Rhode Island since 1991, told us that he and his family sought photographic evidence from the archives of NBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. They came up empty-handed. When Amherst College political science professor William Taubman -- who originally believed that Khrushchev used the shoe to bang on the table -- revisited the question for a 2003 article, he reported that another Times correspondent, James Feron, who was also at the U.N. at the time, insisted that the Soviet leader never banged it. Khrushchev "leaned over, took off a slip-on shoe, waved it pseudomenacingly, and put it on his desk, but he never banged his shoe," Taubman quotes Feron as saying. Feron told Taubman that the author of the Times article, Benjamin Welles, didn't witness the banging but based his story on second-hand accounts. Taubman, a Khrushchev biographer, also quotes John Loengard, a former picture editor for Life magazine, as reporting that Khrushchev reached down, took off a brown loafer, put it on his desk and signaled to some delegates that he was going to bang his shoe. About 10 photographers in the press booth were poised to capture the event. They were disappointed. "He only put it on again and left. None of us missed the picture -- which would have been a serious professional error. The event never occurred," Loengard told Taubman. "I still go with the theory that there were two shoes, that he brandished one of them, but that he did not actually bang either of them on the table at the United Nations," Taubman told us in an email. We will note, just as a matter of speculation, that there's another possibility, one that arises from that 1960 New York Times account. The Times reported there was a second shoe incident soon after the first. "Later," the Times reported, "during the debate on colonialism in which tempers flared among several delegations, Mr. Khrushchev alternately shouted, waved a brawny right arm, shook his finger and removed his shoe a second time. The second shoe incident occurred during a speech by Francis O. Wilcox, an Assistant United States Secretary of State. Mr. Khrushchev and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko exchanged smiles and winks and Mr. Khrushchev then reached down and slipped his shoe back on." Perhaps Khrushchev did bang his shoe and most people missed it. And when word spread to the photographers to focus on Khrushchev, the Soviet leader didn't deliver. That would also explain why the only photographic evidence the Times had was the photo of the shoe sitting on his desk. Our ruling Commentator Arthur Cyr stated that Nikita Khrushchev brought an extra shoe to a United Nations session, which he used to bang on the desk in protest in 1960. His sole piece of evidence is a statement in a Martin McCauley book that talks about "careful examination of the shoe-bashing incident." But McCauley doesn't cite a source or outline the evidence that was supposedly the subject of "careful examination." And now, more than two decades later, he can't remember who told him. So at this point, there is no solid evidence for a third shoe. Meanwhile, the New York Times account from that era states that Khrushchev took off his own shoe. We can't resolve the controversy over whether Khrushchev used it as a gavel. But, based on the absence of evidence, we rate Cyr's Third Shoe claim as False. READ Cyr's rebuttal.

Bush."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/may/09/gilberto-hinojosa/gilberto-hinojosa-says-nation-gained-more-jobs-oba/	Saying the country needs to build on President Barack Obama’s first term, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party said job gains bear that out. "In April," Gilberto Hinojosa said in an email blast sent May 8, 2013, the day before Obama stopped in Austin to talk economic issues, "165,000 new jobs were created and the unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level since 2008. The economy added more jobs during four years under Obama than it did in the entire eight years under George W. Bush!" We were curious about Hinojosa’s comparison. Were more jobs created in Obama’s first term than during Bush’s two terms? Tanene Allison, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, pointed us to an April 16, 2013, article by FactCheck.org, the fact-checking project based at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, stating: "The economy has added more jobs since Obama took office than it did in his predecessor’s entire eight years in office." An accompanying chart laid out an array of facts, including that 1.564 million jobs had been gained nationally since Obama became president. (The chart also said: "Caution: No single number can tell the whole story.") Citing figures devised by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the FactCheck article said that in Obama’s first term, the economy added a net total of 1.208 million jobs, beating Bush’s eight-year total of 1.083 million net jobs gained, though the article also cautioned that bureau figures are subject to revision. By email, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, sent us monthly job totals covering January 2001, when Bush was sworn in as president, through early 2013, when Obama ended his first term. The figures indicate that when Bush became president, the country had 132.5 million jobs. In January 2009, when Obama succeeded him, it had 133.6 million jobs — or about 1.1 million more. In January 2013, after Obama’s first term, the U.S. had 134.8 million jobs — or about 1.2 million more than when he became president. The resulting 100,000 difference in jobs would seem to back Hinojosa’s claim, which if it was extended to consider job gains through the latest month analyzed by the bureau, April 2013, would widen Obama’s lead in jobs gained to nearly 800,000, the figures indicate. Then again, there were oscillations in total jobs through Bush’s years. For example, total jobs dipped to nearly 130 million in August 2003, the third year of Bush’s tenure. After that, the bureau figures indicate, the economy mostly experienced month-to-month job gains until 2008, peaking at 138 million jobs in January 2008. As of that month, the economy had gained more than 7 million jobs on his watch — a figure outpacing gains to date under Obama. However, the major recession subsequently knocked down the total number of jobs in every one of Bush’s last dozen months, accounting for a single-year reduction of about 4 million jobs. We’d be remiss, finally, if we failed to point out that while presidents invariably take credit, and are blamed, for economic ups and downs, job gains and losses are influenced by many factors beyond White House control. Our ruling Hinojosa said the economy gained more jobs in Obama’s first term than it did through Bush’s two terms. This statement depends on cherry-picking information for particular months--obscuring the fact that at one point during Bush’s presidency, the economy had gained more jobs than the country picked up in Obama’s first term. It’s also a stretch to pin, or associate, job gains or losses on any president. The economy is influenced by many additional factors. These clarifications aside, the nation had net job gains during Obama’s first term outpacing net job gains through Bush’s two terms, which ended with a downturn that was the worst since the Great Depression. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Gilberto Hinojosa	None	None	None	2013-05-09T18:38:24	2013-05-08	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12501	Says President Donald Trump "has given more financial disclosure than anybody else."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/steve-mnuchin/no-trump-has-not-given-more-financial-disclosure-a/	Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says President Donald Trump "has no intention" of releasing his tax returns to the public, arguing that Americans have more than enough information about the president's financial matters. During an April 26 press conference to outline Trump's tax plan, a reporter asked Mnuchin if Trump will release his tax returns. "The president has no intention," Mnuchin replied. "The president has released plenty of information and, I think, has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information." We’ve heard claims like this before. But as we concluded in the past, Trump’s lack of tax returns undermine any type of claim that he’s released more financial information than anybody else. What do we know about Trump’s finances? When we asked the Treasury Department about Mnuchin’s comments, staff told us that his remark was specifically in reference to Trump’s 92-page financial disclosure form. That financial disclosure form is formally known as the Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report. The personal financial disclosure form must by law be made public. Trump’s disclosure form is extensive and includes 92 pages of small-print details on assets and income. Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh said Mnuchin claim was grounded in the fact that Mitt Romney’s form was only 47 pages, not counting amendments and updates. Sayegh argued that even Romney, a businessman with a complex set of holdings, didn't release as much in his financial disclosure. But extensive or not, the financial disclosure form is not a substitute for tax returns. And given the fact Mnuchin remark was made after a question about tax returns, it’s possible that his comment would be interpreted more broadly to include all the types of financial disclosure, not just the form. When Trump argued that his financial disclosures were "the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics," we rated that claim False. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and the extent and nature of his charitable giving. Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of Trump’s liquid assets and what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. The returns would also show if Trump has access to specialized tax breaks. "It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation," Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told PolitiFact in October. Trump was the first major presidential nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns, citing a routine audit. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns but instead provided a summary of his taxes. His opponent, Jimmy Carter, did release his tax returns that year — and every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, until Trump. Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Former president Barack Obama released tax returns for 16 years (2000-15.) George W. Bush and Bill Clinton released tax returns for every year in office except for their last. George Bush released three years of returns, and Reagan released 6 years worth of returns. Before the election, Trump promised he would release his returns after a routine audit was over. However, there is no law that prohibits someone from releasing tax returns during an audit. (Richard Nixon released tax returns in the middle of an audit a year after being re-elected.) On April 17, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's audit was still ongoing, but Mnuchin remarks suggest it might not happen at all. Without his tax returns, it’s hard to know how Trump would personally benefit from his tax cut proposals. Trump’s proposal recommends sharp cuts in individual and business income tax rates, as well as eliminating the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. Additional context about Trump, tax returns and the public Although Trump has refused to release his tax returns, some of them have leaked out. Most recently, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC revealed a small portion of Trump's 2005 tax return. It showed that he earned $150 million that year and paid federal taxes of about $38 million. In 1995, Trump reported a $916 million loss, according to the three pages of returns obtained and verified by the New York Times in September. We know a little bit about Trump’s taxes in the 1970s. A 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. Page 33 reports on Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report says that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77. Trump did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 because, according to the tax rules, he lost money those years. But the report reveals no specifics, so the details of his tax returns for those years remain a mystery. Trump’s taxes have piqued the interests of voters for quite some time now. In January, Trump said that Americans don’t care about his tax returns, but several polls of the time show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump’s tax returns are an important issue. Our ruling Mnuchin said Trump "has given more financial disclosure than anybody else." Trump released a financial disclosure report that all presidential candidates are required to fill out, but the fact that Trump has not released any tax filings undermines Munchin’s claim. Experts told us that tax returns would offer valuable details on his tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and his charitable giving, as well as a better idea of his income-producing assets. When we look at all the types of financial disclosure Trump could provide to the public, the lack of transparency around his tax returns remains a significant omission compared with recent presidents. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Steve Mnuchin	None	None	None	2017-04-27T13:34:32	2017-04-27	['None']
pomt-09487	"The costs for families (in the individual market) for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/barack-obama/obama-says-under-democratic-health-plan-family-ins/	For many people, the health care issue boils down to this: Are my insurance rates going to go up or down? Not surprisingly then, one of the testiest exchanges at the health care summit on Feb. 25, 2010, came between President Barack Obama and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., over the issue of how the Democrats' health care plan would affect premiums. Interestingly, both cited an analysis of the Senate health care bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to make their case. "The Congressional Budget Office report says that premiums will rise in the individual market as a result of the Senate bill," Alexander said. "No, no, no, no," Obama retorted. "This is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight." "Let me respond to what you just said, Lamar, because it's not factually accurate," Obama continued. "Here's what the Congressional Budget Office says. The costs for families for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent. What the Congressional Budget Office says is that because now they've got a better deal, because policies are cheaper, they may choose to buy better coverage than they have right now, and that might be 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive than the bad insurance that they had previously. "But they didn't say that the actual premiums would be going up. What they said was they'd be going down by 14 percent to 20 percent. And I promise you, I've gone through this carefully with the Congressional Budget Office, and I'll be happy to present this to the press and whoever's listening because this is an important issue." Alexander later stood his ground, saying, "With respect, you're wrong about -- your bill would increase premiums, I believe. You say it wouldn't. So rather than argue with you in public about it, I'd like to put my facts down, give them to you." "I think it's a great idea," Obama said. "I'd like to get this issue settled about whether premiums are reduced before we leave today, because I'm pretty certain I'm not wrong." This seemed like a good place for us to step in and referee. First, one of the key qualifiers that many people may have lost in this exchange is that they were debating the effects on premiums for people in the individual market. These are the people who do not get their insurance through an employer. This is only a fraction of the overall market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the Democrats' plan were adopted, the individual market would grow to about 17 percent of the American population by 2016. The Democrats' plan calls for the creation of a health insurance exchange in which individuals could shop for insurance with private companies competing for their business. The idea is that it would allow individuals to purchase insurance at lower, group rates. Plans offered by companies participating in the exchange would have to meet government-mandated minimum coverage thresholds. The CBO estimated that the average premium for people in the individual market would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than under current law. Specifically, the CBO estimates the average cost of family policies purchased by individuals would be $15,200 in 2016, as opposed to $13,100 under current law. That's the backing for Alexander's comment. But Obama correctly notes that much of the added cost is tied to people getting better insurance. The CBO said there are three drivers that would cause premiums to rise or fall. And it broke them down as follows: • Average premiums would be 27 percent to 30 percent higher because a greater amount of coverage would be obtained. In particular, the average insurance policy would cover a substantially larger share of enrollees’ costs for health care and a slightly wider range of benefits. Those expansions would reflect both the minimum level of coverage (and related requirements) specified in the proposal and people’s decisions to purchase more extensive coverage in response to subsidies. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a net reduction in costs to insurers, mostly from the changes in the rules governing the individual market. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a shift in the types of people obtaining coverage. Most of that change is tied to an influx of healthier people with below-average spending for health care, who would purchase coverage because of subsidies and a new tax penalty for failing to purchase insurance. Obama gets to his figure by combining those last two cost reductions, but not including the cost increase tied to people essentially getting better insurance. Both Obama and Alexander cited figures independent of the effect of subsidies. But we think it bears noting that under the Senate health plan, about 57 percent of people on the individual market would receive federal subsidies, and those subsidies would cover nearly two-thirds of the total premium. One last point, the Democrats' plan would allow people who currently have individual policies to grandfather in their existing policy. According to the CBO, "the premiums for those policies would probably not differ substantially from current-law levels." In other words, if you were to opt to keep the exact same individual plan (an option the CBO doesn't believe many will take because, with subsidies, most could get a better plan cheaper), the CBO doesn't see the cost rising or falling substantially. And again, we are talking here only about premiums for people in the individual market. For most people, who get their insurance through their company, the CBO projects premiums to decline slightly from where they'd go if no health plan is passed. How slightly? In the 0 to 3 percent range, depending on whether you work at a large or small company. We think both Obama and Alexander have selectively chosen from the CBO report to suit their needs. Alexander insists the cost of premiums in the individual market will go up, without acknowledging that that's because most people will be getting better insurance coverage, either because of new government-mandated minimum coverage levels or because many will decide that subsidies will make upgrades to a better plan more cost-effective. Bottom line, people won't be paying more for the same thing. They'll be paying more for better plans. And on top of that, many will get federal subsidies, so they won't be paying the increased cost out of their own pockets. But we also think Obama has put on blinders when citing the CBO report. Yes, the CBO estimated 14 to 20 percent savings due to rule changes in the individual market, and because the plan is expected to infuse a large number of low-risk people into the insurance pool. But he ignores the estimated cost increases tied to more people getting better insurance. Obama tries to gloss over this by comparing costs "for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving." But the fact is, most would not be getting the same kind of coverage. Some of the shift to better coverage would be due to personal choice -- with subsidies, many people would be able to get better coverage at the same cost or cheaper -- but some would be tied to new government-mandated minimum coverage and the threat of tax penalties if you decide not to get insurance. And for those who opt to grandfather in their current individual policies (even if they don't meet the new government minimum standards), the CBO doesn't see much of a change in premiums one way or the other. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-02-25T19:26:36	2010-02-25	['None']
pomt-03093	"Unlike you and me, Congress gets to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies" under Obamacare.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/25/karen-handel/does-obamacare-claim-get-clean-bill-health/	Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel was the first of the Republican candidates for U.S. Senate to cut a commercial in the campaign, and we thought one specific line in the ad was worthy of an examination. Here’s what Handel said about it in her radio ad that premiered Sept. 6. "Under Obamacare, members of Congress and their staffs are required to buy health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges or plans created under Obamacare – just like you and me," Handel said. "But unlike you and me, Congress gets to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies – all thanks to a special deal worked out with President Obama. Handel and her GOP competitors are united in their opposition to the health care law, which most Republicans and the president call "Obamacare." House Republicans, including some candidates in the Senate race, are involved in a ninth-inning effort to defund the law through a bill floating in Congress. Handel has bashed one particular aspect of the law, a recent decision by the Obama administration to provide federal funding to offset health care coverage for members of Congress and eligible staff members. So, do members of Congress and their staffs get to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies? Handel, who almost won the GOP nomination for governor in 2010, is one of six Republicans who’ve announced plans to run for the Senate seat currently held by Saxby Chambliss that’s up for grabs in 2014. Chambliss has announced he is not running for a third term. Handel has attempted to separate herself from three House members running for the Senate seat -- Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston -- by linking them to contentious congressional policies. On Sept. 9, though, Gingrey introduced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from receiving any money from the federal government to help pay their health care coverage through an exchange plan. Earlier this month, PolitiFact Georgia researched Handel’s claim that Congress secured special Obamacare rules "to prevent their health care costs from rising" and rated it as Half True. So did Handel receive a clean bill of health from the Truth-O-Meter for the most recent claim? Obamacare boots members of Congress and their staffs from their generous Federal Employees Health Benefits plans at year's end, meaning they will have to select an insurance plan from exchanges designed for those who lack employer-based health insurance. When Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. There was uncertainty that federal contributions for health care coverage to members of Congress and their staff would continue when the law passed. On Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the contributions provide up to $5,000 a year for individual coverage and as much as $11,000 for families under some of the most popular health plans, The New York Times reported. That is a subsidy of about 75 percent of the health insurance costs for members of Congress and their staffs, according to a Sept. 18 article in The Atlanta Journal Constitution. Some lawmakers were not happy with the decision. "[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans," U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, said after the OPM’s announcement. "When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats." In Georgia, census reports show that the median household income from 2007 to 2011 was $49,736. Most households in Georgia would qualify for some kind of subsidy if they bought health insurance through an exchange. Most members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000. The leaders in both chambers make more, with House Speaker John Boehner at the top of the list at $223,500 a year. Some chiefs of staffs to lawmakers make annual salaries exceeding $135,000, according to a December 2010 Sunlight Foundation report. Assistants and clerks make in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, the report found. The Office of Personnel Management’s website contains a state-by-state breakdown of the cost for various health care plans for non-U.S. Postal Service workers. The highest monthly subsidy the government would pay for family plans in each state and the District of Columbia was $920.73. Multiplied by 12 months, and that total is $11,048.76. Loren Adler, research director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said she believed Handel’s claim in the radio ad is accurate. "[T]he statement is correct, especially since it’s worded as getting ‘to keep’ the subsidy," said Adler, who has worked with some senators on health care issues. We asked Adler how many lawmakers would maximize their coverage. He directed us to an August study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found the average monthly health care premium for family coverage in 2013 will be $1,363. Some single-coverage health care plans in Washington, D.C., that Adler has seen cost $9,700 a year. "Since family plans generally cost more than twice a single one, there should be at least some offerings expensive enough for a congressional employee to get the $11,000 subsidy for them and their family," Adler said. Again, Handel claimed in a radio ad that members of Congress get to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies to offset health care coverage costs after an arrangement made by the Obama administration. Lawmakers can get as much as $11,000 for family coverage. This is a continuation of a prior funding policy for lawmakers and their staffs that seemed to be unclear when the health care law was passed. Members of Congress and their staffs, however, aren’t the only ones getting taxpayer-funded subsidies. Millions of Americans could get them, based on their incomes. Members of Congress and the high-paid members of their staffs are unique in one important sense. They far exceed the income caps put on the subsidies for average Americans. Handel’s statement is partially accurate, but it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate this statement as Half True.

pomt-06104	"Eighty percent of all U.S. communities depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered online."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/04/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-says-truck-services-often-only-link-us-/	The issue doesn't generate many headlines, but proposed changes in trucking's Hours-of-Service regulations have stirred hot controversy in the industry. When the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on the economic impact of the changes, the title alone hinted at some of the issues involved: "The Price of Uncertainty: How Much Could DOT's Proposed Billion Dollar Service Rule Cost Consumers This Holiday Season?" The Hours-of-Service regulations set limits for when and how long commercial motor vehicle operators may drive. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which developed the rules, says they were based on an exhaustive review of research on the science on driver alertness and working hours, "and strike the crucial balance between safety and economic vitality." The committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio's 4th District, stressed how widely the regulations would be felt: "The vast majority of all retailers, and 80 percent of all U.S. communities, depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered on-line," he said. That caught the interest of PolitiFact Ohio. We asked Jordan's office for more information. Jordan’s press secretary, Meghan Snyder, said the 80 percent figure came from the American Trucking Associations, which cited the Rand McNally Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide. Darrin Roth, director of highway operations for the American Trucking Associations, confirmed that. He said his group had found the number of communities served by railroads -- 18.3 percent -- "and did the inverse." He sent us the spreadsheet from atlas publisher Rand McNally showing state-by-state figures for rail service. It had the 18.3 percent figure. It also showed a slightly smaller percentage for Ohio, where 627 communities of a total 3,516 (or 17.8 percent) were shown having rail service. We found that puzzling for another reason. Census data on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted show Ohio with 247 cities, 691 villages and 1,308 townships, for a total of 2,246 divisions. That's 1,270 fewer than the number of communities cited by Rand McNally. Where did they get their figure? Rand McNally's media relations department told us that they have not produced the Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide "in many years, so we can't query the database any longer to specifically explain the difference in Ohio." In fact, the spreadsheet the American Trucking Associations provided lists its data source as from May 2000. The atlas maker’s mapping specialists provided this explanation about the communities: "Rand McNally included unincorporated places into the count which would make our number higher. Rand McNally had its own criteria for smaller populated places that would differ from the Census. Over the last decade that we produced the Commercial Atlas, Rand McNally continually analyzed and removed some of these smaller populated places year after year as population decreased from these older places or they went out of existence. These sometimes included rail yards, postal facilities, parks, etc., with small populations around them. In some portions of the country, this could result in significant differences between the Census reporting of 'community' and ours." In other words, city neighborhoods and rural crossings that are not distinct governmental entities might have been counted as communities. And while an area like Greater Cleveland most definitely has rail service, not all of the area's hundreds of neighborhoods and suburbs do. Jordan's statement originates with a credible source -- Rand McNally. And the cited data backs his claim that "80 percent of all U.S. communities depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered online." But it also should be noted that Rand McNally hasn’t produced the Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide "in many years," and it is that data that the American Trucking Associations used to generate the figure of 80 percent. That’s a piece of information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s claim rates as Mostly True.	None	Jim Jordan	None	None	None	2012-01-04T06:00:00	2011-11-30	['United_States']

pomt-09784	On whether he would put a missile shield in Poland.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/22/barack-obama/did-obama-flip-whether-he-would-continue-pursue-mi/	When President Barack Obama announced on Sept. 17, 2009, that he had decided to scrap the Bush administration's plans for a long-range missile defense shield in Poland in favor of a different missile defense plan, an astute PolitiFact reader called our attention to an interview Obama did during the campaign in which Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly tried to pin Obama down on this very issue. "Here's a Flip Flop for you from Obama!" the reader wrote, with a helpful YouTube link to the interview (fast forward to about the 3:40 mark). After introducing the issue of a missile shield in Poland, here's the full text of the exchange on Sept. 10, 2008: "Putin doesn't like it," O'Reilly said. "Are you gonna keep that missile shield in there?" "I've said this before," Obama responded, "the Russians are playing a game when they pretend this missile shield is directed against all their ICBMs." "It's ridiculous," O'Reilly agreed. "It's a defensive thing." "It's a defensive thing," Obama repeated. "So you're going to keep them then?" O'Reilly asked again. "Given what has happened in Georgia, I think we have to send a clear signal that Poland and other countries in that region are not going to be subject to intimidation and aggression," Obama said. "Okay, I just want to get this on the record," O'Reilly said. "You're elected president, you're keeping the missile shield in Poland." Said Obama: "I think the missile shield is appropriate. I want to make sure it works though. I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got." Back in December 2006, President George W. Bush — on the advice of Defense Secretary Robert Gates — announced plans to place 10 ground-based interceptor missiles in Poland and an advanced radar in the Czech Republic. Although the idea was to destroy any long-range missiles that might be fired from the Middle East (specifically from Iran), the plan was sharply criticized by Russian officials who said they saw the missile shield as a threat to Russia. Fast-forward nearly three years to Sept. 17: The White House announced a shift in missile defense policy that called for scrapping the plans for advanced radar in the Czech Republic as well as the missile defense shield in Poland. Instead, the announcement said, President Obama called for a reshaped system designed to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran. The change in focus was immediately criticized by Republican rivals. "Only a year since Russia invaded Georgia, and 70 years to the day since the Soviet Union invaded Poland, the Obama administration is continuing its policy of appeasing adversaries at the expense of our allies," said Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference. In a op-ed response in the New York Times , Defense Secretary Gates said it was he who recommended the change. The missile defense plan that included a long-range missile defense shield in Poland was "the best plan based on the technology and threat assessment available" at the time Gates said he recommended it to Bush in 2006. But based in part on new intelligence, Gates said, he and other members of the national security team and senior military leadership decided on a "more suitable approach" to deploy "proven, sea-based SM-3 interceptor missiles — weapons that are growing in capability — in the areas where we see the greatest threat to Europe." "This will be a far more effective defense should an enemy fire many missiles simultaneously — the kind of attack most likely to occur as Iran continues to build and deploy numerous short- and medium-range weapons," Gates wrote. "At the same time, plans to defend virtually all of Europe and enhance the missile defense of the United States will continue on about the same schedule as the earlier plan as we build this system over time, creating an increasingly greater zone of protection. "We are strengthening — not scrapping — missile defense in Europe," Gates concluded. We're not wading into the debate over the appropriateness of the new missile defense strategy. Our concern here is whether Obama has flip-flopped on the issue since the campaign. O'Reilly was pretty persistent in trying to pin Obama down to a verbal commitment for or against the missile shield in Poland. And Obama finally answered that he thought the missile shield was "appropriate." But he left himself a little wiggle room when he added, "I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got." We went back and looked at some of Obama's other comments about a missile shield in Poland at that time to get a better sense of his position then. In campaign literature, Obama said, "We must seek a nuclear missile defense and demand that those efforts use resources wisely to build systems that would actually be effective. Missile defense requires far more rigorous testing to ensure that it is cost-effective and, most importantly, will work." After his election victory, the Obama-Biden transition Web site said its administration would "support missile defense, but ensure that it is developed in a way that is pragmatic and cost-effective; and, most importantly, does not divert resources from other national security priorities until we are positive the technology will protect the American public." After Obama made a courtesy call to Polish President Lech Kaczynski shortly after his election in November, a statement released by Kaczynski's office claimed Obama pledged "that the antimissile shield will be continued." But Denis McDonough, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, quickly responded that Obama made no such commitment. "His position is as it was throughout the campaign, that he supports deploying a missile defense system when the technology is proved to be workable," McDonough said. In an interview on CBS's Face the Nation on Sept. 20, 2009, Obama said it simply "hadn't been shown" that the missile defense shield in Poland would meet his requirement that it be "cost-effective, that the technologies are operable, that it's our best possible strategy." Rather, he said, Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff "came back to me and said, you know what, given what we know now we actually think that this is a better way of doing it. So we're not eliminating missile defense — in fact what we're doing is putting a system in that's more timely, more cost-effective, and that meets the actual threats that we perceive coming from Iran." There's no question that Obama changed his position from calling the missile-defense shield in Poland "appropriate" when pressed by O'Reilly in September 2008. And that change surely disappointed a number of officials in Poland. But then, as on numerous other occasions, Obama tempered his support for the long-range missile defense shield in Poland with the qualifiers that he wanted to "make sure it works," that it is cost-effective and "does not divert resources from other national security priorities." Obama ultimately decided the plan did not meet those tests. And so we give this a Half Flip.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-22T18:36:17	2009-09-17	['Poland']

pomt-04449	"When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, (U.S. Rep. Lois) Capps was the only member who voted no."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/emergency-committee-israel/pro-israel-group-attacks-rep-lois-capps-casting-on/	A new ad by the Emergency Committee for Israel -- a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer -- pummels U.S. Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., over Middle East policy. With a series of dark, conflict-heavy images and ominous music as a backdrop, the ad says, among other things, "When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, Capps was the only member who voted no." We wondered if it was true that Capps was really the only lawmaker to vote no on that measure. It turns out that Capps was indeed the only "no" vote recorded in the 417-to-1 roll call on March 1, 2012. But Capps says she voted that way by mistake, and she sought to correct the record immediately after the vote. Here’s what happened, based on the Congressional Record and interviews with Capps’ staff. The bill, H. Res. 556, condemned the government of Iran for "its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani on the charge of apostasy." Nadarkhani, an Iranian Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 for refusing to reject Christianity. He has since been freed, but at the time of the vote, his fate was uncertain, and his case had become something of a cause celebre. Capps cast a "no" vote, but within minutes of the floor vote, she or an aide realized that she had pressed the wrong button on the voting console. Within minutes, Capps addressed the House to explain her mistake. "Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct the record," Capps said in remarks available on YouTube. "I mistakenly voted ‘no’ just a few minutes ago on roll call (vote) 94 when I intended to vote ‘yes,’ and I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Record reflect that correction. I do support H. Res. 556 (and condemn) the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities. I concur with the resolution in calling for the exoneration and immediate release of Youcef Nadarkhani and all other individuals held or charged on account of their religion." That request was published in the Congressional Record, as was a longer statement that said in part, "It is deplorable, and this House should denounce it in the harshest of terms. Pastor Youcef deserves to be free. He deserves to practice his faith and be home with his wife and young children. He deserves to have his rights as a human being upheld and respected. I urge a yes vote on H. Res. 556." Capps’ office was also aggressive about correcting the record in the media. When the Christian Post published a story that cited Capps’ "no" vote, an aide to Capps contacted the publication, which proceeded to run a correction. Noah Pollak, executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, didn’t back down in an interview with PolitiFact. He said that Capps’ vote "is entirely consistent with the rest of her foreign policy record. Whatever excuses she came up with afterward -- obviously she is entitled to argue that case, but going with the way she voted, it’s not inconsistent." The problem for Capps is that once a vote is over, it’s untouchable -- votes cannot be changed retroactively. So the official tally will always reflect Capps’ mistaken vote rather than the one she intended. That said, at least one expert in congressional procedure said that Capps handled a difficult situation as best as she could. "Since we cannot read minds as to whether they made a mistake or were subsequently told by their office staff that they would be in deep political trouble if they do not make amends somehow, we have to take members at their word," said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "The sooner they correct things, the more believable they are; the later, the less so." Wolfensberger added that today, so many votes are taken in clusters that an honest mistake in voting is plausible. Our ruling The official record does show that Capps was the only lawmaker to vote "no" on the resolution in question, but that’s not the whole story. Quickly realizing her mistake, Capps took several steps to correct the record, including taking to the floor to clarify her position within minutes of the erroneous vote. The speed of her correction suggests that she is not simply changing her mind after the fact. The ad’s claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08911	Since the Democrats’ stimulus went into effect last year, Ohio has lost about 150,000 Jobs.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/28/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-ohio-lost-150000-jobs-congress-pa/	Rob Portman’s main knock on his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, is that Ohio has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs during his watch. Portman frequently mocks Fisher as Ohio’s "Job Czar," pointing out the state’s net job losses since Fisher entered office in January 2007. As of Monday, July 26, Ohio has lost 386,600 jobs since Fisher, who was the state’s chief development officer until he launched his Senate bid last year, become lieutenant governor. A former congressman from Cincinnati and a trade ambassador and budget director for Republican President George W. Bush, Portman does not support the federal stimulus package, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Democratic-led Congress passed the $787 billion bill Feb. 13 and President Barack Obama signed the bill four days later. To keep his attack fresh, Portman began linking the state’s job losses and the stimulus bill, suggesting that the bill itself is responsible for job losses during the last year and half. When Vice President Joe Biden attended a fund-raiser on June 30 in Cleveland with Fisher, Portman’s campaign issued this statement, which inflated the cost of the stimulus package by $213 billion: Biden’s "trip to Ohio would be a perfect opportunity for Lt. Gov. Fisher to admit that the Democrats' trillion-dollar stimulus isn't working and hasn't created the jobs in Ohio." The campaign release went on to say Ohio has lost 150,000 jobs since the stimulus bill passed. Portman’s campaign also used the 150,000-jobs-lost figure in a statement June 18, the day Obama visited Columbus to tout a road project funded with stimulus money. We wondered if that number was right, so we checked the official totals kept by the state. We found some problems with Portman’s claim and the campaign’s efforts to back it up: As of June 30, Ohio had lost 127,900 jobs, from February 2009 through May 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics Survey. It collects data from employers. The figure, the latest available at the time, is seasonally adjusted to avoid artificial spikes and does not include farm jobs, parameters typically applied when computing net job losses. The latest numbers are lower than the ones cited by Portman. His campaign initially cited as its source Ohio’s Department of Jobs and Family Services and data derived from the Current Population Survey, which surveys households, not employers. But using this data actually moves Portman even farther out of the ballpark. It shows that Ohio lost 113,000 jobs since the stimulus bill passed. Ohio has started to see net job gains in recent months, albeit small, contradicting a suggestion that the stimulus bill is causing job losses. Portman’s campaign later offered The Plain Dealer conflicting citations for the figures in both statements, and for the time-frame examined, making it difficult to pin down how and when they computed the figure. In the end, the number of jobs lost cited in Portman’s June 30 statement is inflated and not close enough to be considered a difference that can be attributed to rounding. Furthermore, while the campaign is correct that jobs have been lost since the stimulus was passed, its release ignores important context: Ohio has started to see net job gains in recent months, albeit small, contradicting a suggestion that the stimulus bill is causing job losses. So, for these reasons, we rate Portman's claim Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-07-28T15:45:00	2010-06-30	['Ohio', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01440	Under Rick Scott, there has been a "historic $20 billion in funds for education."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/06/republican-party-florida/rick-scott-holds-record-education-funding-republic/	Florida Republicans have tapped Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera of Miami to speak directly to Hispanic voters in a recent Spanish language TV ad. The ad touts Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s accomplishments. Here is part of the English translation: "He cut taxes 40 times, reformed Medicaid for the neediest and secured unprecedented funding for education." The text on the screen states, "Historic $20 billion in funds for education." We’ve already rated Half True the claim that Scott cut taxes 40 times for families; the statement about reforming Medicaid refers to the state getting a federal waiver to expand privatization in an attempt to save money, but this leaves out that the Legislature has rejected expanding Medicaid for poor adults. But what about the claim on education spending? It’s one of many in a tug-of-war between Scott and his Democratic challenger, former Gov. Charlie Crist. Both candidates have claimed that they hold the state record for most K-12 funding -- and, oddly enough, they both have plausible cases to make. Scott holds the record for total dollars spent, while Crist spent the most on record per pupil. In the recent Spanish-language ad, Scott’s claim about education spending is partially accurate but contains some key omissions. Here’s the rundown. The Republicans’ ad doesn’t specify what type of education funding it is referring to or which year. The ad provides a hint that it is about young children because it shows a video of two young girls wearing shirts that say "intergenerational child care." So we’ll look at K-12 spending. We asked officials at the Florida Department of Education for documentation showing the most recent figure for total K-12 funding for 2014-15. A September 2014 slideshow by the education department shows that total funding for the Florida Education Finance Program -- the main pot of money for K-12 -- was about $18.9 billion, including both state and local dollars. (The state dictates the local government contribution amount, so we have no quarrel with the Republicans adding the state and local dollar amounts together.) The state also receives about $1.5 billion in federal grants for K-12, so if we add up state, local and federal dollars, we end up at around $20.4 billion. So it’s reasonable for the Republicans to cite that $20 billion figure -- though it’s worth remembering that they are zeroing in on one year of Scott’s tenure while omitting any discussion of his other three budgets, including in 2011, when he signed off on a cut of $1.3 billion. After facing criticism for that cut, Scott has since supported increases in K-12 spending. As for the "historic" label, that depends on how you slice the numbers. The supporting information released by the GOP cites a June 2014 Tampa Bay Times story about Scott signing a $77 billion state budget, including money for K-12. "The bottom-line number for K-12 schools of $20.7 billion is the largest in history," the article stated. However, the article, unlike the ad, went on to say that this amount fell short of the per-pupil spending record under Crist. News articles in other publications also cited the same figure. Similarly, when Scott released his budget proposal in January 2014, it included $18.8 billion for K-12 education. While he touted that as that the "highest in Florida history," we rated that claim Half True because he focused on total spending while ignoring the fact that per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Per-pupil spending is a crucial measurement because it shows how much is spent on each student at a time when the number of students is rising. So how do those numbers look? We have rated Mostly True a Crist claim that Scott’s per-pupil education spending is "about $200 less" than the $7,126 his own administration spent per pupil during the recession. We found that this number is correct, though the record refers to the budget Crist signed in 2007, before the recession hit. In August 2014, Scott proposed a budget for next year that would include $7,176 in per-pupil spending to match Crist’s record. But if Scott wins and gets his wish on that dollar figure, Crist would still hold the record if you factor in inflation. It’s also important to point out that overall student enrollment has grown during Scott’s tenure, so it’s not a surprise that the total budget would grow, too. The schools’ full-time-equivalent student body grew by about 68,000 between 2011-12 and 2014-15. Our ruling The Republican Party’s ad says that under Rick Scott, Florida has had a "historic $20 billion in funds for education." The statement is accurate if we look at total K-12 spending for Scott’s fourth year in office. But this claim leaves out some important context -- that Crist still holds the per-pupil record and that Scott significantly reduced K-12 spending during his first year. We rate the statement in the ad Half True. Editor's note: This item has been updated to clarify that in August 2014 Scott proposed a budget of $7,176 in per-pupil spending.

pomt-11304	"X marks the spot at every HCA location where (Gov. Rick Scott) probably defrauded taxpayers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/apr/19/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-slam-rick-scott-defrauding-peopl/	Democrats had some fun with Photoshop after Florida Gov. Rick Scott released an ad promoting term limits in Congress. The TV ad shows Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, in front of a white board with an outline of the United States behind him. Halfway through the ad, Scott puts a red X next to Washington to illustrate his point that it's "the only place that doesn’t want term limits." The Florida Democratic Party recycled the image of Scott on Twitter to insert a joke about his tenure as CEO the Columbia/HCA hospital chain. Federal agents went public with an investigation into the company for Medicare fraud in 1997. Scott resigned from his post shortly after, and the company wound up paying a record $1.7 billion in fines after pleading guilty to 14 corporate felonies. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Hey @ScottforFlorida - we fixed it for you. #SelfServingScott," the Florida Democratic Party tweeted. "X marks the spot at every HCA location where I probably defrauded taxpayers," the edited image says. Florida Democrats told us the eight X marks weren’t intended to refer to specific cases at hospitals. "Probably" is barely squeezed in, roughly half the size of the rest of the words. Democratic Party spokeswoman Caroline Rowland said that should indicate the tweet was a joke. But is it true? Scott certainly hasn't been immune from claims surrounding his time as CEO of Columbia/HCA. In 2014, Florida Democrats claimed Scott "oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history," which PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. We wanted to see how this new claim stacked up. X marks the spot? Scott started Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he added hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia chain purchased Tennessee-based HCA and its 100 hospitals and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents seized records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanded their investigation across the country. They focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, almost four months after the inquiry became public. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. We’ve covered specific charges against the company in several fact-checks since Scott’s first race, such as the company billing Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians; attaching false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; and illegally claiming non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education. We don’t know a lot about the exact hospitals where fraud was found. But the scope of the settlement suggests the Democrats’ map of eight spots isn’t that much of a stretch. By the time Scott resigned, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott's campaign said in 2010. That includes HCA networks in Houston, Miami, Oklahoma City, Wichita, Kansas City, Utah (either Payson or Salt Lake), Nashville and Falls Church, Va. In each of those cities, there is at least one hospital in the HCA network. The 2000 release does mention a few different places where subsidiary of HCA entered in to a plea agreement for fraudulent activities: the Southern District of Florida (Miami); the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta); the Middle district of Florida (Tampa); the Western District of Texas (El Paso); and a Tennessee facility. Columbia Homecare Group and Columbia Management Companies Inc. entered into a criminal plea agreement and plead guilty to several charges involving "a wide range of criminal conduct which occurred at HCA's hospitals nationwide." In Miami, Columbia Homecare Group Inc., a subsidiary, plead guilty to violating the anti-kickback statute. We could not find any other direct evidence that shows tax payers were specifically defrauded in all eight of the cities pointed out by the Florida Democratic Party, but the release indicates that the fraud was a national issue. Then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in the 2000 release that the investigation was the "the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the U.S." "Health care fraud impacts every American citizen. When a company defrauds our nation's health care programs, it takes money out of the pockets of the American taxpayers," Reno said in 2000. "It is wrong." The DOJ also noted in the release that prosecutors from more than 25 states across the country assisted in the case. Adam Levine, an adjunct professor at Stetson University College of Law, said it’s "mostly correct" to assume that there was fraud in areas where HCA is located given the amount of money involved. "We don’t know where the offenders were and which were worse than others," he said. "So all are equally culpable." One final point: Scott was in charge, so he bears some responsibility and has said so. But it's worth pointing out that we don't know how much he knew, and when he knew it. "While I would agree that a CEO or corporate officer cannot know everything, the depth and breadth of the fraud indicates systemic, company-wide policies and procedures that had to be flawed," Levine said. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party distributed a cheeky map of the country and Scott, saying "X marks the spot at every HCA location where I probably defrauded taxpayers." The post involves the health care fraud settlement against Scott, who used to be CEO of Columbia/HCA. We don’t know if fraud occured at those eight exact places on their map, but experts said the scope of the settlement with Columbia/HCA suggests the Democrats' claim isn’t too much of a stretch. The Department of Justice and the attorney general said the case affected facilities nationwide and taxpayers across the country. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-11470	Florida’s school marshal program passed by the Florida House is the "first-of-its kind."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/mar/06/richard-corcoran/floridas-plan-arm-teachers-first-its-kind/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O' Lakes, is following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that would arm teachers in the classroom. On The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, Corcoran said that Florida’s proposal to arm teachers, known as a marshal program, is unlike anything else in the country. The voluntary program would train teachers under the direction of local law enforcement. "One of the things that we are doing in Florida is we have instituted, as President Trump has suggested, the most robust first-of-its-kind marshal program," Corcoran said Feb. 27 on Fox News. Corcoran may have spoken too soon, however. The Senate amended the House proposal on March 5 and removed the ability for schools to arm teachers. Instead, school official such as custodians, principals, librarians and counselors would be eligible for training to carry guns. The bill is now moving back to the House. Still, at the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate were considering plans that would include teachers. So, we wondered whether Florida’s proposal was really a "first of its kind" like Corcoran said. Breaking down Florida’s marshal program At the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate proposed school safety packages that established a "marshal program," which would provide training to teachers so they can be armed on school campuses. The program would be optional, and school districts and law enforcement would have to agree to adopt the program. A school employee, who voluntarily enters the program, must get a mental health screening and receive 132 hours of training for firearms safety, firearm precision and discretionary shooting. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said the one-of-a-kind aspect is the comprehensive nature of the program. "I think the key word he used is ‘robust,’ " Piccolo said. "At 132 hours of required tactical training we have been unable to find a more rigorous system in the country." Texas passed similar law in 2013 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least five states — Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas — passed legislation allowing school employees to carry firearms at K-12 schools in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. Of those states, the closest plan to Florida’s proposal is in Texas, which has had its own marshal program since 2013. Out of the other four states, Texas requires the most training. South Dakota also has a similar program, just with a different name. In Texas, districts that choose to enter the program select a volunteer — a teacher, a coach, an administrator with the right to carry guns on school campuses. There aren’t solid numbers on the size of the program, since the identities of marshals are anonymous, but Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack. The Dallas Morning News reported that there has not been any reports of incidents involving marshals at schools. We sent the two pieces of legislation to researchers at the National Conference of State Legislatures to see if there were any major differences between the two programs. "In my assessment, the programs are not all that different," said Jennifer Palmer, a research analyst, National Conference of State Legislatures. "Both programs are designed to provide additional training for school employees for emergencies including active shooter situations." That said, there some minor differences that Palmer pointed out, including the amount of training each program requires and where the firearm must be kept. Storage of weapon: Florida marshals can carry firearms concealed in holsters approved by the sheriff. If a marshal in Texas is in "regular, direct contact" with students, their firearm must be stored and locked. Training: Texas marshals are required to undergo 80 hours of training, whereas the Florida program would require 132 hours of training. Number of marshals allowed: In Texas, each school can appoint one marshal per 400 students, whereas Florida’s House bill would allow school districts to recommend "school faculty and staff members" with no maximum listed. Authority to act: Texas marshals are authorized to make arrests, however only "as necessary to prevent or abate the commission of an offense that threatens serious bodily injury or death." Florida marshals are only able to exercise authority with the "limited purpose of responding to an active assailant incident." Other similar legislation? Another similar proposal to Florida’s marshal program is in South Dakota where schools have the option to allow individuals to carry guns in school under the sentinel programs that was established in 2013. State law requires that sentinels be trained for at least 80 hours. The Florida marshal program closely resembles a sheriff-initiated program in Polk County, Fla. According to the Lakeland Ledger, Southeastern University, a private school in Florida, implemented a sentinel program that allows teachers to serve as trained special deputies authorized to carry weapons. Our ruling Corcoran said the marshal program to arm teachers is the "first of its kind." Texas established a very similar program in 2013. South Dakota also has a similar program, just under a different name. Both Texas’ law and Florida’s house proposal have the same goal, which is to provide training to teachers and school employees to carry guns on school campuses. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14067	Says a WHO proposal "portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2016/may/20/us-dairy-export-council/dairy-exporters-say-who-casts-milk-obstacle-toddle/	The milk industry is upset with the World Health Organization, claiming the international group is pushing a set of marketing guidelines that put their products in a bad light. In a letter to President Barack Obama on May 9, 2016, the U.S. Dairy Export Council wrote that a WHO proposal "portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life." Does WHO think that milk and dairy products don’t do a baby’s body good? Proposed marketing guidelines At issue are proposed guidelines from the World Health Organization due for a vote at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, at the end of May. The document has been in the works for years and its stated purpose is to end "the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children, with the aim to promote, protect and support breastfeeding, prevent obesity," and generally promote a healthy diet. Dairy exporters are not against breastfeeding, said Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy for the U.S. Dairy Export Council. The problem, Morris said, is that the WHO proposal covers toddlers up to 3 years old. "If we have images of a 1- or 2-year-old drinking milk, is that prohibited?" Morris said. "It seems to us that it would be." Morris highlighted several troublesome clauses in the WHO document, including this one (emphasis ours): "Products that function as breast-milk substitutes should not be promoted. A breast-milk substitute should be understood to include any milks (or products that could be used to replace milk, such as fortified soy milk), in either liquid or powdered form, that are specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years (including follow-up formula and growing-up milks). As the trade groups see it, the proposal would go further. Yogurt, milk and cheese would fall under this definition, they say, when guidelines from the medical community say that most young children do just fine with these foods. Charles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University’s School of Business, told us that the dairy industry has a point. He calls the document "draconian." "At best, the WHO guidelines are a one-sided argument in favor of their strongly held position that breastfeeding is healthier for children without giving the whole position," Taylor said. " At worst, they can be viewed as providing consumers with incomplete information on milk." How WHO responds Make no mistake, WHO doesn’t want to see breast-milk substitutes promoted. WHO contends, however, that the dairy industry is reading too much into the proposed marketing rules. The proposal says you can identify what products would be affected by how they’re pitched to the public. If they are "specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years," then they are a breast-milk substitute. WHO officials says that excludes milk products such as yogurt, milk and cheese. WHO spokeswoman Olivia Lawe-Davies said that "in no way does the guidance discourage the consumption of milk. In fact, WHO recommends milk consumption for older infants and young children who are not being breastfed." That jibes with current WHO guidelines for non-breastfed children age 2 and under. The guidelines state, "Milk products are rich sources of calcium and several other nutrients. Diets that do not contain animal source foods (meat, poultry, fish or eggs, plus milk products) cannot meet all nutrient needs at this age." Davies said the new proposal simply adds marketing restrictions for products known as "follow-up formula" and "growing-up milks." Both are similar to infant formula, but the first one is aimed at infants from 6 months to 1 year, and the second is for toddlers up to 3 years. "Milks marketed for infants and young children are breast-milk substitutes because they de facto displace the intake of breast milk," Davies said. "Milk that is marketed as a general family food is not covered by this recommendation since it is not marketed specifically for feeding of infants and young children." Reading between the lines Experts who have studied the language and are aware of both arguments say both the dairy industry and the World Health Organization have a point. Allyn Taylor has a special expertise in the legal ins and outs of these global health codes. Taylor, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law, was a senior legal adviser when the WHO crafted its rules on tobacco control. She has had no involvement with the latest guidelines. Taylor criticizes the current text as ambiguous, "poorly written" and subject to interpretation. Taylor told us she hopes the wording will be debated at the upcoming World Health Assembly in Geneva. (Perhaps in a way to settle this dispute.) But even with that, she said to assert that the proposal casts milk as an obstacle goes too far. "That is quite a pejorative claim," Taylor said. "You will not find any words in this document to that effect." Another law professor, Emily Parento at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, Calif., agreed. The text of the proposal could be more tightly written, she said. But she didn’t see how that flaw gets you to the industry line that WHO is against milk products for toddlers. "I can’t see the WHO not wanting little kids eating string cheese or having a cup of plain milk," Parento said. "That’s just not there." A key industry trend The world of powdered milk mixes has changed a lot since the current breast-milk formula marketing guidelines passed in 1981. Formula makers began targeting older infants and toddlers. A report from a New Zealand business group said the expansion produced a $55 billion a year market. In a nod to the impact of the 1981 WHO marketing guidelines, the report noted "Infant formula is typically defined as "birth to six months"; the product is then renamed for a range of reasons (primarily to avoid regulation and restrictions on advertising)." Our ruling The U.S. Dairy Export Council said a WHO proposal "wrongly portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life." The proposal clearly is targeting some dairy products, specifically powdered formulations, as ones that work against the benefits that come from maintaining breastfeeding through a child’s early years. But the dairy industry is making a much broader claim, saying the proposal targets milk and dairy products generally. That’s at best unclear. It’s likely unfounded, experts told us. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-08215	"Eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/18/richard-lugar/richard-lugar-says-ending-earmarks-wont-save-money/	One of the congressional Republicans' first actions after the 2010 election was to take a stand on curbing earmarks -- the targeted congressional spending provisions that have been criticized by politicians ranging from President Barack Obama to most members of the tea party movement. An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good. On Nov. 16, 2010, after pressure from newly elected, tea party-backed Republican candidates as well as incumbents on the right flank of the GOP, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blessed an earmark moratorium, even though McConnell had been an active earmarker for much of his congressional career. "Make no mistake, I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state," McConnell said. "I don't apologize for them. But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight. And unless people like me show the American people that we're willing to follow through on small or even symbolic things, we risk losing them on our broader efforts to cut spending and rein in government." Two days after McConnell's announcement, the new House Republican majority voted to enact a ban on earmarks in the 112th Congress as well. Yet as popular as banning earmarks appears to be, a few lawmakers have urged caution. Some have argued that giving up Congress' right to direct where money goes effectively cedes those powers to the executive branch, centralizing more power than ever in the presidential administration. Some have argued that, in the context of the entire federal budget, the dollar amounts are trivial -- roughly $15 billion out of a $1.4 trillion deficit in 2009. Critics say that focusing on earmarks is a symbolic action that obscures the harder choices that will be needed to reduce the federal deficit and cut into the national debt. One lawmaker, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., made a stark point: Cutting earmarks won't actually save money. "I oppose the Senate Republican Conference voluntary moratorium on so-called 'earmarks,' " Lugar said in a prepared statement. "At a moment in which over-spending by the federal government perpetuates annual deficits of over $1 trillion a year, the Congress is being asked to debate a congressional earmark spending resolution which will save no money, even while giving the impression that the Congress is attempting to meet the public demand to reduce spending. Instead of surrendering constitutional authority to Washington bureaucrats and the Obama Administration, Congress should focus on reducing spending on both entitlement and discretionary spending programs. Providing the Obama Administration with greater authority to direct spending does not accomplish this goal, and eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending." It's the last part -- the notion that "eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending" -- that caught our eye. We wondered whether it's accurate. Since earmarks are simply provisions of larger spending bills that direct where lawmakers want the money to go, earmarks, strictly speaking, do not increase the cost of a spending bill -- they only tell where portions of that spending should go. If Congress doesn't specify where the money should be spent, it would be up to executive branch officials to make the decision instead. Joshua Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that favors balanced budgets and reducing the national debt, calls Lugar's statement "accurate." "The moratoriums would not save any money," Gordon said. "They just change who is allowed to direct where money is spent." Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, agrees that Lugar is right, though he adds that the existence of earmarks increases the upward pressure on federal spending indirectly, since lawmakers "know they need to support the relevant powers on the spending committees in order to have their earmarks approved." Mitchell calls earmarks a "gateway drug" that "seduces members into treating the federal budget as a good thing that can be milked for home-state/district projects." Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group critical of earmarks, said Lugar is correct that, under the current budgeting process, eliminating earmarks won't save money. That's because when earmarks are stricken by congressional vote, the money is typically reallocated to other spending, rather than saved outright. But he added that it would be possible to devise a budgeting process in which spending goes down if an earmark is eliminated. A Lugar spokesman, Mark Helmke, said that as long as the administration does not use money dedicated to earmarks for debt reduction, the moratorium would not reduce spending. "The only way that spending is reduced is to cut program spending, and Sen. Lugar is prepared to do that," Helmke said. Indirectly, earmarks may have an I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine effect that pushes spending upward. Under the status quo, however, our experts agreed that Lugar is largely correct -- ending earmarks won't directly reduce spending, only re-direct it. There are other plausible reasons to advocate for an earmark ban, such as ending unseemly horse-trading with taxpayer dollars. But without a thorough overhaul of the budgeting process, saving money directly isn't one of them. We rate Lugar's statement Mostly True.

pomt-01385	"As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000" in a "shady" land deal "from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/15/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-says-susan-happ-took-180000-defendan/	Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for attorney general, has criticized rival Susan Happ for not turning to a special prosecutor to handle a case involving a man with whom she had a financial relationship. The Republican Party of Wisconsin has offered much tougher criticism of Happ, the Jefferson County district attorney and Democratic nominee for attorney general. The party blasted Happ in two radio ads, which make a lot of charges in quick fashion, making them hard to fully absorb. But the GOP summarized it this way in a news release tied to the second ad: "As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000 from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution." Is the claim accurate? Background on the case The news release refers to the prosecution of Daniel J. Reynolds, who initially faced felony charges filed by Happ’s office alleging first-degree and second-degree sexual assaults of a child. Ultimately, her office signed off on a plea bargain, approved in March 2014 by a judge, that included a deferred prosecution agreement. If Reynolds stays out of trouble and gets the recommended treatment, the charges will be reduced to disorderly conduct. Real estate records show Happ and her husband had signed a land contract with Reynolds to sell a piece of property to him for a total of $180,000 over three years. Nobody disputes those events, which form the basis for portions of the GOP claim. Happ says she recognized the conflict of interest and took steps in her office to handle it. When asked for backup, the GOP pointed to the timeline of events as evidence of a "quid pro quo" -- something that is given or taken in return for something else, our dictionary says. But there are big problems with the way the party describes the sequence of events and Happ’s knowledge and actions. Indeed, the claim makes it sound like Happ "took" $180,000 from a defendant after he was charged, then recommended light punishment for him. Here is a closer look at the sequence: Records show the monthly payments under the land deal were two months from completion when the Jefferson Police Department asked Happ’s office in March 2012 to review its request for charges against Reynolds. So there was an ongoing financial relationship at that time. But the land deal was signed more than three years before Reynolds was charged on May 21, 2013, and it ended in May 2012 -- before he was charged, but while the case was being reviewed. The GOP portrays the sale as a "shady" deal with a child predator. According to the criminal complaint that was eventually filed, the assaults occurred between 2001 and 2005. So if the complaint is right, the defendant was a child predator before the land deal in 2009. But records indicate the police investigation began in October 2011. So, Reynolds was not yet charged or under investigation at the time the land deal was initiated. And no one has presented evidence that Happ, elected district attorney in 2008, knew that Reynolds was allegedly involved in assaults until the matter came to her office in 2012. There are other issues. The $180,000 figure cited by the GOP was owed to both Happ and her husband, according to the contract. But the property in question was owned by Happ’s husband before the two were married in March 2009. Reynolds was a tenant in the building at some point. Happ told us she signed the land contract because it’s marital property, but that as a practical matter, she and her husband keep their assets separate and that payments from Reynolds went to her husband. Still, she said, "marital property is marital property," and she understands the conflict of interest was still there. The GOP also says Happ offered Reynolds a deferred prosecution deal. The deal was made by her office, but court records show that the case was assigned to and handled by one of her assistant DAs, Monica Hall. Happ says that, following Supreme Court ethics procedures, she screened herself off from decisions or any involvement in the case when she recognized Reynolds’ name on the referral from the police department. An official at the state Office of Lawyer Regulation, citing that screening procedure, said on Oct. 13, 2014 there was no indication of an ethics breach by Happ. The agency received a complaint in September 2014 about Happ’s handling of the case from the victim of the assaults. A final note. The GOP claim suggests Reynolds got off too easy -- a feeling the victim shares, based on her complaint to the Office of Lawyer Regulation. Happ said on a radio show that she believes from the general details she knows that the case was handled properly by the assistant DA, whom she described as "tenacious and well qualified." Our rating The Republican Party said, "As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000" in a "shady" land deal "from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution." The adequacy of Happ’s response to a conflict of interest is up for debate, but the GOP stretches and distorts the timeline of events to create a highly misleading attack without evidence to back up the idea that Reynolds got a sweetheart deal by paying $180,000.

pomt-09017	On tax breaks for businesses	half flip	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/09/roy-barnes/barnes-now-opposes-some-business-tax-breaks-he-onc/	Former Gov. Roy Barnes has offered a few mea culpas this year as he tries to get his old job back. One key area in which Barnes has changed course is special-interest tax breaks for various businesses. As a member of the Georgia Legislature and later as governor, Barnes supported more than two dozen exemptions, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story by staff writer James Salzer that ran in Sunday's newspaper. Now, Barnes has said in recent campaign speeches that many of these exemptions should be scrapped. "When I was in the Legislature, I voted for all of them. When I was governor, I signed them," said Barnes, who was governor from 1999 to 2003. "We all have sinned and fallen short of the Lord. But when you tell everybody the choices are between all of these exemptions and keeping teachers in the classroom, I believe the teachers win, the children win." Has the former governor flip-flopped on this issue? We wanted to take a closer look. A little state political history here. Barnes did two stints in the state Legislature, from 1974 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1998. In 1998, he was elected the state's 80th governor. But despite vastly superior funding Barnes lost a re-election bid in 2002 to an underdog, a former state senator named Sonny Perdue. Barnes had angered supporters of the old Georgia state flag, which he changed to minimize its Confederate emblem. And then he ran afoul of some state residents because of what they perceived as heavy-handed tactics when new political boundaries were drawn during redistricting. Some political observers, however, believe Barnes' real roadblock in the 2002 defeat was the state's 125,000 public school teachers. As governor, Barnes angered many of those educators with his ambitous school reforms. Many educators felt Barnes blamed them for low test scores, poor graduation rates and other failings. The former governor is now heading into the July 20 Democratic primary trying to win back those teacher votes. In June, Barnes took the extraordinary step of filming a 90-second video apologizing to Georgia's teachers for not listening enough to them when he attempted to implement some of his education reforms. Now, he is promising to remove some of the very same tax exemptions for business that he supported as a state lawmaker and governor to help teachers. As governor, Barnes approved tax exemptions on the sale of solar panels, a corporate tax credit for a Macon-based tobacco manufacturing plant and Girl Scout cookies. Jeffrey Humphreys, a prominent economist, said most states offer tax breaks and exemptions for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's done as a deliberate strategy to help some industries grow. Sometimes it's done to lower the consumer costs on some items. Humphreys said it's often done to be competitive with other states. "They don't want to be out of step with other states competing for jobs," said Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth. Humphreys believes revenue collections are more stable with fewer exemptions. Sarah Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said some exemptions are worthwhile, but others are "purely political giveaways." She agrees many of them should be re-examined. Barnes explained that some of the exemptions have hurt funding for education. The exemptions Barnes voted for and signed as governor cost Georgia, and saved the recipients, at least $1.2 billion a year, state fiscal notes show. School boards across Georgia have slashed their budgets -- and jobs, in some cases -- in recent months to balance their financial books. One problem many of them have cited is receiving less money from the state. Barnes has said he wouldn't touch some of the larger breaks, such as the tax exemptions on the sale of many groceries and prescription drugs. As governor he'd like the authority to suspend or eliminate others, until there is more funding for education. A new commission was recently created that could make changes to some of these tax breaks and exemptions. Humphreys is on the commission. We asked the Barnes camp which exemptions it would cut. It didn't offer specifics, focusing on exemptions approved under the Perdue administration. "All the special interest income and sales tax exemptions passed over the past several years need to be put on the table for temporary suspension," Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter said in an e-mail. Carpenter argued this is not a political flip-flop. Carpenter said state government is currently in a tougher financial pinch than when Barnes was governor. The exemptions approved under the Barnes administration never resulted in drastic actions, such as teacher furloughs, Carpenter said. Perdue, however, found the state's finances were in worse shape than previously thought when he succeeded Barnes in 2003. Yes, Barnes has changed his position on some exemptions. But Barnes still believes some of the breaks -- and some very large ones -- should stay in place. Because of that, Barnes sidestepped a full Flip Flop on the Truth-o-Meter. He gets a Half-Flip.

pomt-01588	"Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/07/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/scott-walker-cut-school-funding-more-any-governor-/	A TV ad released Aug. 28, 2014 by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, starts with three children looking into the camera and each asking: "Why?" Then an adult narrator says: "Why did Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America? Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways." We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his "cronies" or "corporate friends." Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor? What we know There's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding. In fact, in February 2012 we rated True a broader claim -- that Walker had enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state's history." The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad. But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools. The committee’s evidence Before we dig in, a few words about wording. The Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as we’ll see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money. So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, we’ll examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state. What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing. Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-’12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walker’s term in office. (The state’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.) On a percentage basis, Wisconsin’s reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five: State/District Per-pupil SPENDING in 2011-’12 from ALL sources Change from 2010-’11 Wisconsin $11,042 -6.2 percent Florida $8,372 -5.8 percent District of Columbia $17,468 -5.4 percent Texas $8,261 -4.7 percent South Dakota $8,446 -4.1 percent In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsin’s per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-’11, 2.6 percent in 2009-’10, 3.7 percent in 2008-’09 and 4 percent in 2007-’08. In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-’12. Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools’ spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise. Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools. Other measures Now, using the same census report, let’s look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts. State Per-pupil REVENUE in 2011-’12 from STATE GOVERNMENT Change from 2010-’11 Wisconsin $5,544 -8.33 percent Idaho $4,630 -6.79 percent Arizona $3,018 -6.46 percent Wyoming $9,466 -5.05 percent Florida $3,273 -4.84 percent So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim. But there some newer figures available. A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-’14. Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasn’t the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaska’s 3.2 percent cut was the largest.) Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-’14, versus $5,783 the previous year. As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walker’s term, those figures simply aren’t available yet. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said: "Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America." Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-’12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money. But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsin’s school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Greater Wisconsin Committee	None	None	None	2014-09-07T06:00:00	2014-08-28	['United_States']

When he was asked this Sunday how he’d respond to those who think cuts in taxes and regulations will unleash productivity, Gates criticized the notion. "The highest economic growth decade was the 1960s. Income tax rates were 90 percent," he said on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS May 17, 2015. "I mean, the idea that there's some direct connection that all these innovators are on strike because tax rates are at 35 percent on corporations, that's just such nonsense." Gates was making the point that low tax rates do not necessarily lead to economic prosperity. To do so, he mentioned a time when high growth and high marginal tax rates co-existed. Marginal tax rates are tax rates applied to each bracket of income. The more money people make, the higher their marginal tax rates, and the people with the highest income pay the top rate. We decided to check Gate’s statement about growth and personal income taxes in the 1960s. The man who helped revolutionized personal computing is for the most part correct. Using inflation-corrected rates of growth in Gross Domestic Product from the government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 1960s tops the decades of the post-World War II era. We lined those up with the highest marginal tax rates on the IRS website. Here’s what we found: Decade Average GDP growth % Highest marginal tax rate % 1950s 3.09 90+ 1960s 4.36 90+ then 70-77 1970s 3.13 70+ 1980s 3.09 50 then 38.5 then 28 1990s 3.56 31 then 39.6 2000s 1.72 38.6 then 35 (Note: In some cases, the highest marginal tax rate changed during the decade.) While GDP growth varied year-to-year, the 1960s saw the greatest average growth by decade. But that growth didn’t line up with a top tax rate of 90 percent in every year. For the first four years of the 1960s, individuals faced a top tax rate of 91 percent on each dollar over the $400,000 mark. In 1964, the top rate dropped to 77 percent, followed by another decline to 70 percent (this time on every dollar over $200,000.) By the end of the decade, it inched back up to 77 percent. So the top tax rate wasn’t always 90 percent throughout the 1960s, as one hearing Gates’ claim might think. And like today, there were tax breaks and deductions that would lower someone's effective tax rate -- or what they actually pay. No end to this debate Gates’ point was that lowering tax rates does not, by itself, create a more prosperous economy. But the reverse also must be said: Higher tax rates don’t mean a booming economy. In fact, many factors drive the economy, from energy prices and global competition, to interest rates and government spending. A more sober analysis comes from William Gale at the Brookings Institution and Andrew Samwick at Dartmouth College and the National Bureau of Economic Analysis. In a 2014 article, the two economists found that "U.S. historical data show huge shifts in taxes with virtually no observable shift in growth rates." One of the complicating factors in drawing firm conclusions is that tax cuts often come as part of a larger package of changes which makes it tougher to tease out the impact of each policy shift. To further muddy the waters, the rest of the world doesn’t conveniently stand still to let America’s fiscal policy experiments play out in peace and quiet. If China tweaks the value of its currency, or South America has a banking crisis, that affects international capital markets, American trade and thus American growth. Another problem is the timing of spending cuts to offset tax cuts. Gale and Samwick concluded that the failure to cut "unproductive" spending at the same time that tax rates are reduced undermines any positive effect of the tax cuts. But there are studies that reach other conclusions. Two economists at the University of California-Berkeley, Christina Romer and Dave Romer, broke down tax changes based on the driving purpose behind them. For example, it is very different if taxes were cut because the economy hit the skids, rather than wanting to shrink the size of government by curtailing revenues. Romer and Romer -- they’re married -- figured that separating the reasons for tax changes allowed them to factor in a number of outside conditions that determined the impact of the policy shifts. Their key finding? "Our estimates suggest that a tax increase of 1 percent of GDP reduces output over the next three years by nearly three percent," they wrote. (Christina Romer is former chair of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.) So there you have it. Some economists find no real link between tax shifts and economic activity. Some find a direct link. Add to this the debate over different kinds of taxes, such as capital gains and corporate tax rates, and it’s clear why there are so many differing perspectives. For the record, Gates himself favors a shift to taxing consumption rather than labor and income. We reached out to Gates through his foundation but did not immediately hear back. Our ruling Gates said that in the 1960s, high taxes, 90 percent, and high economic growth came at the same time. The underlying reasons are complicated, but the numbers largely bear out. On average, annual growth was about 4.3 percent for the decade, higher than any other post-World War II period. Gates was a bit off in talking about a 90 percent tax rate. During the 1960s, the marginal rate fell for a time to 70 percent. Gates did not go so far as to say that higher taxes bring higher growth. And for good reason. The connection between taxes and growth is quite tricky. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Gates	None	None	None	2015-05-17T17:58:16	2015-05-17	['None']

pomt-01230	Says he has "never received any contributions from the Koch brothers."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/nov/19/john-thrasher/thrasher-says-he-has-never-received-any-contributi/	Long before John Thrasher became president of Florida State University on Nov. 10, students were expressing opposition to his appointment, many of them charging that Thrasher had ties to "special interests." As the Republican former state senator begins his presidency, we decided to look back at a comment Thrasher made during a forum with FSU students and faculty on Sept. 15. Thrasher became defensive when questioned about his ties to Charles and David Koch, the billionaire libertarian brothers who have spent freely on anti-regulation causes. At one point, a graduate student asked Thrasher about campaign contributions he had received from the brothers. The former lawmaker from St. Augustine denied receiving any. "I don't have a relationship with the Koch brothers," Thrasher said. "You say I've got contributions from them? You go look at my contributions, I've never received any contributions from the Koch brothers." Did Thrasher get any campaign contributions from the Koch brothers? Here’s the full story. The money trail Thrasher was approved as president by the FSU Board of Trustees by an 11-2 vote on Sept. 23. On Election Day, he was re-elected to his Senate seat. Two days later, he was confirmed for the presidency by the state Board of Governors and then resigned his Senate seat. (A special election is scheduled for Jan. 27, 2015, which could cost taxpayers as much as $1 million.) On Nov. 10, Thrasher was formally installed as the 15th president of FSU. But the possibility that he could become FSU’s president was controversial almost from the very beginning, with students and teachers decrying his lack of academic credentials. The controversy is colored by past concerns about the Koch brothers’ attempts to influence FSU. In 2008, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation pledged $1.5 million for economics professors if the organization was granted a say in the screening process -- a power that critics said ran contrary to academic freedom. The university accepted the deal. Thrasher, 70, has a business degree and law degree from FSU and served several terms in the Florida House starting in 1992, eventually becoming speaker of the House in 1999 and 2000. In 2009, Thrasher won a special election for a state Senate seat in northeast Florida, then won re-election the following year and served as chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. Commentators cited his political connections and fundraising savvy as the reasons he became the frontrunner for FSU’s presidency after applying in May 2014. (Outgoing FSU president Eric Barron was named president of Penn State University.) Some at Florida State preferred any of the other three candidates -- all administrators at other universities -- over Thrasher. The FSU Progress Coalition, a group of student leaders and faculty openly opposed to conservatives in the Florida Legislature, peppered Thrasher with questions at the Sept. 15 forum, eventually posting audio of the comment about the Koch brothers online (hear it at about the 2:30 mark). Because the recording is audio-only, PolitiFact Florida first set out to verify that the recording was actually Thrasher. The office of the president didn’t respond to our requests, but we found a variety of student, faculty and media sources that confirmed it. But is the statement accurate? A trip to the Florida Division of Elections website showed that Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan., has made four contributions to Thrasher’s re-election campaign since 2012. The multinational group owns interests in manufacturing, energy, textiles, chemicals, paper, ranching, finance and investing, among other things. Current Florida campaign finance laws allow corporations to donate up to $1,000 per election to a legislative candidate. Koch Industries has given Thrasher $3,000 over the past three years. Two donations on Jan. 9, 2012, and Oct. 11, 2012, were $500 apiece. Two were $1,000 each, on Feb. 8, 2014, and Oct. 21, 2014. This final donation came after the forum in question, and after the Board of Trustees had voted for Thrasher. Thrasher campaign spokesperson Sarah Bascom said those contributions came from Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific, a pulp and paper subsidiary of Koch Industries that is the largest private employer in Putnam County, part of Thrasher’s old district. Thrasher has received campaign cash from Georgia-Pacific dating back to 1995; Koch Industries acquired the company in 2005. The four donations cited above were officially made in the name of Koch Industries. Integrity Florida, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign-finance issues, told us it was up to the campaign to list where the money came from. The contribution may have come from Georgia-Pacific, but we’ll go by the fact the donation was credited to the parent corporation, not the subsidiary. But Thrasher’s camp cautioned against jumping to conclusions about what he meant. He "was referring to contributions from them (the Koch brothers) personally," Bascom said. "His comments were not referring to all of the companies that they may have a business interest in." (Thrasher told the Tampa Bay Times on Sept. 18 that he didn’t know the Kochs. "I have been saying I've never met them, I've never talked to them and I wouldn't recognize them if they walked into the room," he said.) The distinction between receiving corporate money from a Koch-owned company and money from the Koch Brothers personally adds some complexity to this question. University of Florida professor Dan Smith said it’s appropriate to declare the money came from the powerful siblings. To a reasonable person, crediting the donations to Koch Industries looks like the money comes from the company’s owners. "It’s quite clear that Sen. Thrasher has received contributions from the Koch brothers over the years," Smith said. "Whether or not they come directly from the Koch brothers or the corporations that they control, that is Koch dollars." But T. Wayne Bailey, a political science professor at Stetson University’s DeLand campus, gave a more nuanced answer. Given Thrasher’s influence over the years, Bailey said, it’s probable special interests like the Koch brothers no doubt have taken great interest in "cultivating" him. Being chairman of Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign would likely have been a factor as well, Bailey said. But whether those donations count as coming directly from the Koch brothers is a question of point of view, he said. If anything, it points out just how much of American industry the Kochs own, and the influence they wield as a result. The circumstances demand that Thrasher "be open and transparent" going forward as FSU president, Bailey said. There are a few other bits of context worth mentioning. First, while Koch Industries’ donations have totaled $3,000, that’s a small fraction of the almost $882,000 Thrasher’s raised since 2011. Second, one of the most important Koch Brothers-linked organizations, Americans for Prosperity, has run hot and cold on Thrasher and his agenda in recent years. The group’s Florida affiliate gave him a grade of D in 2014 after having earned an A+ before. Those grades were based on whether Thrasher voted in favor of policy decisions AFP endorsed. Democrats almost universally receive F grades. Our ruling Thrasher said he has "never received any contributions from the Koch brothers." Thrasher says he has never received money personally from the Koch Brothers, and as far as we can tell, that’s correct. However, he did receive four donations totaling $3,000 from Koch Industries, a company they own. That's what we're checking, not whether he knows Charles and David Koch. His campaign said those donations specifically came from the subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a major employer in his district that had donated to Thrasher years before being owned by the Kochs, but the contributions were officially categorized as coming from Koch Industries. Experts say it could be reasonable to equate those donations as coming from the company’s owners. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14958	Planned Parenthood is "nothing more than a referral service. … They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/oct/22/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-planned-parenthood-does-nothing-p/	Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a nationally broadcast interview that Planned Parenthood does little more than profit from killing babies. Patrick, a Republican, appeared Oct. 19, 2015, on "Your World with Neil Cavuto," a Fox News program. That was the day a Texas state official moved to cut off $3.1 million in annual Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of it federal aid, for contraception and health services. That came as a result, the official said, of videos showing doctors for the group altered abortion procedures to procure intact fetal tissue for researchers in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood, denying misconduct, commented that it was considering its options, including a lawsuit. Patrick, talking to Cavuto, said: "We’re not going to tolerate Planned Parenthood pretending, Neil, to be something they’re not..." Cavuto: "Do you think that Planned Parenthood does anything good?" Patrick: "No. I don’t think they do anything good. Look, they’re nothing more than a referral service. They pretend to care about women’s health. But they don’t have professionals even giving any information to women except referring them to another clinic. They don’t have equipment. They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies." Cavuto: "Well, I understand your passions, sir. But they do a little bit more than that." Patrick: "Very little." There’s been debate about what the videos taken with hidden cameras by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, show about sales of fetal tissue. But on Oct. 7, 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated False a claim that Planned Parenthood has "now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts." Federal law permits fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating such donations. We focused our sights on whether Patrick is right that Planned Parenthood solely provides abortions. To our request for backup information, Patrick’s spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by phone: "We don’t have anything further to add." Past fact checks In August 2015, PolitiFact rated Pants on Fire a claim by Jeb Bush that Planned Parenthood "is not actually doing women’s health issues." That story said Planned Parenthood "offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams," though not mammograms. In September 2012, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that Planned Parenthood "does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers." Earlier, in April 2011, PolitiFact rated False a claim that abortion services are "well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does." That story, citing a Planned Parenthood "fact sheet," concluded that abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, then the most recent year for which the group was reporting statistics. There is lately more up-to-date information. On Planned Parenthood’s website, we spotted a "By the Numbers" document last updated in July 2015 stating that 34 percent of its health services are contraceptive services and 3 percent are abortions. Another document, "Services," states that in 2013, Planned Parenthood provided more than 4.4 million services related to testing men and women for sexually transmitted infections or diseases; more than 3.5 million contraception services; more than 935,000 services related to cancer prevention and detection; some 1.1 million pregnancy and prenatal services; 327,653 abortions; and nearly 132,000 other services. The most prevalent listed contraception service was "reversible contraception" for women (2.1 million services). The most common cancer screening was "breast exams/breast care" (487,029 services). That story said that a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history; she said Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. According to the July 2015 list, Planned Parenthood’s most common pregnancy services in 2013 were pregnancy tests (1.1 million services). Other identified services include HIV tests (704,000 services); emergency contraception kits (1.4 million services) and Pap tests (378,692 services). A longer view: Nationally from 2006 through 2013, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009, according to an Oct. 1, 2015, PolitiFact article. That story presented a chart showing how the number of specific services provided by Planned Parenthood went up or down from 2006 to 2013, based on Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (though a report from 2008 didn’t turn up): Another chart, likewise drawing from the annual reports, showed counts for abortion and non-abortion services provided by the group: Caveats Per all these figures, it’s worth repeating caveats offered by PolitiFact in 2011: --First, many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of "services" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared with what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. --Second, Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, though the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. This basically means observers must accept their accuracy more or less on faith. Planned Parenthood In Texas To our inquiry about Patrick’s claim, Yvonne Gutierrez of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, which says it battles to protect women’s health care access, said the same range of services are offered in Texas by the group. Gutierrez emailed us an undated Planned Parenthood document indicating that in 2013, its Texas clinics had 150,710 patients including 108,533 contraception patients. The document showed state-by-state counts in those categories and for Pap tests plus tests for sexually transmitted infections, breast exams and sex education and outreach. Gutierrez also emailed us a chart, attributed to state agencies, distributed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The chart shows $3.1 billion in Medicaid spending on Planned Parenthood-provided services in the fiscal year through Aug. 31, 2015. That spending covered Medicaid reimbursements and payments through health plans for patients who went to Planned Parenthood clinics, Gutierrez said. We also asked Gutierrez about Planned Parenthood in Texas making fetal tissue available for research. "Planned Parenthood Greater Texas and Planned Parenthood South have never participated in fetal tissue research projects," she replied by email, "and have no plans to do so. While Planned Parenthood Center for Choice (in Houston) does not currently participate in a fetal tissue study, they have taken part in such worthy studies in the past, following all laws and the highest medical and ethical standards. These studies hold the potential to cure disease and save lives. They last partnered with UTMB," the University of Texas Medical Branch, "on a study to prevent miscarriage." Our ruling Patrick said Planned Parenthood is "nothing more than a referral service. … They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies." To the contrary, Planned Parenthood provides family planning and other women’s health services, including abortions and there’s been no confirmation it sells body parts.

pomt-13308	Says "11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land" in the United States "bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/07/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-wrong-lack-hurricanes-diminishes-cli/	As Hurricane Matthew threatened the east coast of Florida, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh cast a far-flung conspiracy about the deadly storm’s hype. Limbaugh, who lives in Palm Beach County, used his radio show to decry what he sees as the politicization of storms by the left to validate climate change. At the time, Hurricane Matthew was a Category 4 storm. Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of "playing games" with hurricane forecasting to push climate change. Hurricane forecasts come from the National Hurricane Center. The center is controlled by the National Weather Service, which falls under the administration’s Commerce Department. Limbaugh recalled how former Vice President Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth, said after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans that the world could expect more destructive hurricanes because of climate change. "And then what happened? We had 11 years of no hurricanes -- 11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States, which just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument," Limbaugh said on his radio show Oct. 5. "They want people to think this way: Hurricane reported. Must be climate change." Limbaugh has made similar and wrong arguments in the past, such as when he said the media made up polar vortexes to reinforce global warming. His latest theory about U.S. hurricane landfalls amounting to "a hole right through" the validity of climate change is also wrong. A history of hurricanes The last major hurricane to hit the United States was Wilma, which pummeled Florida’s west side as a Category 3 storm in 2005. Wilma was a Category 5 storm at its peak while at sea and the most intense hurricane reported anywhere until Hurricane Patricia hit Mexico in 2015. As Hurricane Matthew approached, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, tweeted Oct. 5 it has been 4,000 days since the last major hurricane hit the United States (or approximately 10.9 years). A "major" hurricane means the storm is a category 3, 4 or 5, said Dave Nolan, another professor of the Rosenstiel School. To be a Category 3 hurricane, winds at the surface must exceed about 115 mph (100 knots) somewhere in the storm. "Major" does not refer to size, damages or fatalities — it’s about intensity, as measured by maximum wind speed, Nolan added. Hugh Gladwin, an associate professor in the department of Global and Sociocultural Studies at Florida International University, said Limbaugh added that storm surge and amount of damage are also factors and some would argue more important than wind speed. If those factors are considered, it is possible that Hurricane Sandy, the destructive 2012 storm that disrupted the East Coast, could qualify as a major hurricane. Conflating weather with climate Limbaugh uses the stretch without hurricanes to make a case against climate change, but experts said that’s all wrong. "This has nothing at all to do with climate change," Nolan said. "Hurricanes are extreme events with a lot of variability from year to year, so they can't be used to indicate long term trends about climate." He also said Limbaugh’s U.S.-centric take on climate change ignores weather events from around the world. An example of these events include super typhoon Haiyan, which was the most intense typhoon to ever hit the Philippines, and Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest ever to hit Mexico. Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Institute, said the Atlantic only corresponds to about 13 percent of the global number of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), with about 30 percent of the tropical cyclones occurring in the western North Pacific (where they are called typhoons). Point being, the lack of hurricanes hitting the United States is a localized issue, and doesn’t speak about the global issue of climate change. "The relationship between climate change and major hurricanes is complicated and there is not much agreement on it among meteorologists," Gladwin said. Some researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, compiled research on global warming and hurricanes in 2015 and concluded that a warming climate, by heating the oceans, will make hurricanes more intense. But explicit connections have not been determined. "It is premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity," reads NOAA’s analysis. Nolan said that science has changed course in the last 10 years. Between 1990-2005 some papers suggested that global warming will lead to more and stronger hurricanes, and we can already see this effect over the last 40 years. Since then, academic consensus has emphasized global warming will probably make fewer hurricanes, but some of them will be stronger, and we can't see any trend at all in the historical record. Limbaugh mischaracterizes Gore as an example of a liberal who has associated more hurricanes with climate change. Gore points to research that oceans have gotten warmer and have led to more intense hurricanes, but both Nolan and Gladwin said Gore never said there would be more hurricanes. Either way, Limbaugh fails to make the case that the 11-year stretch without major hurricanes hitting the United States disproves climate change. "It's not valid to look at the number of landfalling major hurricanes in the United States to say anything about climate change, since random changes in atmospheric steering currents, unrelated to climate change, are partially responsible for the 11-year U.S. major hurricane drought’," said Jeff Masters, the director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Our ruling Limbaugh said the fact that the United States went 11 straight years without major hurricanes "just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument." It doesn’t. There are several major flaws in his line of reasoning. First, looking only at major hurricanes that hit the United States ignores storm activity around the world. Second, storm frequency does not strictly correlate with rising temperature. Third, many other data points prove that climate change is real. Limbaugh’s argument is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/827d3cf9-63b0-4f4c-8da5-4dbef2a5204f	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2016-10-07T15:44:58	2016-10-05	['United_States']
pomt-06465	"I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/illegal-immigrants-did-lawn-care-mitt-romney/	Mitt Romney’s hiring decisions in lawn care continue to dog him. The former Massachusetts governor, in an Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate, faced accusations from primary foe Rick Perry that he hired illegal immigrants to work at his home. The two had this tense exchange: Perry: "Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year. And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy." Moderator Anderson Cooper: "Gov. Romney?" Romney: "Rick, I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life. And so I'm afraid -- I'm looking forward to finding your facts on that, because that just doesn't --" Then they proceeded to talk over each other, but Romney's claim was virtually the same as one we've checked before. The first time Romney was running for president, in 2006, the Boston Globe broke a story about his hired help. The Globe said Romney, for an entire decade, used a landscaping company that relied on illegal Guatemalan immigrants. Employees at the company, Community Lawn Service with a Heart, said its owner hadn't asked them to provide documents showing their immigration status. The workers said they were paid $9 to $10 an hour, in cash, for working sometimes 11 hours a day. The newspaper sent a team of reporters to Guatemala after getting a tip that Romney had hired a landscaping company notorious for using illegal immigrants. They tracked down three former landscapers who claimed to have been in the United States illegally when they worked on Romney's lawn. One of them, Rene Alvarez Rosales, said he worked for Romney eight years landscaping his lawn, occasionally getting a "buenos dias" from Romney himself. Others told the Globe of casual encounters with Romney over the years, during which he had never inquired about their status. Romney’s first response to reporters’ questions about the matter: "Aw, geez." Later, his campaign issued a statement that the governor knew nothing about the immigration status of the landscaping workers, and that his dealings were with owner of the company, a legal immigrant from Colombia. The owner told the Globe that Romney never asked him about the status of the workers. When the Los Angeles Times followed up with another story, a Romney spokesman said, "Gov. Romney has no information or knowledge to corroborate the Globe's allegations. He hired a legitimate lawn service company and he knows the owner as a decent, hardworking person who is a legal resident." When Romney said he "did not" have illegal immigrants working for him, we rated his statement Mostly False, given the credible evidence that undocumented lawn care laborers from Guatemala worked at his home for years, and his careful statements about his knowledge of their status. In this case, his wording is slightly different, that he had not "ever hired an illegal in my life." It's clear from the Globe's reporting that he hired a landscaping company and that employed illegal immigrants. He has made the argument he hired the company, not the specific workers.

pomt-06476	Says Republicans want to cut education by 25 percent.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/17/david-axelrod/obama-adviser-axelrod-says-republican-want-deep-ed/	Speaking in New Hampshire last month, presidential adviser David Axelrod didn't focus his attacks on Mitt Romney or Rick Perry. Instead, he took aim at a man who's not in the presidential race: Rep.Paul Ryan. Axelrod, who is leading President Barack Obama's bid for re-election, had harsh words for Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, over the committee's controversial budget proposal, which Axelrod said threatened America's future with severe spending cuts. "If you cut education by 25 percent, which is what's been proposed on the other side, you're mortgaging our future," Axelrod told an audience during a September 27, 2011 speech at the Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. "Our students are sliding compared to other countries," Axelrod said, criticizing the Ryan plan’s proposed cuts. Ryan and House Republicans took a lot of pride in proposing billions of dollars in spending cuts in House Resolution 34, Ryan's budget blueprint. But, did they really propose cutting education funding by a quarter? PolitiFact is on the case. We started by approaching the Obama campaign, which pointed us to the Ryan budget plan, as well as other statements the president and other White House officials have issued about education cuts. As a resolution, the Ryan proposal doesn't provide specific breakdowns of its spending plans, but instead groups education funding with training, employment and social services in a category called Function 500. Ryan spokesman Gerrit Lansing said that looking at such a large category is no way to accurately judge specific spending measures, and he pointed out that the budget resolution does not set final spending levels, but instead provides a maximum amount that can be spent. Congressional committees would determine the final funding levels from there. "This is not an apples to apples comparison," Lansing wrote in an email. "Function 500 contains job training programs, student loans, the Smithsonian (Institution), billions in Social Services Block Grants, and more – none of which have much to do with K-12 programs that a reader assumes refers to ‘education spending.". But other budget analysts disagree. Education funding makes up the largest segment of Function 500, often encompassing 90 percent or more of the costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So, for this piece, we’ll continue to use it to set the basis for comparison. As proposed in April, Ryan's plan, which passed the House of Representatives but failed to pass the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, would have directed $77.2 billion during the current fiscal year to education and the other Function 500 categories. That number is down $15 billion, or 16.3 percent from last year's spending level, which has extended into the current fiscal year thanks to a continuing resolution from Congress. It is also $28 billion or 27 percent lower than the president's fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. Because they haven’t yet passed a budget for 2012, federal lawmakers are operating on a continuing resolution, which continues spending at last year’s levels. With the resolution set to expire November 18, however, members of the House Appropriations Committee have drafted a new spending plan that would leave education funding at $69 billion, 3 percent lower than the current level and 14 percent lower than the President’s budget request. This plan, worked out by an Appropriations subcommittee and introduced September 29, has not yet been taken up by the full committee or on the House floor. In Washington, budget managers and analysts don't typically consider the president's budget plan, or bills still pending in committee, when drawing spending comparisons. Instead, they look to the Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections, which estimate the cost of maintaining current services, factoring in inflation. The CBO projections, issued in March, call for $95 billion in the 2012 fiscal year to maintain current education and social services, according to agency reports. The $77.2 billion included in Ryan's budget proposal is 16.8 percent lower than the CBO figure. That number increases to 20.6 percent in 2013 and 22 percent in 2014, and it reaches the 25 percent mark in 2016 when the Ryan plan proposes $76.2 billion in Function 500 funding – $25.5 billion less than the CBO's baseline projection of what it would take to maintain services as they exist today in that year. The Ryan budget's proposed cuts remain above 25 percent each year between 2016 and 2021. In total, the plan proposes $782.7 billion in Function 500 spending between 2012 and 2021 – $250 billion, or 24.2 percent less than the $1 trillion required to maintain current services, according to the CBO baseline. "The Republican budget resolution further cuts education every year, quickly reaching annual cuts of more than 25 percent below current levels that will harm education for our children now and the quality of our future workforce, as well," Democratic members of the House Budget Committee wrote in opposition to the budget proposal after it was released in April. Our ruling: Because Budget Resolution 34 doesn't include detailed breakdowns of Function 500 spending reductions, it's impossible to determine exactly how much of the cuts are proposed to come out of the education budget. Further, the plan itself, in resolution form, does not dictate exact spending levels, but instead sets the maximum amount that can be spent. Congressional committees and floor votes determine the rest. Still, because education spending makes up such a large proportion of the total Function 500 costs – over 90 percent – it's safe to assume most of the cuts from this category would come from education. With that in mind, the percentages don't lie. The Ryan budget proposal included more than 25 percent funding cuts every year between 2016 and 2021, and it proposed a total 24 percent funding cut between 2012 and 2021, within range of Axelrod’s 25 percent figure. Axelrod's figures are correct if you include everything in the category, most of which is education, but it also includes items that are not education. We rate Axelrod's claim Mostly True.

pomt-01435	Says Michelle Nunn is "for amnesty."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/07/david-perdue/perdue-misses-mark-amnesty-allegation/	Political discourse often relies on shorthand to make a point. Opponents of health care reform raised the specter of euthanasia with "death panels, a widely mocked term that earned PolitiFact’s inaugural Lie of the Year in 2009. The bill that created health care reform is now known as Obamacare by both those who support and those who deride it. Then, there is amnesty. Technically referring to blanket forgiveness for a crime, in political circles the word refers to President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 immigration reform that granted illegal immigrants legal status if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982 and meet other minimum requirements. The measure’s failure to slow illegal immigration has made it a charged political term, like the one Republican Senate hopeful David Perdue has lobbed against his Democratic rival, Michelle Nunn. "She’s for amnesty, while terrorism experts say our border breakdown could provide an entry for groups like Isis," Perdue says in his ad, Secure Our Borders. With the nationally prominent race between Perdue and Nunn tight, we decided to take the amnesty claim for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the claim is based on statements Nunn made during a Chamber of Commerce forum in August. Speaking at the event, Nunn said she did not support President Obama taking any executive action on immigration. Nunn said she would have voted for the Senate immigration bill that passed last year. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spearheaded that bipartisan bill, which was co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York and supported by 13 other GOP Senators, including former Republican presidential candidate John McCain. At the same forum, Perdue told the crowd that immigration should first focus on securing the border. That is the same point the ad is trying to make, Dickey said. "Nothing has gotten done because we can’t come to consensus, and in the meantime, our borders are left unsecured," Dickey said. "Only when we are done with securing our border can you talk about what comes next." That brings us back to the bill, which stalled in the GOP-controlled House. Similar to the previous amnesty bill, it would allow illegal immigrants to seek "provisional immigration status" by proving they were in the United States by Dec. 31, 2011. The new bill also would require those applicants to have no felony convictions, no more than two misdemeanors and to pay a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 penalty would be due in six years and, after 10 years, applicants could pay $1,000 to seek a green card. It would be a 13-year process for most of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants to achieve permanent residency or pursue citizenship (children brought as minors and agricultural workers qualify for shorter waits). Before that process could begin, though, the bill would have required the federal government to double the number of U.S. border patrol agents, build 700 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico and further fortify security with radar and unmanned drones and biometric tracking at 30 of the nation’s biggest airports. The requirements to spend billions on border control, before allowing for a pathway to citizenship, has muddied the water even for fact checkers. At times, PolitiFact has ruled claims of amnesty as Half True and Mostly False. Our friends at FactCheck.org, meanwhile, have come down to say the Senate bill is not amnesty. Nunn’s camp cites much of the same reasons as Factcheck.org, saying the term amnesty mischaracterizes the depth of the bill and requirements placed on both the government and undocumented immigrants before citizenship is even on the table. Support of the bill also means Nunn supports increased border control and security, said spokesman Nathan Click. "The ad lies about Michelle's position on immigration, one that is widely shared by Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce," Click said, noting the right-leaning group supported the bill but has repeatedly said it does not support amnesty. "David Perdue’s ad is a dishonest political smear, plain and simple," Click added. Very little in the immigration debate has been simple. Last year’s proposed immigration overhaul drew bipartisan support in the Senate but a conservative backlash in the House. Technically, the proposal includes an amnesty provision by erasing the illegal status of undocumented workers over a 13-year-period that includes payment of fines and other requirements. But it also mandates the border control improvements that Perdue said should be a priority – before any path to citizenship can take place. There is some truth in calling the Senate bill an amnesty measure, but just a grain. The bill also calls for much stiffer border control, and investment, first. Ignoring those mandates pushes the claim down the the Truth-O-Meter. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-10-07T00:00:00	2014-09-17	['None']

pomt-06046	Mitt Romney has 15 homes.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/12/winning-our-future/does-mitt-romney-have-15-homes-woman-winning-our-f/	In the 28-minute video "When Mitt Romney Came to Town" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private-equity firm Bain Capital -- an unidentified former employee of a company bought by Bain recalls the hardship that followed the firm’s acquisition. "That hurts so bad to leave my home because of one man that's got 15 homes," the woman says. Does Mitt Romney really own 15 homes? We began by asking Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, the super PAC behind the ad. Tyler is a former longtime spokesman for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a rival of Romney’s in the GOP presidential primary -- but Winning Our Future is by law unaffiliated with Gingrich’s presidential campaign. Tyler wrote back to us to say, "We don’t make any claim about how many homes Mitt Romney owns." But at PolitiFact, we do hold politicians -- and super PACs -- accountable for the claims they make to the public. The speaker may have been using a bit of rhetorical excess, but the filmmakers -- in an ad paid for by the Winning Our Future -- chose to air the claim and not dispute it, so we consider it fair game for fact-checking. We did a nationwide database search of real estate transactions, deeds and tax records. Initially, our search turned up 16 addresses affiliated in recent years with Mitt Romney or his wife, Ann. But further research enabled us to rule out the bulk of these because they either had been sold or because they represented commercial properties rather than residences. We were left with three properties that appear to be residences currently owned by Mitt Romney or his wife: • A home in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent ocean front neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. This property, bought by the couple in 2008 for $12 million and assessed at $8.7 million in 2010, has been the subject of news reports that the Romneys plan to tear down the existing house and undertake a significant expansion. We will address that issue in a separate fact check. • A condominium in Ann Romney’s name in Belmont, Mass., assessed at $773,000. • A home in Wolfeboro, N.H., on Lake Winnipesaukee, assessed at $4.3 million. Ann Romney is listed as the owner of the 2.3-acre property, purchased for $2.5 million in 1997. A second, 6.3-acre property nearby, also in Ann Romney’s name, appears to be a combination boathouse and stable with living quarters. It is assessed at $2.5 million. News reports indicate that the Romneys upgraded their Wolfeboro property with tennis courts and other amenities. The Romney campaign did not comment to PolitiFact on the number of houses the family owns. Our ruling Winning Our Future released a video in which an interviewee said Mitt Romney owns 15 homes. We find that while the Romney family does own three houses collectively valued at nearly $20 million, but based on the public records we've reviewed they don't own anything close to 15 homes. We rate the statement False. EDITOR’S NOTE: The day after this story was posted, a reader pointed us to a Jan. 14, 2012, article in the Toronto Star that noted that the Romney family owns "a white-sided cottage on a sandy ridge overlooking Lake Huron" in Grand Bend, Ontario – a property purchased in 1950 by Mitt Romney’s father George that did not come up in our search of United States properties. This does not increase the number of Romney-owned homes close enough to 15 for us to change our rating.	None	Winning Our Future	None	None	None	2012-01-12T17:45:21	2012-01-12	['None']
pomt-09531	One-third of the economic stimulus package was tax cuts.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/10/jon-stewart/stewart-claims-stimulus-bill-one-third-tax-cuts/	Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and Daily Show host Jon Stewart traded wisecracks -- and a few insults -- in O'Reilly's No Spin Zone on Feb. 3, 2010. O'Reilly told Stewart that it was frightening that the Daily Show host had been called "an important cultural arbiter." O'Reilly said that his audience is "primarily stoner slackers who love Obama," but that "a lot of people don't think you're smart." Stewart shot back that O'Reilly was now the "voice of sanity" at Fox, which he likened to "being the thinnest kid at fat camp." At times, they got serious. One topic was Stewart's belief that Republicans seem intent on opposing everything President Barack Obama puts on the table -- even if he presents an opportunity to compromise. "But the president won't give the GOP anything," O'Reilly said. Stewart pointed to Obama's stimulus plan as an example. The bill was opposed by Republicans even though it included tax cuts, which typically appeal to their small government sensibilities. "[Obama] has given [Republicans] many different angles," Stewart said. "For instance, even in the stimulus plan, a full third of that was tax cuts. ... Just like at the State of the Union when he said we cut taxes for 95 percent of middle-class Americans, and everybody clapped, and the Republicans just sat there like this. Tax cuts, that sounds vaguely familiar." Is Stewart right that tax cuts account for a third of the stimulus plan? The stimulus bill, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is meant to create jobs and boost the economy. It cost $787 billion, including $499 billion to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion in tax breaks to individuals and businesses. Among other things, the mix of tax cuts includes a refundable credit of up to $400 per individual and $800 for married couples; a temporary increase of the earned income tax credit for disadvantaged families; and an extension of a program that allows businesses to recover the costs of capital expenditures faster than usual. Simple math shows that Stewart is in the ballpark with his claim: $288 billion is a little more than 36 percent of the bill's overall cost. So, tax cuts -- at least the way they've been defined by the Obama administration -- make up for slightly more than one-third of the bill. But calculating the cost of the true tax cuts in the stimulus is a bit more complicated. In July 2009, we checked Obama's claim that, at the time, the stimulus had delivered $43 billion in tax breaks. According to the Treasury Department, about $8 billion of that figure came from extending a fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Originally, the AMT was targeted at very wealthy people, but over the years it spread to include some middle-income taxpayers as well. Congress passes yearly fixes to prevent those middle income taxpayers from having to pay the AMT. All told, the AMT fix in the stimulus will cost about $70 billion over 10 years, according to a bill summary published by the Senate Finance Committee. But many tax experts say the AMT fix should not be considered a tax cut. They say that, by extending the AMT fix every year, the government is basically maintaining the status quo. Back in July, we spoke with a number of tax experts about the issue who all agreed that including the fix as part of the stimulus "tax cuts" is a stretch. Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute, explained it this way: "AMT is something those people never expect to pay," he said. "It's kind of like saying that, if I didn't rob you on the way home from work today, I gave you money." The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, gave the AMT extension a D-minus in its Tax Stimulus Report Card because "the provision would provide virtually no economic stimulus. Because the patch is perennially extended, it would have no effect on behavior in 2009. Almost 80 percent of the benefits would go to the richest 20 percent of households, who would be least likely to spend the additional funds and stimulate demand." So, our tax experts are skeptical that the $70 billion AMT fix should be included in the stimulus bill's tax relief. That would bring down the cost of the tax cuts to about $218 billion. That means about 28 percent of the bill could be described as tax cuts, a little less than the one-third cited by Stewart. So we find Stewart's claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-07546	Milwaukee lost the headquarters for MillerCoors because the area lacks good transit.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/02/jason-haas/milwaukee-county-board-candidate-jason-haas-says-m/	It’s not uncommon to hear politicians sing the blues about a community. It makes sense -- to win an election, candidates have to convince voters they are the ones who can fix the problems. But singing the blues can include some sour notes. Take Jason Haas, who is running for the 14th District seat on the Milwaukee County Board. In a statement to the Bay View Compass newspaper, he made a claim about Milwaukee County transit options that might make a voter in his district want to pony up more tax dollars for public transportation. Haas and his opponent, trucking company owner Steve Kraeger, submitted written responses to questions from the Compass, which appeared in the newspaper's Feb. 27, 2011 issue. In one of his responses, Haas discussed his views on the importance of public transit, including this observation: "Businesses have decided not to locate (in Milwaukee) precisely because there are no effective transit options; Milwaukee lost the headquarters of MillerCoors to Chicago, in large part, for that reason," Haas said. This caught our attention. It didn’t sound right that a multi-billion dollar company moved its headquarters out of its home town because of the transit system. We called Haas for elaboration. He said he based his comments on an article from the Business Journal, a MillerCoors press release and a study from the nonprofit Transportation Development Association. We looked at Haas’ evidence and found what amounted to the old game of telephone, where a statement is made, misunderstood, repeated, and so forth. The trail links Haas’ statement to a misleading item from the Business Journal, and back to a Chicago Tribune article. But let’s start at the beginning -- the MillerCoors marriage and the merged company’s decision on its corporate headquarters. At the time of the merger in 2008, Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Denver-based Coors Brewing Co. were the number two and three brewers in the United States, respectively. The merger was a joint-venture, a 50-50 ownership deal that meant neither company was acquiring the other. Speculation was rampant for months over where the headquarters of the new company would be located. Since both Miller and Coors had an equal amount of power in the new company, the headquarters decision was a touchy subject. Give the HQ to Denver or Milwaukee and it would be clear that one brewery was the "winner." A July 16, 2008 Journal Sentinel article quoted MillerCoors President Tom Long as saying it would have been "too difficult" to choose either Milwaukee or the Denver area as the MillerCoors headquarters location. "We came to the conclusion that we did need a neutral third place," he said. So, it wasn’t about transportation at all, at least not in eliminating Milwaukee. So how did transportation come into this equation? Back to the decision. Eventually, MillerCoors narrowed the list of potential locations to Chicago and Dallas and in July of 2008 announced Chicago as its new home. The office is at 250 S. Wacker Drive, just across the Chicago River from Union Station. The company didn’t abandon Milwaukee: It maintains a major brewery in Milwaukee, which employs about 800, as well as about 300 corporate jobs, said MillerCoors spokesman Julian Green. Superior transportation system was part of the reason Chicago was chosen over Dallas. And that’s where the game of telephone comes in. A July 16, 2008 Chicago Tribune article quoted Long as saying Chicago was chosen as the company’s headquarters because of "access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources." The Business Journal and the Transportation Development Association interpreted Long’s comments in a different manner. The TDA said "the top reasons why MillerCoors chose to locate its corporate headquarters in Chicago rather than Milwaukee were access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources." A July 27, 2008 article in The Business Journal suggested Milwaukee needs to upgrade its transit system, saying "part of the decision" as to why MillerCoors put its headquarters in Chicago was due to the city’s transportation system. This was accurate, since it referred to the Chicago vs. Dallas choice. In a November 2008 editorial, however, The Business Journal said that the Chicago transit system was a "key part of MillerCoors’ decision to locate the new joint venture’s headquarters in that city, rather than Milwaukee." Candidate Haas repeated -- and elaborated -- upon that statement. He said Milwaukee’s lack of transit options was a "large part" of the reason MillerCoors went to Chicago. So where does that leave us? Haas said Milwaukee lost the MillerCoors headquarters because it lacks effective transit. Yet there is no evidence the brewing company chose against Milwaukee for those reasons. Milwaukee and Denver were never in play. The company chose Chicago over Dallas, and, in doing so, the top executive praised that city’s transit system. We rate Haas’ statement False.

pomt-14271	A study "from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Dartmouth concluded that Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/apr/08/tom-price/bid-restructure-medciaid-does-rep-tom-price-get-co/	When Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, released his committee’s 2017 budget resolution, he posted the text on Medium. Part of the budget takes a jab at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The committee proposes to restructure Medicaid, the federal-state program for health coverage for the poor. The resolution urges repealing the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and "giving states more power to control their Medicaid dollars." But one passage caught our eye: "For too many Americans, Medicaid is an empty promise. Finding a physician who will see Medicaid beneficiaries can be incredibly challenging because providers are under-reimbursed and cannot afford to provide care at the rates the program pays. In fact, a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Dartmouth concluded that Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program." We wondered whether Price and his committee were correct to cite the work of three health care academics to support the argument that Medicaid is "an empty promise" that provides "significantly lower" value to its beneficiaries than its actual cost. As it turns out, it’s more complicated than that. In fact, one of the paper’s co-authors told PolitiFact that he disputed the connection the committee was seeking to draw. About the paper We started our research by locating the paper, written by Amy Finkelstein of MIT, Nathaniel Hendren of Harvard and Erzo F.P. Luttmer of Dartmouth and published in June 2015. Titled, "The Value Of Medicaid: Interpreting Results from The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment," it looked at data from Oregon’s 2008 expansion of its Medicaid rolls. Oregon’s Medicaid program provided a unique opportunity for researchers, because the state had only enough funding to cover a portion of residents who wanted to sign up. So to distribute spots in the program, they set up a lottery. This allowed health care economists a rare opportunity to compare health-related outcomes for those with Medicaid as well as an uninsured control group. (We have previously written about a different study that uses the Oregon data.) The paper is aimed at hard-core health care wonks, but the gist of the authors’ mission was to determine how much of every Medicaid dollar benefited recipients directly, as opposed to how much benefited the wallets of whoever else would have been paying the health care bills if the person was not covered by Medicaid. Ultimately, the authors estimated that between 40 and 80 cents of every dollar benefitted whoever would have been paying those health care costs if Medicaid hadn’t been. These could be state or local governments, the patient’s relatives or friends, or health care providers who would otherwise have to eat the unreimbursed costs of care. (Between 20 and 40 cents of every dollar replaced money that Medicaid recipients would have spent on their own.) When the study came out, some supporters of a more free-market approach to health care touted it as evidence that Medicaid wasn’t doing a good job of targeting its dollars. And if true, this would be an argument for cutting the program or making significant changes to it. The authors respond However, it’s important to remember that all the money being studied in the paper -- even that which reimbursed someone other than the patient themself -- was spent on behalf of the patient. The patient reaped the benefits of the full dollar, not just 20 to 40 cents of it. That means "Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries," as the resolution put it, isn’t just the 20 to 40 cents that replaces the Medicaid beneficiary’s personal outlays; rather, it’s something approaching the whole dollar. In addition, the study doesn’t exactly speak to whether Medicaid is an "empty promise," as the resolution puts it, or to such issues as doctor shortages or below-market reimbursement rates. When we ran the passage from the budget resolution by the authors of the paper, Hendren told us that what the committee said amounted to "a non sequitur." "We don’t provide any evidence in our paper suggesting providers are under-reimbursed or that individuals on Medicaid aren’t able to obtain care," he said, adding, "the result is more nuanced than the way it is referenced." When we contacted Price’s staff, they said they didn’t mean to suggest that the academics had endorsed their specific reform effort. They added that the committee still believes the paper offers a concrete example of how the program is falling short on its promise to beneficiaries. "It is failing to deliver on that promise for too many right now, and we simply cite the research from MIT, Harvard and Dartmouth as one example of how it is failing," the committee told PolitiFact. But when we ran that response by Hendren, he was skeptical. "I would disagree that we present evidence that Medicaid is ‘failing’ its beneficiaries," Hendren said. "Our results suggest the common interpretation of Medicaid — namely that its primary beneficiaries are the enrollees themselves — is misguided. If I give one dollar to you and one dollar to your boss, you’d probably only be willing to pay one dollar for that. Just because the program costs two dollars doesn’t mean it’s failing, in my opinion. Rather, we’d want to also think about the fact that the program is benefiting your boss, too." Our ruling Price, in his committee’s resolution, said that "for too many Americans, Medicaid is an empty promise. … In fact, a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Dartmouth concluded that Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program." Academics did conclude that only a fraction of what Medicaid spends directly replaces what its beneficiaries would have had to pay for their health care costs. But even the Medicaid money that doesn’t replace the beneficiary’s own spending does pay for their health care. This conflicts with the resolution’s claim that the paper showed that Medicaid’s "value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program." The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-07664	Says students who receive free or reduced lunch are "performing just as well" as students who do not.	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/10/thad-altman/during-teacher-bill-debate-talk-turns-student-perf/	A version of a controversial education bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed in 2010 is being fast-tracked through the Florida Legislature in 2011, now that Crist is gone. You could call SB 736 "Son of SB 6." The bill, which would link raises for teachers to student performance and limit the length of teacher contracts to one year, passed the Senate, 26-12, three days into the annual legislative session. A companion bill is moving through the Florida House. During floor debate prior to its passage on March 10, 2011, state Sen. Thad Altman, R-Rockledge, tried to offer an amendment that would give school districts flexibility in judging teachers who teach students who receive free or reduced lunch. The bill already offered leeway for judging English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and special-needs teachers. Altman said he wanted to acknowledge the "extra challenges" that educators who teach students on free or reduced lunch have. The idea, however, got a rise out of the lone Democratic supporter of the bill, Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando. "Are you saying just because a child is on free or reduced lunch, they need additional assistance?" asked Siplin, who said that he -- like Gov. Rick Scott -- "grew up in the projects" and turned out all right. Altman recoiled to say that wasn't his intent, and claimed that free and reduced lunch students are performing as well as their counterparts. "Our poverty schools are performing just as well," Altman said. Altman's amendment died by a voice vote, but since this debate will continue in the House, we thought it important to address his broader point. The question in this case: Are students receiving free and reduced lunch performing as well as students who don't? The answer, on average, is no. PolitiFact Florida researched student performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test for 2010 through data supplied by the Florida Department of Education. FCAT exams are issued to students starting in the third grade. Exams measure student performance in writing, reading, math and science. At every grade level, in every subject area tested, students receiving free or reduced lunch scored worse on average than those not receiving free or reduced lunch, according to FDOE statistics. Here's an example. Students take the FCAT math exam each year starting in the third grade until they finish their sophomore year of high school. Fifth graders in 2010 scored a 336 on average. Those who received free or reduced lunch scored 323 on average, while those who did not scored 356. The same trend played out for every grade level. We're attaching the summary reports for each test from 2010 so you can see for yourself. In each case, we sorted mean test results among all students, those who receive free or reduced lunch and those that do not. View the reading results here. View the math results here. View the writing results here. View the science results here. The raw scores are a better apples-to-apples comparison of student performance than, say, a school's FCAT letter grade, because the letter grade adjusts for relative improvement and groups all students together. Altman said afterward that the point of his amendment was to be able to reward teachers who were helping poorer students compete and excel against their classmates. And he said that in his home of Brevard County there were examples of schools with high rates of students receiving free or reduced lunches who were performing as well as districts were students were better off. The current version of the bill, Altman said, draws no distinction for those high-performing teachers who are bucking the statewide trend. He said he hoped someone would carry forward a similar proposal when the debate moved to the House. Altman wanted to insert language in an education bill that would have given school districts more leeway to offer raises to teachers who instruct children receiving free or reduced lunch, saying it was important to acknowledge the "extra challenges" those teachers face. When pressed by Siplin if he was suggesting poor students aren't as smart as others, he said no -- that students receiving free or reduced lunch are performing as well as everyone else. To be clear, we're only talking about test scores here, not capabilities or smarts. Though in a roundabout way it may actually help his point, Altman made a general claim about student performance that contradicts the facts. We rate it False.

pomt-03248	"For anybody who's trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/13/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-he-did-pass-bill-during-his-tim/	Rick Kriseman was quick to defend his time as a state representative during the recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum. During the hour-long debate, incumbent Mayor Bill Foster claimed Kriseman was ineffective as a lawmaker representing St. Petersburg. (We’re checking Foster’s specific attack in another fact-check.) Here’s how Kriseman responded: "For anybody who's trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed, along with a bill that requires people who are convicted of DUI to carry $100,000 of insurance in case they hit somebody else and injure them in an accident. So there are issues and legislation that I have passed." In this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Kriseman’s claim about crosswalks. Kriseman, a Democrat who served as a legislator from 2006 to 2012, spent two years as policy chairman for House Democrats. Practically, that means he studied up on the legislation scheduled to hit the House floor and advised the Democratic caucus how to vote in a daily meeting. In 2007 and 2008, Kriseman introduced a proposal that required drivers to stop for, rather than simply yield the right of way to, pedestrians legally in, or about to enter, crosswalks. In 2008, the idea (HB 89/SB 154) passed with unanimous votes, but it did not have his name on it. The Senate sponsor, then-Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, got the paper credit. Kriseman’s version barely budged through the House committee process, with leaders choosing to advance the one with Fasano’s name on it. Why? Party politics. Fasano readily told us Kriseman came up with the proposal, and he asked Fasano to be the Senate sponsor. Fasano, as a member of the majority party, had a better shot at getting it passed. It’s rare for a member of the minority party to have his or name on a bill if a majority party member is sponsoring it in the other chamber, he said. "That’s politics, in Tallahassee especially," Fasano said. "Not as much in the Senate, but definitely in the House." Kriseman pointed to other bills he sponsored that became law, including one in 2007 that requires people convicted of DUI to carry 10 times the liability insurance of other drivers, or $100,000 for one injured person. Pinellas County Republican Dennis Jones sponsored the bill in the Senate. The point of the law is to cover medical expenses of DUI victims. Gov. Charlie Crist signed the bill in a St. Petersburg ceremony in which he honored a 40-year-old father who was hit years earlier by a drunken driver as he sat on his motorcycle at a red light. The man, Chris Prati, required around-the-clock medical care and was no longer able to eat or speak, according to Times archives. A local bill bearing Kriseman’s name also got Crist’s signature in 2007. Two years later, a Kriseman-sponsored measure that encouraged service-learning courses in schools ended up in a Republican-sponsored Senate bill that became law. Our ruling Kriseman said, "For anybody who's trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed." Kriseman’s name wasn’t on 2008 legislation meant to aid pedestrians, but the Senate sponsor who got credit said it was Kriseman’s idea and that he simply needed a Republican to help get it through the legislative process.

pomt-00841	"According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than by someone who happens to carry a conceal-and-carry permit."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/mar/23/florida-students-concealed-carry/are-alligator-attacks-more-common-attacks-those-gu/	The Florida Legislature is moving toward allowing guns on college campuses. House and Senate panels have voted in favor of a proposal that would let concealed weapon license holders -- who must be 21 -- have their guns in college facilities. Currently, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. The Legislature had previously rejected allowing guns on campuses, but a shooting last year reignited the debate. Gunman Myron May, a former Florida State University student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. During a Senate Higher Education Committee hearing on March 16, 2015, students testified both for and against the proposal. "According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than by someone who happens to carry a conceal-and-carry permit, and that was a study over the first 10 years of the conceal-carry law in Florida," said Erek Culbreath, president of Florida Students for Concealed Carry, a group that advocates for concealed carry of firearms on all the campuses. Are gator attacks twice as common as attacks by someone who has a conceal-and-carry permit? We went in search of the evidence. Data on gators and guns Florida’s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Currently, about 1.3 million people have Florida concealed weapon licenses. (By coincidence, the number of estimated wild alligators in Florida is also 1.3 million.) We found no study that compared gator attacks with any sort of "attack" by gun license owners. What Culbreath sent us -- and what we found elsewhere -- was that over the years, pro-gun advocates obtained separate data from state officials on gator attacks and gun license revocations and combined them to make such a comparison. In fact, this claim even made its way to the Connecticut General Assembly when politicians there considered a handgun safety bill in 1998. For example, one website wrote it this way in 1999: "Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. During the first ten years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 146 to 88 margin." (The footnotes stated that the information came from a Fish and Wildlife Conservation spokesman and a statistical report about gun licenses.) We obtained some updated data from state officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has documented the number of alligator bites on people between 1948 and November 2013 for a total of 357 bites. (For the record, that is strictly bites by alligators and not crocodiles, which are rare.) During the hearing, Culbreath mentioned data from the first 10 years of concealed carry in Florida. We found no comprehensive source of data for "attacks" by gun license holders. However, the state does have data on revocations for misuse of a firearm. Between October 1987 and February 2015, the state revoked 9,636 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to data maintained by the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which handles gun permits. Of that group, 168 were revoked for misuse of a firearm. (In January 2011 the state stopped maintaining information about the breakdown of license revocations by type.) We were unable to obtain more details about whether those 168 assaulted someone or misused the gun in some other way. We also couldn’t isolate data just for 1987 through 1997 to provide a decade comparison to the alligator bites. But overall, alligator bites happen more often than the revocation of gun permits for misuse of firearms. Is it a meaningful comparison? Experts didn’t think it should carry much weight in the policymaking process. "As for comparing bites to bullets, it is more than silly," said James Alan Fox, criminology professor at Northeastern University. "The risk of attack by an armed person exists virtually anywhere one travels. Gators only attack near certain bodies of water. At the University of Florida, for example, the only gator you’ll see is the mascot at sporting events." (After our fact-check posted we heard from a couple of readers who noted that there are indeed actual live alligators on the University of Florida campus. "We do indeed have real alligators on campus," university spokesman Steve Orlando said. "There are several in Lake Alice on the west side of campus, though I couldn’t give you an exact number. We have no record of any alligator attacks.") UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, an expert on the Second Amendment, had this to say about our query: "Are you serious? I'd rather not be attacked by an alligator or a concealed carry permit holder. The data on permit revocations suggest that concealed carry permits are revoked far more often than alligator attacks. Alligators are also subject to stricter controls than concealed carry permit holders: You can't bring an alligator to the mall when you go shopping." David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and author of the book Private Guns, Public Health, said that revocations don’t capture every misuse of a gun by a permit holder. "It would be like looking at the small number of driving licenses that are revoked and claiming that is a good measure of how well people are driving," he said. Florida State University Professor Gary Kleck said that the comparison to gator attacks was likely used to indicate how rare gun crimes by carry permit holders are. "It could just as easily been something else that's really rare, like death from meteor strikes or midair aircraft collisions. The point is merely that these things are extremely rare," he said. Our ruling Culbreath said, "According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to get attacked by an alligator than by someone with a conceal-and-carry permit." We don't have data on attacks committed by people with conceal-and-carry permits. The gun data is based on an approximation using permit revocations that may or may not accurately reflect the number of "attacks." Also, the data is 10 years old. That said, these statistics, imperfect as they are, do support the notion that both kinds of attacks are uncommon. Whether this is a valid argument in favor of the bill is in the eye of the beholder. We find the statement has an element of truth but ignores other information that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13563	The Obama administration gave Iran "$400 million in ransom payment cash."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-calls-400-million-payment-iran-ransom/	Back in January, Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States. On the same day, the United States transferred $400 million in cash to Iran, holding onto the money until three of the freed Americans were in the air, on their way home. Some critics of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy -- including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump -- are putting the two happenings together and calling it a "ransom" payment. The administration denies that characterization. "Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash, where they just yesterday caught Obama in yet another lie," Trump said in an Aug. 21 speech in Michigan. While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it "ransom" isn’t quite accurate. The word "ransom" implies that Iran refused to release the prisoners unless the United States turned over $400 million of its own money to Iran, and American officials capitulated. In reality, the United States owed Iran $400 million as part of a longstanding dispute, and negotiators used that pending settlement as leverage to release the detained Americans. Experts said this kind of exchange is standard issue in U.S.-Iran relations over the past few decades. The important but subtle nuance is this: While settling the $400 million helped ensure that the prisoners got home, it wasn’t an illicit payment. Iran, according to the claim adjudicators, had a legitimate right to the money. ‘Business as usual’ In 1979, Iran’s then-monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid $400 million to the United States government to purchase military parts. But that year’s revolution toppled the shah, and the military parts were never delivered. To regain its funds, Iran filed a claim against the United States in 1981 in the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which adjudicates disputes between the two nations. The body, located at the Hague, was established amid negotiations to end the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, in which pro-revolution students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The tribunal's first priority was to address claims from private individuals, including 4,700 now-resolved U.S. claims filed against the Government of Iran. Over the past several years, the tribunal has focused more of its attention on claims the two governments have made against each other, including this dispute over the $400 million weapons deal. The State Department announced its settlement in the dispute — the United States would pay Iran $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest — on Jan. 17, the same day Obama announced the return of the Americans detained in Iran, as well as the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. The first installment of the settlement was also transferred that day, via an unmarked cargo plane, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal in early August. The administration paid the funds using various European currencies because U.S. law bars financial transactions with Iran in U.S. dollars, and Iran’s access to banking is limited because of international sanctions. The administration has explained that the $400 million settlement and the prisoner release were negotiated in separate channels and coincidentally reached their resolutions near the same time. Negotiators took advantage of the convergence in order to ensure that Iran returned the prisoners by withholding the payment until the American detainees were in the air and headed out of Iran. "While there is no connection between the $400 million and the return of our American citizens, we did, however, in those endgame hours, hold back that payment until we knew that our Americans were safe and sound and on their way out of Iran, because, in the very last few hours, Iran was playing a few games here on us," said State Department spokesman John Kirby in an Aug. 19 PBS interview. We may never truly know how intertwined these two negotiation channels were, but two experts personally familiar with the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal told us that the administration’s explanation is plausible. "As for the timing of this particular settlement, the Obama administration’s account is entirely consistent with my experience," said Nancy Combs, who was a legal adviser to the tribunal until becoming a professor at William and Mary Law School in 2004. Combs said this particular claim was massive in size, complexity and value, so it is likely that lawyers had been working on this case prior to and separate from the prisoner issue, as well as the nuclear deal talks. Given that these cases are hashed out by career lawyers over many years, it’s likely that the lawyers approached the administration with the news that they were in a position to settle, as opposed to the administration directing them to settle, said John Bellinger, who served as the State Department’s chief legal adviser under President George W. Bush. (Bellinger has publicly opposed Trump.) "I suspect that these two negotiations, the claims settlement and detained persons, were completely separate and happened to come together at the same time," Bellinger added. "I don’t think it’s appropriate to call this ransom, and the intent of the money was not to gain the return of these detainees." We should note that some have pointed out an article Bellinger wrote for the Washington Post in 2009, in which he seemed to say the tribunal had already dismissed this claim. Bellinger told us that it is his understanding that the January 2016 settlement involved a different dispute. We talked to five people who study national security and Iran. The only one willing to call the payment "ransom" was Clare Lopez, vice president for research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, a right-leaning think tank. Lopez has called the broader Iran deal unconstitutional and has written for conservative websites. "There's simply no other way to call an unmarked cargo plane delivery of pallets of shrink-wrapped European currency in the middle of the night to the foremost state sponsor of terror in the world that remains under U.S. financial sanctions for terrorism," Lopez said. The majority of experts said the ransom label was inaccurate. "In no sense can this payment be considered ransom," Combs said. "A ransom is a payment made to secure the release of a detained person. This sum, by contrast, was made to satisfy a legitimate debt that the U.S. owed to Iran." Gary Samore, executive director for research at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction under Obama, said it's not "technically ransom in that the money that was returned was Iran’s money." Samore said he was not surprised by the exchange because there’s a history of using financial tools to settle deals with Iran. He specifically noted that in 2011, the nation of Oman paid Iran $1 million on the United States’ behalf for the release of two American hikers who had been jailed in Iran for two years. "It’s business as usual," he said. "I don’t think the Iranians are going to release prisoners if they don’t get something." Our ruling Trump said the Obama administration gave Iran "$400 million in ransom payment cash." On the same day in January, the United States paid Iran $400 million dollars, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there appears to be a quid pro quo — the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home — this does not equate to ransom, experts told us. Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute. It’s unclear whether the prisoner and financial disputes were connected in just the final hours of the prisoner transfer or if there was more advance coordination. Trump’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cdaae571-dd1f-42af-b16b-924a46f08f71	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-24T13:27:14	2016-08-21	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-07704	A telephone company will no longer have to provide landline service to customers if there is an alternative provider, including wireless.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/05/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-says-telecom-bill-would-allow-p/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has a contentious relationship with Virginia utility companies. On Feb. 21, Armstrong took the House floor to oppose a telecommunications bill that updated telecom laws and changed certain regulations faced by landline carriers. Armstrong, D-Henry, disliked provisions in the legislation, which wound up passing the General Assembly. One was a change that would allow phone companies to refuse to not run new landlines to homes and businesses if there is an adequate alternative that the customer could use, such as cell phone service. Another was a provision in the bill that Armstrong said would erode the State Corporation Commission’s ability to regulate electric utilities. Here’s what Armstrong, who is exploring a 2013 bid for statewide office, said on the House floor: "If you pass this bill, a telephone company would no longer have to provide service by way of a landline facility to any customer, residential or business, who requests such service if there is an alternative provider, either wireless or wire-line. If the service is available through a cell phone, than that is an adequate substitute even if the service does not meet the service needs or pricing requirements of the customer." We looked at the legislation. It says that "a telephone company shall not have the duty to extend or expand its facilities to furnish service and facilities when the person, firm or corporation has service available from one or more alternative providers of wireline or terrestrial wireless communications services at prevailing market rates." According to the SCC and Verizon, that means there is no requirement to run a landline to any new customer who can obtain coverage from another source, including cell phones. Robert Woltz, Jr., the president of Verizon’s Virginia landline division, said his company increasingly faces situations where a developer building a new subdivision signs an exclusive telecom agreement with a cable company, such as Cox or Comcast. If one or two customers in the neighborhood want their landline from Verizon, Woltz said it makes little financial sense for the company to pay for the extensive wiring needed. "If company ‘X’ serves the subdivision with Triple Play (cable, Internet and telephone service) and I only do voice, I shouldn’t have to invest lots of money to serve a few customers," Woltz said. The new rules say a company can only decline to provide landline service if there is a "reasonably adequate" alternative. The SCC is now deciding how it will enforce that standard. "It may just be on a case-by-case basis, unless there are a lot of complaints and the commission decides they need to make a defined standard," said William Irby, director of the SCC’s Division of Communications. Woltz said the SCC could check service availability in suburban areas through online searches and contacting cable companies. In disputes over whether wireless service is adequate, he said regulators could make house visits to test reception and ensure a phone works throughout a person’s house. In his speech, Armstrong warned the bill could affect 4 million Virginians. But anyone who already has a landline should not see any changes. The bill would require landline providers to give any existing customer the option to have a landline repaired if service is disrupted. "I don’t get to tell existing customers what to do," Woltz said. Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss is concerned wireless service would be more expensive than landlines for consumers while offering fewer features. There is also the concern with prices. The new law requires that the alternative service be available at "prevailing market rates." But Irby said those comparisons occur only in the same group of technology, meaning wireless prices are compared to other wireless services, not landline prices. Let’s review. Armstrong said a bill approved by the General Assembly would allow phone companies to refuse to run landlines to new customers if alternative services, including cell phones, are available.

pomt-09177	"This year, we have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month, a majority in the private sector, a stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/04/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-touts-democratic-record-job-creation/	Politicians love to tout the monthly employment numbers -- and frame them in the best light. That's what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did on June 4, 2010, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced its monthly job figures for May. In a news release, the Speaker's office said in part, "Last month, the unemployment rate fell and private sector jobs expanded; we have added jobs in six of the last seven months. This year, we have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month, a majority in the private sector, a stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months." We found Pelosi largely correct on the details but that she dodged some important context. -- Last month, the unemployment rate fell. Correct: It fell from 9.9 percent to 9.7 percent, where it had been for the first three months of 2010. -- Last month, private sector jobs expanded. Correct: The economy added 41,000 new jobs in May, although that represented the smallest increase since January 2010. -- The U.S. has added jobs in six of the last seven months. Correct: The economy added 64,000 jobs in November 2009, lost 109,000 jobs in December 2009, added 14,000 in January 2010, added 39,000 in February, added 208,000 in March, added 290,000 in April, and added 431,000 in May. -- This year, the U.S. has added an average of 200,000 jobs per month. Very close. The average was 196,400. Pelosi would have been on safer ground if she'd said the economy "had added, on average, almost 200,000 jobs per month." -- A majority of the jobs added this year have been in the private sector. Correct, though barely. The average monthly increase in private sector jobs was 99,000, or 50.4 percent of new jobs added. But here's the part we paid special attention to, because it seeks to contrast these numbers with the record of President George W. Bush: -- These statistics stand in "stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months." The numbers are correct as Pelosi phrased them, but she is cherry-picking. Her selection of time periods for the comparison produces a picture that's as flattering as possible to the Democrats. We think a listener hearing this would assume that President Barack Obama's job creation record stood in "stark contrast" to Bush's, when in fact the time periods Pelosi uses put Obama's record in the best possible light -- because it skips all of 2009 -- and puts Bush's in the worst possible light. She conveniently left out all of 2009, when the nation lost 4.7 million jobs, or 395,000 per month. That's a monthly rate nearly twice as large as the increases recorded in 2010. Looked at another way, the job gains in 2010 that Pelosi touts have only replaced one-fifth of all the jobs that were lost in calendar 2009. Meanwhile, the final three months of the Bush presidency accounted for the worst job loss totals of his presidency. Yes, the job-creation record for 2010 represents a significant improvement over 2009, and it's true that assigning "blame" for the job losses in 2009 is tricky, since many of the job losses under Obama were set in motion under policies implemented by Bush. Still, we feel that comparing the three worst job-loss months of Bush's presidency to the five best job-gain months of Obama's is an example of highly selective math. A spokesman for Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, told PolitiFact that when the Speaker's office sends out job-related news releases, it attaches a graph that has the full picture of gains and losses starting in December 2007 -- the start of the current recession. That chart shows jobs declining by larger and larger amounts until a low point in January 2009, when Obama took office, then climbing (that is, losing fewer jobs every month) until November 2009, when the monthly changes, with one exception, turned into net job gains. The chart also appears on the Speaker's blog. While we didn't find a copy of the chart included with the news release when we found it on Pelosi's website, Elshami forwarded us a copy that had been sent to reporters earlier that morning that did include it. So we'll give her office partial credit for providing some context, even if it didn't come in the document we initially found. In all, then, the Speaker's portrayal of the numbers is technically accurate, but the general impression she gives -- that the record under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress stands in "stark contrast" to the record under Bush -- is political spin based on selective choices about what data to use.

pomt-06841	Says state Rep. Sandy Pasch, her recall opponent, "voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab for…Viagra."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/05/alberta-darling/wisconsin-state-sen-alberta-darling-says-rep-sandy/	One of the eye-catching direct mail pieces of the Senate recall campaigns is Republican Sen. Alberta Darling’s depiction of her opponent, Democrat Sandy Pasch, on the screen of an electronic tablet. "iBad, The Sandy Pasch Edition," the mailer shouts. It invents applications such as "iSpend," "iTax," "iOink," and "iBilk" to paint Pasch as a tax and spend liberal. The "iBilk," the mailer says, "runs union applications that send taxpayer dollars to the bedroom -- for Viagra -- instead of the classroom." That’s right, Viagra is a topic in the Milwaukee-area Senate recall to be decided Aug. 9, 2011. Darling also focuses on the issue in a campaign TV ad that says: "Sandy Pasch even voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab for…Viagra." Did Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, vote to give teachers health insurance coverage that paid for Viagra and other pills for erectile dysfunction? The Viagra issue won wide publicity in 2010 when the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association sued the Milwaukee Public Schools over the issue, claiming men were unfairly discriminated against by an MPS decision to stop covering the pills. MPS first agreed to cover the drugs in 2002, leading to 1,002 claims for such drugs from MPS employees by 2004. During negotiations with the union for its 2003-2005 contract, MPS tried to stop coverage of the drugs, citing rising costs. An arbitrator sided with the district in 2005, leading to further appeals that ultimately did not go the union’s way. The 2010 union lawsuit was dropped in March 2011, in effect settling the issue in favor of the district. We asked Darling’s camp to explain the connection between the nearly decade-old MPS dispute and Pasch, who was elected in 2008. Andrew Davis, Darling’s campaign manager, did not cite a specific vote on the MPS issue or on coverage of Viagra. He offered a more general response, saying that Pasch has stood with unions and backed union rights in the controversy over Gov. Scott Walker’s move -- supported by Darling -- to curtail collective bargaining for public employees. Said Davis: "The extent of collective bargaining gave unions the power to bargain for Viagra, and that bill was put on the backs of the taxpayers." But that’s not what the TV ad said. Pasch is pro-union, and has supported a reversal of the collective bargaining limits that Walker and GOP lawmakers put through. But she has at times disagreed with the Milwaukee teachers union. That union recently declined to reopen bargaining to talk about contributing more toward teachers benefits in order to possibly save some jobs. Pasch said she wished they had come back to the table. But there was no legislative vote related to Viagra. And Pasch came into public life three years after an arbitrator ruled MPS could deny Viagra to employees. Darling tries to make the case that collective bargaining enabled the union to get Viagra coverage. But MPS management was the party that signed off on it. Even if MPS didn’t have to negotiate with employees in the early 2000s, it could have added the drugs. And it didn’t need an end to collective bargaining in 2011 to make the call to drop the drugs -- it did that years earlier. The bottom line? In seeking to tap into anger in some quarters over the Viagra issue, Darling claims Pasch voted to allow it for school district employees. Darling cites Pasch’s support for collective bargaining. But there was no vote in Madison on the matter. The issue was resolved in Milwaukee when an arbitrator ruled in favor of the school district -- years before Pasch came to office.

pomt-01914	Says Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke has "deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/30/john-chisholm/milwaukee-sheriff-pays-overtime-deputies-sit-secur/	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. regularly uses the media to criticize other elected officials -- having, for example, accused Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele of penis envy and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett of being "clueless." In contrast, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm rarely engages in public political battles. So it was a surprise when Chisholm excoriated Clarke in a letter on June 2, 2014. Among other things, Chisholm said the Sheriff's Office was running a budget deficit partly because Clarke has "deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work." Chisholm’s charge seemed worthy of a look. The backdrop The district attorney’s letter was in response to a letter he and the county’s chief judge received a few days earlier from Clarke. Clarke, in the wake of a shooting of a 10-year-old Milwaukee girl, who was gravely wounded in the crossfire between two men on a playground, called for temporarily suspending plea bargaining and probation sentences for major crimes. For years, he wrote, the county's prosecutors and judges had engaged in "soft-on-crime practices." Security checkpoints Security checkpoints for the county courthouse complex, which includes the Public Safety Building and the Criminal Justice Facility, are not the responsibility of the Sheriff’s Office but rather the county Division of Facilities Management. In other words, county workers, not sheriff’s deputies, check visitors and operate metal detectors at the various entrances to the complex. The security work is not part of the sheriff’s budget. Clarke, however, has asserted his authority to help provide security. In March 2013, Clarke announced that during an "integrity check," an undercover sheriff's deputy with a gun cleared security checkpoints at all six entrances into the county courthouse complex. He said that, as a result, he had ordered deputies posted at each security checkpoint in the complex until "he is convinced weapons cannot get through." He said the staffing would be paid for with overtime. That staffing is continuing. When we checked the entrances one afternoon in June 2014, we found two county employees manning each checkpoint and a deputy nearby. At one checkpoint, we saw a deputy actively working the metal detector; but at the others, a deputy was only observing. Our colleagues who regularly visit the courthouse told us the same: usually they see deputies merely observing, but occasionally actively working a checkpoint. For his part, Clarke told us the deputies are not posted at the checkpoints to watch the screeners. "The deputies are there to provide an armed presence for the protection of the public and employees, and to prevent and deter an armed person from getting into the building," he said in an email. The cost There’s no dispute that overtime pay is being used, at least in part, to pay deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. But the amount is not clear. Based on overtime reports the Sheriff’s Office submits to county officials, it’s not possible to tell how much in overtime pay is being spent on deputies working security checkpoints at the courthouse complex, said county Auditor Jerome Heer. Overall, the sheriff’s overtime expenditures have gone over budget. In 2013, the Sheriff’s Office spent $5.9 million for overtime, exceeding the $3.6 million overtime budget, Heer said. As of June 23, 2014, he said, overtime expenditures were $2.7 million, which is on pace to exceed the overtime budget of $4.1 million. Our rating Chisholm said Clarke has "deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work." There’s no dispute that part of the sheriff’s overtime budget pays deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. The deputies typically are observing visitors passing through the checkpoints, but sometimes get actively involved in screening them or monitoring metal detectors.

pomt-12494	"The ‘tax plan’ rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/28/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-target-about-what-donald-trump-might-/	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., took aim at President Donald Trump’s tax proposal by making it personal -- how much the president would stand to gain from passage of his own tax proposal. "The ‘tax plan’ rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for)," Pelosi tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is this accurate? To the extent we know anything about Trump’s personal tax situation, experts said she is basically correct. What we know about Trump’s taxes Trump is the first presidential candidate, and the first president, in decades not to release his tax returns. Two portions of Trump’s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from 1995, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times last fall. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don’t shed much light on Pelosi’s claim. The second forms are the summary pages from his 2005 federal tax return, which were first reported in March by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. The 2005 returns suggest that Pelosi is in the ballpark, judging by the alternative minimum tax alone. Trump’s tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. A line in Trump’s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT. That was a large portion of his total tax bill: Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year. Some room for questions When we contacted Pelosi’s office, a spokesman provided two analyses. One, by Pelosi’s own staff, cited the AMT line from his 2005 report. The other analysis, published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee on April 26, said that Trump would save about $28.6 million mostly through the reduction of the "pass-through income" rate to 15 percent. ("Pass-through income" involves a certain type of structuring for business and personal income taxes.) Given these two projections, "we decided to go with an average of $30 million," said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill. Several tax experts said that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given what we know. "In round numbers, Pelosi's assertion is correct," said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Several experts added, however, that the combination of Trump’s lack of transparency about his own taxes and the lack of detail he’s offered so far in his tax proposal provide a lot of room for uncertainty. For instance, in future years, Trump’s taxes may be more reliant on the lower, 15 percent tax on pass-through income than the AMT, said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor whose specialties include taxation. But we don’t know exactly how that would change the equation. "We don't really have enough detail from Trump's tax returns to properly analyze the impact of reforms," said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. "And even the reform plan is not so much a plan but a high level of general objectives." Then again, if Trump wants to complain about an incorrect estimate of his tax burden, all he has to do is release his tax returns, Shaviro said. Our ruling Pelosi said, "The ‘tax plan’ rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for)." Experts agree that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given the limited information available, both in Trump’s public tax returns and the bullet-point nature of his tax-policy proposal. Still, it is an estimate, so the actual number may be quite a bit lower or higher. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07269	For more than 30 years after World War II, there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/25/bob-mcdonnell/gov-mcdonnell-says-us-debt-shrank-comparison-gdp-d/	Gov. Bob McDonnell used some historical context to argue the national debt is on an unsustainable arc. "After World War II, we (had) just about 100 percent of GDP tied up in debt, but over 30 years there was a reduction in the debt until the 1980s," McDonnell said in a video interview posted online May 20 by Human Events, a conservative website. With all the talk about the U.S. hitting the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling recently, it’s hard to imagine an era when the government actually reduced its borrowing load in proportion to the national economy. We wondered if McDonnell was right. The governor was talking about U.S. debt as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product, which is the value of all goods and services produced in the nation. Economists say the percentage is important because it measures a nation’s ability to support its debt. After World War II, did that percentage slide down in the U.S. until the 1980s? Before we get into the numbers, it’s helpful to point out at that the U.S. national debt is made up of two components. The biggest chunk is publicly held debt owed to investors, the Federal Reserve as well as state and local governments that have purchased U.S. securities. The second piece is debt held by government accounts, mostly trust funds for Social Security, Medicare, military retirement and other programs. We asked the governor’s office where the information for his statement came from. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, sent us a Congressional Budget Office table showing the level of publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP from 1790 to 2000. That graphic shows a relatively steady drop from the post-World War II peak to around 1980. To get an idea of how the debt level changed each year between the mid-1940s and the 1980s, we also examined historical tables on the Office of Management and Budget’s website. Let’s start with 1946, the year after World War II ended. At the end of that fiscal year, the Gross Federal Debt -- the total of public and government debt -- was 121.7 percent of GDP, its highest ever. That went on a general decline over 35 years, although there were about a half dozen times when the debt’s share of GDP rose year-to-year before dropping off again. In 1979, debt amounted to 33.2 of GDP. If you look at just publicly-held debt as a percentage of GDP, it followed the same trajectory. It’s highest proportion of GDP was also in 1946, when it was 108.7 percent of the nation’s economic output. That also fell off gradually until 1979, when publicly held debt was 25.6 percent of GDP. So either way you count the debt -- total debt or just publicly-held debt -- McDonnell is correct that as a share of GDP it dropped over the roughly 35-year span between World War II’s end and the 1980s. The total national debt as a percentage of the GDP rose during the 1980s and fell in the late 1990s. But since 2001 it’s been on the rise. Total debt is projected to be 102.6 percent at the end of the 2011 fiscal year, according to the OMB. McDonnell warned that U.S. debt total is on its way to "record levels." As a percentage of GDP, the total debt still has a way to go before hitting its record level of 121.7 percent in 1946. Measured only in dollars, the national debt for the most part has been rising since the end of World War II. The total national debt was $270.1 billion in 1946. It increased fairly consistently to its current level of roughly $14.3 trillion on April 30, 2011. Let’s review. McDonnell said that since the end of World War II, the national debt as a percentage of GDP went down over a roughly 30-year period until the 1980s. McDonnell is correct that the debt, when measured as a percentage of the country’s GDP, was on a downward trajectory during that time. We rate his claim True.

pomt-11278	"Black and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/25/kirsten-gillibrand/are-people-color-arrested-more-often-marijuana-new/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says legalizing marijuana would benefit communities of color, particularly in New York City. Gillibrand says people of color are arrested for marijuana possession at a much higher rate than white people, despite similar marijuana use. "Black and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage," Gillibrand tweeted. New York state is exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The state Department of Health has begun a study on how legalization would affect residents. So are blacks and Latinos arrested ten times as often as white people for marijuana? New York City data Gillibrand relied on data from a February article published by Politico New York, which cited data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. The agency provided that data to us for this article. The numbers confirm Gillibrand’s claim: Eighty-six percent of people arrested for criminal possession of marijuana in New York City last year were either black or Hispanic. Five percent were classified as "other" by the agency. Nine percent of those arrested were white. The agency tracked 17,880 total criminal marijuana arrests in New York City last year. Almost half of the people arrested — 8,565 — were black. Some 6,853 were Hispanic and 890 were identified as "other." Only 1,572 of the offenders were white. There are a few caveats to the data. For one, it doesn’t include every marijuana arrest in the city. The data only tracks arrests for burning marijuana in public or possessing more than 25 grams at a time. More severe crimes, like selling marijuana, are not included in the numbers. The data also excludes cases where a more serious crime was involved. For example, if marijuana was found on someone pulled over for driving while intoxicated, the agency would not report the drug possession in this dataset. Statewide data The gap is not as wide outside New York City, state data shows. There were 5,417 of the same type of marijuana arrests upstate and on Long Island in 2017, according to the data. Of those, about 31 percent were white, 37 percent were black, and 25 percent were Hispanic. The remaining arrests were marked as "other." That still means about two-thirds of those arrested for marijuana possession outside New York City were people of color in 2017. Marijuana use by race Gillibrand also said the rate of marijuana use is the same regardless of race. The Politico article cites data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union to support that claim. Fourteen percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites reported using marijuana in the past year in 2010, according to federal data. The ACLU analyzed data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the U.S. Census Bureau. Jon Gettman, an associate professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, used the same data to calculate more recent numbers for this article. About 14 percent of whites and 16 percent of blacks reported using marijuana in the past year in 2016. Data previously compiled by Gettman for the Brookings Institution showed the rates of use by whites and blacks have been about the same since at least 2001. Our ruling Gillibrand said blacks and Latinos in New York City are arrested at 10 times the rate of whites for marijuana possession, despite using it at about the same rate as whites. State data proves Gillibrand’s claim. Nine percent of people arrested for marijuana possession in the city last year were white versus 86 percent that were black or hispanic. Analyses of federal data also shows white people report using marijuana about as much as black people. We rate her claim True.

pomt-00886	U.S. military involvement in Libya "allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/09/rand-paul/paul-gets-it-wrong-fate-libyan-missiles/	Terrorists have thousands of dangerous missiles, and it’s former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s fault, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Paul, a potential 2016 contender, threw some jabs at Clinton in his Feb. 27 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In particular, he pointed to the United States’ military involvement in the 2011 Libyan uprising, during Clinton’s term as secretary of state. "Hillary's war in Libya is a perfect example," Paul said. "Hillary's war made us less safe. Libya's less stable, and radical jihadists run amok. They swim in our swimming pool! Hillary's war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists. As Hillary was declaring victory in Libya, Ambassador Stevens was pleading for more security." We were intrigued by Paul’s claim that radical Islamists got their hands on "thousands" of surface-to-air missiles. The United States has worked for years to destroy tens of thousands of man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) around the globe. These over-the-shoulder surface-to-air missiles are easy to transport, and they pose serious danger to both commercial and military aircraft. We found that it’s likely terrorists have acquired a few Libyan MANPADS as a result of the conflict, but experts told us that there is no way they number in the thousands, or even dozens. Moreover, experts told us U.S. military involvement isn’t to blame. American programs actually reduced by thousands the number of MANPADS accessible to terrorists. "There is currently insufficient evidence to support the claim that radical Islamist groups have obtained ‘thousands’ of Libyan MANPADS," said Jeremy Binnie, the Middle East/Africa editor for Jane’s Defense Weekly. Where did they go? The 2011 U.S.-backed Libyan uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled the decades-long dictator Col. Muammar Gaddafi. At the time, the State Department estimated that Gaddafi had amassed about 20,000 MANPADS over 40 years. Paul's office sent us news reports from 2011 regarding the many MANPADS that went missing during the conflict; most were looted or destroyed. There was real concern that they would end up in the hands of terrorists. Three years later, a United Nations Panel of Experts report found: "Fears that terrorist groups would acquire these weapons have materialized." According to the report, Libyan MANPADS are known to have been smuggled into Chad, Lebanon, Mali and Tunisia, and authorities seized some found on a boat headed to Syrian insurgents. It’s also possible, but unconfirmed, that they’ve made their way to Egypt and Gaza. The MANPADS found in Mali and Tunisia were confirmed to be part of terrorists’ arsenals. But the idea that terrorists even had access to "thousands" of operable MANPADS is inexplicable, experts told us. First, Libya’s 20,000 MANPADS were amassed over 40 years. The U.N. report said only some would still be usable today, despite their age. Others were acquired in pieces and cannot be reassembled because they are missing key components, said William Lawrence, a professor at George Washington University's Elliott School, who previously worked at the United States Embassy in Tripoli, Libya. The missiles destined for Syria, for example, did not include launchers. Also, some of the weapons were controlled by anti-Gaddafi rebels, whom the U.S. supported, Lawrence added. As for the claim that U.S. military involvement is somehow to blame for any missiles falling into the wrong hands, Libyan rebels were seen with looted MANPADS before the United States got involved in March 2011, Binnie said. There is a long paper trail of America’s role in drastically reducing Libya’s MANPADS arsenal. The United States military spent about $2 billion and several months in Libya as part of a U.N.-sanctioned NATO coalition intent on toppling Gaddafi. In the mission, NATO airstrikes destroyed Libyan weapons depots, and in the process, according to the administration, eliminated thousands of MANPADS. Further, a major aspect of the United States’ diplomatic mission in Libya was a $40 million program to aid the U.S.-backed transitional government in regaining control over Libya’s weapons -- MANPADS in particular. The program -- which one State Department official called "the most extensive effort to combat the proliferation of MANPADS in U.S. history" -- recovered more than 5,000 Libyan MANPADS. According to the State Department, getting rid of Libya’s MANPADS were part of diplomatic discussions with Libya long before the 2011 uprising. So let’s review: Of those 20,000 MANPADS -- the United States recovered 5,000, NATO destroyed thousands, the U.S.-backed transitional government acquired many, and many are inoperable. While we know terrorists got their hands on a few, it’s highly unlikely that they have "thousands." A line in the U.N. report Though the evidence overwhelmingly is against Paul, one line in the U.N. report threw us a curveball: "Panel sources stated that thousands of MANPADS were still available in arsenals controlled by a wide array of non-state actors with tenuous or non-existent links to Libyan national authorities." If thousands of MANPADS are still in the hands of "non-state actors," could that mean thousands are available to terrorists? Not likely, Binnie said. While Libya has some radical Islamic non-state actors, the county also has numerous local tribes and militias (who aren’t terrorists) that formed during the uprisings who likely stockpiled MANPADS. "While Ansar al-Sharia and other radical groups affiliated to the Islamic State are operating in Libya, they remain very much a minority," Binnie said. It’s also worth noting that there have been no documented instances of a shootdown using Libyan MANPADS since the 2011 conflict, said Karim Mezran, senior fellow at the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. "The Islamist groups have been bombed from the air daily in the last six months," Mezran said. "If they have thousands (of MANPADS) why haven't they used them so far?" Our ruling Paul said that U.S. military involvement in Libya "allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists." Experts told us that even though some terrorists are known to have a few Libyan surface-to-air missiles, the idea that they have "thousands" is extremely unlikely. While many of Libya’s 20,000 surface-to-air missiles went missing during the conflict, thousands more were destroyed, recovered, rendered inoperable or believed to be in the hands of militias that aren’t radical Islamic terrorists. It’s also incorrect to say the United States’ military involvement caused these missiles to go missing. The weapon looting began before the United States and NATO showed up. And when they showed up, they destroyed or recovered many thousands. It’s arguable that American involvement had the exact opposite effect than what Paul asserts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-00025	"Judicial Watch reports show 1.7 million California votes are not registered voters!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/false-facebook-post-claims-millions-fraudulent-vot/	A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims that more than a million votes tallied in California were cast by unregistered voters, before the polls were even closed on Election Day. The post attributed the data to findings by the conservative group Judicial Watch. We reached out to Judicial Watch, which denied any affiliation with the post. "Not ours," said Jill Farrell, a Judicial Watch spokesperson. "Just some random person misinterpreting." Farrell suggested the post may have been a botched interpretation of a lawsuit Judicial Watch brought against the state of California and Los Angeles County. The litigation centers on California’s handling of state voter rolls, which contain a large number of voters who are considered "inactive." Registered voters may be rendered inactive if official election materials like a mail ballot or voter guide are sent and returned as undeliverable. According to our friends at Snopes, estimates do show some California counties list more registered voters on their rolls than eligible adults, though some argue the methodology underlying this count is dubious. The merits of the legal arguments are beyond the scope of this fact-check. What’s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes. Judicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk. The group does not claim more than a million fraudulent votes were cast in California, as this Facebook post states. At the time the post was circulated, the votes had not even been tallied yet.

pomt-08473	Just like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, "the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/12/george-will/george-will-claims-afl-cio-receives-dues-foreign-e/	The Obama administration has continued to speculate about foreign money being used to fund attack ads against Democrats -- and last week President Barack Obama offered Exhibit A: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations," Obama said at a campaign stop on Oct. 7, 2010. "So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections. And they won't tell you where the money (for) their ads comes from." As ABC's This Week host Christiane Amanpour played a clip of the president's remark during the Oct. 10, 2010, program, she noted that conservative George Will, a panelist on This Week, was shaking his head in frustration. "Well, he won't tell us who he's talking about," Will said. "He's talking about the Chamber of Commerce, which does indeed receive dues from foreign entities that are associated with American business, just as the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it. And the shock and awe that we're supposed to feel from this is somewhat selective." We looked at the president's half of this exchange in a separate item, and rated his claim about the Chamber -- that "groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections" -- Half True. Here, we'll examine Will's comment that just like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, "the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it." The Chamber and the AFL-CIO have very different perspectives in the political debate. The Chamber of Commerce predominantly supports Republican candidates, while the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions, almost exclusively backs Democrats. Will's statement is technically true, said AFL-CIO spokesman Eddie Vale, but requires some caveats. The AFL-CIO (it stands for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) is a federation of dozens of unions, so it doesn't have individual members in and of itself. The members belong to unions which in turn are members of the AFL-CIO. And some of the AFL-CIO's affiliates do have Canadian members -- most notably the United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers unions. Those union affiliates pass through a portion of the dues they collect from American members to the AFL-CIO, but not from their foreign members, said Vale. "We don't take money at the national level from foreign members," Vale said. There's another big difference in disclosure requirements between unions and groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While FEC and IRS laws do not require unions to disclose donors -- just as they do not require disclosure of donors to trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- unions are subject to the Labor Management Relations Act, which requires public disclosure of payments over $5,000 to unions. So you can go to the Department of Labor's website and search the contributions to (and disbursements made by) the AFL-CIO and other unions in any given year. "Our information, people can see it," Vale said. Politico's Ben Smith did a good explainer of all this, challenging a twitter message posted by Jim Dyke, one of the GOP consultants on the board of the conservative group American Crossroads, which stated, "[U]nions are [501](c)(5)s and don’t disclose...is that the business as usual? Or does that make them shadowy?" Smith concluded that unions have to disclose significant contributions, while some of the most politically active groups such as the Chamber of Commerce do not. Vale would not say how much the AFL-CIO is spending on ads in this year's mid-term elections, but he said the federation spent about $50 million in the 2006 midterm elections. This time around, he said, the AFL-CIO is active in campaigns in about 26 states, particularly in California, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Ohio. We e-mailed Will about Vale's characterization of the funding for the AFL-CIO and he responded, "Although I am content to have my statement assessed as 'technically true' --which is to say: true--I would add this from the October 8 New York Times:'Organizations from both ends of the political spectrum, from liberal ones like the AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club to conservative groups like the National Rifle Association, have international affiliations and get money from foreign entities while at the same time pushing political causes in the United States.'" So disclosure requirements for unions are different than "Super PACs" such as Crossroads GPS or trade associations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which essentially have none). But Will didn't broach the disclosure issue in his statement about the AFL-CIO. He said only that the AFL-CIO "receives dues from foreign entities associated with it" just like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce does. It's true that some individual members affiliated with the AFL-CIO collect dues from foreign (Canadian) residents. And those unions pay dues to the AFL-CIO. But according to the AFL-CIO, the dues collected from non-U.S. workers are not passed up to the national AFL-CIO. And so we rate Will's comment Half True.

pomt-10421	"Sen. Obama has declared, and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/21/john-mccain/he-has-said-it-again-and-again/	The issue of whether or not to meet diplomatically with the leaders of enemy nations is clearly shaping into an important wedge issue in the presidential campaign. Sen. John McCain has hammered Sen. Barack Obama for saying he would meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is well known for his anti-America, anti-Israel rhetoric. "Sen. Obama has declared, and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions, likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union," McCain said in remarks before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008. McCain argues this position "betrays the depth of Sen. Obama's inexperience and reckless judgment." While McCain has criticized Obama's approach of meeting with leaders of isolated nations in general, McCain has particularly singled out Ahmadinejad. "What does he (Obama) want to talk about with Ahmadinejad, who said that Israel is a stinking corpse?" McCain asked. "Who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, who is sending the most explosive devices into Iraq killing Americans. What does he want to talk about?" Perhaps sensing political vulnerability on the issue, McCain's campaign fired off a number of press releases accusing the Obama campaign of trying to back off Obama's stated position. When asked in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer how Obama could defend meeting without preconditions with Ahmadinejad, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, Susan Rice, said Obama had promised only that he'd meet with the appropriate Iranian leadership "not necessarily Ahmadinejad." More fuel was added to the debate when Joe Klein of Time magazine wrote in his blog that he could find no instance where Obama said he would negotiate specifically, by name, with Ahmadinejad. "He (Obama) did say that he would negotiate with the Iranian leadership -- but, on matters of foreign policy and Iran's nuclear program, the guy in charge is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei," Klein noted. "Why doesn't the McCain campaign and other assorted Republicans ever accuse Obama of wanting to negotiate with Khamenei? Well, because Khamenei isn't quite the flagrant anti-Semite Ahmadinejad is ... and, as we keep hearing, Obama has a Jewish problem." To be sure, when Obama raises this issue -- which he does often on the stump -- he usually says, generically, that he will meet diplomatically with the "leaders" of America's enemies. For example, when asked in a press conference in Watertown, S.D., on May 16, 2008, about the McCain campaign accusing him of trying to distance himself from comments about meeting with the leaders of rogue nations, Obama said he hasn't distanced himself at all. "I say that in every town hall meeting that we have and every rally," Obama said. "What I have said is that I will meet with not just our allies and our friends but I will initiate tough diplomacy with our enemies. That includes Syria, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. I would meet with them and I would meet with them without preconditions although with preparation. I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior. If it was in the case of Iran, stop threatening Israel, stand down on nuclear weapons development; stop funding Hamas and Hezbollah and stop stirring up problems inside of Iraq. If they are willing to change behavior, then, we would offer inducements and benefits diplomatically. If they don't, we will continue to ratchet sanctions and isolations on Iran. That has been a consistent policy that I have presented throughout. There are no contradictions. I have no idea where it is that they are suggesting that somehow there has been a change in policy. But has Obama said specifically that he'd meet with Ahmadinejad? We could find no public statements where Obama neatly says, "I will meet with Ahmadinejad." But we believe there are some instances where that was the substance of Obama's words. One example came in a press conference in New York City on Sept. 24, 2007. Question: "Senator, you've said before that you'd meet with President Ahmadinejad. … Would you still meet with him today?" "Nothing's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries," Obama responded. "I find many of President Ahmadinejad's statements odious and I've said that repeatedly. And I think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that don't have American interests at heart. But what I also believe is that, as John F. Kennedy said, we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate. And by us listening to the views even of those who we violently disagree with – that sends a signal to the world that we are going to turn the page on the failed diplomacy that the Bush Administration has practiced for so long." The McCain campaign provided snippets of news accounts of that press conference that left little doubt how the press interpreted Obama's comments at the time. Check out these headlines: "Obama Stood His Ground Monday On His Controversial Remarks Earlier This Year That He Would Meet With Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad" (from CNN); and "Obama: I Would Still Meet With Ahmadinejad" (from CBS News). In a Nov. 11, 2007, interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Obama again mentioned Ahmadinejad when discussing his open-door policy. "Part of the reason it's important for us to talk to countries we don't like and leaders we don't like, it's not that I think that in a conversation with somebody like Ahmadinejad that I'm going to somehow change his mind on everything, but what we do is, we send a signal to other leadership in Iran, to the Iranian people and to the world community that we are listening and that we are willing to try to resolve conflicts peacefully." Host Tim Russert asked if Obama was afraid of being used in a propaganda way. "I've got to say I'm not afraid of losing a propaganda war to somebody like Ahmadinejad," Obama said. "You know, strong countries and strong presidents speak with their adversaries." In those contexts, Obama clearly counts Ahmadinejad among those with whom he would meet.

pomt-07801	"We have 80,000 abortions in Texas every year."	true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/18/dan-patrick/state-sen-dan-patrick-says-80000-abortions-are-per/	UPDATE, 11 a.m., July 11, 2013: More than two years after this fact check was completed, we rated as Mostly False a claim that more than 80,000 abortions annually occur in Texas. This rating traced to state-collected data indicating 72,470 abortions occurred in Texas in 2011, down from some 77,000 abortions reported for 2010. See that full article here. We did not change this Truth-O-Meter story, which reflects abortion counts and other information available at the time Dan Patrick made his claim. Answering colleagues’ questions about his proposal to require women seeking an abortion to first get a sonogram, state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, said: "We have 80,000 abortions in Texas every year." Last month, we rated True Gov. Rick Perry’s statement at a Texas Rally for Life that there have been 50 million abortions nationally since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states cannot prohibit abortions before the point at which a fetus can survive outside a woman’s body. We decided to check Patrick’s statement, too. Donna Bahorich, a Patrick spokeswoman, pointed us to a web page about abortions in Texas on the Texas Department of State Health Services website. The Texas Abortion Facility Reporting and Licensing Act requires every abortion facility in the state to submit an annual report to the department on each pregnancy terminated at the facility, according to the page, which was updated in July. In 2007, 81,079 induced abortions were reported to the agency. Carrie Williams, a DSHS spokeswoman, pointed us to more recent data that showed a slight uptick in abortions in Texas in 2008: 81,591. According to the department, 78,330 of those abortions were performed on Texas residents, and 2,974 were performed on residents from out of state or another country. Next, we turned to the respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. According to a 2011 fact sheet prepared and posted online by the institute, 579,700 of 5.1 million women of reproductive age in Texas became pregnant in 2008. Seventy percent of those pregnancies resulted in live births, the sheet says, and 15 percent in induced abortions. That year, the sheet says, 84,610 women obtained abortions in Texas — a rate of 16.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age. The sheet cautions: "Some of these women were from other states, and some Texas residents had abortions in other states, so this rate may not reflect the abortion rate of state residents." The sheet also says the 2008 Texas abortion rate was down 4 percent from the 2005 rate. In 2008, according to the institute, abortions in Texas represent 7 percent of all abortions in the United States — 1.2 million American women obtained abortions that year. Finally, we wondered whether 80,000 abortions are performed in Texas every year, as Patrick says — not just the most recent year. According to a January Guttmacher report on abortion trends in Texas from 1973-2008, abortions increased from a low of less than 20,000 in 1973 to a peak of more than 100,000 in 1981. The report shows a downward trend since then. According to the Department of State Health Services, 82,056 induced abortions were reported in 2006, 77,374 in 2005, 75,053 in 2004, 79,166 in 2003, 79,929 in 2002 and 77,537 in 2001. So, per the latest available data, Patrick is close. We rate his statement as True.	None	Dan Patrick	None	None	None	2011-02-18T06:00:00	2011-02-17	['Texas']
pomt-06781	U.S. debt is "now equal to 100 percent of the GDP."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/18/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-debt-now-matches-size-gros/	Rob Portman knows his budget facts. That’s one reason the Ohio freshman U.S. senator, a former White House budget director, was appointed on Aug. 10, 2011, to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the 12-member congressional panel charged with trimming future budgets by up to $1.5 trillion. In commenting on his appointment that day, Portman issued a statement with a budget fact that struck us as curious. He said, "I am honored to answer the call to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and will work hard to ensure that meaningful spending cuts are made to reduce our deficits, change the trajectory of Washington's record high debt, and to encourage economic growth and job creation. With the U.S. debt now equal to 100 percent of the GDP, Washington cannot continue to kick the can down the road again." Had the federal debt really matched the gross domestic product? The GDP measures all the goods and services produced here. Add it all up and you know the size of the nation’s economy. News stories have reported over the last year that if the government didn’t make spending cuts or come up with more tax revenue, if not both, the debt load would match and exceed GDP eventually. Have we already reached that debt-GDP match point? No. Portman press secretary Christine Mangi said the source of the senator’s claim was a wire service report by Agence France-Presse, or AFP, whose stories are published in newspapers and on the Web. On Aug. 3, using figures for new borrowing as soon as Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the nation’s debt ceiling, AFP reported: "U.S. gross debt shot up $238 billion to reach 100 percent of gross domestic product after the government's debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury figures showed." This new borrowing, the wire report said, "took total public debt to $14.58 trillion, over end-2010 GDP of $14.53 trillion, putting the United States in a league with highly indebted countries like Italy and Belgium." We checked those figures. The GDP number used by the wire service was solid -- but out of date. The figure came from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA, whose estimates put the economy’s size last year at $14.5265 trillion. Here’s the problem: That was GDP for 2010. It has grown since then. GDP was $15.0038 trillion in the second quarter of this year, the most recent measurement available, according to the BEA. Comparing GDP with debt, we ran the numbers a couple of other ways, using both old and newer BEA figures for GDP and the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" website for specific debt figures. If you wanted to use 2010 GDP, a fairer comparison would be to measure gross debt on Dec. 31, 2010, which was equal to 96.5 percent of the GDP. That’s high, of course, and it prompted concerns about spending and revenues. But it was not seen as a doomsday trigger. So what was the ratio of debt to GDP when Portman made his comment? The closest calculation possible, using confirmed government figures, is made by comparing GDP for the second quarter of 2011 ($15.0038 trillion) with gross debt ( $14.5819 trillion) on Aug. 10, the day of Portman’s statement. That puts the gross debt at 97.2 percent of GDP. Since Portman relied on the AFP story of a week earlier, we compared the debt on that day, too, and got the same result: Gross debt was 97.2 percent of GDP. Is this too much quibbling over less than 3 percentage points? If this were baseball, the statistical equivalent would be to celebrate Barry Bonds making the 3,000-hit club when he hit still had 85 hits to go; in the end, he never made the record. (All other parallels between big numbers and disgrace are strictly incidental.) But in finance, the distance is not as great. The International Monetary Fund said last year that total debt could match the size of the GDP by 2012, according to Bloomberg, the financial wire service. House Speaker John Boehner made the same prediction, and PolitiFact called it accurate. If anything, the likelihood of the gross debt hitting 100 percent of GDP this calendar year (but in the 2012 fiscal year, which starts in October) has since grown. That’s because the debt is still rising at what is likely to be a faster pace than economic growth, which is torpid. "I imagine it will happen sometime in early FY2012," Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us. So Portman was off but "pretty darn close, given the information we have," Peuquet said. Still, there’s a caveat: This gross debt that he spoke about is not the scary part to many economists. More important, they say, is the portion of debt that’s owed to the public. This is the pool of Treasury securities that the government sells to investors, and it was $9.916 trillion the day Portman made his statement. Measured against the size of the economy, that comes to 66 percent of GDP. It’s the highest level since shortly after World War II, when the nation was paying off war debts. In a worst-case scenario, with continuation of current tax rates and no change in spending policies, the public debt could exceed GDP by 2021, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in June. That’s the doomsday scenario. But the CBO’s more likely scenario would put the public debt at 70 percent in 2020. The rest of the debt -- $4.67 trillion -- is intra-governmental lending, including Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. The money will have to be paid back, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. That’s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what’s most important for understanding the government’s fiscal health, says Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group. The CBO was matter-of-fact about it in a report last December: "Gross debt is not a good indicator of the government’s fiscal condition." With that bit of background, we return to Portman. PolitiFact has discussed the debt’s components before, and economists have said that it’s important to distinguish between the two kinds of debt. But they also say it is not inaccurate -- depending on the context -- to put the two together in order to discuss the gross debt, and that’s what Portman did. Given his stated interest in dealing with long-term budget matters including entitlements, it’s not unreasonable for him to talk about the gross debt. Where does that leave us? Portman said the "U.S. debt is now equal to 100 percent of the GDP." It is not, but "he’s pretty darn close, given the information we have," says Peuquet. Before we rate Portman’s claim, we’ll note that Mangi, Portman’s press secretary, offered still another way of calculating the debt-to-GDP ratio. Although we quibble with this methodology because it still uses outdated numbers, this took the percentage to 98.5 percent, very close to the 97.2 percent figure we got. Mangi then offered an additional argument to push the percentage past 100: Add in all the debt held by state and local governments, too, "because the United States government includes federal, state and local governments," she said. Put all that debt together and it already exceeds 100 percent of GDP. Problem is, local and state debt are not part of the broad, divisive debate that led to creation of the new super committee. Portman’s committee is dealing with federal deficits and debt, not the debt of Parma. And when Portman said "the U.S. debt now equals 100 percent of the GDP," it was clear -- as it has been from weeks of debate in Washington -- which debt he meant. The gross debt hasn’t reached 100 percent, but it will. Portman’s statement is not 100 percent accurate, but at 97 percent-plus, it’s close enough to merit a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-04344	Says Connie Mack’s Penny Plan would cut "over $200 billion out of Medicare, over $1 trillion out of Social Security. ... $3 trillion out of defense."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/24/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-macks-penny-plan-would-lea/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, says his plan to balance the federal budget is so simple it comes down to a penny. But Mack’s Senate rival, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, said that the Penny Plan would lead to massive cuts in entitlements and defense. "He has a Penny Plan that would absolutely eviscerate Medicare and Social Security," Nelson said during an Oct. 17 debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. "Over $200 billion out of Medicare. Over a trillion out of Social Security. And we are going to release tonight the impartial nonpartisan Congressional Research Service study that shows how he absolutely savages Medicare, Social Security and oh by the way to boot ... $3 trillion out of defense. That is what his Penny Plan is." We wanted to check to see if Nelson accurately characterized the impact of Mack’s Penny Plan on Medicare, Social Security and defense. We’ve looked at Mack’s Penny Plan before when Mack said his plan "would balance our budget by 2019" and "continues to gain support." We rated that claim Half True.You can read that check for a longer analysis of the Penny Plan, but we will include the highlights here. By the numbers Mack got the idea for H.R. 1848, the One Percent Spending Reduction Act from the One Cent Solution. The founder, Bruce Cook, is a businessman from Georgia and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The One Cent Solution even has a rap to promote its message. The math works like this: For six years, the federal government would reduce spending by 1 percent each year. In the seventh year, funding would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic product, which measures the size of the overall economy. By the eighth year, the plan would balance the budget and save $7.5 trillion over 10 years. If Congress and the president couldn’t reach an agreement about what to cut, the plan would trigger automatic across-the-board spending cuts. A mailer Mack sent this year stated the plan would balance the budget by 2019, while a Mack congressional staffer told us based on the latest figures it would do the trick by 2017. To give you an idea of how dramatic this is, Paul Ryan’s budget plan wouldn’t balance the budget for nearly three decades, until 2040. Mack introduced his bill in the House on May 11, 2011. It was referred to committees and introduced in the Senate on June 30. Since then, it has seen no official action. Experts said Mack’s math was right, but plan avoids the tough questions Earlier this year, we asked several federal budget experts from across the political spectrum about Mack’s Penny Plan. They generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget. But they said the challenge is how do you get there: Do you cut everything by 1 percent or cut some more than others? Mack’s plan lacks that specific guidance other than saying that would be in the hands of lawmakers and the president to sort out. "The numbers work, but they have to be made effective by policy changes," said J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The easiest part legislatively is the targets, and you have to have those, but then you still need to finish the job." Most notably, the bill doesn’t explain how it would adjust Medicare and Social Security to make up for the expected growth as Baby Boomers retire. We asked Mack’s congressional office if Mack supports cutting peoples’ Social Security 1 percent a year for six years. Their statement: "The Penny Plan sets a framework for reducing spending. It will be up to Congress and the president to work together to determine how best to achieve those spending reductions." Michael Linden, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, called Mack’s plan "ridiculous." He noted that the plan could mean an even larger cut than 1 percent for each senior, since the number of seniors getting Social Security will increase. And if Social Security and Medicare were off the table, that would remove about 35 percent of non-interest spending from the chopping block, leaving bigger cuts elsewhere. CRS study After we published that fact-check, U.S. Sen. Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont, asked the Congressional Research Service to analyze the impact of Mack’s Penny Plan on Medicare and Social Security. The Oct. 4, 2012, report explained that the plan would establish caps on federal outlays, and enforce those caps through a sequestration process which can force automatic cuts if lawmakers can’t reach an agreement. The report laid out in detail how those cuts would be applied if they were implemented across all programs. The bottom line, according to the report: Mack’s plan would lead to about $2.89 trillion in defense cuts and $2.89 trillion in non-defense programs between 2013-22. The cuts would include about $211 billion for Medicare and about $1.124 billion for Social Security. Experts weigh in on CRS study We sent Nelson’s claim and the study to several experts including Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; Alan Viard, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute; and Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Viard told us in an email that it appears the Congressional Research Service correctly outlined how sequestration would work. Still, Congress and the president could avoid the amount of the cuts cited by Nelson if they agree to larger spending cuts elsewhere. But no matter how you slice it, to achieve the bill’s spending caps would "require gigantic reductions in federal spending, relative to the baseline," he wrote. "There is no prospect that cuts of this magnitude could ever be adopted." Peuquet reached a similar conclusion: "There is no doubt this plan would put into place pretty large reductions in spending across across the board to control the deficit and debt." The Mack campaign said the CRS findings were just "one opinion" and reiterated their previous claims that the plan would work to reduce federal spending. The campaign also highlighted one sentence from our earlier fact-check: "Our experts generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget." Our ruling Nelson said during the debate that Connie Mack’s Penny Plan would cut more than $200 billion in Medicare, $1 trillion in Social Security and $3 trillion in defense. Nelson relied on a study from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It found that Mack’s plan, if implemented across all programs, would cut $211 billion in Medicare, $1.124 trillion in Social Security and $2.89 trillion in defense. During the debate Nelson didn’t mention the timeframe for those cuts: 2013-2022, as mentioned in the study. The study makes some assumptions and is based on current economic projections. The reductions to Medicare, Social Security and defense might not ultimately occur if Congress and the president could agree to other specific cuts. But we will repeat what our expert from the conservative organization said: "Any method of meeting the bill’s spending caps would require gigantic reductions in federal spending, relative to the baseline. There is no prospect that cuts of this magnitude could ever be adopted." Nelson’s claim requires some explanation about the plan and its timeline, but his numbers are correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2012-10-24T14:13:51	2012-10-17	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-04008	"Washington, D.C., now has greater population than Wyoming and Vermont, more active duty military than 29 states, more tax revenue than 29 states (and) a larger domestic product than 27 states."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/06/facebook-posts/dc-voting-rights-post-offers-hit-and-miss-data/	For decades, residents of Washington, D.C., have been clamoring for representation in Congress. Currently, the nation’s capital has only a non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives and no U.S. senators. The issue has been such a frustration that D.C. license plates feature the protest motto, "Taxation Without Representation." It’s against this backdrop that we noticed a Facebook post recently. Here’s the text: "Washington, D.C., now has: "Greater population than Wyoming & Vermont "More active duty military than 29 states "More tax revenue than 29 states "A larger domestic product than 27 states "But no vote on the floor of the House OR the Senate? "What’s up with that?" We wondered how accurate the post’s claims were, so we took a look. We’ll take them in order. • Greater population than Wyoming and Vermont This one’s true, as long as you use 2012 population estimates rather than the last full Census count in 2010. (D.C.’s population grew quickly within that two-year span.) In 2012, the district was estimated to have 632,323 residents, putting it ahead of Vermont at 626,011 and Wyoming at 576,412, but no other state. • More active duty military than 29 states The most recent data we found was for 2009, and it shows that the Facebook post actually underestimated the nation’s capital. There are 31 states that had fewer active duty military personnel than D.C. (This may not be too surprising, given that the Pentagon is just across the river in Virginia.) • More tax revenue than 29 states The U.S. Census Bureau ranks all 50 states by tax revenue collected, but it doesn’t include D.C. However, we were able to find the D.C. data separately, in a D.C. government document. Meshing the data together, we found that D.C. total tax revenue for fiscal year 2011 was higher than 14 states, not 29 states. So this claim is incorrect. • A larger gross domestic product than 27 states Data from the U.S. Commerce Department shows that for fiscal year 2011, the district only outranked 17 states with a smaller gross domestic product than D.C. So this statistic is off the mark as well. Our ruling We found that the Facebook post was accurate in describing D.C.’s ranking in population and active-duty military personnel, but significantly off in describing tax revenues and gross domestic product. That said, D.C.’s actual rankings -- higher than 14 states in tax revenues and higher than 17 states in gross domestic product -- do support the post’s underlying point that many smaller states have congressional representation when D.C. does not. On balance, we rate the post Half True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2013-02-06T15:54:40	2013-02-06	['Wyoming', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-04553	"Barack Hussein Obama will … force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/27/government-not-god-pac/ad-claims-obama-will-force-doctors-assist-homosexu/	A fact-challenged newspaper ad attacking President Barack Obama addresses some standard wedge issues: same-sex marriage, illegal immigration, Islamic law. Then there’s this claim: "Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies." It’s one of those statements that’s so far outside reality, our experts wondered where to start. William Murray, chairman of the political action committee that says it placed the ad in 19 papers in three states, said it predicted "what we believe Obama will do in a second term." But even predictions require some connection to the way the world works. This fails that test. ‘Outrageous,’ ‘imaginary,’ ‘fevered dream’ Volunteers for Murray’s Government Is Not God PAC put together support for the ad’s claims, which they sent to us. The evidence? That Obama supports adoption by same-sex couples and extended benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees. But that didn't come close to proving the claim. The links don’t address: a) doctors b) surrogacy c) buying babies. Nor do they address whether Obama would be interested in such an action. And a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians hasn’t seen any such evidence. "We cannot find any remotely related action or statement by the president or his administration that would lead anyone to such an outrageous conclusion," said Brian Moulton, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign. Experts in surrogacy from a medical perspective had a similar reaction. "We have no idea what this claim is based on," said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. But even if Obama were interested, he would find a nearly impossible task (short of, say, suspending the rule of law). Whether surrogacy is legal is a matter of state law, not federal. In the District of Columbia, for example, attorneys could serve jail time for helping write a contract between prospective parents and a woman who wants to carry their child. In other states, surrogacy varies from perfectly legal to functionally impossible, according to a summary of state regulation from Maryland law firm Creative Family Connections. Michael Tanner, an expert in health care policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that even if the Obama administration managed to require non-discriminatory coverage for artificial reproductive technology in its health care law, doctors don’t have to accept insurance, and they don’t have to perform procedures. "They can't supersede the surrogacy laws. They can't force physicians," he said. "... That has got to be the most bizarre claim I have ever seen in my life." He called it "a fevered dream." Jonathan Rauch, author of Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America, and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution told us, "Even a sane version of this claim is imaginary." Our ruling A newspaper ad claimed that "Barack Hussein Obama will … force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies." There’s no evidence Obama is interested in such a requirement. But even if he were, surrogacy laws vary by state and there’s no mechanism to force doctors to perform a procedure. Experts found this claim "outrageous," "imaginary," and a "fevered dream." We find it Pants on Fire.	None	Government is Not God PAC	None	None	None	2012-09-27T17:16:46	2012-09-23	['None']

pomt-09159	"Fulton County has successfully reduced the number of pregnancies" among 15- to 19-year-olds.	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/09/fulton-county-government/fulton-county-says-teen-pregnancy-down/	As part of Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month, Fulton County hosted a day of awareness events May 27 at the Neighborhood Union Health Center in Vine City. A news release announcing the effort said the following: "Fulton County has successfully reduced the number of pregnancies among 15-19 year olds [sic] in the County. The number of teen pregnancies dropped from 2,608 in the year 2000 to 1,831 in 2006." In the spirit of the awareness campaign, we at PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Fulton County's news release. Fulton County teen pregnancies are indeed down. Way down. Between 2000 and 2006, the number of pregnancies among Fulton County females age 15 through 19 dropped just as the news release stated -- about 30 percent. In fact, the figures Fulton County published downplay the decrease. Consider its pregnancy rate, a measurement that takes into account changes in population size. When you use this figure, the drop is even more dramatic. In 2000, the rate was 97.1. per 1,000 females in the specified age group. By 2006 it was 58.1 -- a decrease of about 40 percent. But is this truly a "success," as the news release said? "Success" suggests to us that the decrease is unique or greater than average. For instance, if Fulton teenage pregnancy dropped 30 percent while the state's rate dropped by 90 percent, Fulton's decrease would look more like failure than success. "Success" also implies that county government had something to do with it. The claim was made in a Fulton County news release, after all. To determine whether Fulton's decrease in teen pregnancy is unusual, we looked at county, state and national statistics for females 15 through 19 between 2000 and 2006. Nationally, the pregnancy rate for teens dropped from 48 to 42 per 1,000, or 12.5 percent. Across Georgia, the drop was about 14 percent -- 81.3 to 67.6 per 1,000. For Georgia's nonrural counties, it fell from 79 to 66 per 1,000, or about 16 percent. In the metro area, Clayton County (at 83.4 per 1,000), DeKalb County (at 67.5 per 1,000) and Gwinnett County (at 62.1 per 1,000) all had higher pregnancy rates in 2006. And while Cobb County's pregnancy rate was lower than Fulton's at 51.5 per 1,000, its decrease between 2000 and 2006 was less than half of Fulton's, at about 17 percent. There you go. Fulton County's 40 percent drop was unique. Now, did Fulton County government have anything to do with it? Probably. We interviewed three experts who said it is extremely difficult to measure the exact effect of a community's teen pregnancy prevention efforts. However, it's reasonable to assume that a county that implements programs with a proven record of success has something to do with the drop in the pregnancy rate. Fulton does a share of that work. For years, it has provided pregnancy tests, contraceptives, counseling, health education classes, abstinence-based education, community outreach and five health centers that focus on adolescent health and development. Nongovernment organizations in Fulton do a lot, also. Grady Memorial Hospital, which is located in Fulton County, provides clinical services and outreach. Its clinic saw just under 2,000 teens in 2009. Its educational outreach program reached 3,000 teens. The Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University develops and researches successful sex education methods and disseminates information to teens and professionals. While Grady, the Jane Fonda Center and other resources have likely played a major role in the reduction of teenage pregnancy rates, it's fair to give credit to Fulton County as well. We rate its claim as True.	None	Fulton County Government	None	None	None	2010-06-09T06:00:00	2010-05-26	['None']
pomt-05351	"The expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts ... would be the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, about $4.6 trillion over 10 years."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/may/11/charles-bass/expiration-bush-tax-cuts-largest-increase/	U.S. Rep. Charles Bass sees a perfect financial storm looming. Meeting last month with The Telegraph editorial board, Bass, a New Hampshire Republican, ran through the list of upcoming votes that could divide Congress and American taxpayers over the coming months. "We now have a sequester of about $1 trillion hanging over our heads at the end of the year," Bass said in the April 3 meeting, referring to mandatory cuts that will take effect if Congress doesn't act. He added, "We have the payroll tax issue to address. We have the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, all of them, which, if un-extended, would be the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, about $4.6 trillion over 10 years." There is certainly no shortage of major votes facing Congress as the fall election approaches. But, are Americans really facing the biggest tax hike in history? We decided to crunch the numbers. Bass is hardly the first politician to make the claim. When the Bush tax cuts were last up for renewal in 2010, it became a rallying cry of sorts for Congressional Republicans and news entities alike. Former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a similar claim that year when she appeared on Fox News Sunday. PolitiFact ruled the claim "Pants On Fire" at the time because she was wrong about the ranking and also incorrectly described the Democrats' plans. And the numbers haven’t changed much since. Estimates vary as to how much taxes would rise if the Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire fully. Congress approved the tax breaks in 2001 through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and adjusted them in 2003 through the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010, because they passed Congress through a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. But, after a heated debate, lawmakers voted in 2010 to extend them for two more years. Some tax analysts have argued that, because the tax cuts were intended to be temporary, their expiration does not count as a tax increase. But, we’ll leave that argument for another day. Most estimates for the increase caused by repealing the tax cuts hover around $3.7 trillion over 10 years, the number represented in the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget and Economic outlook from January. (The number is listed under the category of "extend certain income tax and estate and gift tax," though analysts assure us that it refers to the Bush tax cuts). In his statement, however, Bass included not just the $3.7 trillion estimate, but an additional $900 billion from the Alternative Minimum Tax, another level of income tax set to expire at the end of this year. "The expiration of just those two measures results in income tax brackets rising at all levels," Bass spokesman Stephanie DuBois wrote in an e-mail to The Telegraph. In hard dollars, the total $4.6 trillion figure would rank among the highest tax increase in history, analysts say. But, through the lens of the Gross Domestic Product -- the only true way to assess tax increases in an apples to apples way, according to analysts -- the Bush tax cuts don’t measure up. Spread out over the next 10 years, the $4.6 trillion tax increase would amount to about 2.25 percent of the total GDP. We calculated that figure, with help from several tax analysts, by adding together the Budget Office’s projected GDP figures over the next 10 years, 2013-2022, and dividing it by the $4.6 trillion figure. The result is higher than most tax increases in recent history, according to a U.S. treasury department report, released in 2006, which analyzes all tax provisions since 1940. According to the report, the Bush tax cuts have held a higher percentage of the GDP than many of the biggest tax laws in recent history. It beats out the the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which measured in at 1.23 percent of GDP by the time all its provisions went into effect in 1986. It also measures larger than the Revenue Act of 1941, which at $3.6 billion, amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP. Yet, according to the treasury department analysis, the Bush tax cuts fall well below the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. This would make the Bush tax cuts, should they expire, the second largest tax increase in history, as a percentage of GDP. "There is no doubt, if all the (Bush) tax cuts were allowed to expire, this would have a very big impact," said Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, and author of the blog TaxVox.org.. "But, if you’re asking the question, would it be the largest tax increase ever?, the answer is no," Gleckman said. "World War II required this massive tax increases, and nothing we’ve done since have come close." Further, as Gleckman notes, few in Washington, D.C. expect the Bush tax cuts to expire in full. Rather, the debate centers largely on whether to extend the tax breaks for the nation’s highest earners, those taking in $200,000 or more a year. If those cuts were allowed to expire, it would mean a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP, far less than Bass’ claim. Our ruling: The trillions of dollars at stake this year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts place them among the nation’s most costly. But, a historical review of other tax legislation show the cuts, if allowed to expire, would still amount to less than half the percentage of the Gross Domestic Product that World War II spending bills took on.

pomt-06427	Says "if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/24/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-newark-shooting-victims-have-high/	Many gun violence victims in the state’s largest city share a common trait -- a criminal history, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. Booker, in a recent radio interview, said statistics showing the extent to which shooting victims are involved in the criminal justice system are "startling." "We now sat down with Rutgers and have shown that if you are shot in the city of Newark, as the shooting demonstrates that we just saw, if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times," Booker said Oct. 13 on WBGO’s "Newark Today," just days after a daytime shooting spree in a public housing complex in Newark’s Central Ward. "So we know the players here. If you are getting shot or doing the shooting, overwhelmingly you've been involved in the criminal justice system and the correctional system is not correcting." PolitiFact New Jersey was also startled by the data. So, we researched Booker’s claim. Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said Booker’s "statement should have been shot and killed, instead of shot," but beyond that he’s right. The statistics come from a study Anthony Braga, a professor with Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice is conducting, as a program called "Operation Ceasefire" is implemented in Newark. David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, along with Braga and Anne Piehl, a Harvard professor at the time, implemented Ceasefire in Boston in 1996, with the city’s police department. The strategy aims to reduce gun violence through targeted law enforcement efforts, social services outreach and community interaction. Though Braga’s study is not yet completed or published, Braga said he briefed Booker and his staff on the progress of his research on homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city. "The exact numbers are... 85% of 165 murder victims in Newark between 2009 and 2010 were known to the criminal justice system before they were killed ("known" meaning that they were arrested at least once before the homicide event)," Braga wrote in an email. And those "victims, had, on average, 10 prior arrests on their criminal records." Braga said he determined those figures by running the names and dates of birth of the homicide victims through the state’s database of criminal history files. Kennedy said that pattern of violence is not unique to Newark. "This is the way the streets work," he said. "The idea that ordinary people kill each other is nearly never true." "The folks who pick up a gun and kill another human being are the exception, even within an active criminal population and they almost always kill people in their same social networks. So they’re killing each other, in effect. Contrary to what a lot of people think, this stuff is not random. It’s not stranger on stranger," said Kennedy. "It’s people that know each other." Our ruling Booker said "if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times." The mayor should have said shot and killed, but the rest of his statistic is on point -- and backed by the research of a Rutgers-Newark criminal justice professor. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-10724	"Americans spend 100-million hours a year filling out these forms (FAFSA). That is the equivalent of 55,500 full-time jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/20/hillary-clinton/a-lot-of-time-but-the-math-is-off/	While discussing college costs, Sen. Hillary Clinton joined a growing chorus of political leaders calling for reform of the financial aid application process. Quoting from a Brookings Institution proposal called "College Grants on a Postcard," the former first lady said something must be done given how long Americans spend filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid each year. It's 100-million hours, Clinton said, the equivalent of 55,500 full-time jobs. Her math is slightly off, and it relies on a disputed number. The Brookings Institution paper says 100-million hours is "the equivalent of about 50,000 full-time jobs." And our calculator figures it's 48,077 jobs of 40 hours a week. Also, that figure of 100-million hours is at odds with the government's best estimate. The Department of Education estimates on its Web site that first-time users will need less than an hour to complete FAFSA on the Web. That time frame "largely assumes that the applicants and their parents come to the Web prepared," spokeswoman Stephanie Babyak told PolitiFact.com. Approximately 10-million forms are filed each year. By the department's estimate, it would be 10-million hours of form filling. "Implausible," counters Harvard University associate professor Susan Dynarski, who wrote the Brookings Institution paper. "The IRS estimates 8 to 10 hours to complete the 1040EZ or 1040A, which are both far shorter than the FAFSA," Dynarski wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact.com. "The estimate for the 1040 is 16 hours, and 1040 is about the length of the FAFSA. Other researchers have estimated an average of 27 hours for IRS compliance. Ten hours is therefore an informed estimate based on this range of values and our detailed examination of the FAFSA questions." Given such disparities, we turned to other experts, who largely sided with the Department of Education's version. "That form is fairly simple," said Vivian Fiallo, a guidance counselor at Freedom High in Tampa. Several of the questions are biographical — nothing tough there — and many require only a yes or no. The interactive Web site even tells you where to look for each answer, Fiallo added. Indeed, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire-based Center for College Planning said in an e-mail that the denseness of the form has become less of an issue since it went online, though some families still describe the process of applying as overwhelming. "With assistance, it can take an average of 30 to 45 minutes to fill out the FAFSA," the center's Erin Hathaway wrote to PolitiFact.com. "If there are complicated asset situations or private business owners, joint families etc., then it can take longer, usually one to two hours." No research has been done on the topic, said Meihua Zhai, director of research at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, making all information on how long it takes anecdotal. Given the disputed number and the lack of research, we find Clinton's statement to be Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-11-20T00:00:00	2007-10-11	['United_States']

mpws-00011	In his fifth State of the State address on Thursday, Gov. Mark Dayton repeated a lot of claims about the state’s economy and future. PoliGraph put three of those claims to the test and found two of the three to be correct. Here’s Dayton’s first claim about Minnesota’s economy. “More Minnesota businesses are expanding.  So, more Minnesotans are working.  They are earning more money, which means they are paying more taxes.” Dayton’s talking about the state’s most recent budget forecast. The report showed that more Minnesotans are working and earning higher wages, when not adjusted for inflation. That means more income and sales tax revenue for the state, which is a big driver behind Minnesota’s $1.9 billion budget surplus. PoliGraph rated a similar claim from Dayton accurate in the past, and we’re sticking with that rating. Dayton went on to talk about how Minnesota’s employment rate stacks up against the rest of the nation. “Our unemployment rate is an unusually low, 3.7%…. Minnesota is the only state in the nation, whose employment rate for 25-54 year-olds in 2014 exceeded its pre-recession level in 2007.” Dayton is correct that the state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent – lower than the national average of 5.5 percent. He’s also referring to a study from the Pew Charitable Trusts that compared 2014 employment rates in every state with employment rates prior to the recession. The study focused on 25-54 year-olds because those are considered prime working years, according to Pew’s website. Dayton is mostly correct that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that has an employment rate that’s higher than before the economy tanked. But the rate change is only slightly better than before the recession, and the Pew study doesn’t consider it statistically significant. Lastly, Dayton touched on the state’s education funding. “A rank of 24th in per-pupil K-12 education expenditures by a state with the 11th highest per-capita income means that at least thirteen other states are making greater financial efforts than we are to educate our children.” Back in January, Dayton made a similar claim about Minnesota’s per-pupil spending, but Poligraph gave it an inconclusive because the most recent numbers available are a few years old. That means the latest rankings don’t include Dayton’s more recent investments in education, like funding for all-day kindergarten. This claim comes with another important note: Minnesota actually ranks 15th in per capita income according to the latest Census data. A few years ago, Minnesota ranked 11th in the nation. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/04/poligraph-fact-checking-the-state-of-the-state/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Fact-checking the State of the State	April 10, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'The_Pew_Charitable_Trusts']
pomt-13791	In 2010, Clinton "said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she’s always argued against it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/mitch-mcconnell/did-hillary-clinton-flip-flop-iran-nuclear-enrichm/	On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Hillary Clinton of bending with the political wind on key issues. "Hillary has changed her positions so many times it’s impossible to tell where conviction ends and ambition begins," McConnell said. "In 2010, she said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she’s always argued against it." We wanted to verify that Clinton indeed held one view in 2010 and another in 2014. The context for McConnell’s statement is the decade-long push to get Iran off the path of building nuclear warheads. The United Nations Security Council had been trying since the mid 2000s to strike a deal with Iran. The council’s first demand was that Iran freeze the enrichment of uranium. Iran ignored that. It was only after stiff sanctions began to hit Iran hard in 2011 that negotiations moved forward. But sanctions alone didn’t break the logjam. In 2012, the United States, with Clinton as secretary of state, opened the door to allowing Iran to continue to enrich uranium on a much more limited scale than it had before. That ultimately became part of the deal. Now for what Clinton has said about Iran and enrichment. Clinton and her positions McConnell’s Senate campaign focused on two news reports. On the surface, the news reports appear to prove McConnell’s case. But a closer read reveals flaws in contrasting the two statements, an expert told us. One, from the BBC in December 2010, paraphrased Clinton as saying that under the right conditions, in the future, Iran might be allowed to enrich uranium. "We told them that they are entitled to the peaceful use of civil nuclear energy," Clinton is quoted as saying in the article. "Peaceful use" could mean either enriching uranium domestically or importing nuclear fuel produced somewhere else. The McConnell campaign contrasts that comment with a 2014 interview in The Atlantic — before any deal was struck with Iran — where Clinton seemed to take a tougher line. "I've always been in the camp that held that they (Iran) did not have a right to enrichment," she told The Atlantic. "Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded." The key here is that Clinton is talking about whether Iran had a legal right to enrich its own nuclear fuel. But Clinton continued, "I think it's important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there cannot be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran. The preference would be no enrichment. The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out. So, little or no enrichment has always been my position." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told us Clinton was talking about two different things. (Kimball’s group favors the deal with Iran.) "The first time (in 2010), she is saying that it is conceivable that Iran might be allowed to enrich fuel for the peaceful use of nuclear energy," Kimball said. "In the second, she’s addressing whether there is a legal right to enrich. And there is no legal right to enrichment." McConnell’s point rests on the idea that Clinton was saying something different in 2014 than she said in 2010. But we found examples that suggest he was mixing a shift in tone with a shift in policy. In March 2011 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton was asked specifically if Iran had a right to enrich uranium. "It has been our position that, under very strict conditions, Iran would sometime in the future, having responded to the international community’s concerns and irreversibly shut down its nuclear weapons program, have such a right under IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection." So in her 2011 testimony, Clinton spoke of allowing enrichment "under very strict conditions." In 2014, Clinton called for a "clear set of restrictions on Iran" and with those, the "fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out." ("Break out" here means a surprise restart of a nuclear weapons program in Iran.) The words are not identical, but there is little difference in meaning. There is some ambiguity in how she talks about Iran’s rights. Kimball put that into the context of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It allows countries to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. It doesn’t specifically give them the right to enrich their own uranium. Nor does it forbid it. In 2014, Clinton said definitively that Iran had no legal right to enrichment. In her 2011 testimony, she described a conditional right, and the conditions would be no nuclear weapons program and international inspections. Our ruling McConnell said that Clinton changed her views on allowing Iran to enrich uranium. He claimed that she was open to allowing enrichment in 2010, and then in 2014, denied that she was ever open to the idea. A full reading shows that in 2014, Clinton was talking about whether Iran enjoyed a legal right to enrichment, and she said it did not. An arms control expert we reached agreed that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that Iran signed does not grant that right. In addition, in that 2014 interview, Clinton did not reject the idea that through negotiations, Iran might be allowed to enrich uranium. The conditions she described in 2014 are similar to the ones in a 2010 interview with the BBC and even more like her House testimony just a few months later in 2011. In 2011, she called for enrichment "under very strict conditions." In 2014, she said allowing enrichment would be a fallback position under "a clear set of restrictions." The words are not identical, but there’s not enough here to say she changed her position.

pomt-01782	"The best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/27/ruth-marcus/marcus-if-tee-use-marijuana-regularly-the-drop-8-i/	About two dozen states have moved to loosen the reins on marijuana. The legal ground is shifting and a New York Times Sunday editorial tried to shake things up a bit further. For more than 40 years, federal law has banned pot and lawmakers in many states have voiced reluctance to run afoul of Washington. The paper’s editorial board said the federal government should be silent on marijuana and let states decide for themselves. Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said she was okay with letting states experiment, but in a discussion on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 27, 2014, Marcus said she was against letting states "go the full legalization route." Her main concern with state’s loosening the rules had to do with teenagers. "It is a vast social experiment," Marcus said. "We do not know the outcome except that the best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points." We didn’t hear from Marcus, but we’re pretty sure she is citing a 2012 study from Duke University researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Duke team led by Madeline Meier studied nearly every child born in the New Zealand town of Dunedin born in the early 1970s. By the time they turned 13, these children had taken their first IQ tests. Follow-up interviews as they grew older determined if they were using marijuana, alcohol or other drugs. They took another battery of IQ tests when they turned 38. The Duke researchers screened out those who had problems with hard drugs, alcohol or schizophrenia. They controlled for the kids who dropped out of school. What they found was the ones who began smoking pot weekly before they turned 18 showed an average drop of about eight IQ points. Some lost more and some lost less but all lost at least a bit. "Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline," the researchers wrote. The study didn’t say this proved that that early and long-term use caused the drop in IQ results. Researchers acknowledged that some unknown variable might be responsible. At the same time, they said it was plausible that pot could be disrupting brain development in teenagers. The report attracted a fair bit of attention. Then, about a year later, another analysis emerged, again published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This one came from Ole Rogeberg, a Norwegian economist, who said he could get the same results as Meier by factoring in socioeconomic status. In short, Rogeberg said the kids from poorer households would lose ground on IQ tests over time because they tended to end up doing work that was less mentally demanding. "The causal effects estimated in Meier et al. are likely to be overestimates and the true effect could be zero," Rogeberg wrote. "Although it would be too strong to say that the results have been discredited, the methodology is flawed and the causal inference drawn from the results premature." Meier shot back that Rogeberg had relied on an economic model and that when her team looked at the incomes of the families, they still found a loss in intelligence that was tied to marijuana. In particular, children from middle-class households were more likely to see a drop in their IQ scores if they started smoking pot early and continued as they aged. However, there was no mention of how large the drop was or how statistically robust it was. Annette Dobson, a statistician at the University of Queensland, commented on the debate. Dobson largely weighed in on Rogeberg’s side, saying the number of long-term pot users in the Dunedin group was small, only 124 reported regular use at any time. "I suspect that the small sample size limited the extent to which the authors were able to take possible confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, into account," Dobson wrote. "So are the original results by Meier et al. correct? I don’t believe we can say whether they are or not." Our ruling Marcus said the best evidence shows that teenagers who start smoking marijuana will lose eight IQ points. This overstates the actual underlying report. It would be more accurate to say the study showed a higher risk of losing that many points on an IQ test, not that a person necessarily would. More fundamentally, an equally reputable analysis found that IQ loss could be tied to household incomes as much as marijuana use. Clearly, a scientific consensus has yet to emerge, and Marcus ignored the ongoing debate. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Ruth Marcus	None	None	None	2014-07-27T16:58:26	2014-07-27	['None']
pomt-07728	The 2006 Massachusetts health care law has "added (only) about 1 percent to our state budget."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/02/deval-patrick/deval-patrick-said-massachusetts-health-care-law-a/	Massachusetts overhauled its health care laws in 2006 to work toward universal coverage. Many consider it a model for national health care reform -- even critics, who say that Massachusetts’ problems with cost controls mean the national plan will have similar problems. But Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of the state, said the cost overruns aren’t as dramatic as some are claiming, when asked about it on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "Actually, it's added about 1 percent to our state budget, which is not what is generally reported on out there, but that is the truth," Patrick said. Patrick added that the plan in Massachusetts was to cover the uninsured and then address cost controls. "And just as we have shown the nation how to provide universal care through a public-private model, I think we can crack the code on health care costs as well," he said. Patrick promoted his own plan for reducing costs by paying doctors and hospitals for healthy outcomes, not per procedure. We were interested in fact-checking Patrick’s statement that the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, had added only 1 percent to the state budget. We contacted Patrick’s office but didn’t hear back. Meanwhile, we tracked the claim back to a report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers’ Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group backed by business that regularly analyzes state fiscal issues. A report published in 2009 found that the state’s share of health care spending increased by $353 million in fiscal year 2010. The state’s entire budget is roughly $30 billion, so that comes out to about 1 percent, said Michael Widmer, the group’s president. He said the group has not updated the analysis with more recent numbers but has seen nothing to indicate the trend is any different. There’s some fine print to explain about the group’s analysis, though. The foundation arrived at its number by adding health care spending increases for expanding coverage. But it also subtracted money the state would have spent under the old system on care for the uninsured and the state’s old Medicaid program. An analysis by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute in 2009 took issue with the study’s focus solely on the state budget. The federal government significantly increased Medicaid aid to Massachusetts as a result of the new law. Additionally, businesses and individuals had to spend more on insurance to satisfy new requirements that everyone have health insurance. Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation agreed that the federal government did pay more money for the Massachusetts health plan. Also, some of the uninsured also paid for care that the state paid for before, he said. "That’s why the piece around the state budget has always been modest," Widmer said."We’re not trying to pretend it didn’t cost any additional money to insure 400,000 additional people." Patrick said his state’s health care law "added about 1 percent to our state budget," and an independent analysis confirms that. There were additional costs for the health care plan outside of the state budget, so Patrick was right as far as the state budget goes. But because it's only one piece of a picture that includes increased federal spending, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00915	"...Over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/02/dave-brat/brat-us-school-spending-375-percent-over-30-years-/	U.S. Rep. Dave Brat wants to rein in federal funding for public education. Brat, R-7th, backs the Student Success Act, a GOP bill that would scale back Uncle Sam’s role in overseeing public schools and consolidate dozens of federal education programs. On Feb. 11, he introduced a successful amendment in the House Education and Workforce Committee that would require the U.S. Department of Education to issue annual reports recommending ways to save on school spending. Brat, a former college professor, expressed his thoughts in classical terms: "The greatest thinkers of Western Civ. were not products of education policy," he said. "Socrates trained Plato on a rock and then Plato trained Aristotle, roughly speaking, on a rock. So huge education funding is not necessary to achieve the greatest minds and the greatest intellects in history." Five days later, Brat took to Facebook and posted his view in modern terms. "Our own government statistics show that over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375%, but test scores have remained flat," he wrote. "That proves that just throwing more money at education is not the solution." We wondered whether Brat’s Facebook post is accurate, both in terms of the 30-year growth percentage for federal education funding and his characterization of test scores as "flat." Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Bratt, said the congressman’s statement was based on July 2012 testimony by Neal McCluskey before a U.S. Senate education subcommittee. McCluskey, is director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He said that federal education cuts mandated under sequestration -- Congress’s 2011 agreement to chop domestic and defense spending in return for raising the nation’s borrowing limit -- "are both necessary and overdue." McCluskey argued that increasing school funding has not improved student performance. Let’s take a closer look. Funding levels A reading of McCluskey’s testimony instantly turns up an inaccuracy in Brat’s statement. McCluskey said the 375 percent increase, adjusted for inflation, occurred over a 40-year period from 1970 to 2010. Brat posted that the increase occurred over 30 years and didn’t offer dates. McCluskey cited White House figures showing federal outlays for elementary, secondary and vocational education were $2.9 billion in 1970 and rose to $73.3 billion in 2010. When adjusted for inflation, that comes to about a 375 percent increase. But there’s an issue with using 2010 as the end date for measuring the growth. U.S. education spending hit a record high in 2010, bolstered by more than $30 billion in special stimulus money Washington sent states in the wake of the Great Recession to help pay for schools. The stimulus program has stopped and during the last budget year -- ending Sept. 30, 2014 -- the U.S. spent $40.8 billion on education. Going back 30 years, as Brat did, puts us in 1984 when federal spending on schools was $6.5 billion. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 176 percent increase -- less than half of the congressman’s figure. Now, let’s throw in another factor: the number of students in publicly-funded schools across the nation increased from 39.2 million in 1984 to a projected 50 million in 2014. Federal spending per student rose from $165 in 1984 to about $816 in 2014. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 117 percent increase -- less than one-third of Brat’s figure. We should note that when we queried Brat’s office about the Feb. 16 Facebook post, spokesman Gottstein sent us a Feb. 11 news release in which the congressmen correctly said that the 375 increase in education spending took place over 40 years -- from 1970 to 2010. The public, however, doesn’t have access to this detail. Brat’s congressional website doesn’t contain a copy of the release, but it does link to his Facebook post, which says "over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent..." We just used an ellipsis. So let’s look at the second part of Brat’s statement. Test scores Brat’s claim that test scores "have been flat" again comes from McCluskey’s 2012 Senate testimony. McCluskey said that between 1970 and 2010, math and reading scores on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests, "have been almost stagnant for 17-year-olds, the final product of our elementary and secondary system." The NAEP, frequently called "The Nation’s Report Card," refers to a variety of tests given every four years to fourth, eighth and twelfth graders in a sampling of states. McCluskey focused on the "long-term trend" test for 17-year-olds, which since the early 1970s has measured achievement on an unchanged set of math and reading skills. On the first NAEP reading test, in 1971, 17-year-olds had an average score of 285 on a scale of 500. On the most recent test, in 2012, the average was 287. On the first math test, in 1973, the average was 304 and that inched to 306 in 2012. The scores don’t change much if you measure them over the 30 years Brat mentions on Facebook. The average math score in 1982 was 298 and rose by eight points over the next three decades. The average reading score in 1984 -- the reading test wasn’t given in 1982 -- was 289 and fell by two points in 2012. Brat is hardly the first to call the results for 17-year-olds "flat." Education Week, a nationally-circulated periodical, used the same term in a 2009 headline to describe the history of NAEP scores for the age group. The chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee that year -- Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. -- called it "deeply troubling" that high schoolers were not making "meaningful gains" on the tests. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in 2014 that NAEP results underscore a need to "reject educational stagnation in our high schools." Many educators say the focus on average test results for all 17-year-olds overlooks significant gains by other groups and subgroups taking the NAEP. For example, from 1982-2012: Average math scores of 17-year-old blacks rose 16 points Average math scores of 17-year-old Hispanics rose 17 points Average math scores of all nine-year-olds rose 25 points Average math scores for all 13-year-olds rose 16 points. Our ruling Brat says that "over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat." The inflation-adjusted figure Brat uses to describe what he sees as runaway federal spending on education over 30 years is overblown. You can only get near a 375 percent increase if you start in 1970 and end in 2010, when U.S. school funding was nearly doubled with stimulus money and stood at an all-time high of $73.3 billion. Uncle Sam spent $40.8 billion on public schools last year. When you divide that by enrollment, it comes to $816 a student. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 117 percent increase in federal spending per student over 30 years ago. That said, the increase in per-student spending is still significant and Brat has valid point on the test results. Average NAEP scores for 17-year-olds have barely budged during the last 30 years of testing. So we rate the totality of Brat’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-12941	Under Obamacare, "American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-under-obamacare-american-families-/	As part of his visit to Capitol Hill to kick off Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Vice President-elect Mike Pence blasted the law -- also known as Obamacare -- for its impact on ordinary Americans’ finances. "Right now, the American people are laboring under extraordinary increases in premiums," Pence told reporters. "The average deductible for a bronze policy (the least comprehensive Obamacare offering) today is $12,000. American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000. And this year, the average premium increase on families has been over 25 percent, and 100 percent in some American states. That all comes to an end when we set in motion an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare." Pence was right that the premiums for policies purchased on the online marketplace HealthCare.gov were slated to be 25 percent higher in 2017 than 2016. When the Department of Health and Human Services announced that figure, it became a major talking point for Republicans like presidential candidate Donald Trump. But the part of Pence’s comment that raised our eyebrows was that under Obamacare, "American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000." As we discovered, that’s not really correct. (The Trump-Pence transition office did not respond to our inquiries.) How much did premiums rise for Obamacare policies? We started by looking at the data released by HHS about average Obamacare premiums. This data has been released for four years -- 2014 to 2017. We looked at one of the standard measurements the department calculates every year -- what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan. (As you might guess, a silver plan is more comprehensive than a bronze plan, but less generous than gold and platinum plans.) Premiums for this type of policy started at $9,468 a year in 2014, rose very modestly to $9,636 in 2015, rose somewhat more aggressively to $10,428 in 2016, and then rather substantially -- 25 percent -- to $13,080 in 2017. Altogether, then, average premiums for this type of Obamacare plan rose by a cumulative 38 percent during that period, which is not a trivial amount. However, the raw dollar increase was less than what Pence said -- $3,612 rather than $5,000. So Pence’s dollar figure is exaggerated. That said, we’ll note a few additional bits of context, some helpful to Pence’s overall argument and some not. • Consumers won’t be paying all of this amount. This $3,612 figure doesn't take into account the subsidies that most marketplace purchasers qualify for. Once the average level of subsidies are included in the calculation, the actual out-of-pocket premium cost borne by qualifying consumers actually decreased slightly between 2014 and 2017 -- a drop of $60, from $4,920 in 2014 to $4,860 in 2017. That's an important piece of context that's missing from Pence’s comment. • Premiums on HealthCare.gov have risen faster than premiums for employer-sponsored plans. We looked at data calculated annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust about employer-provided policies and their premiums. Between 2013 and 2016, premiums for the average full-family, employee-sponsored plan rose by a cumulative 11 percent. That’s well below the increase for Obamacare plans, which as we noted was 38 percent between 2014 and 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com • Before Obamacare, under President George W. Bush, overall premium increases were faster. Before you assume that all premiums rose faster under Obama, consider this. According to the Kaiser/Health Research and Educational Trust studies, family premiums for employer-sponsored insurance increased by a cumulative 99 percent -- basically doubling -- under the eight years of Bush, while under eight years of Obama, they rose by a much more modest 59 percent. On this score, the news is not great for Pence. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Pence said that under Obamacare, "American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000." Judged in context, Pence appears to be talking only about people who buy their insurance from HealthCare.gov. And in reality, the increase for the most common yardstick plan from HealthCare.gov has been smaller than that -- $3,612. Over the same time period, federal subsidies actually decreased what the average marketplace purchaser had to pay. On the other hand, $3,612 is not a trivial increase, and it’s valid to note that the premiums rose significantly faster for these plans than they did for employer-sponsored insurance over an equivalent period. We rate Pence’s statement Half True.	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2017-01-09T14:22:27	2017-01-04	['United_States']

pomt-04293	On a single-payer healthcare system	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tammy-baldwin/single-payer-healthcare-system-america/	In the space of two days in the waning weeks of the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Tammy Baldwin declared her position on getting a single-payer healthcare system "moot," "irrelevant" and "hypothetical." Instead, she said, Congress should focus now on putting into place the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping healthcare law approved by congressional Democrats and signed into law by President Obama in March 2010. Republicans, including Senate campaign rival Tommy Thompson, pounced on Baldwin’s remarks, with Thompson’s camp saying that Baldwin was "trying to walk back her 14-year support for a single-payer health care system." Did Baldwin change her position on single-payer? For an answer, let’s test that question on our Flip-O-Meter, which looks at whether candidates have changed their position. Our standard disclaimer: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent over time. Thompson moved to make the elimination of "Obamacare" a central part of the campaign, pledging in the primary to be the 51st vote to repeal it. Now, in the general election, he has been using Baldwin’s views to try to paint her as so "extreme" that she’s to the left of Obama. Baldwin voted for the Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance to millions of uninsured. But she also pushed for even more dramatic action, which she later described this way: "I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan." Let’s look at Baldwin’s record on the issue. Baldwin, who entered Congress in 1999, has advocated repeatedly for health care for all -- universal coverage -- and has publicly favored a financing mechanism called "single payer," as we have documented in the past. Here’s how she has defined the financing: "Under a single-payer system, all Americans would be covered for all medically necessary services. Patients would regain free choice of doctor and hospital, and doctors would regain autonomy over patient care. A single-payer system would be financed by eliminating private insurers and recapturing their administrative waste." She continued: "Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business. Costs would be controlled through negotiated fees, global budgeting, and bulk purchasing." That was from a Baldwin news release in 2006. Single-payer systems are in use in Europe and Canada, among other places. A 2011 law moved Vermont toward a universal, single payer system. In that 2006 news release, Baldwin was announcing her co-sponsorship of a bipartisan bill, The Health Partnership through Creative Federalism Act, that would have given grants to states to try different approaches, including a single-payer system, to cover their uninsured residents. In 2009, as the healthcare reform debate raged in Congress, Baldwin was part of a bloc of Democrats pushing for serious consideration of a single-payer system. "I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our healthcare system," Baldwin said as the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted on Obama’s plan. In the end, the bill did not go that route. Under the law, employers will continue to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. A larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges. The law is expected to reduce the ranks of the uninsured by 30 million, but not completely eliminate them. Since the passage of "Obamacare," Baldwin has made few new public pronouncements about single payer, while making clear she still wants to at least try to take steps toward a single-payer system. Her current House website praises "Obamacare" for taking an "important step" toward quality healthcare for all Americans, but makes clear she wants to go further. She says she will work for allowing Americans the choice of a "public option", calling that "essential." The "public option," which was considered during the 2009 debate, is an insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans. Baldwin supported a public option during the healthcare reform debate, saying it could, if successful, lead to the single-payer system she supports. At the 2010 political rally where she used the "I was for a single-payer plan" line, she praised Obamacare as "incredible progress" but her remarks suggested it was not the end of her quest to see all Americans get health insurance. She did not go into specifics of her strategy. Taking all this history into account, during the 2012 Senate race we rated Mostly True a Thompson claim that Baldwin wants a "completely government-controlled" health care system that goes "far beyond 'Obamacare'" and is "a Medicare system for all." Yet we could find little evidence Baldwin had addressed the issue in the context of the 2012 campaign. That changed Oct. 24 and 25, 2012. Asked by a Journal Sentinel editorial writer Oct. 24, 2012, whether she still supports moving to single-payer system, Baldwin responded that it’s a "moot question." She said: "It took 70 years for America to have a federal health policy. I certainly do not see that debate coming up. So it’s a hypothetical question." The next day, asked if she still supports single payer, she told reporters at an endorsement news conference that if elected, she would focus on implementing "Obamacare," -- rather than advocating for having the government go even further as she has in the past. She called her position on single payer "irrelevant." "We have a bill (the Affordable Care Act) that was passed. I worked on it. I voted for it. That's what our task is going forward. It doesn't matter the debates of a decade ago or even more recently. We have passed a bill. I voted for it, and now we need to put it to work and make it work for Wisconsin." Our rating Baldwin, in her recent statements, did not renounce her support for a single-payer system so much as deflect questions about it. So this is not a major change of position that translates into a full flop. But her line about being content to work now on implementing "Obamacare" is inconsistent with her public vow to push hard to go even further -- to a public option that could lead to a single-payer system. Baldwin did not say she was permanently shelving her prior strategy, but is setting it aside right now. We think that earns her a Half Flip, which we define as a partial change of position or inconsistent statements.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-11-01T09:00:00	2012-10-25	['None']
pomt-01958	The U.N. Arms Treaty "infringes upon our right to keep and bear arms."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/20/monica-wehby/will-un-arms-trade-treaty-infringe-our-right-keep-/	From universal background checks to limits on magazine capacities, gun-control proposals are among the surest ways to stir controversy. Some Second Amendment activists are convinced there is yet another threat to gun ownership that comes not from the U.S. government but from the United Nations. The claim: U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby, a Republican, is running against Oregon’s Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley. On her website, Wehby addresses gun ownership, singling out a U.N. proposal long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups. She promises to oppose the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, her statement says, because it "infringes upon our right to keep and bear arms." If adopted, would it have that effect in the U.S.? We decided to check. The analysis: We emailed Wehby’s campaign and asked how this U.N. treaty would affect gun ownership in the United States. Michael Antonopoulos, the candidate’s new campaign manager, replied: "Dr. Wehby is an unapologetic defender of second amendment rights and will always oppose any effort (to) infringe on them when she is in the Unites States Senate." He added that nine Democratic senators share Wehby’s concerns about the treaty but provided no additional information on how the treaty itself would infringe on U.S. gun rights. We checked PolitiFact National’s database for some background on what the treaty is and what it does. The formally named Arms Trade Treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, was adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, three opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, with North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed. The treaty requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms, PolitiFact Virginia found. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. It has no enforcement power, but backers hope it will create common standards for international trade of weapons. To take effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36. So does it contain language that would somehow infringe on gun-ownership rights of U.S. citizens, as Wehby’s website claims? The pact’s preamble affirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." We emailed the U.S. State Department and asked for its position on the treaty. Press officer Drew Bailey sent us a synopsis, which included this point: "Nothing in the Arms Trade Treaty is inconsistent with the rights of U.S. citizens, including those protected by the Second Amendment." Some pro-gun advocates, however, remain unconvinced. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for instance, has called for hearings into the Arms Trade Treaty and its potential reach. The group also notes, correctly, that a Senate majority, including some Democrats, opposes ratifying the pact. The National Rifle Association issued a statement after Secretary of State John Kerry signed the treaty saying it "threatens individual firearm ownership and an invasive registration scheme." Despite all signs to the contrary, the NRA and other groups opposed to the treaty insist it will create a slippery slope leading to a national gun registry. However, previous PolitiFact checks don’t back that up. PolitiFact Georgia, in an Aug. 12, 2012 story, interviewed legal experts and concluded, "...even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not 'almost certainly force' the U.S. to create one," as a Georgia congressman had alleged. The ruling: Oregon Republican U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby’s website, in addressing the Second Amendment, says she opposes an international arms treaty passed by the U.N., and signed by the United States, because it "infringes on our right to keep and bear arms." A Wehby spokesman did not elaborate on how or why any infringement could come about, but did restate the candidate’s support for the Second Amendment. He did not return phone calls or emails asking exactly how the treaty would infringe on the gun rights of U.S. citizens Previous fact-checks looking at this claim found it lacked merit. Language in the treaty itself specifically leaves gun-control and ownership decisions up to member nations. The claim is all flash and no powder. We rate it False.

pomt-02470	"Worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/21/dan-branch/dan-branch-worked-pro-reagan-texas-committee-thoug/	Texas attorney general candidate Dan Branch surely isn’t unique in touting a connection to Ronald Reagan, who ranked among the most popular recent presidents upon leaving office. But we grew curious about Branch’s closeness after spotting a video ad for Branch, a Republican state representative from Dallas. "Dan Branch worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him," the narrator said in the ad posted online Feb. 4, 2014. A Branch radio ad, posted Jan. 29, similarly said that Branch "worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him." Texas warhorses of the Reagan era -- George Strake, who then chaired the Republican Party of Texas; Ernest Angelo of Midland, a leading Reagan supporter; and Tom Pauken, then in the Reagan administration -- each told us by telephone that he didn’t recall Branch working with Reagan. Pauken, saying Branch had long been more closely associated with the Bush wing of the party, called Branch’s statement "misleading." We asked Branch’s campaign manager, Enrique Marquez, for the basis of the ad claim. He said by email that Branch was hired in 1984 to "administer the Victory Fund of the Reagan/Bush '84 re-election effort in Texas, reporting directly to Reagan/Bush Texas co-chairs, U.S. Sen. John Tower and Martha Weisend," who are both no longer living. "The Victory Fund," Marquez said, "was a joint effort of the Reagan/Bush '84 campaign in Texas and the state Republican party." Marquez added that in his role, Branch met Reagan at Texas campaign stops. Asked for more detail, Marquez emailed that Branch succeeded Bob Estrada as the fund’s administrator. Estrada, a Dallas lawyer and investment banker, told us by phone that Branch was already the deputy administrator when he was promoted to take Estrada’s place as the committee’s administrator in May or June of 1984 after Estrada agreed to work for the Reagan-Bush campaign in Washington, D.C. Estrada said the purpose of the Victory Fund was to register and turn out voters for the president and other Republicans, including Phil Gramm, the party’s nominee for the Senate seat being given up by Tower. Estrada had no objection to Branch saying he "worked with" Reagan. "Millions of people worked with Reagan. Do you have to be a Cabinet member to say you were directly involved?" Estrada said. "People who stood in the mall and handed out brochures worked with" Reagan. We also reached Karl Rove, the long-time adviser to George W. Bush, who said by phone that he remembered Branch as the de facto chief operating officer of the Victory Fund, which Rove described as a volunteer-intensive effort to lift Reagan-Bush and others. At the time, Rove said, he handled some direct-mail work for the committee and also offered advice. Rove said Branch, who was 26 at the time of Reagan’s re-election, "had a significant role for someone his age." Our ruling Branch said he "worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him." This partly holds up in that Branch was an underling for a Texas committee devoted to helping Reagan win re-election and to electing other Republicans. Then again, his claim leaves the impression that Branch was right alongside Reagan, perhaps as a White House aide or joining in the president's day-to-day travels. Not so.

pomt-02222	"David Dewhurst currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/apr/18/dan-patrick/david-dewhursts-us-senate-campaign-2012-owed-more-/	Reacting to a TV ad poking at his personal bankruptcy in the 1980s, state Sen. Dan Patrick said Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst owes more than $1 million to creditors from his losing 2012 run for the U.S. Senate. Dewhurst and Patrick, both of Houston, are in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination after Patrick led the four-way March primary. In a document posted online after Dewhurst’s ad debuted April 16, 2014, Patrick’s campaign mentioned a one-time Dewhurst business debt. "In addition to these debts," Patrick said, Dewhurst "currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign." Patrick’s camp provided web links to news stories as the basis of the claim. On Aug. 13, 2013, the Texas Tribune reported that through June 2013, Dewhurst’s campaign finance reports indicated that it still owed $909,875.90 to consultants and vendors involved in his Senate bid. In July 2012, Dewhurst lost a primary runoff to attorney Ted Cruz, who won the seat that November. "The unpaid bills range from several six-figure debts to media experts to a few hundred dollars owed to a company that provided email services," the Tribune story said. "Many of the vendors are upset about getting stiffed for thousands of dollars from the campaign of a multi-millionaire candidate like Dewhurst, who hasn’t hesitated to pour some of his vast wealth into his political endeavors." Then-Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was still legally entangled in pursuing the recovery of up to $2 million allegedly stolen from his state and federal campaign kitties by a former campaign manager, Kenneth "Buddy" Barfield, the story said. Considine said lawsuits filed by Dewhurst’s campaign committees included an effort to recover funds "that should have been used to pay any outstanding federal campaign obligations." Debts from Dewhurst’s 2012 campaign subsequently increased, according to a news story in the Dallas Morning News posted online Feb. 7, 2013. Dewhurst, the story said, "still owes businesses $1.4 million from his failed 2012 U.S. Senate campaign, a federal report filed this week shows. The 20 private creditors have been waiting 18 months for payment. The debt ranges from $170,628 to a Maryland-based media consultant to $464 for email services." The story quoted Considine, on Dewhurst’s behalf, as blaming the Barfield morass. We turned to the Federal Election Commission website and perused the Dewhurst finance report that was cited in the News story. The report, filed by Dewhurst’s Senate committee in February 2014, indicates outstanding debts of $1,406,808 as of the end of 2013, not counting loans. We asked Dewhurst’s lieutenant governor campaign about Patrick’s claim. By email, spokeswoman Eliza Vielma pointed out the outstanding debts belong to Dewhurst’s campaign, not to Dewhurst personally. Also, she said, efforts continue to sell Barfield’s former home to raise money that would make up for the funds "stolen by Barfield from" Dewhurst’s state and federal campaign "committees," she said. According to a Jan. 3, 2014, Houston Chronicle news story, Dewhurst in November 2013 reached a settlement agreement with Barfield agreeing to sign over his West Austin home to repay a portion of the campaign funds that Dewhurst has said Barfield stole. On April 18, 2014, a Zillow.com web page showed the home in the Old Enfield part of Austin for sale for $2.75 million. According to a Chronicle news story posted online Jan. 11, 2014, a Dewhurst Senate campaign attorney, Adam Schramek, said after Dewhurst’s settlement with Barfield came public: "This matter is being handled by the Travis County District Attorney's office, but my clients are pursuing every avenue to achieve full restitution for Mr. Barfield's crimes." Our ruling Patrick said Dewhurst "currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign." To be precise, it's Dewhurst's Senate campaign that had outstanding debts exceeding $1.4 million through 2013. Also, Dewhurst appears to be trying to recoup campaign dollars he has described as stolen; it’s not as if he’s simply a deadbeat.

pomt-04256	"Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/14/steve-lonegan/conservative-activist-steve-lonegan-says-60-new-je/	Faced with low payment rates, most New Jersey doctors are apparently shutting their doors on Medicaid patients. And under a plan from President Barack Obama, the same fate will befall the Medicare program, according to conservative activist Steve Lonegan. In an Oct. 24 op-ed on the Asbury Park Press' website, Lonegan argued that changes to Medicare would lead that program down the path of Medicaid, which he claimed 60 percent of physicians in New Jersey do not accept. "Medicaid vastly underpays doctors," wrote Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. "Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients. This is not a model to replicate for our seniors." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Lonegan’s 60 percent figure is on the mark. A recent study estimated that only about 40 percent of office-based physicians in the Garden State were accepting new Medicaid patients last year. First, let’s explain how the Medicaid system works in New Jersey. Most Medicaid services provided in New Jersey are done through a managed care system. Under that system, the state contracts with private insurers, who manage the patients’ health care and pay the doctors directly. Some services in New Jersey are still covered on a fee-for-service basis, in which doctors are paid by the state. To back up his claim, Lonegan directed us to a study by Sandra Decker, an economist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. That study was outlined in an article published in the August 2012 edition of a journal called Health Affairs. The study was based on the responses of 4,326 physicians to a nationwide survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics from February 2011 to June 2011. In that study, Decker estimated that about 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. To be more precise, the percent of such physicians in the Garden State is likely between 28 percent and 53 percent, according to the study. That roughly 40 percent estimate represents the lowest percentage for any state and much less than the national average of 69.4 percent, the study shows. Why don’t more physicians accept Medicaid patients? One reason appears to be about money: the less they’ll get paid, the less likely physicians will take on those patients. The fee-for-service rates paid by states have been measured by how they compare with Medicare fees. Decker’s study shows that states with greater Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratios tended to have a higher percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients. New Jersey has ranked at the bottom for fee-for-service Medicaid payments in recent years, according to different studies. It remains unclear how those fee-for-service rates compare to what some New Jersey doctors are getting paid to treat Medicaid patients on a managed care basis. Those managed care fees are negotiated between the physicians and the insurance companies. State officials are not involved in those negotiations, and thus don’t know how much the doctors receive, according to Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services. But Stephen Zuckerman, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, told us the two sets of rates are often similar, but doctors may get paid more in managed care systems. However, under the health care reform enacted in 2010, certain doctors providing primary care services to Medicaid patients in both fee-for-service and managed care are supposed to receive 100 percent of Medicare rates for 2013 and 2014, according to federal regulations. Brian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in an e-mail that the fee increase applies to every state, and federal officials expect it to attract more physicians to accept Medicaid patients. Our ruling In an op-ed last month, Lonegan claimed: "Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients." That statement is backed up by a recent study estimating that roughly 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. The study also suggests that fewer physicians accept such patients in states with lower Medicaid payment rates. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01431	Saudi Arabia is "the only Muslim country out of 47 Muslim-majority countries" where women cannot get licenses to drive.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/07/dean-obeidallah/obeidallah-saudi-arabia-only-muslim-nation-where-w/	The comments about Islam from comedian, social critic and cable talk show host Bill Maher continue to stir reactions across the TV dial and across the political spectrum. Maher has said that when Muslim nations suppress political rights and deny freedoms to women, homosexuals and minorities, they are fair game for harsh criticism. The verbal fracas centers on whether Maher and others paint Islamic countries with too broad a brush. American comic Dean Obeidallah argued that Maher went too far. "You can criticize Muslims," Obeidallah said on MSNBC’s The Ed Show on Oct. 6. "It’s about doing it responsibly. Don't pick and choose and cherry-pick facts to define us by our worst examples. ... Like Saudi Arabia, women can't drive. That’s outrageous." But, Obeidallah said, "that's the only Muslim country out of 47 Muslim-majority countries that does that." We thought we’d run that number down. We asked Obeidallah and he said not only is it accurate within the Muslim world, but Saudi Arabia might be the only country worldwide that doesn’t let women drive. He pointed to an NPR story that said the oil-rich nation holds that dubious distinction, although it clarified "while there is no law formally banning female drivers, the government does not give them licenses." Some Saudi women have gotten behind the wheel and driven in plain sight to challenge the country’s policy. We went through a list of Muslim-majority nations and from everything we found, Obeidallah is correct about Saudi Arabia’s unique status. Another country that blocked women from driving did not show up. (For the record, our list had 51 nations, not 47. And there's another list that has 49. But we won't quibble over that.) John Esposito is a leading expert on Islam and a professor of International Affairs and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University. We asked him if Saudi Arabia was the sole Muslim nation with this policy regarding women. "Yes," Esposito said. Even within Saudi Arabia’s religious community, you can find arguments on both sides of the issue. On the website Islam Question and Answer, the justification of the prohibition lies in the Koran. The site operates under the Saudi Sheikh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid. "It is well known that (driving) leads to evil consequences which are well known to those who promote it, such as being alone with a non-mahram (marriageable) woman, unveiling, reckless mixing with men, and committing haraam (sinful) actions because of which these things were forbidden." But Islam Today, another website under the auspices of a different Saudi religious leader, Sheikh `Abd al-Wahhâb al-Turayrî, reaches a different conclusion. "There is nothing in Islamic Law that prohibits a woman from driving an automobile," according to the website. "In Saudi Arabia, the state considers it to be in the best interests of the people to enact laws restricting driving for certain sectors of the population, and that it falls within the state’s jurisdiction to do so. The law in Saudi Arabia that prevents women from driving is considered one of these laws. It is therefore not to be understood as an Islamic teaching." Obeidallah clearly subscribes to the second view. "There is zero basis in the Koran to ban women from driving, or we would see some other Muslims country doing it," Obeidallah said. "It's not a Muslim thing, it's a Saudi thing!" Our ruling Obeidallah said Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim-majority nation that doesn’t allow women to drive. According to our research and independent sources, that is correct. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14013	The Dog Meat Festival in Yulin, China, "threatens global public health."	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/03/alcee-hastings/dog-meat-delicacy-or-global-health-threat/	Every June, the city of Yulin in China’s southwestern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region hosts a spectacle that has drawn international condemnation. An estimated 10,000 dogs are butchered as part of a dog meat festival that started about six years ago. U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., moved to put his colleagues on record against the practice. In a House resolution, he highlighted that "dogs who reach the slaughterhouses are typically beaten to death with shocking brutality, without any regard for their welfare," and that the dog meat trade "poses a risk to human health by exposing people to a multitude of diseases, including rabies and cholera." Action is needed, the resolution continued, because the Dog Meat Festival in Yulin "threatens global public health." We are not insensitive to how ugly the scene might well be in Yulin. But our focus is on whether this festival in itself poses a threat to global public health. Hastings spokesman Evan Polisar sent us a statement that said "anything that happens in China has global significance, positively or negatively, due to China's enormous size." The statement noted that rabies kills about 2,000 people a year in China. People who handle the dogs are most at risk of contracting rabies by being bitten or scratched. "Since rabies is deadly and the number in China is so big, a reduction of that number is a global accomplishment," Polisar told us in an email. The statement from Hastings’ office also mentioned the potential for food contamination at restaurants that serve dog meat. Perhaps, but that falls well short of describing a global health threat, officials at the World Health Organization told us. Put simply, you may reject the dog festival as being cruel to animals or unethical, but you shouldn’t suggest it poses a global health threat. "While much can be said from the ethics and animal welfare points of view, we’re not aware of scientifically justified arguments behind the claim that a dog meat festival in China or the practice of eating dog meat represent a global threat to public health," said Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima, director of WHO’s Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases. "While it may pose a potential public health issue within China because of the lack of compliance with existing regulations, this would have no or very limited international impact." Dog meat is eaten primarily in countries in Asia, although it is also reported in some places in Africa. This map shows the nations most commonly mentioned in news reports. China did see a resurgence of rabies during the 1990s and the government responded with more monitoring and rabies vaccination programs. A study of about 1,300 cases found that six cases (.5 percent) were tied to the dog meat trade. Researchers in Yunnan Province on Guangxi’s western border took tissue samples from 300 dogs slaughtered for meat and found none were infected with rabies. Hastings’ resolution also mentioned cholera, but China reported no outbreaks of cholera in 2014 and while there was one between 2010 and 2013, it occurred far away in another part of China to the north and east of Yulin. We could find no survey of global health threats that made any reference to dog meat or the dog meat trade. Worldwide, rabies kills about 60,000 people a year, about a third of them in India. HIV/Aids and tuberculosis, clear global health threats, each kill over a million people annually. There are reports from China and Africa that dog slaughter is particularly cruel because some believe that the meat tastes sweeter if the animal dies in pain. The moral objections are obvious. The government of Yulin has distanced itself from the festival and moved to limit it. Our ruling Hastings said in his resolution that the dog meat festival in Yulin, China threatens global public health. No evidence backs that up. A leading expert at the World Health Organization dismissed the idea, both for the festival in particular, and the practice of eating dog meat in general. Peer-reviewed studies in China find little connection between the dog meat trade and rabies. There may be other reasons to condemn the festival, but the risk it poses to public health globally is not one of them.

pomt-11214	"Trump votes for death penalty for being gay."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/10/washingtonsources/no-trump-didnt-vote-death-penalty-gay-people/	A vote at the United Nations on a resolution about the death penalty has led to some inaccurate headlines about President Donald Trump. "Trump votes for death penalty for being gay," said a May 7 headline on the WashingtonSources website. The story, which repeats a claim circulating for months, said that the vote put the United States in the same category as China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the United States voted against a resolution that called for an overall ban on the death penalty, not a ban specific to gays and lesbians. The United States has said formally that it opposes the death penalty for people in same-sex relationships. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Death penalty resolution While the story said that the vote "just" took place, it actually happened several months ago. On Sept. 29, the UN Human Rights Council voted on a broad resolution about the death penalty. Among other things, the resolution condemned imposing the death penalty "as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations, and expressing serious concern that the application of the death penalty for adultery is disproportionately imposed on women." The resolution also stated that the Secretary General had found discriminatory use of the death penalty, including based on sexual orientation. The four-page resolution includes a long list of arguments against the death penalty, and said that states that have not abolished the death penalty should "consider doing so." The United States was one of 13 countries to vote against the resolution, while 27 nations voted in favor and seven abstained. (The story said that Trump took the vote, but technically U.S. voting decisions are reached through internal discussions involving senior officials.) The U.S. statement about the vote made no specific mention of same-sex individuals. Instead, it said that the United States opposed the resolution because the resolution advocated for the outright abolition of the death penalty. "The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a state’s international obligations." The Trump administration faced a barrage of negative headlines about the section of the resolution pertaining to people who are gay. Days after the vote, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert reiterated that the U.S. was against a broad condemnation of the death penalty, but also spoke up about the portion that pertained to people who are engaged in same-sex relations: "The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization." Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, also pushed back against the headlines. She tweeted Oct. 3: "Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community." Impact of the resolution After Nauert’s statement, some gay rights activists remained critical of the vote. The Human Rights Campaign stated that it "welcomes this clarification but continues to be concerned about the Trump/Pence administration’s engagement on the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad. It is disturbing that leadership in this administration did not discuss this position in their original explanation for the "no" vote." According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, as of 2017 there were six countries (eight if we count the parts of Syria and Iraq still occupied by ISIS) where the death penalty is implemented for same-sex relations. There were also five where it is technically allowed (if not actually invoked), and one where it has not yet been implemented. John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, an organization that opposes the death penalty, told PolitiFact that the United States made clear that it's vote against the resolution was not based on the reference to same-sex conduct. The United States has traditionally had issues with death penalty resolutions at UN forums, said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch. "HRC resolutions have political power in that they are expressions of a key collective body, the UN’s top human rights body," he said. "But they’re not legally binding in the way that Security Council resolutions can be." Our ruling A headline by WashingtonSources said, "Trump votes for death penalty for being gay." In September, the United States voted against a four-page resolution about the death penalty that included a provision condemning the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for "consensual same-sex relations." But the U.S. had another reason to vote against the resolution: The United States still uses the death penalty, and this resolution broadly condemned it. Days later, the State Department went on record stating that it "unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality." We rate this claim False.

pomt-05785	"New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization" of people with developmental disabilities "in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey. "	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/26/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-only-texas-institutionalizes/	There’s a fact of life in New Jersey that Gov. Chris Christie considers "shameful." As the governor announced more funding for social services in his budget speech on Feb. 21, he told the Legislature the government needs to change that fact by providing better care to the state’s vulnerable residents. "New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey. This is a shameful fact. We must change. It’s long overdue," he said. This isn’t the first time Christie made this point. During an "Ask the Governor" segment in January on New Jersey 101.5 FM, Christie said: "one of the sins in New Jersey is that we have more developmentally disabled folks institutionalized in New Jersey than any state other than Texas. And it's just obscene." Christie is on the mark by the number of people with developmental disabilities in large, state-operated institutions. But when measured as a rate of the general population, his comment needs some clarification. Michael Drewniak, the governor’s spokesman, cited a report from the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities, a project administered by the University of Colorado. The group tracks state-level data on revenue, spending, and programmatic trends for services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Several experts said the group’s report is their primary source for data. The report includes two measures of institutionalization: raw numbers and rates. The rates are calculated per 100,000 people in the general population. Experts told us both measures matter. But, they said, comparing rates, rather than raw numbers, accounts for the likelihood that more populous states institutionalize more people. Drewniak said Christie’s statement was based on the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities report from 2008, but acknowledged more recent figures have become available. "The 2008 information (and New Jersey’s rank vis-a-vis Texas) has apparently been established in the policy lexicon/discussion here in New Jersey and, thus, has been referred to on several occasions by the Governor, including [on Feb. 21] in the budget speech. Regardless, the data from 2011, shows NJ is still 49th in the nation," Drewniak said in an e-mail. In the most recent report, New Jersey had 2,703 people living in state-operated institutions of 16 or more people. Only Texas had more people living in such institutions, at 4,899 people. Sharon Lewis, commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said different groups may define institution in various ways. But state-operated facilities with 16 or more people is one definition. The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities ranks states and Washington, D.C. by the number of developmentally disabled people in large, state-operated institutions as a rate per 100,000 of the state’s general population. By that measure, New Jersey ranks 49th, followed by Arkansas and Mississippi. Texas ranks 43rd. State advocates for the developmentally disabled said by either measure New Jersey isn’t doing well. "We are very much behind the rest of the country in getting people out into to the community," said Alison M. Lozano, executive director of the New Jersey Council on Developmental Disabilities. "I think it’s a poor reflection on how we provide services in this state, unfortunately." Our ruling Christie said: "New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey." Christie is right, according to the population of large, state-operated institutions. Only Texas has more people with developmental disabilities in such institutions than New Jersey. However, as a rate compared to the general population, the governor is slightly off. Arkansas and Mississippi institutionalize more people with developmental disabilities than New Jersey by that measure. Texas is 43rd. Still, experts agree that the governor’s point is on target: New Jersey lags the rest of the country in moving people with developmental disabilities out of institutions and into the community.

pomt-05287	Says he fought for the repeal of a septic tank inspection program after "Tallahassee pulled a fast one."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/24/don-gaetz/tv-ad-don-gaetz-distorts-debate-over-septic-tank-i/	Florida’s next Senate president is telling voters in a new campaign ad that he fought to overturn a "fast one" pulled by Tallahassee lawmakers. "When Tallahassee pulled a fast one on septic tanks, Gaetz fought back," a TV advertisement says. That’s partially true. But Sen. Don Gaetz, a loquacious Republican from the Panhandle, is leaving something out when he discusses a never-enforced and now largely repealed measure requiring septic tank inspections every five years. He voted for the inspections. Twice. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Gaetz said he was misled about the inspection requirement by the Senate sponsor and a staff member, and that’s why he and other Republicans crusaded to have the inspection requirement tossed out of state law. But the public record doesn’t bear that out. "This bill was not a last-minute, surprise bill," said Sen. Paula Dockery, R-Lakeland, a member of the special committee that raised the prospect of mandatory inspections with residents in 2010. "I think that’s a little unfair -- a lot unfair." PolitiFact Florida decided to dig into the septic tank inspection requirement, which passed in 2010 and was removed for most counties in 2012. Then-Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, sponsored the measure as part of a larger conservation proposal (SB 550). There are about 2.6 million septic tanks in Florida, and about half are more than 30 years old, a 2008 Department of Health study found. (The Legislature had directed the agency to assess the costs of a statewide inspection program.) Officials expected the amount of annual septic tank inspections to increase from 17,000 to 500,000 because the of the new requirement. Constantine’s bill passed its required committees with ease, earning just a few no votes. Gaetz, elected to the Senate in 2006, voted against the bill during one committee stop. But when it came before the full Senate for final passage, Gaetz, like nearly every senator, cast floor votes in favor on April 26, 2010 (30-3), and April 29, 2010 (34-4). Most people who spoke at the committee’s statewide hearings before the session "spoke highly of the idea" of an inspection program, noted a 2010 summary of the committee’s work. "Not one speaker spoke against requiring inspections," the report stated. That changed almost immediately -- with Gaetz, other Republicans and at least one Democrat leading the backpedaling. They argued that the inspection requirement was a one-size-fits-all approach and that the price tag of inspections -- estimated around $150 or more -- was too high during an economic downturn. (PolitiFact Florida wrote about the cost issue during the 2011 session.) As frustration mounted among tea party members and his northwest Florida constituents, Gaetz was quoted as saying a repeal of the inspection requirement was already "teed up and and ready to go," according to November 2010 Bradenton Herald story. In another statement, he bemoaned the legislation’s burden "on many people in rural areas who are struggling to make it financially in these exceptionally hard times." Why the change of heart? Gaetz told PolitiFact Florida he voted for the bill after being "misled" by Constantine and committee staff about the bill’s consequences -- hence the "fast one." He asked Constantine privately outside the Senate chamber, he said, if this was the same proposal the Senate defeated the year before, and he said no (that proposal applied to some counties with larger springs and died in committee). Gaetz said he asked if he had anything to worry about, and Constantine told him no, it would affect areas Gaetz didn’t represent. "Constantine and the staff director attempted to reassure me and other senators that our concerns were misplaced," he said. "The whole Senate was operating under information that wasn’t entirely true." That’s why he crusaded against the inspections later, he said. Constantine insists he never misrepresented the septic tank program. "All the information was fully vested," Constantine said. Audio recordings of meetings in which Gaetz voted on SB 550 amplify Constantine’s position. The inspection requirement was added to the bill during the Senate Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means. Shortly before Gaetz’s no vote during that meeting, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, asked Constantine about the inspection program’s impact during a series of rapid-fire hypothetical questions. "Is this statewide?" Negron asked. "Yes," Constantine said. As the Senate approached its floor vote a few days later, Constantine fielded a question from Sen. Rudy Garcia, R-Hialeah: "Is this the one that has the septic tank language?" "This is the landmark bill for water resources and it includes that," Constantine said. There were no questions from Gaetz. Now, it’s true that Gaetz attempted to overturn the inspection requirement. During a special session in 2010, Gaetz sponsored a measure that pushed the program’s implementation date from Jan. 1, 2011, to July 1, 2011. Gov. Rick Scott allowed it to become law without his signature. (The Senate and the House waited until Scott was in office to deliver the bill to the governor for his signature or veto.) In 2011, Gaetz said he asked Senate budget chairman JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, to include budget language that would prevent the Department of Health from implementing the requirement for another year. And in 2012, Gaetz said he asked Senate President Mike Haridopolos to find a way to get rid of the mandate. A partial repeal wound up in a Department of Health reorganization bill (HB 1263), which Scott signed into law. The inspection requirement still exists for 19 counties with large springs, but they are allowed to opt out of the inspection requirement (as Hernando County did in early May.) In the end, Gaetz basically fought to get rid of a state law that he is partially responsible for. Gaetz says he was misled by "a fast one," but we found no evidence of the bill sponsor downplaying the swath of affected homeowners. Plus Gaetz ultimately is responsible to know what is in a bill he voted on. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Don Gaetz	None	None	None	2012-05-24T10:51:43	2012-05-18	['None']
pomt-09283	"Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/27/sherrod-brown/six-largest-banks-getting-bigger-brown-said/	Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is pushing a proposal to cap the sizes of large banks. He appeared on ABC News' This Week with Jake Tapper to talk about that, as well as Democratic efforts to pass financial reform. "Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake," Brown said. "Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. ... We've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen." Some very smart people disagree on Brown's point that big banks resist regulation by reason of their sheer mass. People like Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks. Meanwhile, people like Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning New York Times columnist, say that breaking up the banks isn't necessary to avert the next meltdown if the proper regulations are put in place. We were interested in Brown's statistic though: That 15 years ago the top six banks' assets totaled 17 percent of GDP, while today that's 63 percent. Brown's staff said he got the numbers from 13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown, a book by Johnson and James Kwak, that describes the financial crisis and advocates steps for reform, including limits on the size of banks. Johnson also cited the number in an article in the New Republic, co-written with Peter Boone, that criticized President Barack Obama for not pushing rules that are tougher on big banks. The numbers are a fairly straightforward calculation. You take the bank's total assets, such as loans, cash and securities. (Remember that to banks, a loan is an asset, since they make money off loans.) Then you divide by GDP, which is gross domestic product, and is the total economic output for a country during a given year. Last year, the U.S. gross domestic product was $14.3 trillion. Johnson's book lists the six biggest banks of 2009 as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The numbers in the book looked right to us, but we wanted to find an outside expert to confirm it. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia agreed to run the numbers to see if they got the same thing. Sure enough, they found the same thing. The figures were off by a few percentage points because the researchers were able to use numbers from the fourth quarter of 2009 and compared them with the same quarter in 1994. Johnson's book cites numbers from the third quarter. Here's the information the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia sent us: Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 2009 Bank of America Corp. - 2,224.5 JP Morgan Chase - 2,032.0 Citigroup - 1,856.6 Wells Fargo - 1,243.6 Goldman Sachs - 849.3 Morgan Stanley - 771.5 Total 8,977.5 Nominal GDP 14.453.8 Percentage 62.1% Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 1994 Citicorp - 250.5 BankAmerica Corp. - 215.5 Chemical Banking Corp. - 171.4 Nationsbank Corp. - 169.6 JP Morgan - 154.9 Chase Manhattan - 114.0 Total 1,075.9 Nominal GDP 7,248.2 Percentage 14.8% A couple of experts we asked about these numbers noted that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were for years categorized as investment banks, and would not have been counted in the 1994 numbers. That changed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, when the two firms became bank holding companies so they could borrow from the Federal Reserve. The underlying point, though -- that there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry -- remains true, they said. Brown said, "Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP." Independent sources and experts confirm that, so we rate his statement True.

pomt-13405	"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‘watered-down’ HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa."	false	/global-news/statements/2016/sep/23/daily-caller/conservative-website-wrongly-ties-clinton-foundati/	For the most part, Republican attacks on the Clinton Foundation have raised questions about its donors, but now an article from the conservative Daily Caller website challenges one of the foundation’s signature efforts, getting affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to patients worldwide. In a story headlined as an exclusive, a Daily Caller reporter wrote "Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‘watered-down’ HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa." The primary goal of the Clinton Health Access Initiative when it began in 2002 was to bring down the price tag of AIDS medicines. If the initiative were tied to distributing ineffective drugs, that would be a serious offense. We decided to drill into the details. HIV/AIDS Drugs and the Clinton Health Access Initiative The Daily Caller article is based on a draft version of a report on the Clinton Foundation from the office of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a conservative Republican from Tennessee. Blackburn’s staff focused on the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s dealings with the Indian generic drugmaker Ranbaxy. The initiative has become a key player in the worldwide supply chain of the antiretroviral drugs used to fight HIV/AIDS. In one fashion or another, it is tied to the treatment of about 11 million people facing the immune deficiency disease. While the details of the initiative’s role get complicated, at the bottom of it all is a simple idea: It brings together drug buyers (governments, nonprofits and multilateral aid bodies) that buy in large volume and generic drug makers who agree to price caps. The model has worked. The price of HIV/AIDS treatment plunged and low-cost Indian drugmakers remain an essential part of the equation. Ranbaxy was one of the original group of Indian firms that signed on with the Clinton initiative in 2003. Questions about non-HIV/AIDS drugs But Ranbaxy has faced serious problems with American regulators. In September 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter against Ranbaxy, citing the ways it was cutting corners in the production process at two facilities in India. The FDA’s main complaint was that the company had falsified test results on the stability (think shelf life) of a handful of drugs, none of which however were aimed at treating HIV/AIDS. To be safe, government regulators issued an import alert that blocked 30 drugs at the U.S. border. That longer list included two antiretrovirals used to treat HIV/AIDS. In 2013, the Justice Department filed charges, but again, none of the counts involved HIV/AIDS drugs. In 2013, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $500 million in fines and civil penalties. It admitted that it lied on its paperwork and that it allowed defective batches of drugs to treat acne and epilepsy into the U.S. market. The head of the FDA’s criminal investigations said his team had found evidence that those drugs "were defective, in that their strength differed from, or their purity or quality fell below, that which they purported to possess." The government calls such drugs adulterated, or, as the Daily Caller put it, "watered down." The FDA said in its original 2008 press release "FDA has no evidence to date that Ranbaxy has shipped defective products." FDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer told PolitiFact that applied to HIV/AIDS drugs. Were the drugs safe? So to recap: the Clinton Foundation was using HIV/AIDS drugs from a Indian company that was part of a U.S. government investigation. The company eventually admitted that it had falsified records for several drugs and paid a $500 million fine, but none of the drugs included in that group were HIV/AIDS medications. So what do we know about Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs? The FDA said there were no grounds for a drug recall, and on that point it had plenty of company. The World Health Organization had been keeping tabs on Ranbaxy since 2004, including testing Ranbaxy’s finished products. That year, inspectors found problems with Ranbaxy’s drugs and decertified three of its HIV/AIDS medicines. The company then withdrew all of its HIV/AIDS drugs from the WHO’s approved drug list. There was a drug recall in South Africa. (At the time, the Clinton initiative did little work there.) In 2005, the WHO restored seven Ranbaxy medications to its list of prequalified HIV/AIDS drugs. In a 2013 summary report, WHO said, "Since 2004, international cooperation between stringent regulators and WHO-Prequalification Program has been enhanced to allow early sharing of regulatory intelligence and to facilitate coordinated action, when necessary. At present, there is no evidence that any of the Ranbaxy products currently included on the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products are of unacceptable quality." Put simply, since 2005, no regulator has found its HIV/AIDS drugs defective or issued a recall of its products. That list includes agencies in the United Kingdom and South Africa, where HIV/AIDS is an enormous problem. South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Through our partnership with Africa Check, reporter Vinayak Bhardwaj confirmed that South Africa’s Medicines Control Council had been conducting random tests of Ranbaxy products. In 2013, the council declared the drugs "safe and effective." Even Blackburn’s report, which is the evidence for the Daily Caller’s claim, added a key qualifier, saying the "Clinton Foundation likely facilitated the distribution of watered-down HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa through its Clinton Health Access Initiative" (emphasis ours). Given that many regulators had declared those drugs safe, we asked Blackburn’s office for evidence that proved the foundation likely distributed watered-down drugs. We have yet to receive a response.(Deeper in its article, the Daily Caller wrote of "the possibility" that the Clinton initiative distributed diluted drugs.) Ellen 't Hoen, the former point person at the charity group Doctors Without Borders for HIV/AIDS drugs, told us this allegation is not new. "It is a nonsense story circulated by right-wing groups," 't Hoen said. This is not to say that Ranbaxy has not continued to run afoul of international standards. Since 2012, the FDA has dropped three additional Ranbaxy drugs from its approved list. But generally, it’s violations tend to cluster around failures to follow the best manufacturing methods. Serious allegations that Ranbaxy sells shoddy drugs have come from several quarters. The American government said that when it filed charges against the drugmaker in 2010. So did several former Ranbaxy executives, according to a Fortune magazine article. They told Fortune, "Ranbaxy had used ingredients that failed purity tests and blended them with good ingredients until the resulting mix met requirements. Such a mélange could degrade or become toxic far more quickly than drugs made from the high-quality materials required." The Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy Still, the cloud around Ranbaxy was enough to force the Clinton Foundation’s hand. In 2008, it offered a two-pronged response. Except for two specialized compounds designed for children, it stopped buying any Ranbaxy drugs itself. It also warned sub-Saharan governments and others in its buyer network to take extra steps to confirm the quality of Ranbaxy’s products. It told them to switch to other manufacturers where possible, and if they had to buy from Ranbaxy, they should step up testing of every batch and toughen up the quality control requirements in their contracts. It continued to list Ranbaxy’s products in its menu of approved generic drugs. Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for the initiative, told us the nonprofit "left the decision to the governments as to what they should do." Lachapelle said the Clinton initiative limited its buying of Ranbaxy drugs to the pediatric medications (all of which it tested) to be ultra cautious. But it didn’t push governments to do the same because neither the FDA nor WHO said the drugs were unsafe, nor did they recall any products. Lachapelle said this created a dilemma for sub-Saharan African governments. "If patients taking antiretroviral drugs suffer an interruption in the drugs they are supposed to take every day, there is a danger that they can develop resistance to the drugs which reduces their effectiveness when they re-start them," Lachapelle said. "They can also suffer an increase in viral load and a decline in the strength of their immune systems which can lead to severe illness and death." In its 2008 memo to governments, the Clinton initiative said "CHAI believes that either decision — to continue purchasing these products from Ranbaxy or to purchase from alternative sources — is potentially reasonable depending on a country’s specific circumstances." Our ruling The Daily Caller said that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative distributed "watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa." At the most literal level, the statement is a misreading of a report from a conservative Republican who said the foundation "likely facilitated" the distribution of watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs. Neither version of the claim -- centering around the drugmaker Ranbaxy -- is proven. In fact, a host of regulatory agencies have found the drugs in question to be safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said there was no evidence the drugs themselves were substandard. The World Health Organization, South Africa’s Medicines Control Council and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency tested the Ranbaxy drugs and found them to be safe. Such testing dates back to at least 2005. We rate this statement False. Update and correction (Sept. 29, 2016): After this item posted, we heard from Mark Tapscott, executive editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization that says it provides investigative reporting for the public benefit. The group does not publicly list its donors. Tapscott listed what he called nine factual errors in our story. We reviewed his claims and found most of them without merit, as they failed to distinguish between Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs and its other products. Tapscott, however, correctly noted that in 2004 WHO decertified three of Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs. Ranbaxy’s HIV/AIDS drugs were recertified the following year. The story now reflects that information, as well as the correct year in which the Justice Department filed charges against Ranbaxy. Our rating remains unchanged. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19ee7189-664a-4b8e-869b-f11f5b211c33	None	Daily Caller	None	None	None	2016-09-23T12:49:07	2016-09-19	['Bill_Clinton', 'Africa', 'HIV/AIDS', 'Clinton_Foundation']

pomt-06655	Says that in his book, Rick Perry said that "Social Security is unconstitutional."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-rick-perry-believes-social-2/	In the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express Republican debate, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney attacked one of his rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for his stance on Social Security. Romney charged that Perry had, in writing a 2010 book, "pointed out that in his view ... Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states." The charge echoed one that Romney had made in a mailer sent to Florida voters shortly before the debate. The mailer asks, "Social Security Unconstitutional? Rick Perry believes Social Security is unconstitutional." It then cites an excerpt from Perry’s book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington: "Social Security is something that we’ve been forced to accept for more than 70 years now. … at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government." We looked at Perry’s book to see whether Romney’s charges were fair. The relevant portion of the book seeks to change readers’ interpretations of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. Traditionally, Perry argues, historians have considered the New Deal an important bulwark against economic collapse during the Great Depression. But in Perry’s view, the New Deal was in fact a disastrous policy that expanded the government’s reach, curbed individual rights and set the nation on a path to, as he put it, "socialism." "There has been a slow march to socialize this country and rob us of our most basic and fundamental right to live free," Perry wrote. "This march -- rooted in the Progressive movement and expanded in modern liberalism -- has been punctuated by periods of staggering government growth predicated on the notion that some problems are so big that only Washington can solve them, but only in ways that ignore the words of the Constitution. It is in these moments of crisis that Americans are most susceptible to government overreaching." A key culprit, he writes, was the Supreme Court, which had previously stood against a strong central government but during the 1930s lent its support -- wrongly, in Perry’s view -- to Roosevelt’s expansive agenda. During the New Deal, "an arrogant President Roosevelt and an emboldened Congress saw the opportunity to use a crisis to expand Washington's influence, and the Supreme Court let them do it by abdicating its role as the protector of constitutional federalism," Perry wrote. "We allowed the Supreme Court and its lower courts to assume a role not envisioned for them by the Founders," Perry added. "We allowed them to become policy makers by judicial fiat and to ignore their fundamental job of interpreting the Constitution and the law as given to them instead of reading virtually everything under the sun into narrowly written clauses." This is the backdrop to the quote used by the Romney campaign. Here’s the full quote Romney uses to justify the charge that Perry "believes Social Security is unconstitutional": "Social Security is something we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now," Perry writes. "Because of that, Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman wrote, the program is ‘one of those things on which the tyranny of the status quo is beginning to work its magic.’ Despite the controversy that surrounded its inception, it has come to be so much taken for granted that its desirability is hardly questioned any longer. And there stands a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal, in stark contrast to the mythical notion of salvation to which it has wrongly been attached for too long, all at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government." We won’t address the validity of Perry’s interpretation of the motivations behind the New Deal, or its long-term consequences. (Though we are certain that a robust debate could be waged over that question.) Instead, we’ll focus on whether Romney is justified in saying that Perry "believes Social Security is unconstitutional." In analyzing Romney’s charge, we are interpreting it to mean that Romney is referring to Perry’s personal view about the constitutionality of Social Security. We don’t think that Romney is simply saying that Perry is misinformed by believing that the Supreme Court has actually ruled Social Security to be unconstitutional. So does Perry’s book support Romney’s contention? Perry never explicitly says, "Social Security is unconstitutional," or "If I were on the Supreme Court, I would vote to declare Social Security unconstitutional." But the clear message of the passages about the constitutionality of Social Security is that Perry believes that the Roosevelt administration made a wrong turn when it pursued the New Deal, and that the Supreme Court enabled that change by bowing to the administration’s wishes, junking its own limited-government judicial precedents in the process. If Romney is saying that Perry’s personal opinion is that Social Security is unconstitutional -- and we think that is indeed what Romney is saying -- then the former Massachusetts governor can find support for that charge in Perry’s writings. In our view, Perry makes a pretty clear argument that the Supreme Court should not have granted its approval to the New Deal in the 1930s, and that one result of the court’s actions is that "we’ve been forced to accept (Social Security) for more than 70 years now." The fact that Perry never explicitly wrote the words "Social Security is unconstitutional" keeps this statement from a full True rating, but we think that the conclusion Romney draws from Perry’s book supports that general notion. We rate Romney’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-09-12T21:49:02	2011-09-12	['None']
pomt-01865	"Without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/11/kendall-jones/texas-teen-hunter-kendall-jones-without-hunting-no/	Texas teenage cheerleader Kendall Jones, the hunter who became the hunted, shot back at critics recently, defending her controversial big game hunts as conservation efforts. Jones made news by posting photos of her hunting trip to Zimbabwe on her Facebook page, posing and grinning next to her kills -- including a lion and other big cats. The pictures created an uproar among animal lovers and Jones was labeled the "most eminently hateable person on the Internet right now." But the 19-year-old -- who counts more than 577,000 fans of her Facebook page -- says these outraged animal lovers are missing the point. "Tanzania also has 15 photo-safari areas, which have been lauded as a non-consumptive alternative to traditional hunting tourism," Jones wrote in a July 2, 2014, Facebook post, quoting National Geographic magazine. "Unfortunately, only 4 of the 15 photo-safari areas are financially viable. The remaining 11 are subsidized by hunter-generated funds. So without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management." The point being, if people like Jones didn’t pay to hunt, then wildlife lovers wouldn’t have any animals to look at. We wondered: Is Jones really a misunderstood Artemis or just a wolf in sheep’s clothing? Falling prey to false facts A quick Google search confirmed that the quote Jones referenced is indeed from National Geographic, published Sept. 2, 2013. But it’s from an opinion piece titled "African Lions Should Not Be Listed as Endangered," submitted to the magazine by Melissa Simpson of Safari Club International, a conservation group composed of hunters. Simpson wrote, "The regulated hunters in Africa make a vital contribution to conservation efforts, primarily through the revenues their hunting expeditions generate for local communities and wildlife resource agencies." Historically, game reserves in Africa were set up by colonial sport hunters when animal populations began to disappear in the 19th and 20th centuries from over-hunting by early European settlers, according to environmental historian John MacKenzie. But today, sustainable trophy hunting alone is not enough to protect wildlife and stop poachers, said African Wildlife Foundation spokesperson Kathleen Garrigan. It’s just one of a set of "tools" used to protect wildlife and habitats. And that’s only under good governance, at a low volume, and with social and economic benefits to local people, according to guidelines set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), one the world’s leading conservation groups. Others share a similar view on game reserves. Both the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation and wildlife conservationists say that hunting tourism can do good for communities and wildlife, where alternatives are not possible. Photo tourism, which needs more capital and infrastructure to implement, won’t work for certain landscapes, says IUCN ecologist Rosie Cooney. "There are areas with sufficiently low density of animals that no tourist is going to pay thousands of dollars a night to chase them around. In the Serengeti, people will line up two years in advance to see animals because there are scores of them but, in other parts, that’s just not the case," said mammal biologist Bruce Paterson. In these areas, especially where human populations are growing, trophy hunting can foot the bill for keeping natural landscapes natural. But assuring healthy animal populations requires hunting operators to be knowledgeable about population dynamics and reasonable about trophy quotas, the age of the animals hunted, profit margins, etc., Paterson said. There are only about 500 West African lions left, which are considered fair game because they’re mistakenly grouped with other African lions instead of their real family, endangered Asian lions. And when trophy hunting is successful in maintaining large wildlife populations and diversity, it’s well-managed, well-regulated, and often paired with other efforts. "South Africa, through an aggressive conservation initiative that involved ecotourism, hunting, breeding, translocations, and other conservation efforts, was largely responsible for bringing the southern white rhinoceros back from the brink of extinction," Garrigan said. Trophy hunting doesn’t do it alone So while experts say trophy hunting can help wildlife management, they agree that it’s just one way to do so. As for which tool is the sharpest in the tool shed, the IUCN says it’s not trophy hunting. With the same level of management and regulation, the conservation results in hunting areas are lower than those obtained by the neighbouring national parks, the IUCN wrote in a 2009 report. In some places, without the proper oversight, the hunting industry is actually contributing to wildlife declines, Garrigan said. On top of that, there’s even less of a bite in the financial argument for trophy hunting. "Sure, some element of (wildlife management) is happening with fees paid by hunters who go into fishbowls to shoot fish. But the major thrusts are governments and private managers of the photo tours," said environmental historian James McCann. Contrary to Jones’ Facebook claim, the non-consumptive tourism sector -- meaning you can look but you can’t touch -- is overall more profitable than trophy hunting. Botswana recently banned hunting in favor of high-cost, low-density ecotourism. Tanzania’s national park system actually receives about $11 million annually from just one photographic tourism area, whereas hunting revenue altogether averages $10.5 million, according to wildlife conservationist Peter Lindsey. "Photographic ecotourism undoubtedly generates greater gross revenues than trophy hunting in Africa, and where large numbers of tourists visit, employment opportunities for local peoples can be higher than just hunting," Lindsey wrote in a widely cited 2006 study that actually recommends trophy hunting. Hunting groups including Safari International, NGOs and academics alike report that the entire trophy hunting industry generates about $200 million in annual revenue, $100 million in South Africa alone. But this figure, which comes from Lindsey’s study, is questionable, says the Economists at Large in their 2013 report. The $100 million figure, for example, was taken from an unpublished study by the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa. Whatever the number, trophy hunting revenue is a small slice of the pie. Altogether the IUCN reports that the hunters are contributing all of 1.3 percent of tourism revenue in the big game countries, and have created 0.0001 percent of the jobs (and most are part time). Averaged out over land used, hunting generates less than $2 per hectare -- about $1 if we exclude South Africa -- and moreover, local communities get just a dime of that. In Tanzania, where the financial contribution by game revenue is the highest, hunting contributes to about 0.3 percent of the national budget but uses about a quarter of land. Our ruling Jones, who has been criticized for posting photos of big game kills while visiting in Africa, claimed that, "Without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management." First, while the quote was published in National Geographic, it was written as part of a pro-hunting opinion piece. Second, the claim is inaccurate. Experts agree that hunting reserves can help wildlife management in the right circumstances, but other efforts -- including ecotourism and photo tourism -- have a more significant impact. No matter the size of the contribution, it’s clear that wildlife management isn’t solely being supported by big game hunts. We rate Jones’ claim False.

pomt-00813	"Today roughly half of born-again Christians aren’t voting. They’re staying home."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/mar/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-today-roughly-half-born-again-christ/	Declaring for president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told a crowd at Liberty University, the Virginia institution founded by evangelist Jerry Falwell: "Today roughly half of born-again Christians aren’t voting. They’re staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values." At least since Ronald Reagan won the presidency, Republicans have viewed conservative Christians--specifically white evangelical Christians--as pivotal. And in the latest presidential race, in 2012, born-again Christians comprised 26 percent of all voters, most of them saying they voted for GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls commissioned by news organizations. By phone and email, Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute told us white evangelical Christians vote in equal or larger proportions than other Americans. Still, he said, the share of white Christian voters has declined. In 1992, he said, 75 percent of voters identified that way while in 2012, 57 percent did so. Key factors are increasing ethnic diversity and fewer young Americans affiliating with a religion, Jones said. He noted a fall 2014 institute study breaking down the religious denominations of Americans. So, could it be that that these days, about half of born-again Christians aren’t voting? Political scientists we reached wondered if Cruz was solely talking about voters in presidential elections--seems logical--and if he really meant to emphasize only white evangelical Protestants rather than all born-agains. That seems likely since many African Americans, who tend to vote Democratic, identify as born-again Christians, which loosely refers to individuals who have made or renewed a commitment to Jesus Christ as their personal savior. Cruz’s backup We didn’t hear back from Cruz about his claim until we initially published this fact check. As we’ll detail, available voter surveys suggested born-again Christian turnouts of 58 percent to 63 percent in the 2012 elections--meaning 42 percent of such voters or fewer stayed home. By email, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said Cruz reached his "roughly half" conclusion starting from a 2007 survey by the non-partisan Pew Research Center indicating 26.3 percent of American adults identified as evangelical Protestants. The center conducted a "nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults living in continental United States telephone households" from May 8, 2007 to Aug. 13, 2007. Apply that result to the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimate of adults who were eligible to vote in 2012, 215 million, Tyler wrote, and it looks like nearly 57 million of citizens eligible to vote in 2012 belonged to evangelical Protestant churches. Separately, he pointed out, Pew cited voter exit polls taken for news organizations to conclude 23 percent of the nation’s November 2012 voters were white evangelical Protestants. Given that 129 million voters participated that fall, Tyler said, that means there were about 30 million evangelical Protestant voters, which would have been about half of the evangelical Protestants eligible to vote. Next, we asked political scientists who had already weighed in on Cruz’s claim to assess Cruz’s methodology. Most said Cruz inappropriately mixed apples and oranges by applying the 2007 survey results to 2012 voter exit polls though a University of Texas professor, Daron Shaw, said, "I don’t know that the Cruz numbers are any less plausible" than estimates we’d earlier tracked down. We also reached out to Pew researcher Gregory Smith, who declined to comment on Cruz’s methodology though he cautioned generally against reaching any conclusions by relying on different surveys asking different questions taken in different years. Smith said, though, it looks like white evangelical Protestants comprised about as much of the electorate in 2012--23 percent, according to voter exit polls--as they did of the population (19 percent, according to Pew surveys taken in 2012). Smith’s nudge: Given that 54 percent of eligible Americans voted for president in 2012, according to the U.S. Election Project overseen by Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, Smith said, it’s not implausible that about half of white born-again Christians didn’t vote. "Half of everybody didn’t vote," Smith said. Earlier, we looked for independent analyses of born-again turnout. American National Election Studies Experts told us a good way to gauge turnout among born-again Christians is a national project that has surveyed people about voting every presidential election year since 1952. Next, Patricia Luevano of the American National Election Studies, overseen by researchers at the University of Michigan and Stanford University, told us by email that after the 2012 elections, some 83 percent of born-again Christians interviewed in person said they had voted with 78 percent of born-again Christians interviewed online saying so. Gadzooks! Then again, Luevano wrote: "It should be noted, of course, that this is self-report," her point being that individuals sometimes declare they voted even if they didn’t. Don’t run with those figures, Shaw told us, because "you cannot just put out a self-reported turnout figure without acknowledging that these numbers are significantly inflated." We didn’t figure out how to accurately shrink those figures. Fortuitously, the national study does so for voters it interviews in person by checking public records, a lead investigator told us by phone. The upshot for 2012, Stanford University’s Simon Jackman said, is that 63 percent of born-again Christians voted. Overall, the survey drew on 2,054 in-person interviews with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, he said. Some 18 percent of these born-again voters were African American, Jackman said by email. So we pressed Jackman to focus on those voters more likely to vote Republican. He said 68 percent of white born-again Christians voted (again, a conclusion based on checking what people said against voting records). Other analyses We identified a couple of other surveys per turnout by born-again Christians--and noticed an older study indicating half of born-again Christians voting. Stephen Ansolabehere of Harvard University said by email that according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, 65 percent of 18,559 born-again Christians said they voted in the 2012 elections. Adjusting for some people saying they voted when they did not, he said, knocks the rate of voting born-again Christians to 58 percent to 59 percent. John C. Green of the University of Akron said its voter surveys indicate 61 percent of born-again Christians voted in 2012. It’s worth noting, he emailed, "that it takes a lot of effort to mobilize all kinds of voters, including evangelicals. Getting to 61% took a huge effort." Footnote: A Washington Post news story published after Cruz’s declaration pointed out the University of Akron study covering the 2000 election year. That year, researchers found, 50 percent of white evangelical voters cast ballots--as did half of black Protestants, half of Roman Catholics and 58 percent of mainline Protestants. Our ruling Cruz said: "Today roughly half of born-again Christians aren’t voting." This may have been so in the 2000 presidential election year. But if we’re talking about voting for president lately, surveys suggest born-again Christian turnouts of 58 percent to 63 percent in 2012--meaning 42 percent of voters or fewer stayed home.

pomt-14838	"There is currently no ability to vet these people," referring to Syrian refugees.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/19/ben-carson/ben-carson-there-currently-no-ability-vet-syrian-r/	In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, many have suggested that, given the lack of proper screening, accepting Syrian refugees would be akin to inviting in the enemy. "There is currently no ability to vet these people. By letting refugees into our country without vetting we are putting America at risk," Republican candidate Ben Carson wrote in an official statement posted on Facebook on Nov. 16. Is Carson right that we don’t vet the refugees? Well, it’s more that we can’t, Carson spokesperson Doug Watts told us. "There is no foolproof and effective way of vetting these people," Watts said. "That’s his opinion, shared by millions of others, and confirmed by thousands of felonies occurring at the hands of both legal and illegal immigrants." But Carson said we don’t vet refugees, and that isn’t correct. Carson has a point that the system isn’t foolproof, but the ability to screen refugees does exist. How we vet refugees Let’s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process, which has been in place since 1980 and was retooled after 9/11. Before refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO — determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months. Once the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are approved, according to the State Department. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. According to Buzzfeed, Syrian refugees are also being vetted through a secret national security screening program. The program, the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Process, is specifically used to screen people deemed potential national security threats. While the checks are being conducted, trained DHS officers interview refugees in person. (Most interviews with Syrian refugees happen in Amman, Istanbul and Cairo.) Refugees who’ve been cleared by the officer, the State Department and the background checks then undergo medical screenings, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes and one final security clearance. This process typically takes one to two years, if not longer, and happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Gaps and challenges There are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees, with intelligence and national security officials highlighting the paucity of data in particular. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October that the intelligence in Syria is "not as rich as we would like it to be," while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are "gaps" in data availability. "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them," Comey said in a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Oct. 21. The lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which describes itself as "low immigration, pro-immigrant." "The country is in chaos and the identities and claims of the applicants are nearly impossible to verify. We can check our databases and fingerprint repositories, and so on, but if we have collected little information on Syrians, it will not help," Vaughan said The case against alarm Challenges, however, don’t translate into "no ability" to vet at all. "No system is foolproof. If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely," said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who’s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. "The alarm is way overblown." Experts and advocates pushed back on the notion that we accept refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department. There’s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the U.S. refugee system. The concerns stemming from the Syrian passport found in connection to the Paris attacks don’t apply here, experts said. That’s because the European vetting process for refugees arriving by sea is extremely chaotic and not comparable to the processes used by the UN and United States. In the United States, very few resettled refugees — three since 9/11, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker — have been implicated in terrorist situations. Daryl Grisgraber of Refugees International pointed out that the Tsarnaevs came to the United States as children from Chechnya and applied for asylum, but were radicalized here. "We’ve also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we’ve done this successfully time and time again without incident," said Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA. And finally, refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States. So for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program "makes no operational sense," said Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University. It would be more likely for ISIS to find Europeans who could travel to the United States on business or tourist visas. "Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?" she said. Our ruling Carson said, "There is currently no ability to vet these people," referring to Syrian refugees. The United States vets refugees through a process that involves multiple federal and international groups and that typically takes one to two years. Refugees undergo security checks, interviews, medical screenings and other steps. Carson has a point that there is some concern over insufficient data, though some say the concern is exaggerated. Even if there are gaps and challenges in the vetting process, it’s a far cry to say there’s no ability at all to vet refugees. We rate Carson’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-14846	"Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-3000-killed-guns-between-nevada-an/	At the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more gun control. "Just think about this -- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns," she said. The Iowa debate took place Nov. 14, and the Las Vegas debate happened on Oct. 13. Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the most recent CDC tally -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents. If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month. But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn’t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December. The only alternative we could find is the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths by combing through police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily. The Gun Violence Archive’s numbers aren’t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted 12,500 gun deaths in 2014 and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn't include suicides, which make up more than half of all gun deaths. The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive's executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in. So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton’s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts. "My call is that Clinton’s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility," said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida. In fact, the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis. Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted. One final note on Clinton’s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- "killed by guns" -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC. Our ruling Clinton said, "Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns." We found a few problems with her statement. First, we don’t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton’s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There’s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton’s claim is probably not too far off. But we can’t know for sure. Also, it’s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton’s phrasing obscures that point. Clinton used very specific language even though she’s actually extrapolating from old data. Overall, we rate her claim Half True. Editor's note: The Gun Violence Archive got back to us after publication, and we've updated the piece to include their comments.

pomt-01303	"The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the" campaign against the city’s light-rail proposition.	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/29/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-austin-tea-party-and-conservati/	U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett’s smiling face appears on a mailer sent out by a group advocating voter approval of a City of Austin rail proposition on the November 2014 ballot. We noticed a not-so-happy message. "Don’t let the Tea Party fool you," says a headline below the photo of the Democratic congressman from Austin on the placard mailed to voters by Let’s Go Austin, a group that favors the proposal to spend $1 billion on a light rail line and roads. Doggett goes on to say: "Proposition 1 is a smart investment in Austin’s future." Below, he extolls the spending plan and then says: "The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the misleading campaign against Prop. 1, but don’t you buy it." The mailer doesn’t say how opponents have been "misleading." Setting aside that characterization, we wondered if Doggett was right about the Austin Tea Party and a conservative millionaire leading the "no" campaign. An Oct. 8, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news story on spending by forces for or against the proposal didn’t mention tea-party groups while identifying Citizens Against Rail Taxes as the major group working against approval and briefly mentioning Our Rail, which the story described as opposing the proposal and preferring a different rail route. According to the story, Citizens Against Rail Taxes had raised nearly $279,000 through late September 2014 from 13 donors including the retired high-tech executive serving as the group’s treasurer, Jim Skaggs, who the story personally credited with giving $50,000. Our Rail had raised $760, the story said Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, told us via spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale that Skaggs has supported "ultra-conservatives" like Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and state Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels. "Surely," Doggett also said by email, "the Austin Tea Party doesn’t deny its active opposition to Prop. 1." Lynda Rife, campaign manager for Let’s Go Austin, separately confirmed by email Doggett was referring to the Austin Tea Party, which recommended voters oppose the proposition in an Oct. 19, 2014, online post, she pointed out. That post said in part: "This is just another boondoggle thought up by our current corrupt and mismanaged city council." Before that, Rife noted, Americans for Prosperity, a national group supportive of tea-party efforts, brought Cato Institute anti-rail activist Randal O’Toole to Austin for September 2014 events promoted by the Austin Tea Party. Also, Rife pointed out, the group has posted multiple messages opposing the proposal on its Facebook page. Rife said the millionaire in the ad is Skaggs, the retired CEO and board chair of Tracor Inc. "Skaggs," Rife asserted, "has an extensive history of giving to Republican candidates and organizations in both state and federal elections." Austin Tea Party Campaign finance filings with the City of Austin don’t show any Austin Tea Party expenditures in the run-up to balloting. By phone, Dean Wright, the group’s organizer, told us the group hasn’t spent money opposing Prop. 1. Otherwise, Wright said, it’s referred what he estimated to be close to 3,000 individuals in its network to Citizens Against Rail Taxes, which he said has taken "the leadership position." Wright said the Austin Tea Party supports CART’s messaging. We saw several anti-rail-proposition messages in the Austin Tea Party’s Twitter posts including a message written Oct. 24, 2014 referring to Doggett as "Kickback Lloyd" that was linked to its criticisms of Doggett’s pro-proposition message. Jim Skaggs By email, Skaggs confirmed he’s a millionaire. He didn’t commit to membership in any party. "I frankly do not frequent the political world and do not really know the definition of ‘conservative,’" Skaggs wrote. "I am a common-sense person and dislike some of what all parties do. I was born a Central Texas Democrat." Skaggs said Rife was incorrect about Americans for Prosperity bringing O’Toole to Austin. We reached O’Toole by phone who told us that out of interest in the rail vote, he decided to visit, going on to acquire his own plane ticket. O’Toole, who said he stayed with Skaggs, said Americans for Prosperity sponsored one of his Austin events by reserving the room. Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission showed Skaggs making about 100 donations totaling over $100,000 to state-level Republican candidates or political groups from 2002 to September 2014; the biggest one was $10,000 given in 2008 to the political arm of the Texas Republican Advisory Council. Skaggs also has contributed to multiple Republican candidates or groups involved in federal races. In 2013, Skaggs gave donations of $2,600 to U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and Roger Williams, both R-Austin, according to information drawn from federal campaign finance filings by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics. In May 2014, the center indicates, Skaggs gave $300 to the Republican National Committee. Over earlier years, another search of the center’s database indicates, Skaggs (who lives a few miles from the Texas Capitol in a part of Travis County not in Austin) gave money to Republicans including Cruz ($1,250); Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (more than $4,000); President George W. Bush ($4,000); 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ($4,000); Sen. John McCain, the party’s 2008 nominee ($2,300); and presidential hopefuls Ron Paul ($1,000) and Herman Cain ($300). In the early 1990s, Skaggs contributed to two Democrats, the center's database suggests, then-U.S. Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma ($500) and then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico ($250). Our ruling Doggett said: "The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the" campaign against the city’s light-rail proposition. Skaggs seems wealthy, has supported Republican candidates and is treasurer for the major group battling Prop. 1. The Austin Tea Party opposes the proposal too. However, the group hasn’t spent a dime on the cause and doesn’t appear to be a major mover in the anti-Prop. 1 campaign. We find this statement Half True.

pomt-10483	"Among his (Obama's) pet projects is a bill ... which would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/15/focus-family-action/the-bill-has-no-such-spending-requirement/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, warns that Obama sponsored legislation that commits the United States to drastically increasing foreign aid. "Among his pet projects is a bill he sponsored called the Global Poverty Act, which would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid," the article on the group's Web site says. "Over 13 years, that will amount to a whopping $845-billion increase over current foreign-aid spending! Get your checkbooks ready!" The Global Poverty Act, introduced by Obama on Dec. 7, 2007 — along with Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel and Democrat Maria Cantwell — would "require the president to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to further the United States foreign policy objective of promoting the reduction of global poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by one-half the proportion of people worldwide, between 1990 and 2015, who live on less than $1 per day." Focus on the Family takes that statement to mean the bill would adopt all of the United Nations' Millenium Project recommendations, one of which is that high-income countries like the United States should increase their foreign aid to 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015. (According to the Millenium Project Web page, in 2004, total aid from the industrialized countries totaled $78.6-billion — or about 0.25% of their collective GNP. The United States, the report states, donated 0.16 percent of its gross national income.) Minnery said his group's interpretation of the legislation originated with an article by Cliff Kincaid for Accuracy in Media on Feb. 12, 2008. That story reached a much wider audience when Rush Limbaugh parroted Kincaid's claim on his nationally syndicated radio show. But according to staff members for several of the legislators pushing the bill, Kincaid misread the legislation. The act adopts only the first recommendation from the U.N. Millenium Project, the one that requires countries to develop strategies to halve by 2015 the number of people who live in extreme poverty, on less than $1 per day. So the claim that the Global Poverty Act would commit the United States to spending 0.7 percent of its gross national product on foreign aid? "That's just not factual," said Jordan Stark, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel. Again, a Republican. "The bill simply requires the president to develop and implement a U.S.-determined strategy to reduce global poverty and does not mandate any new spending," Stark said. But don't just take his word for it. The Congressional Budget Office on March 28, 2008, estimated the cost of implementing the bill would be less than $1-million per year. According to the CBO report, the bill would require the president to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce global poverty, including "more effective forms of development assistance, coordination of efforts with other countries and international organizations, and continuation of existing initiatives to reduce poverty and disease in developing countries." It also would require the State Department to prepare several reports. But, "enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or receipts." Now, maybe the president decides that in order to address extreme global poverty the United States ought to kick in more. But the president would not be tied to any dollar figure in this bill. The statement — which began with Kincaid and was repeated by Focus on the Family Action — is False.

pomt-02666	"We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation’s history."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/12/robert-gibbs/robert-gibbs-says-us-has-been-afghanistan-longer-n/	Liberal pundits are trying to defuse criticism of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy stemming from a new memoir by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. In the book, Gates writes that Obama "eventually lost faith in the troop increase he ordered in Afghanistan, his doubts fed by top White House civilian advisers opposed to the strategy, who continually brought him negative news reports suggesting it was failing," according to the New York Times, which obtained an advance copy. Obama’s former press secretary Robert Gibbs argued on Meet the Press that Obama’s position is not surprising given his pledge to draw down the wars in his first presidential campaign. "Look, Barack Obama was, and I assume continues to be, skeptical of our military ability to solve Afghanistan," Gibbs said. "We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation’s history." For this fact-check, we relied primarily on previous PolitiFact examinations. The conflict in Afghanistan has been running for more than 12 years, since American troops entered the country in 2001. The U.S. began its anti-terror military operations Oct. 7, 2001, about one month after the Sept. 11 attacks. Obama had planned for all troops to be out of Afghanistan by Dec. 31, 2014 -- marking more than 13 years of military there -- though a draft accord leaves as many as 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. That’s longer than the major United States interventions in World War I and World War II. It’s also longer than the conflict in Korea, and both wars in Iraq. The second Iraq war lasted for more than eight years. It began with a U.S.-led military coalition entering the country on March 20, 2003, aimed at finding Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Obama pulled out the last U.S. troops by the end of December 2011. The closest major conflict to Afghanistan in terms of length is Vietnam. The start date of the Vietnam war is somewhat fuzzy because it escalated slowly with the Eisenhower administration establishing a military presence in South Vietnam in the 1950s. However, most say the war started with the Tonkin Gulf resolution on Aug. 7, 1964, and ended either in 1973 or 1975 -- after about 10 ½ years. So while Gibbs is on solid ground, there are a couple of things worth noting. Gibbs’ measure excludes broader "wars." To reach the conclusion that Afghanistan is the longest foreign war in U.S. history, you need to exclude the 46-year-old Cold War and the presence of military forces in South Korea decades after the on-the-ground battle concluded. University of North Carolina historian Richard H. Kohn said in a 2010 interview that some might consider the conflict in Afghanistan part of the "war on terror." But by that logic, the wars in Korea and Vietnam also could be considered part of the Cold War. The "Banana Wars" in Latin America in the early 20th century lasted longer but didn’t always include active fighting. These wars were not declared wars but "relatively quick-in-and-out interventions which kept happening over and over," said Max Boot, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power. The goal was to preserve U.S. economic, political and strategic interests in various Caribbean-area countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Panama, said Alan McPherson, a University of Oklahoma professor and author of The Invaded: How Latin Americans and Their Allies Fought and Ended U.S. Occupations. The longest consistent military occupation was in politically unstable Haiti from 1915 to 1934. That does not translate to 19 years of straight fighting, though there were two short periods of wars that were "nowhere near the fighting we’ve had in Afghanistan," McPherson said. The U.S. military presence mainly ran the government. There were 2,000-3,000 marines in Haiti at the height of the U.S. occupation, McPherson said. There were other significant informal wars around this time, including an eight-year presence in the Dominican Republic that saw the U.S. military taking over the government and dissolving the country’s parliament, as well as fighting a six-year rebellion in Nicaragua led by August Cesar Sandino. Our ruling Gibbs said, "We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation’s history." People can make different interpretations as to what constitutes a war. We take no issue with Gibbs’ interpretation but acknowledge that people might see the Banana Wars as the longest U.S. conflict on foreign soil. Gibbs is accurate, but his statement requires some additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Robert Gibbs	None	None	None	2014-01-12T17:26:37	2014-01-12	['Afghanistan']

From 2000 to 2010, for example, the state’s population grew by 12 percent. Oregon’s Hispanic population, by comparison, grew by 64 percent over that span, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The Claim A group of education and community leaders from around the state gathered at Kah-Nee-Ta Resort in February to discuss ways to improve educational outcomes. The event, co-sponsored by the Oregon Education Investment Board, had a particular focus on helping third-grade students of color and English language learners. A meeting slide show included a "fact" that later showed up in the Oregon School Boards Association’s April newsletter. "Did you know that in 2013 over 50 percent of all babies born in Oregon were Hispanic?" said the newsletter item, written by Betsy Miller-Jones, OSBA executive director. We’re aware that Oregon’s racial complexion is changing, but are half of all newborns now Hispanic? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis We contacted Jonathan Modie, communications officer for the Oregon Public Health Division. In an email, he told us that records for 2012 show that of the 45,059 babies born in Oregon that year, 8,521 -- or about 18.9 percent -- were Hispanic, according to official statistics. Preliminary data for 2013 roughly match the 2012 numbers. Neither comes close to the "more than 50 percent figure" included in the claim. To determine where the number came from, we contacted Kristin Gimbel, communications director for the Oregon Education Investment Board. After checking around, she told us two things. One, that the figure came from a slide show prepared by Zeke Smith, former chief of staff to Portland Schools Superintendent Carole Smith and now chief impact officer for United Way of the Columbia-Willamette. And, two, that it was wrong. "Regretfully (Smith) told me that he inadvertently transposed the data," Gimbel wrote in an email. In a follow-up phone call, she said Smith explained that, in working late on a volunteer basis to put the slide show together, he simply neglected to include an important proviso. The claim, she wrote, should have read: "In 2013 for the first time, more than half of the babies born to parents on Medicaid were Hispanic." Miller-Jones, who included the figure in the Oregon School Boards Association’s April newsletter, acknowledged the mistake. "We relied on information from a normally reliable source," she wrote in an email. "We appreciate your pointing out the error, about which we will inform the OEIB (Oregon Education Investment Board) as well as our members." The Ruling The executive director of the Oregon School Boards Association, picking up on a statistic included in a slide show presented to educators and others at a conference in February, wrote in a newsletter that in 2013 "more than 50 percent of all babies born in Oregon were Hispanic." A check of Oregon vital statistics puts the figure at about 18.9 percent for 2012, and preliminary data for 2013 are about the same. The official who worked late on his own time to prepare the presentation, meanwhile, said he simply goofed in omitting key wording that would have made the claim correct. It is true that the percentage of Hispanics who call Oregon home is increasing, but Hispanics don’t give birth to more than half of all babies born in the state. Miller-Jones said she will send a correction soon to those who received the newsletter. We rate the claim False. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on our ruling.

pomt-09605	Obama's job approval rating is up.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/18/donna-brazile/brazile-claims-obamas-job-approval-rate-going/	As Jan. 20, 2010, approaches, pundits and pollsters are scanning the numbers to see how President Barack Obama has done during his first year in office. A group of news analysts discussed Obama's job approval rating Jan. 17, 2010, on ABC's This Week, and specifically focused on a new ABC-Washington Post poll conducted between Jan. 12 and 15, 2010. Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that Obama is doing the best job he can given the circumstances. "He's had to inherit two wars, he's had to work with a Congress that often tries to take the lead. ... And of course he's worked against a Republican Party that was united against him and against all of his policies," she said. "Despite all of that, there's some good stuff in [the poll results]. ... Not only is his job approval up but most Americans consider him a strong leader." Brazile's comment that Obama's job approval is up piqued our interest. Could the numbers be so optimistic? We went back to the ABC-Washington Post poll and found that Brazile is technically correct: Obama's approval rating has increased three percentage points from 50 percent in December 2009. That was his lowest job approval rating to date, according to the same poll. So, Brazile is correct that Obama is polling three points higher than he did in December. But the latest figure also falls within the poll's three-point margin of error; statistically speaking, not much has changed since December. (She was more accurate with her claim that "most Americans consider him a strong leader." The poll showed that overall, 63 percent of the people characterized him that way.) To get some perspective, we looked at other recent job approval statistics. Pollster.com, a Web site that aggregates polling data from numerous sources and averages the results, shows that Obama's approval rating has been increasing since December. These averages are a bit squishy because each poll has a different margin of error, but they give a good estimate of where the country stands. Fox News, for example, has Obama's approval ratings up four percentage points from November to 50 percent this month. According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating is up slightly as well. Rassmussen polling demonstrates a similar trend, though it also shows that slightly more people disapprove than approve of Obama's performance. Other polls, including Quinnipiac, however, show Obama's numbers on the downturn. So, Brazile claimed that Obama's job approval ratings are improving, and generally speaking, it seems they are. But we're going to lower our rating by one notch because she based her claim on one poll in which the increase is within the margin of error. So we rate this one Mostly True.

pomt-09781	"Our own National Security Agency says that (Iran's) nuclear ambitions are advancing, and at the same time ... we are slashing our own nuclear arsenal."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/23/sean-hannity/hannity-says-us-reducing-its-nuclear-arsenal/	It's no secret that conservative talk show host Sean Hannity has issues with the Obama administration's direction on national defense. On the eve of a global summit in New York, Hannity questioned the wisdom of the Obama administration's commitment to reducing the nation's nuclear arsenal. "Here is the situation," Hannity said during a Fox News interview with Sen. John McCain on Sept. 22. "We've got (Iranian president Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, just on the heels of coming to New York, again denying that the Holocaust took place. Our own National Security Agency says that their nuclear ambitions are advancing, and at the same time we see what happens — we are slashing our own nuclear arsenal." We decided to look into Hannity's statement, if only to put it into proper context. First off, during a speech on Sept. 18, Ahmadinejad did again question whether the Holocaust was a "real event," and said that the Jewish state of Israel was created out of "a lie and mythical claim." And intelligence reports do, in fact, suggest that while Iran does not yet have nuclear weapons, and claims not to be pursuing them, it has made progress in its ability to enrich uranium and might only be a few years away from developing nuclear weapon capabilities. As for the United States slashing its nuclear arsenal, that's also true. In fact, it's been true for a couple decades, ever since the Cold War ended. Under treaty agreements that started under President Ronald Reagan, and due to retirement of old weapons, the United States and Russia have been steadily cutting the number of nuclear weapons that are ready to be used either from bombers, submarines or ground-based missile silos. The current treaty that covers the counting and verification of nuclear weapon reductions is called START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), and it expires in December. It has resulted in the reduction of some 80 percent of all strategic nuclear weapons. President Barack Obama has said that his goal is to reduce nuclear weaponry in the United States and Russia even further. During the presidential campaign, Obama promised "deep, verifiable reductions in all U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons — whether deployed or nondeployed, whether strategic or nonstrategic — and to work with other nuclear powers to reduce global stockpiles dramatically by the end of an Obama presidency." In his defining speech on nuclear weapons as president, Obama in April spoke to an audience in Prague about his long-term vision for a world free of nuclear weapons. "So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons," Obama said. "I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly — perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.' In July, Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in London to set up the framework for a new START treaty. And both sides have committed to seeking a new agreement by the end of the year to make further reductions in their nuclear arsenals. Currently, the U.S. and Russian arsenals comprise about 95 percent of all the nuclear weapons that are known to exist in the world. But neither side is talking about eliminating its nuclear arsenal any time soon. The number of weapons possessed by both sides is, and would remain under any new treaty, enormous relative to the number of weapons possessed by other countries. So Hannity is clearly right that the United States is reducing its nuclear arsenal. It was even one of Obama's campaign promises . But the statement implies that this is a change in strategy under Obama. In fact, it is a continuing policy that began under President Reagan (a Hannity favorite). And while Obama may talk of a nuclear free world, it's in long-range terms. So we find Hannity's claim Mostly True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2009-09-23T19:07:09	2009-09-22	['Iran']
pomt-09142	"A major part" of the climate change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman "was essentially written by BP."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-kerry-lieberman-climate-bill-essent/	The ongoing oil spill caused by a damaged BP well in the Gulf of Mexico is bringing attention to the relationship between the oil conglomerate and politicians. On June 9, 2010, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., used a floor speech to link BP and a climate-change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. "The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since it’s been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write." McConnell touched on a lot of points in this excerpt, but the one that most interested us was whether "a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP." When we asked McConnell's office for evidence to support this charge, a spokesman provided us with links to several news reports. These stories -- published over the past few months in the Washington Post, in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill, and in the energy-and-environment trade publication Greenwire -- offer ample evidence that BP was involved in the long-running negotiations over the bill, and that the company spoke favorably about the measure as it was being drafted. The articles indicated that BP, along with Shell, ConocoPhillips and the Edison Electric Institute, would ultimately endorse the measure. In fact, one article specifically noted that BP CEO Tony Hayward -- not yet the internationally known face of the disaster -- gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in March in which he "indicated he was encouraged" by the Kerry-Lieberman effort. Aides to Kerry and Lieberman do not dispute that BP was involved in the negotiations, along with many other parties. "The senators met with more than 60 of their colleagues and all involved stakeholders, including environmentalists, religious leaders and the business community," said Whitney Smith, a spokeswoman for Kerry. "The senators worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders to develop their discussion draft," added Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann. "They met with the CEOs of Shell, BP and Conoco because their industry will be regulated under the bill and it was important to ensure that the bill's approach to transportation emissions would reduce oil dependence. They also met with members of the business and environmental community in an effort to ensure that the bill met all of their goals: to grow the economy, create jobs and clean our air." But it's one thing for a company's representatives to meet with Congressional aides, make the company's case and suggest that they may endorse a bill. It's another to actually write legislation. On this point, Kerry and Lieberman's offices are clear: "Senators, not any industry, wrote this proposal, and any suggestion to the contrary is false and politically motivated," said Smith, the spokeswoman for Kerry. Let's delve into the evidence. On March 24, Houston Chronicle energy blogger Tom Fowler reprinted a "discussion draft" by BP that advocated several policy positions related to hydraulic fracking. That's a technique that allows energy companies to unlock natural gas by injecting chemicals into underground reservoirs. Critics have suggested that the procedure risks tainting adjoining water supplies, and they have urged lawmakers to establish tight controls on the process. As reprinted in Fowler's blog, the "discussion draft" argued that "governments and industry have critical roles toward continuing to assure the public that hydraulic fracturing operations are effectively managed and regulated and that human health and the environment are protected." Among other things, the draft sought to maintain "the confidentiality of trade secret information." However, this language was not included in the draft bill that Kerry and Lieberman released a month later. Quite the opposite: The bill draft said that "a hydraulic fracturing service company shall disclose all chemical constituents used in a hydraulic fracturing operation to the public on the Internet in order to provide adequate information for the public and state and local authorities" -- a much more stringent standard than that sought by BP. It's also worth noting that the BP "discussion draft" was not even intended to be actual language in the bill. Rather, it was intended as language for a "Sense of the Senate" resolution, which, unlike the law itself, is not binding. BP also sought a federal pre-emption for automobile tailpipe emissions, said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. That means that BP wanted the federal government to set a universal standard for emissions, rather than having states set their own levels, which could allow some states -- especially California -- to set stricter limits. Such a policy has been a longstanding item on the industry's agenda for climate change regulation. In this case, too, the Kerry-Lieberman draft bill specifically maintained the right of states to set emissions limits, leaving BP's idea on the cutting-room floor. And BP and other players in the industry proposed increasing gasoline taxes at the pump rather than curbing vehicular emissions through a direct cap, said John Coqueyt, a legislative specialist with the Sierra Club, an environmental group. After making progress initially, this idea was abandoned in the Kerry-Lieberman draft, Coqueyt said. "On the one hand, BP did have substantial input into the Kerry bill," said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety. BP, other oil companies, the Edison Electric Institute and other industry groups "submitted much language and many ideas. Some are probably recognizable in the current bill. ... But I don't think it is accurate to say that BP essentially wrote a major part of the bill." We agree. There's no question that BP, by taking a cooperative stance with Kerry and Lieberman rather than an adversarial one, had the opportunity to float its ideas during the legislative drafting process. And by dangling the possibility that the company might back the bill -- which would provide the senators with politically valuable support on a complicated and contentious bill -- BP and other energy companies wielded some leverage in the drafting process. In fact, many on the left -- not just conservatives like McConnell-- are disappointed that Kerry and other Democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies, including BP, while crafting the bill. But saying that the senators listened to BP's case is not the same as saying that "a major part" of the bill "was essentially written by BP." In fact, looking at three BP-pushed initiatives that have come to light shows that none were included in the current draft of the bill, which suggests that the senators and their aides were hardly captive to BP. It may be revealing that one day after the statement we're checking, McConnell had toned down his description of BP's role. In a floor speech on June 10, 2010, McConnell said, "Some favor the Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the way, has been pushed by the oil company BP." If he'd simply said "pushed" the day before, he would have been pretty close to being accurate. But McConnell went much further when he said that BP had "essentially written" a "major part" of the bill. We rule that claim by McConnell False.

pomt-09853	A provision in the health care reform bill for end-of-life counseling for seniors is not "entirely voluntary."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/13/sarah-palin/palin-claims-obama-misled-when-he-said-end-life-co/	After wide denunciation ( including here ) of Sarah Palin's claims last week that the proposed health care reform bill would create "death panels," the former Alaska governor again went to her Facebook page to answer the critics and reassert her claim that end-of-life counseling authorized in the House version of the health plan is not "entirely voluntary." We've looked at this claim before when Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York, went on the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16, 2009, and said, "Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner." We gave that statement got our lowest rating, Pants on Fire! But the issue has hardly dissipated. In fact, on Aug. 13, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that the Senate Finance Committee has "dropped end-of-life provisions from consideration entirely" from its version of health care overhaul legislation because it could be "misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly." But it remains in the House bill. Palin may have stepped down as Alaska governor last month, but she remains a prominent Republican voice. In a town hall meeting on health care on Aug. 11, President Barack Obama specifically referenced Palin's "death panel" phrase when discussing what he said was incorrect information that has been circulating about the health care bill. "It turns out that I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end-of-life care, setting up living wills, the availability of hospice, etc.," Obama said. "So the intention of the members of Congress was to give people more information so that they could handle issues of end-of-life care when they’re ready on their own terms. It wasn’t forcing anybody to do anything." In her Facebook response the following day, Palin accused Obama of fudging the truth. "With all due respect, it’s misleading for the president to describe this section as an entirely voluntary provision that simply increases the information offered to Medicare recipients. The issue is the context in which that information is provided and the coercive effect these consultations will have in that context." Palin then accurately cited some of the language Section 1233 of the House version of the health care plan, which is titled "Advanced Care Planning Consultation." As Palin says, the provision "authorizes advanced care planning consultations for senior citizens on Medicare every five years, and more often 'if there is a significant change in the health condition of the individual ... or upon admission to a skilled nursing facility, a long-term care facility... or a hospice program.' During those consultations, practitioners must explain 'the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice,' and the government benefits available to pay for such services." Palin then argues that this provision must be viewed in the context of a health care bill whose stated purpose is "to reduce the growth in health care spending." "Is it any wonder," Palin writes, "that senior citizens might view such consultations as attempts to convince them to help reduce health care costs by accepting minimal end-of-life care?" That's an opinion. What we're trying to get at here is Palin's claim that the end-of-life counseling is not "entirely voluntary." When we wrote about McCaughey's claim that the end-of-life counseling was mandatory, we cited several health care experts who said McCaughey was simply misreading the provision, that the bill would make the counseling available, but voluntary. In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives, said Jim Dau, national spokesman for AARP, a group that represents people over 50 and has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision. Dau called McCaughey's comments "not just wrong, they are cruel. ... We want to make sure people are making the right decision. If some one wants to take every life-saving measure, that's their call. Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families, and that's their decision, too." When Palin reasserted the not "entirely voluntary" claim on Aug. 12, we spoke with Dr. Gail Wilensky, who was administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, directing the Medicare and Medicaid programs, under President George H.W. Bush. She is now a health care policy researcher who focuses on health care for the military and veterans. "There are a lot of things not to like about the House bill," she said. "I don't think this is one of them." Wilensky also confirmed that the end-of-life counseling sessions in the House bill are voluntary. "If you want to be in a position to determine your own fate, this is what you want to do," she said. "If you don't want to deal with that, or think about that, that's fine, too." The legislation ensures that people do not have wait until they become ill to get an appointment with their doctor paid for by Medicare, she said. "This is the kind of conversation you'd like people to have when they're not under physical duress or emotional duress and with their physicians and their families," she said. Later in her Facebook post, Palin seems to acknowledge that the counseling isn't explicitly mandatory, but that in practice it would be. She cites an opinion piece from the Washington Post's Charles Lane, in which he writes, "Though not mandatory, as some on the right have claimed, the consultations envisioned in Section 1233 aren't quite 'purely voluntary,' as Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., asserts. To me, 'purely voluntary' means 'not unless the patient requests one.' Section 1233, however, lets doctors initiate the chat and gives them an incentive — money — to do so. Indeed, that's an incentive to insist. "Patients may refuse without penalty," Lane wrote, "but many will bow to white-coated authority." The bill would, in fact, authorize Medicare to reimburse doctors who provide this kind of counseling. And we think it's fair to opine that this creates an "incentive" for doctors to provide end-of-life counseling. We also think it's fair to argue that a frail elderly person in poor health might "bow to white-coated authority." But given the leaps in logic that have been popular in some conservative circles in recent weeks that this provision translates to government-mandated euthanasia, we think it's important to be clear about what the bill says. The fact is that there is nothing in the health care bill that would require people to get the end-of-life counseling. Perhaps, as Lane — and by extension Palin — argues, patients might feel some subtle pressure from a doctor to get the counseling. But the patients make the call. That's the definition of voluntary. We've said in our previous item that it was voluntary, and we see nothing in Palin's argument that proves otherwise. And so we rule her claim False.

pomt-09626	"Texas is LAST (50th) in spending for mental health care."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/marc-katz/marc-katz-says-texas-last-spending-mental-health-c/	Marc Katz, the Austin deli owner running for lieutenant governor, lists health care as his No. 1 campaign issue on his Web site. So it's no surprise that he took a shot at highlighting Texas' struggling mental health system on Twitter. "Texas is LAST (50th) in spending for mental health care," he said in a message on Twitter on Dec. 8. We wanted to know the source for Katz's claim, but he didn't respond to our phone calls or email. We assume Katz was referring to data published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation for fiscal 2006, which tallied mental health care spending for the District of Columbia and the 50 states. Texas was indeed ranked 50th for spending — per capita — though that was second to last. Spending $34.57 per Texan, the state squeaked ahead of New Mexico, which spent $25.58 and ranked 51st. Florida came in third from last at $38.17, and the national average was $103.53. When you look at total dollars spent, Texas ranked 10th in 2006, spending about $805 million. Aware of the state's shortcomings in health care services, Texas legislators allocated $55 million in 2009 to be distributed during the next year (half of it has been already) to expand services at local mental health centers, and through August this year, community mental health centers will receive another $341.8 million in state money through the Department of State Health Services. Twitter sometimes leads to clunky writing because items are limited to 140 characters per tweet. In this case, though, Katz sliced information to give it more impact. Sure, he was only off by one state, but that was the difference between Texas ranking last and not, an important detail when you're showing Texas' rank in ALL CAPS. We rank Katz's statement Mostly True.	None	Marc Katz	None	None	None	2010-01-12T15:20:11	2009-12-08	['Texas']
pomt-15386	Public support for abortion "is actually going down a little bit," polls show.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/28/donald-trump/trump-pro-choice-polling-numbers-declining/	Donald Trump, who in 1999 said he "was strongly pro-choice," says he's now against abortions and will nominate Supreme Court justices who share his stance. During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Trump suggested his shift in position mirrors the feelings of the American public. "In terms of polling, the pro-choice (support) is going down a little bit," Trump said. "It’s very interesting." Is that true? The most recent polling we could find comes out of Gallup. In May of this year, the polling group found 50 percent of Americans identify as pro-choice, compared to 44 percent of Americans who identify as pro-life. That's actually up, not down. The gap is outside the margin of error, the first time the pro-choice position has a statistically significant edge since 2008. If anything, the pro-choice position is gaining ground, not losing it in recent years. In 2012, 50 percent of people identified as pro-life, Gallup found, compared to 41 percent who identified as pro-choice. Here's a chart showing the Gallup results since 1996: Between 1997 and 2008, people identifying as pro-choice hovered around 50 percent, and the pro-life group stayed in the mid 40s, according to Gallup. Between 2009 and 2014, the pro-life group occasionally surpassed the pro-choice group in the polls. According to the report, some shifts in public opinion on abortion have coincided with political events, such as related legislation or Supreme Court decisions. But because of an increasing percentage of Americans who say their views are primarily liberal, it’s possible the pro-choice group will maintain its edge. Other research has found that public opinion on abortion has remained relatively stable. According to Pew, 51 percent of adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while with 43 percent say it should be illegal all or most of the time. Those percentages have been near the same level for more than 20 years. The divide has stayed "remarkably stable" as far back as 50 years, according to researchers out of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., who assembled data from several polls and published an article in The Atlantic about a year ago. The article points out that in both 1975 and 2013, 54 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances. For some additional context, the AEI research found that far fewer Americans consider abortion policy a high priority than you might expect, given the attention paid to the issue. In fact, only 1 percent of Americans polled by Gallup mentioned abortion as the most-important issue facing the country. The authors also pointed out that Americans are conflicted on abortion -- noting a 2013 study that found many Americans identified as pro-life and pro-choice. "Pro-life and pro-choice activists don't see the shades of gray that most Americans see on the issue," the authors wrote. "Neither their actions nor court decisions have altered public opinion in any significant way since Roe was decided more than four decades ago." We reached out to Trump through a spokesperson but did not hear back by our deadline. Our ruling Trump said, "In terms of polling, the pro-choice (support) is going down a little bit." There was a significant dip in the number of people who identified as pro-choice in 2012, but that number has rebounded during the last three years, according to a Gallup survey. Other research shows the percentage of people who identify as pro-choice or pro-life split has stayed relatively stable for at least the past 20 years. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-13773	"Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-latino-poverty-has-grown-under-o/	Are you better off than you were eight years ago? Donald Trump posed this classic election-year question in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president at the party’s national convention in Cleveland. "What about our economy?" he asked. "I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper," he continued. "Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely." There’s a lot to unpack there, but given Trump’s attention to immigration from Mexico, we decided to focus on his claim that 2 million more Latinos are in poverty than when Obama took office. As it turns out, poverty among the Hispanic population has been relatively stable under Obama. There’s some literal accuracy to Trump’s claim: About 10.9 million Hispanic people lived below the poverty line in 2008, according to Census figures. And about 13.1 million Hispanics were in poverty in 2014, the most recent year available. That’s a jump of about 2 million. But – and this is a big but – that statistic is essentially meaningless because the country’s Hispanic population has also been growing. The percentage of Hispanics in poverty as a share of the total Hispanic population is a much more useful statistic. Going by that figure, poverty among Hispanics has barely budged over the course of Obama’s presidency. It was 23.2 percent in 2008 and 23.6 percent in 2014. Christopher Wimer and Laura Nolan of the Columbia Population Research Center ran their own numbers for PolitiFact and came to a similar result. The Census data looks at pre-tax cash income, while Wimer and Nolan considered after-tax income and various other non-cash income sources for poor people, like housing assistance and food stamps. According to their figures, the number of Hispanic people living in poverty in 2008 was roughly 12.3 million, and it grew to 14.5 million in 2014, so a change of about 2 million. The poverty rate, however, barely grew from 25.8 percent to 26 percent. Trump’s statement is "technically true but misleading," said Wimer, co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. Wimer also noted the significance of the fact that Obama took office in the middle of the Great Recession. Normally, poverty grows during a recession. But various economic recovery measures helped to keep poverty under control, like expanded food stamps, unemployment benefits and earned income tax credits. "It’s not like poverty declined, but (the administration’s recovery measures) pinched the bleeding," he said. Our ruling Trump said, "Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago." Literally, about two million more Hispanic people are living in poverty than in the year leading up to Obama’s inauguration. However, this statistic isn’t very meaningful because the Hispanic population overall has also grown. The rate of poverty, a much more useful statistic, has been fairly stable throughout Obama’s presidency, hovering just above 23 percent. So the implication of Trump’s statement — that poverty among Hispanics has grown significantly under Obama — is incorrect. Trump is cherry-picking the rising overall number without mentioning the rate is stable. We rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20f68f82-a61d-4509-958f-5f9052477536	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T22:28:36	2016-07-21	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-08843	About 106,000 soldiers had "a prescription of three weeks or more" for pain, depression or anxiety medication.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/10/gen-peter-chiarelli/us-army-report-documents-problem-suicides-military/	Leaders of the U.S. Army need to take more active steps to prevent a growing number of soldiers from committing suicide, according to a major study released by the Army. Gen. Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. The study documented complex pressures -- including overly long deployments, more tolerance for high-risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers. Another complicating factor: increased use of prescription antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and pain medications. "We know that we had over 106,000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine," said Chiarelli. A few moments later, he added, "A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue. There are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet, and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment, and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt." Chiarelli was referring to information in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report, released Aug. 5, 2010. This seemed like an important issue to explore further. The report explains that historically, the Army's suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian population's. But the Army's rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. That year, the suicide rate in the Army was 20.2 per 100,000, compared with a typical civilian rate of 19.2. This increase prompted the study. "In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population," the study states. "If we include accidental death, which frequently is the result of high risk behavior (drinking and driving, drug overdose, etc.), we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions. Simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy." The report affirms the 106,000 number that Chiarelli uses. "Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106,000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain, depression or anxiety medications. The potential for abuse is obvious," it states. The report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military: "There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system. This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals. For example, the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use. Unfortunately, there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit. As a result, we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors." The report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29, and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants -- specifically, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -- among young people, and whether these medications sometimes increase the risk of suicide. "The Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care," the report states. The report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military. Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs; "14% of the force is taking some form of opiate medication," according to the report. The percentage for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications appear somewhat lower, with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication, according to evidence the report cites. Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression. We should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides. "The impact of increased use of antidepressant, psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population," the report states. In the interview with Amanpour, Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated. "We know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others," he said. Finally, we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled "The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison." The Army has been transformed in recent years, the report states, so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than "good order and discipline practices." Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections "have been lost" as part of that transition. "There are instances where a leader’s lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks," the report noted. While the report raises a host of issues, we're only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers. The Army report and other testimony that we found support Chiarelli's statement that approximately 106,000 soldiers had "a prescription of three weeks or more" for pain, depression or anxiety medication. We rate his statement True.	None	Gen. Peter Chiarelli	None	None	None	2010-08-10T11:47:44	2010-08-08	['None']
pomt-14596	Says he was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper.	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-ad-claims-endorsements-valley-news-/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been searching for high-profile newspaper endorsements in the New Hampshire primary. His main rival, Hillary Clinton, has been officially backed by the Concord Monitor, Portsmouth Herald, Keene Sentinel and the Boston Globe. But a campaign ad titled "Endorsed," might have given people a different impression. The ad, which was first posted online Wednesday Feb. 3, touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine. "From postal workers to nurses, he’s been endorsed for real change," a narrator says in the ad. The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H. Up to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words "endorsed by." Those words disappear when the Telegraph’s logo appears, along with the quote: "He’s not beholden to Wall Street Money." The words "endorsed by" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: "Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember." So did the Valley News or the Telegraph endorse Sanders? According to their editors, no. Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb. 3 that "For the record, despite @BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contrary, @NashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate #nhpolitics" And Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb. 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary. As news of the spot’s issues spread, the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad. It removed the word "endorsed" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That’s the version of the ad now on the campaign’s official YouTube channel, which is still titled "Endorsed.". The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It’s worth noting that the editorials cited in the ad -- from each newspaper -- were indeed laudatory. The Telegraph editorial, which is behind a paywall but accessible through a Google cache, includes this passage: "He is not tainted by scandal. "He hasn’t erased a cache of emails. "Nobody questions whether Sanders has sold his political soul in exchange for donations to his family foundation. He doesn’t have a foundation. But that piece was published in May, far before the traditional season for newspaper endorsements. It gave Sanders little chance of winning the primary, also noting that the independent senator was "not even a real Democrat." As for the Valley News, the paper’s Dec. 31, 2014, editorial simply encouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race. "A presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore much-needed balance to American political life, which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decades," the paper noted. Our ruling A Bernie Sanders political ad said he had been endorsed by the Valley News newspaper and implied he had been endorsed by The Telegraph of Nashua. While each paper published laudatory editorials about the Vermont senator, neither one has so far offered him an official endorsement. In the context of an ad titled "Endorsed," full of unions and other organizations that have in fact endorsed Sanders, the spotlighting of quotes from New Hampshire newspapers would suggest that the papers had made the same decision. The campaign’s decision to alter the ad improves its technical accuracy, but the misleading impression remains. We rate the ad’s claim False.

pomt-13209	Says Ted Strickland "in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ... He has said he has a mixed and spotty record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don’t know where he is on this issue."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-quotes-stricklands-own-words-about-mixed-a/	Republican Sen. Rob Portman fired back at former Gov. Ted Strickland’s own words about gun rights during the final debate in Cleveland for U.S. Senate. The phrase he used -- "mixed and spotty" -- was featured earlier in the campaign season in an attack ad by Fighting for Ohio PAC, a political action committee that supports Portman. "Gov. Strickland in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA," Portman said, when a question was posed to him about the candidates’ records on gun issues. "I’m not talking about years ago, I’m talking about this campaign. He has said he has a ‘mixed and spotty’ record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don’t know where he is on this issue." Here, we wanted to know if Strickland bragged about a sterling NRA rating in the same campaign in which he acknowledged a spotty record. When Fighting for Ohio PAC used the "mixed and spotty" line, we rated its ad False, because Strickland’s quote was misleadingly juxtaposed with figures about Ohio’s lost jobs and tax hikes under Strickland’s governorship. Portman is on firmer ground, because Strickland’s "mixed and spotty" remark did emerge in the context of guns. Strickland confirmed that he was running for Portman’s Senate seat on Feb. 25, 2015. In his 12 years as a U.S. Congressman, Strickland opposed measures to restrict gun ownership. So it was surprising to Ohio political observers when Strickland appeared at forums in Cincinnati and Columbus and talked up measures for more rigorous background checks and prohibiting gun sales to suspected terrorists. "Ted’s views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy," Strickland’s spokesman David Bergstein told reporters Democratic primary opponent P.G. Sittenfeld questioned whether Strickland’s change of heart on guns was motivated by the tragedy or by political timing. A recording more than two years after the attack surfaced that Sittenfeld used to his advantage. On March 10, 2015, Strickland was a guest on WOSU’s "All Sides with Ann Fisher," and took a call from a listener named Jeffrey. Caller: "Hey there. Gov. Strickland, I know you are a big supporter of the president and when you campaigned for him in 2012 you wrote an article about his support for the Second Amendment. I was just wondering how you continue to say you support the Second Amendment when you have been lobbying for additional gun laws when you were working in D.C." Strickland: "Well, I have not lobbied for additional gun laws and, my brother, let me put my record in front of you. As a congressman, I had an A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association. That has been my position, and it is my position." Strickland had to clarify his stance on guns in a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board interview of Democratic primary candidates for Senate in February 2016. It was taped, and is the source of the "mixed and spotty" line. "Has my position changed over time? It has," Strickland said. "My record is mixed and spotty and I can be criticized for that." Our ruling Portman said Strickland "in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ... He has (also) said he has a mixed and spotty record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it." At the debate, Portman framed the quote in the proper context about guns.

pomt-08354	"Unfortunately everyone needs to cut back in these tough economic times. That's why I voted to cut my own pay along with the pay of our state employees."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/27/matt-patten/state-rep-matt-patten-democrats-tout-pay-cut-vote-/	Pigs can fly, and politicians can vote to cut their own pay. That's the message from House Democrats. They’re using a vote on a bill that purported to cut salaries of General Assembly members by 5 percent to bolster a number of their Statehouse candidates. Holding onto those House seats is critical for Democrats this election as they cling to a 53-46 edge over Republicans. Typical of the advertisements is a mailer sent out by Rep. Matt Patten, a Strongsville Democrat locked in a tight re-election battle with Republican Mike Dovilla. The mailer announces in large lettering, "Why I voted to cut my own pay." Patten explains in the mailer that he voted to cut the pay of state employees, but also took a hit in his own wallet. "Unfortunately everyone needs to cut back in these tough economic times," he says in the mailer. "That's why I voted to cut my own pay along with the pay of our state employees." House Democrats around the state are citing this vote in a number of races, so we decided to take a closer look at this claim. The pay cut was actually a Republican idea before Democrats seized it. Rep. Seth Morgan, a Dayton-area Republican, included the 5-percent pay cut bill idea as stand-alone measure in House Bill 210, which was introduced on June 9, 2009. That bill went nowhere for months. Democrats latched onto the idea in October 2009 and inserted the 5-percent pay cut plan into a measure that delayed a 4.2 percent state income tax cut for all Ohioans. The so-called freeze on the income tax cut provided $844 million the state needed to shore up its budget, which had a hole in it after legal wranglings halted a plan to raise revenue by allowing slot machines at Ohio's horse tracks. Republicans saw the freeze as a tax increase, so the bill containing the freeze and the pay cut passed on a mostly partisan vote. Only two Republicans joined all 53 Democrats in voting for it. Later, the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate stripped the provision from the legislation, so it never actually became law. So Patten and the other House Democrats did vote to cut their own pay, right? Not so fast, dear reader. A section of the the Ohio Constitution actually prohibits members of the General Assembly from changing their own pay. The bill analysis done by the non-partisan Legislative Service Commission spells this out very clearly. "Because, however, Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 31 prohibits changing the compensation of General Assembly members during their terms of office, the 5-percent reduction in salary and supplements will not affect officers and members who are currently holding office," reads the analysis. "This portion of the bill goes into effect on the 91st day after the bill is filed with the Secretary of State and the pay changes apply only to those members whose terms of office commence on or after January 1, 2011," it concludes. House Democrats argue that the lawmakers making this claim intend to be back in the next legislature session -- if they are re-elected. "No one is claiming this who doesn't intend to come back to the legislature and serve," said House Democratic Caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy. Maybe so, but the fact remains that the pay cut was for the members of the next legislature. Patten and the others didn't actually vote to cut their own pay, but instead cut the pay of whomever holds their seats in 2011. PolitiFact Ohio has rated as False claims that accuse lawmakers of raising their own salaries when the pay increases didn’t take effect until the next term of office. The rationale was that if a legislator has be re-elected before being eligible for the pay raise, there is no guarantee that they would ever see the money. We ruled in those cases that voters actually granted the pay raise when they sent them back for another term. That same rationale applies here. Patten and other House Democrats are making an issue out of a vote that purported to cut lawmakers’ pay by 5 percent. They claim they cut their own pay in the measure which ultimately wasn't adopted. However, even if the measure had been adopted, the Ohio Constitution would have prevented the pay from taking effect until the next General Assembly is seated. So they actually didn't vote to cut their own pay. They cut the pay for members of the next legislature, which may or may not include them. Therefore, we find this claim to be false.

pomt-12153	Eighty percent of the school tax bills in the state of Pennsylvania went up over last year.	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/aug/09/scott-wagner/campaign-video-pa-gov-candidate-scott-wagner-takes/	Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner tried to school voters last week with an "educational video" featuring him standing in front of a government organizational chart blasting tax increases under consideration in Harrisburg. Problem is, the Republican state senator from York apparently based part of his lesson on little more than a hunch. In the campaign video titled "Drain the Harrisburg Swamp" posted on YouTube Aug. 2, Wagner criticized a $2.2 billion revenue package approved by the state Senate at the end of July that includes some targeted tax increases meant to balance the $32 billion spending plan that lapsed into law a few weeks prior. Wagner, who's running for governor in 2018 and voted against the bill that’s still waiting on House approval, said in the video that even modest tax increases will impact Pennsylvanians, particularly those already seeing property tax hikes heading into the 2017-18 school year. "On July 1, a lot of people started receiving their school tax bills," Wagner said in the video. "Those tax bills didn’t go down. And they didn’t say the same. They went up. And I can assure you that 80 percent of the school tax bills in the state of Pennsylvania went up over last year." Wagner didn’t cite a source or state department to support his "80 percent" claim, so we decided to check the facts. PolitiFact Pennsylvania couldn’t find a single report to indicate that eight in 10 Pennsylvanians saw a school property tax increase this year -- and Wagner’s campaign didn’t attempt to prove that it’s true. When reached by PolitiFact late last week, campaign spokesman Jason High said Wagner was in fact referring to school property taxes when he said "school tax bills," and indicated the state senator didn’t actually know how many Pennsylvanians saw their property taxes rise this year when he threw out the 80 percent number in last week’s campaign video. "The 80 [percent] number was simply a guess that Scott made based on his own personal experiences and the feedback that he’s heard from people around the state," High said. So was his "guess" close? According to one study, sort of. Though school districts across the state set property tax rates prior to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the state Department of Education hasn’t released comprehensive data on the number of Pennsylvanians facing property tax increases in the 2017-18 school year compared to the 2016-17 school year. Department spokesperson Casey Smith said the most recent figures available are from 2015-16. The closest data we could track down that looked at property tax rates across Pennsylvania’s 500 public school districts for the 2017-18 school year came from a June budget report commissioned by the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials and the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. The report, based on responses from 332 school districts, was conducted in the spring, and therefore unable to report how many school districts actually hiked property taxes this year. But it did indicate how many planned to. Surveyors found that 70 percent of school districts that responded anticipated increasing property taxes in 2017-18, not far off from Wagner’s 80 percent claim. Just 12 percent of school districts reported they anticipated increasing property taxes above the Act 1 index, a cap of sorts that’s meant to allow districts the ability to increase property taxes consistent with inflationary cost increases. If a district wants to raise property taxes above that index, it must either send the tax hike to a referendum or request a waiver from the Department of Education. The Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials and the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators don’t know if 70 percent of respondent school districts actually did raise property taxes this year -- just that they anticipated needing to. A study of how many districts followed through on that will come this fall. Jay D. Himes, the executive director of PASBO, said the number of school districts raising property taxes across the state sat at about 70 percent for several years as mandated costs continue to "far exceed" new revenue from the state. Himes, who has worked on this report for seven years, said usually the number of school districts that actually increase property taxes is slightly lower than the number that indicate they anticipate a hike in the spring. "In terms of property taxes, what usually happens is the most conventional way of school budgeting is plan for the worst and hope for the best," he said. "That would usually mean that some districts that said they were going to raise may not, and some districts won’t raise as high because rather than more guesswork involved, it’s more real-time data." Mark DiRocco, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators, said "the majority" of school districts in Pennsylvania have steadily raised property taxes since the Great Recession, while "a lot of districts still have not recovered from" massive cuts to public education approved in 2011 under former Gov. Tom Corbett. He added that many school districts are still seeing revenue losses even beyond what property tax increases can cover. That’s largely driven by increasing costs related to pension contributions, special education, healthcare and charter school payments, he said. Our ruling In what he described as an "educational video" posted to his campaign website, state Sen. Scott Wagner, running for governor in 2018, said "80 percent of the school tax bills in the state of Pennsylvania went up over last year." Of the state’s 500 school districts, 332 responded to a survey and, of those, 70 percent indicated they anticipated raising property taxes in the 2017-18 school year. But there’s been no comprehensive data officially released by the state showing the number of districts that actually approved property tax hikes this year. Wagner’s team indicated the gubernatorial candidate was acting on a "guess" when he threw out the 80 percent number in his campaign video. Lucky for him, that guess will likely end up being close.

pomt-10611	"I don't have lobbyists running my campaign."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/mitt-romney/campaign-is-ankle-deep-in-lobbyists/	At a news conference at a Staples store in Columbia, S.C., Mitt Romney got into an argument with an Associated Press reporter over his ties to lobbyists. "I don't have lobbyists running my campaign," said Romney. AP reporter Glen Johnson challenged the statement and noted that one of Romney's top advisers is Ron Kaufman, a prominent Washington lobbyist. But Romney insisted that neither Kaufman nor any other lobbyists were "running" his campaign because they were not paid for their work. "Ron is a wonderful friend and adviser. He's not paid. He's an adviser, like many others. But I do not have lobbyists running my campaign," Romney said. He added that Kaufman did not attend the campaign's regular strategy sessions. Johnson kept challenging Romney, noting that Kaufman had traveled on the campaign plane and then he got Romney to acknowledge that Kaufman had provided advice during strategy sessions for debates. To examine the truth of Romney's statement, let's first address his point that you must be a paid staffer to be "running" the campaign. Because of the dynamic nature of a political race and the uneven flow of money, campaigns routinely rely on volunteers to play key roles. So it's common for unpaid professionals to be involved in tasks such as helping with strategy, organizing volunteers and acting as a spokesman. Indeed, lobbyists Barbara Comstock and Al Cardenas have acted as media spokesmen for Romney, carrying out the same task as campaign aides who happened to receive paychecks. So we don't accept the idea that you must be on the payroll to be involved in "running" the campaign. And there's no question that some key people in the Romney campaign are well-connected lobbyists: • Kaufman, a senior adviser to Romney, is chairman of Dutko Worldwide, which has lobbied for American Pacific Corp., American Trans Air, Amgen, AT&T; – and that's just some of the As. • Ben Ginsberg, the campaign's national counsel, is a partner in the firm Patton Boggs, a large lobbying firm that has represented Kaiser Aluminum, Lucent Technologies, the Venetian Casino Resort and many others. His bio on the firm's Web site boasts that "Mr. Ginsberg represents a variety of clients on Capitol Hill on a wide range of issues including appropriations, trade, broadcasting and health care." • Cardenas is chairman of the Romney Hispanic Steering Committee, a finance co-chairman for the campaign and a frequent spokesman for Romney. He is a partner in Tew Cardenas, a lobbying firm with offices in Washington, Miami and Tallahassee. Records show he has lobbied for Progress Energy, Bell South, the Florida Association of Realtors and the Recreational Fishing Alliance, among others. His Web site boasts that "He has been named as one of Washington, D.C.'s top lobbyists by The Hill newspaper." • Comstock, an adviser and frequent spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, is a founding partner of Comstock Corallo, which has lobbied for the Hearst Corp. and the National Association of Broadcasters. • Vin Weber, the Romney campaign's policy chairman, is considered one of Washington's premier lobbyists. He is chief executive of Clark & Weinstock, which has represented Microsoft, Pfizer, Texas Instruments, General Electric and many others. During the standoff in the Staples, Romney said, "I don't have lobbyists at my elbows that are arguing for one industry or another industry." They may not be at his elbows, but his campaign sure looks ankle-deep in them. And so we find his claim to be False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-01-18T00:00:00	2008-01-17	['None']

pomt-12333	"Democrat Maxine Waters has shown up to only 10 percent of congressional meetings for 35 years."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/15/teddystickcom/maxine-waters-has-not-skipped-90-percent-congressi/	A blog post that accused U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D.-Calif., of being an absentee congresswoman for decades relied on a fake statistic from a thread on Reddit. "Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS," read the headline on a June 7, 2017, post on TeddyStick.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The website, which doesn’t list contact information and has hidden its registration data, attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job. The writer, who is credited on the post as Sam Di Gangi, wrote: "Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that 'Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.' " The source is simply a Reddit thread from June 7, 2017, which contains no evidence at all. It’s just a series of comments posted on Reddit’s "the_donald" forum. We contacted a Waters spokesman, who chose not to comment. Waters is a long-serving legislator, but she hasn’t been in Congress for 35 years. She first started representing a California district in 1991, so she’s been in Washington for 26 years. She became a state legislator in 1977 and served until joining the U.S. House of Representatives, which amounts to 40 years of lawmaking experience. Beyond that, it’s wrong to say Waters missed 90 percent of her "congressional meetings," even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn’t specified. It’s possible the post referred to her voting record, but that would be way off. As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That’s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate. The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn’t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the Washington Examiner did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014. Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats. U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., came in first, missing 96 percent of hearings in the Examiner’s analysis. We spot-checked Waters’ 2015-16 record as ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, which also gives her ex officio status on a half-dozen subcommittees, meaning Waters could attend meetings for those subcommittees if she chose. By our count, Waters missed 37 percent of the hearings listed on the Government Publishing Office’s website. There’s no evidence Waters attended a paltry 10 percent of meetings, however you count them. TeddyStick.com used a dubious source that appeared to have just made up the stat.

pomt-04765	In the past 27 months, President Barack Obama has created more private-sector jobs than "in the Reagan recovery."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/27/stephanie-cutter/barack-obama-says-his-recovery-has-outpaced-ronald/	Stephanie Cutter, President Barack Obama’s deputy campaign manager, said her boss one-upped President Ronald Reagan in economic rebuilding following a crippling recession. But was she right? On the Aug. 22, 2012, edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Willie Geist asked Cutter what argument she would make to someone who had been out of work under Obama and who was wondering whether it’s time for a change. Cutter responded, "Well, I think that worker probably has a good understanding of what's happened over the past four years in terms of the president coming in and seeing 800,000 jobs lost on the day that the president was being sworn in, and seeing the president moving pretty quickly to stem the losses, to turn the economy around, and over the past, you know, 27 months we've created 4.5 million private sector jobs. That's more jobs than in the Bush recovery, in the Reagan recovery, there's obviously more we need to do...." Many readers contacted us to ask if the Obama recovery has really outpaced the recovery from the 1981-1982 recession under Reagan. (We’re focusing on the Reagan comparison because readers emailed us saying they thought Cutter was wrong.) The answer is that, however you slice it, it hasn’t. Here’s a rundown. Using Cutter’s methodology Cutter counted the past 27 months. That’s the most favorable measurement for Obama, since 27 months ago was the low point in employment numbers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal scorekeeper for jobs numbers. Cutter also used private-sector job numbers rather than the overall job numbers, which helps Obama’s case too; government job losses have been a drag on the overall numbers over that period. Between March 2010 and July 2012 (which is actually 28 months), the number of private-sector jobs rose from 106.9 million to 111.3 million, an increase of 4.4 million -- just shy of Cutter’s 4.5 million. What about Reagan? The low point for employment under Reagan was December 1982, with 72.8 million private-sector jobs. Fast-forward 27 months to March 1985 and the number of private-sector jobs was 80.4 million. That’s an increase of 7.7 million -- a far bigger jobs bump than under Obama. Even more impressively, the Reagan recovery took place within a much smaller economy. The 27-month Reagan recovery represented an 11 percent increase in jobs, compared to a 4 percent increase during the comparable period under Obama. So the Gipper wins this faceoff. (Using Cutter’s method, President George W. Bush oversaw an increase in 4.3 million jobs in the first 27 months following the low point during his tenure, so he had slightly fewer than Obama.) Starting with the beginning of the recovery The comparison is even more unflattering to Obama if you use a less cherry-picked time frame than the one Cutter used -- one that starts when the recoveries officially began, rather than the low point for jobs. Using this formula, Obama’s numbers change quite a bit, since he’s suffered from the growing pattern of recoveries creating fewer jobs, and more slowly, than was typical in past recoveries. The recession under Obama officially ended in June 2009. That means that the number of jobs continued to fall for another nine months before hitting rock bottom. Counting these nine extra months of job losses, Obama’s private-sector job creation total falls to 3.4 million over three years and one month. By contrast, using this formula actually boosts Reagan’s private-sector job-creation totals. The recession under Reagan officially ended in November 1982, almost simultaneously with the low point in jobs. Over the next three years and one month -- the comparable period under Obama -- the number of private-sector jobs increased by 9.1 million. Taking into account the growth of the workforce overall, employment has grown by 3 percent during the Obama recovery, compared to 13 percent under Reagan. Chalk up an even stronger win for the Gipper. Our ruling Even using Cutter’s cherry-picked formulation, job creation under Obama has dramatically trailed the pace set by Reagan. In fact, adjusting for the size of the workforce, Reagan’s recovery was more than four times bigger than Obama’s has been so far. We rate Cutter’s claim False.

pomt-12743	"Corporate entities are paying a lot less taxes this year than they have in the past. Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/02/kip-kendrick/kendrick-mostly-right-about-reduced-corporate-tax-/	Many Missouri lawmakers are worried about the estimated $456 million budget gap for fiscal year 2018. By law, the government cannot approve an unbalanced budget. Although the state has made some cuts, more work still needs to be done. That has lawmakers looking for answers as to why state revenues have dropped. Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, was interviewed by KMIZ's Joey Parker on "This Week," on Jan. 20. Kendrick stated why he believes the budget gap is so large. "If you look at the budget right now, income tax collection is right where it was projected, the same with sales tax collection," he said. "What is down significantly is corporate income tax collection. Corporate entities are paying a lot less taxes this year than they have in the past. "Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015, but it is also some special interest tax cuts that we keep giving out over and over, and it has made it all but impossible to fund our state’s priorities." We wanted to check out Kendrick’s claim that corporate entities are paying a lot less in taxes — and if they are, why? Budgeted vs. actual revenues The first half of Kendrick’s statement is easy to verify. Overall, the state of Missouri collected less corporate income taxes and about the same amount of individual income tax and sales tax when comparing the collected year-to-date revenue from Fiscal Year 2016 to 2017. According to the latest monthly general revenue report released Feb. 2 from the Office of Administration Division of Budget and Planning, individual income tax and sales tax both grew around 3 percent. However, corporate tax income collections are significantly down compared to last year. In FY 2016, the state collected about $272 million. In FY 2017, it collected only $193 million, which is a 29 percent decrease or about $78 million less. Tax 2016 2017 Percent Change Difference amount Individual Income $1,204,433,166 $1,243,652,121 3.26% $39,218,955 Sales and Use $3,720,875,540 $3,853,824,016 3.57% $132,948,476 Corporate Income/Franchise $271,510,526 $193,092,057 -28.88% -$78,418,469 Source: Missouri Office of Administration/Division of Budget & Planning Note that these are collections year-to-date, comparing the collections as of Jan. 31 for FY 2016 to FY 2017. The fiscal year for 2017 runs until June 30, so we won’t know the full accounting until then. Corporate tax income from the tax deadline on April 18 could make up the difference. However, even Gov. Greitens’ proposed FY 2018 budget, which still has to be approved by the Missouri legislature, projected a $97 million decrease in corporate tax income for FY 2017. So what we do know supports Kendrick’s point: "Income tax collection is right where is was projected, the same with sales tax collection. What is down significantly is corporate income tax collection." Missouri business climate The second half of his claim is trickier to pin down: "Corporate entities are paying a lot less taxes this year than they have in the past. Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015, but it is also some special interest tax cuts that we keep giving out over and over, and it has made it all but impossible to fund our state’s priorities." First, is there another explanation as to why the corporate tax collections are low? There could be fewer businesses in the state, or these businesses could have generated less income. The Missouri Department of Economic Development tracks the number of businesses in the state. Because the 2016 data are only available through the third quarter, the department provided data in an email for the third quarters in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to compare. According to the department, the numbers are counts of establishments, or individual locations, which is the same measure on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. This means that instead of counting Wal-mart once, the data reports individual Wal-mart establishment. In 2014 there were 185,634 establishments; in 2015, there were 192,108 establishments; and in 2016, there were 193,695 establishments. So the number of businesses increased, if only slightly. So are businesses in Missouri not doing well? Do they have less taxable income? Both Chuck Pierce, the government relations consultant for the Missouri Society of Certified Public Accountants, and Tracy King, the vice president of governmental affairs at the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate income can vary from year to year due to the cyclical nature of the economy. Profits can be reduced by a recession. However, Tom Kruckemeyer, the chief economist for the liberal think tank Missouri Budget Project, said the state economy is doing "reasonably well." "Broadly speaking, the economic indicators for the state of Missouri are actually pretty good," Kruckemeyer said. One economic indicator is the unemployment rate. According to the numbers release Jan. 24 from U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, Missouri’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 4.4 percent, compared to the national rate of 4.7 percent. And over the past few years, the Missouri and national unemployment rates have dropped. The 2016 Missouri Economic Report produced by the Missouri Department of Economic Development found that 50,000 jobs were added in Missouri between December 2014 and December 2015. This is the largest year-over-year growth in 10 years. The report also stated that Missouri’s personal income increased 2 percent in 2015 and has averaged an increase of 1.8 percent from 2010 through 2015. Overall, these numbers show that Missouri’s economy is doing fine, so corporate entities must be paying less taxes due to tax cuts as Kendrick claims. Taxing corporations In the KMIZ interview, Kendrick said there was a loophole in a bill passed in 2015 that caused corporations to pay less taxes. Kendrick, in an interview with PolitiFact, said the bill he was referring to was Senate Bill 19, which changed the way corporate income tax was allocated for multi-state corporations. The bill expanded House Bill 128, passed in 2013. Before SB 19 was passed, King, of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, said Missouri taxed 50 percent of any goods produced in the state and sold in another state, so these businesses were double taxed. She said that businesses were moving out of the state and taking jobs because of this tax. Thanks to SB 19, Missouri no longer taxes the production of goods sold out of state. In the fiscal notes for SB 19, the estimated cost of the law was $15.2 million per year. However, Kendrick said the new estimate of the bill’s effect on the state’s revenue is a drop of $200 million, which other legislators confirmed. Rep. T.J. Berry, R-Kansas City, said he also heard the bill reduced tax collections by $200 million. And in a Jan. 24 House debate, Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, said a "corporate allocable tax bill" passed two years ago cost the state $200 million. The Department of Revenue has not responded to PolitiFact’s inquiries for how much SB 19 affected the revenue collections. A few tax authorities have said this bill has played a part in the decrease of corporate income tax revenues. Kruckemeyer said the combination of HB 128 and SB 19 were the primary causes of the low corporate income tax collections because they were "explicit changes in tax law." However, Ray McCarty, president of Associated Industries of Missouri, said SB 19 did lower collections but cautioned that corporate income tax revenue is only a few million dollars out of multi-billion dollar revenue collection. He stressed that there may be other factors at play, including above average tax refunds and other legislation. Our Ruling Kendrick said, "Corporate entities are paying less taxes this year. Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015." There hasn’t been a decrease in businesses, and the Missouri economy is doing well as indicated by various economic data. So corporations must be paying less taxes — though experts can argue about which tax cuts and other factors are behind Missouri’s lower corporate income tax collections. However, we don’t have the complete numbers of corporate tax collections because the fiscal year doesn’t end until June 30. With that caveat, we rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-09994	"Congress shoveled $700 billion into the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $325 billion of which has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/09/george-will/columnist-will-correct-initial-tarp-money-did-not-/	The Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, was envisioned as a giant pot of money the federal government could use to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. The idea was to buy the bad assets so banks would be in better shape to do more lending. That was the original vision of Henry Paulson, the Bush administration's treasury secretary and one of the architects of the plan. He won quick approval from Congress in early October 2008. But Paulson changed his strategy. Instead of using the early TARP money to buy the toxic assets, he decided to use it to invest in banks. That, Paulson said, would get them to resume lending. Since then, critics have questioned whether the TARP money has been wisely spent. They have criticized TARP investments in banks that did not appear to be in serious trouble, and said it was unwise to spend $25 billion on the auto industry. In his column on March 24, 2009, conservative writer George Will took aim at a variety of recent acts by Congress and the Obama administration. He described members of Congress as "braying yahoos" and said the Obama administration had invited private sector investors to become business partners "with the capricious and increasingly anticonstitutional government. This latest plan to unfreeze the financial system came almost half a year after Congress shoveled $700 billion into the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $325 billion of which has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets." We had a vague recollection that TARP spending had been broadened at some point, but we wondered if Will was correct that such a large amount had been spent without buying the assets that were the original focus of the program. (Indeed, the program was named after them, creating a metaphorical acronym that suggested it was a temporary protection from storms.) A quick history: In early October, with fears that the economy was on the brink of collapse, Congress approved the $700 billion Paulson wanted, and President George W. Bush signed the measure into law. As we noted above, the early vision was to buy toxic assets. But just 10 days later, Paulson and the Bush administration changed the game plan. Instead of buying toxic assets, they said they would buy stock in American banks to put them on sound footing so they could resume lending. "Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy," Paulson said on Oct. 14. "We regret having to take these actions. Today's actions are not what we ever wanted to do – but today's actions are what we must do to restore confidence to our financial system." Criticism grew. Some said Paulson had gotten too much leeway to spend the money. Congress began harrumphing and holding hearings, and oversight groups known as SIGTARP (the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program) and COP (the Congressional Oversight Panel) began to scrutinize the spending. (A quick aside: The financial crisis has spawned some of coolest acronyms this side of the Pentagon, making it possible for Treasury officials to utter sentences like, "COP and SIGTARP have examined the TARP but haven't yet focused on the P-PIP.") The $325 billion cited by Will comes from the March 11 testimony by Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant secretary for financial stability who directs the TARP, before the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Asked about the status of the program and how much more would be needed, Kashkari said, "We've deployed about 325 billion cash dollars out the door." And at that point, none of the money had been spent on buying toxic assets, according to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional research group, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group tracking spending on TARP and other stimulus programs on its site Stimulus Watch. We should note that since that testimony, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has unveiled his proposal for buying the toxic assets, which would be partly paid for by a portion of the TARP money. But that wasn't the case when Will's column was published, so we find his claim to be True.

pomt-02836	"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/21/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-85-million-americans-received-r/	It’s not an easy time to be a supporter of the health care law. There’s rage at every turn, for the millions of policy cancellation notices in Americans’ mailboxes, for the faulty online marketplace, and for President Barack Obama’s leadership in general. David Axelrod, Obama’s former campaign strategist and adviser, tried batting down the dearth of bad press with some positive statistics about the law Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The law allows young adults under 26 to stay on their parents’ plan, prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and eliminates lifetime caps, Axelrod said. Plus, "8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care." Shortly after his segment, Axelrod took to Twitter and said he was talking about rebates sent in 2013. We wanted to know if his point is accurate. You’re probably wondering who got free money from their insurance companies, and why, because it likely wasn’t you. One of the health care law’s many requirements demands health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of each dollar they charge in premiums on medical care, not for administrative purposes. Policy wonks know it as the medical loss ratio, or the 80/20 rule (for larger employers, it’s more like the 85/15 rule, but that’s more than we need to know for this fact-check). Some Americans know it as the way they got paid by their insurer. If a company spends less than 80 percent on medical services, it must return the difference to the consumer either as a cash payment or as a reduction in future payments. Two-thirds of insurance companies were already meeting the ratio without a policy change, according to a 2011 Government Accountability Office study, though compliance varied upon policy type. For example, 77 percent of companies that sold to large employers with more than 100 employees met the 80/20 rule, while only 43 percent of companies serving customers in the individual market were in compliance. The ratio does not apply to self-funded plans. Insurance companies had to report their premiums and spending for the first time in 2011. Companies returned $1.1 billion in total rebates to 13.1 million policyholders in 2012, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Companies returned about half as much in rebates in 2013 to 8.85 million policyholders (Axelrod was citing the agency’s original estimate of 8.5 million recipients). The average rebate was $98. So Axelrod is on somewhat solid ground here. But there’s a caveat. While 8.85 million policyholders were due rebates, it doesn’t mean people are getting checks as Axelrod claimed. Our colleagues at PolitiFact pointed this out in a statement from Obama over the summer. (Obama also tried to put a dollar amount on the checks, which led to a rating of Half True.) About one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013 (the proportion was about the same in 2012). That means they physically got a check. The rest of the rebates went to the small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees. Employers and employees often share the cost of health insurance, with employers picking up the bulk of the cost. In those cases, the rebate goes to the employer because they buy the insurance. But the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. Employers can pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by "applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees," such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. Again, the rebates came but they doesn’t mean it trickled down to policyholders in the form of a check. Our ruling Axelrod said, "8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care." He is correct on the number of rebates. However, like Obama before him, Axelrod’s claim isn’t clear on the fact that these checks are mostly going to employers who run plans for their workers, not individual Americans. Employers can then choose to pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by "applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees," such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2013-11-21T17:52:12	2013-11-21	['None']

Marco Rubio announced that he will seek re-election in Florida, ending weeks of speculation about his political future. Rubio told reporters that he faced a sense of duty to remain in office whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected president. Rubio’s decision is a complete reversal of what he said as he ran for president, which likely opens him up for criticism as he begins his late campaign. We traced Rubio’s statements about running for re-election, with a focus on statements since he announced for president in April 2015. We are putting his statements on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter which measures the extent to which a politician flips without making a judgment call about those changes. (You can read all of our fact-checks of Rubio on our Truth-O-Meter.) While campaigning, Rubio repeatedly said he was running for president and not for re-election. After he dropped out in March, he said he would not seek re-election. But in recent weeks some of his comments left wiggle room. Rubio’s statements while a presidential candidate Leading up to his April 13, 2015, president announcement, Rubio repeatedly said he wouldn’t seek another Senate term if he ran for president. He couldn’t be on the ballot in Florida for two federal offices at the same time, although technically there was time to do that if he ran for president and dropped out because the qualifying period for the Senate seat is June 2016. Rubio’s vow to not run cleared the path for a handful of other Republicans to jump into the race. Rubio said many times he had no intention for conducting a bid for Senate. Here are just a few. Feb. 20, 2015: Rubio told reporters at the Palm Beach International Airport: "If I decide the best place for me to serve America is to run for president, that's what I'm going to do. And I'm not going to have an exit strategy premised on the idea that I'm going to pivot back to a Senate race. We have quality candidates in the state on the Republican side who could run and make great senators." May 11, 2015: Rubio told ABC News, "I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president. You don't run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it doesn't work out." Oct 20, 2015: Rubio said on Fox News, "In November of next year, I will either be the president of the United States or a private citizen again, because I have a sense of urgency." March 11, 2016: In West Palm Beach, Rubio said, "I'm running for president of the United States. I intend to see that process through to the end. I intend to be the nominee. If that doesn't work out, I've told everyone very clearly: January of next year I will either be the president of the United States or I will be a private citizen. And if I never hold elected office again, I'm comfortable with that." March 14, 2016: A day before Florida’s primary he told the Miami Herald, "I have no problem becoming a private citizen and moving on to other endeavors, to be successful at other things. I've not given much thought to it yet, but things outside of politics." Rubio’s statements after losing primary Rubio lost the Florida primary March 15. He continued to say he wouldn’t run again but then began to slightly qualify his commitment against running. March 17, 2016: Rubio told reporters in Washington, "I'll finish out my term in the Senate. We're going to work really hard here. We have some things we want to achieve. Then I'll be a private citizen in January." May 16: Rubio tweeted, "I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January." May 17: Rubio told a radio station that "I think being a private citizen is a good thing." However, he didn’t rule out running at some point in the future. May 26: Rubio told reporters it was "unlikely" he would seek re-election: "I didn't think it was fair for me to run for president and freeze that seat in a competitive state. So, I made my decision. I don't have anything new to say from what I said in the past. ... I made that decision and I've lived by that decision. Nothing's changed." But pressed further whether he might change his mind he replied, "I don't think so. Look, I enjoy serving with my colleagues, I respect them very much; I'll always listen to what they have to say. But I don't think anything's going to change." May 29: CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Rubio if he would run if his friend, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, didn’t. "Maybe" Rubio said. June 13: The day after the mass shooting at an Orlando gay club, radio show host Hugh Hewitt asked Rubio about whether he would run for re-election. "I think when it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country," Rubio said. He added: "My family and I will be praying about all of this. And we'll see what I need to do next with my life with regard to how I can best serve." June 15: Rubio had repeatedly said he was supporting Lopez-Cantera. After the Orlando shooting, Lopez-Cantera told Politico that on Sunday he encouraged Rubio to run. Rubio told reporters he would think about it over the weekend. "Obviously I take very seriously everything that's going on, not just in Orlando but in our country. I enjoy my service here a lot. So I'll go home later this week and I'll have some time with my family and then if there’s been a chance in our status, I'll be sure to let everyone know." June 22: Rubio told reporters that he decided to run. "I think that the point that really drove me to change my mind is that as we enter this kind of new chapter in our history here is, there’s another role the Senate plays that I think can be really important in the years to come. And that’s the power given to it in the Constitution to act as a check and balance on the excess of the president. It’s even more important given the fact that control of the Senate could very well come down to what happens in the Florida race." Our rating Rubio said multiple times in 2015 and 2016 that he would not seek another term in the Senate, even if he dropped out of the presidential race. After he dropped out of the race in March 2016, Rubio reiterated that he would not seek re-election and would be a private citizen in January. He showed signs of rethinking that position in recent weeks, particularly after the Orlando shooting. On June 22, Rubio announced he will seek a second term. We rate his change in position as a Full Flop.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-06-22T10:36:29	2016-06-22	['United_States']
pomt-12310	"Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth’s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-wrongly-downplays-human-role-climate-ch/	Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earth’s temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the "primary control knob" for the earth’s temperature. "No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in," Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perry’s claim about climate change’s main cause, which scientists have likened to a "control knob." Human activity the main cause of climate change Perry’s claim flies in the face of settled science. The world’s leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is "extremely likely" to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While it’s still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earth’s rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earth’s recorded temperature since 1880. This is not to say natural factors don’t affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earth’s rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, it’s clear the impact is less than that of human factors. Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they don’t account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor," Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide the main ‘control knob’ Perry misidentified climate change’s main "control knob," but he’s not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s claim that carbon dioxide is not "a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earth’s atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a "primary control knob" that’s been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. "A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house," said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earth’s temperature (black line). Our ruling Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, "Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth’s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in." Perry’s claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the "primary control knob" governing the earth’s relatively recent uptick in temperature.

pomt-10067	U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on whether Senate Democrats would seat Roland Burris.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/20/harry-reid/reid-flips-enate-democrats-seating-burris/	"This is not about Mr. Burris; it is about the integrity of a governor accused of attempting to sell this United States Senate seat. Under these circumstances, anyone appointed by Gov. Blagojevich cannot be an effective representative of the people of Illinois and, as we have said, will not be seated." — Dec. 30 statement from Senate Democratic Caucus, which is headed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "We have spoken to Mr. Burris to let him know that he is now the senator-designate from Illinois and as such, will be accorded all the rights and privileges of a senator-elect . . . . We congratulate Senator-designee Burris on his appointment, and we look forward to working with him in the 111th Congress." — Statement from Reid and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009 So how did embattled Roland Burris, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's pick to replace Barack Obama, go from being what Reid described as a "tainted appointment" to "colleague and a friend"? Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements. The first statement came from Reid and the Democratic caucus after Blagojevich defiantly appointed Burris despite charges from federal prosecutors that he had tried to trade the seat for personal gain. Although there was no suggestion that Burris was ever involved in Blagojevich's scheme, Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders said they considered any appointment from Blagojevich "tainted" and vowed to block it. Reid explained the Senate Democrats' initial hard line in a news conference on Jan. 7: "The reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn't look very good." Reid cited comments that federal prosecutors have alleged Blagojevich used, saying the Senate would be "an ‘effin gold mine, I've got to get anything I can out of it." "How are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way," Reid said. But Reid quickly began to soften his stance a few days later. In a Meet the Press interview on Jan. 4, host David Gregory asked if there was "room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris." Reid responded, "I'm an old trial lawyer. There's always room to negotiate." Legally, a few things fell Burris' way. For one, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the appointment was valid. Senate Democratic leaders had initially pinned some of their legal opposition to the Burris appointment on the fact that Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White had not signed off on the appointment, but that fizzled when White wrote a letter validating the appointment. In addition, Burris appeared before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment and testified that he had never offered Blogojevich anything in return for his appointment. Also, Senate Democratic leaders found themselves facing mounting pressure from other Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, to seat Burris. Senate Democratic leadership relented and eventually backed Burris. He was sworn in on Jan. 15 and, like Obama was, will be the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate. "There are many paths to the United States Senate," Reid said from the floor on Jan. 15. "It is fair to say that the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us was unique. . . . Senator Burris, on behalf of all senators, we welcome you as a colleague and a friend." Whether political pressure, a realization of legal inevitability or the change in Burris credentials was the tipping point, the fact is that Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders drew a line in the sand and then, two weeks later, crossed it. It's such a reversal that it's a safe bet that video clips of Reid's earlier statements will be used in Republican TV ads when the Burris seat comes up for election in 2010. On the Flip-O-Meter, we call that a Full Flop.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2009-01-20T17:36:06	2009-01-13	['Harry_Reid', 'Roland_Burris', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-15248	On the Cuba embargo.	full flop	/florida/statements/2015/aug/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-cuba-embargo-change-position-did/	Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Miami in which she called for lifting the Cuba embargo -- and she did it on the home turf of embargo supporters and GOP rivals former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. "The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all," she said at Florida International University July 31. The anti-Democratic America Rising PAC accused Clinton of making a "sudden flip flop on Cuba." Well, it wasn’t exactly sudden. We decided to put Clinton’s statements since 2000 on the embargo on our Flip-O-Meter, which doesn’t pass judgment on changing stances but evaluates whether a candidate has flipped and to what extent. Some voters see some flips as a sign of inconsistency, while others view flips as a sign that a politician has the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents. First, a word about lifting the embargo, which would require action by Congress. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act which prevents the embargo from being lifted until Cuba holds free and fair elections, frees political prisoners and allows for a free press and labor unions. Cuba did release some prisoners as part of the deal with the United States but has not met all of these conditions. 2000 Clinton spoke about Cuba in 2000 when she was running to be the U.S. senator from New York. After a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in October that year, an audience member asked Clinton for her position on the embargo. "I believe before the United States should lift the embargo, Castro should make some good faith show of moving toward ending repression, freeing political prisoners and some steps toward democratization," she said. Clinton also said that while she supported increasing food and medicine exports to Cuba and allowing more travel, "I’m not ready to vote to lift the embargo." 2008 During her first presidential bid in 2008, Clinton favored maintaining the embargo. (So did Obama at the time, though he would later change his stance.) In July 2007, Obama said in a debate he would meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The next day Clinton said that was "irresponsible and, frankly, naive." In a December 2007 debate, Clinton said: "Until there is some recognition on the part of whoever is in charge of the Cuban government that they have to move toward democracy and freedom for the Cuban people, it will be very difficult for us to change our policy." In January 2008 in a statement accompanying a questionnaire released by the Cuban American National Foundation, Clinton said now is "not the time to consider wholesale or broad changes to our Cuba policy." In a debate on Univision in February 2008, Clinton said "as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction." 2014 to 2016 In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that near the end of her tenure as secretary of state, she recommended that Obama review the embargo. She wrote that the embargo "wasn’t achieving its goals, and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America. After 20 years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive." When Obama made his announcement on Dec. 17 about the change in Cuba policy, Clinton said she supported the change. The speech in Miami was Clinton’s first major speech as a presidential candidate about Cuba policy. It occurred amid the backdrop of polls that show the majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. During her speech, Clinton explained that she had supported the embargo in the past. The Helms-Burton law was signed after the Cuban Air Force shot down the Brothers to the Rescue plane, killing volunteers on board. Clinton said "with their deaths in mind, I supported the Helms-Burton Act to tighten the embargo." But she said that the embargo was a "failed policy" and said she agrees with Obama’s call on Congress to drop the embargo. "That last step about the embargo is crucial, because without dropping it, this progress could falter," she said. "The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all." She also said that if Congress won’t act to make it easier for more Americans to go to Cuba, she will use her executive authority to do so. Our conclusion In her 2000 campaign for Senate, Clinton clearly stated that she wasn’t ready to lift the Cuba embargo. During her first bid for president in 2007, she repeatedly called for reforms in Cuba before any such changes to the embargo. But by 2014, she was a critic of the embargo and said it hadn’t achieved it’s goals. In a speech in Miami on July 31, Clinton forcefully stated that she believes it is time to drop the embargo. Clinton has made a full change of position, so we rate it a Full Flop.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-03T17:17:29	2015-07-31	['Cuba']

pomt-14284	"A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/apr/06/bill-clinton/bill-clintons-college-debt-claim-mostly-true/	Former President Bill Clinton raised a hot-button issue while stumping for his wife in Los Angeles this week: America’s mounting student loan debt. Student debt in the United States has reached $1.3 trillion, which trails only the amount Americans owe on their mortgages. It’s often blamed for preventing young people from buying houses and cars, which fuels the country’s economy. Undergraduates in the class of 2015 finished school with an average of $35,000 in student loan debt, the most in history, according to Edvisors.com, a financial aid website. If elected president in November, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would remove a unique barrier related to college loans, the former president claimed. "A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down," Bill Clinton said, speaking at a recent campaign rally at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. We wondered: Is refinancing really off-limits for all college loans? With student loan debt such a big issue this election year, we decided to check the facts. Past efforts at change Both Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, have pledged to allow student loans to be refinanced. But they weren’t the first to call for this change. In June 2014, Senate Republicans rejected legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would have let student borrowers refinance their federal loan debt. "Homeowners are refinancing. Small businesses are refinancing. We just want young people who got an education to have their shot," Warren was quoted as saying in a Washington Post news article at the time. Republicans said they were not convinced the legislation would have resulted in lower borrowing costs, and labeled it an election stunt. The bill would have let people with federal and private loans issued prior to 2010 refinance at 3.86 percent, the article said. It added that the Obama administration estimated that the bill could have helped 25 million borrowers save $2,000 each over the lifetime of their loans, or $50 billion. Former President Bill Clinton speaks during a campaign stop for his wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016, at the West End Community Development Center in Greenville, S.C. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Our research As they’ve campaigned across the country, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Sanders have each pledged to allow for refinancing of college loan debt. What they, and apparently Bill Clinton, are talking about is refinancing federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of all student borrowing. We turned to the nonprofit college planning group American Student Assistance for some advice. They and other groups say federal student loans can be refinanced into private loans. But doing so can remove federal protections such as fixed interest rates and the ability to pause repayments. Also, private student loans can be refinanced into new lower-interest private loans. But there’s no provision in federal law allowing the refinancing of a federal loan to another, lower-interest federal loan. "There is no federal refinancing. Congress sets the interest rate for federal student loans, and most of these rates are fixed by law, no matter how solid your credit or income becomes post-graduation," American Student Assistance advises potential borrowers. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim in 2014 and rated it Mostly True. They spoke with Heather Jarvis, a North Carolina attorney specializing in student loan law, who told them some graduates may be able to refinance student loans at lower rates through private lenders. But, she said, this would only happen in cases in which borrowers have substantial income. Jarvis added that "refinancing federal loans with a private loan is risky. The borrower gives up important protections that accompany federal loans (like flexible repayment and discharge provisions)." Students repaying federally backed loans, Jarvis said, are effectively barred from refinancing opportunities because federal law makes no provision for the government to make such offers. Asked about the former president’s statement, Bill Clinton’s press secretary said in an email "it’s very safe to say that the vast majority of students with debt have federal debt." She pointed to statistics from the College Board showing federal loans account for about 90 percent of student borrowing. She said a small percentage of borrowers can refinance a federal student loan by making it a private loan. Our ruling Former President Bill Clinton said at a recent campaign rally in Los Angeles: "A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down." Borrowers of federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of student loans, cannot refinance those into lower-interest federal loans. Congress sets the interest rate on these loans, and there’s no provision in federal law that allows for them to be refinanced. Depending on factors such as income, some borrowers can refinance their federal loans into lower-interest private loans, though they risk losing their federal loan protections. Clinton most likely was referring only to federally backed loans when he made his statement, but a clarification about private loans would have helped. We rated his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06075	Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan provides "pretty much" the same coverage that members of Congress receive.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-republicans-medicare-plan-would/	Every American should have access to the health care benefits that members of Congress enjoy. That’s an oft-repeated grumbling about the Washington elite, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum acknowledged that he hears it from voters on the campaign trail. "Well, you know, I hear this all the time. ... I've been campaigning around the state, you know, ‘We should have the same kind of health care that members of Congress have,’" he said during a Jan. 8, 2012, primary debate in New Hampshire. "Well, that's pretty much what Paul Ryan's plan is. … The members of Congress have a premium support model. So does every other federal employee," he said. Santorum was referring to the budget proposal introduced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. Known as The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise, Ryan’s plan reduces federal spending through changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older. Santorum isn’t the first to say that Ryan’s vision for Medicare mirrors Congress members’ health insurance. But PolitiFact has investigated and found that the plans are not the same. Medicare vs. the Ryan plan Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals and sets fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan’s plan specifically says this is not a "voucher" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Ryan’s plan explains it this way: "When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks." There’s the comparison again. Ryan’s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance. So how are the two systems alike? In Ryan’s budget, Medicare plans from private insurers would be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as are plans that cover members of Congress. Also, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. How are they different? First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula known as "Fair Share." Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired, living on a fixed income. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Our ruling Keeping in mind that Ryan’s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the health insurance that members of Congress receive, and on the point that matters most: cost to beneficiaries. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income on average than members of Congress and likely will not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. Finally, they will not enjoy the same protection against rising costs that "Fair Share" provides members of Congress. We rate Santorum’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-13162	Global warming leads to much quicker spread of the Zika virus because the increased temperature, "makes mosquitoes mature faster, . . . bite more due to having a higher metabolism, and makes the Zika virus inside of them incubate faster."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/28/al-gore/al-gore-claims-global-warming-will-lead-faster-spr/	In a nod to environmentally oriented voters, Hillary Clinton campaigned in Miami with Al Gore to detail her plans for investing in green energy and combatting global warming. During his speech, Gore highlighted the dangers that global warming poses to public health in the United States. While discussing Florida’s Zika outbreak, he claimed that increased temperatures energize Zika-carrying mosquitoes and make the disease spread faster. "The change in climate conditions changes the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots," he said. "Increased temperature from global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, makes them bite more due to a having a higher metabolism, and makes the Zika virus inside of them incubate faster, leading to much quicker spread of the disease." Gore’s overall message was focused on Zika transmission in the United States. But scientists across the world have expressed concerns that global warming could increase transmission of tropical diseases such as dengue fever and malaria in many countries. We decided to take a closer look at the effect of global warming on mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. Global warming and mosquitoes Research suggests that higher temperatures from global warming could increase the habitat range of Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito that transmits Zika virus, yellow fever and dengue. For example, a recent study simulated the change in habitat for Aedes aegypti in two different global warming scenarios until the year 2080. The researchers found that even in a model with moderate greenhouse emissions, the mosquitoes would be able to expand into areas that were previously too cool to live in, such as the northeastern United States and southern Europe. They concluded that up to an additional 298 million to 460 million people could end up exposed. Graphs showing the projected spread of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in two global warming simulations. Figure A shows the mosquito’s current distribution, where red regions have the highest level of activity and blue regions the lowest. Figure B models changes in habitat between 2061 and 2080 with moderate greenhouse emissions. Figure C is the same, but assumes a higher level of emissions. Purple shading shows regions where the mosquitoes would become more prevalent. Source: Monaghan et al. But how do rising temperatures directly affect the metabolism and life cycle of Zika-carrying mosquitoes? Andrew Monaghan, lead author of the mosquito habitat study and a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that global warming has the potential to elevate transmission risk due to changes in the mosquito’s behavior. "Warmer temperatures increase Aedes mosquito development and survival rates, affect biting behavior, and speed up the extrinsic incubation period for Aedes-transmitted viruses such as Zika," he said. "There is strong scientific consensus on these aspects, based on numerous laboratory and field studies." This effect isn’t unique to mosquitoes with the Zika virus. According to Laura Norris at USAID, the reproduction rate of a variety of mosquito-borne viruses is directly correlated to the mosquito’s metabolism. Because all mosquitoes are cold-blooded, increased temperatures would lead to faster reproduction of the virus and would yield mosquitoes that can spread disease earlier in their life cycle. A complicated picture Scientists suspect that global warming is playing an increasingly large role in outbreaks of tropical disease. A World Health Organization report notes that dengue and malaria transmission increased in several Asian countries during unusually warm El Niño years. Other trends include the spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease and encephalitis into northern Europe and the resurgence of malaria in the East African highlands. However, experts stressed that climate change is an extremely complex phenomenon that could have different and unpredictable effects on mosquito ecology and disease transmission, depending on the region. Monaghan noted that in regions where the temperature is already near the upper threshold for mosquito habitability, global warming could actually reduce transmission risk due to decreased survival rates in extreme heat. However, these areas of lower risk would likely be small compared to areas that would end up with a higher transmission risk. Additionally, other changes in climate such as rainfall and humidity complicate the picture. Mosquito-borne disease could increase in regions that experience more rainfall due to wider availability of potential breeding pools. Other locations could see decreases in the mosquito population due to droughts. Finally, it’s important to remember that disease transmission isn’t affected by just one variable, but rather by an intricate mosaic of factors involving modern human travel, poverty, ecology, habitat modification and genetic variation. The challenge for scientists lies in sorting out the effects of global warming from these other issues. Greg Lanzaro, professor at University of California at Davis, said he wasn’t aware of any compelling evidence that linked Zika spread to global warming. He instead identified increased human travel and trade as the major drivers behind the spread of mosquitoes and pathogens to new environments. Walter J. Tabachnik, a professor at the University of Florida’s Medical Entomology Laboratory, thinks that climate change will change disease transmission, but cautioned against making any sweeping conclusions. He directed us to several of his papers that highlighted the shortcomings of current disease models and called for more research in the field. The lesson is that although global warming could change mosquito behavior and potentially facilitate disease transmission, there’s so many different variables involved and so many separate regions to study that it’s impossible to make any clear-cut predictions. Our ruling Gore claimed that global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, bite more, incubate the Zika virus faster, and spread the disease quicker. There is strong scientific consensus that higher temperatures do speed up the mosquito’s metabolism, resulting in the biological effects Gore described. But scientists haven’t conclusively proved that global warming leads to faster spread of mosquito-borne diseases. More research is needed to understand how a changing climate fits into an already complicated mesh of human and environmental factors.

pomt-03174	"The average family premium has increased by 29% under Obama!"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/	Just hours before former President Bill Clinton was to give a speech promoting President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Republican National Committee sent a pre-emptive tweet critical of Obama’s stewardship of health care. The Sep. 4, 2013, tweet said, "The average family premium has increased by 29% under Obama!" The tweet offered the link to a new RNC website, obamacarecosts.org, and added the hashtag "#Obamacosts." Is the tweet’s claim correct? We turned to the leading study of family premiums, an independent, nonpartisan study published annually since 1999 by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust. The study looks at health premium costs for workers and their employers. The 2008 study -- the last one completed before Obama took office -- found that the average family premium for employer-sponsored health insurance was $12,680. By the time of the 2013 study, that amount had risen to $16,351. That’s an increase of 29 percent -- exactly as the RNC’s tweet had said. That’s well above the rate of inflation overall, which was about 8 percent during that period. Since health coverage premiums provided through a job are typically split between the employee and the employer, the studies also provided a breakdown of who paid what. This data showed that the employee share of premiums actually rose even faster over that period -- 36 percent. So the RNC’s numbers are sound. But we’ll also point out some missing context: The rate of increase between 2008 and 2013 was significantly lower than it was between 1999 and 2008. From 2008 to 2013, premiums rose by an average of 5.8 percent per year. But between 1999 and 2008, premiums rose by an average of 13.2 percent a year -- in other words, twice as fast as premiums rose under Obama. So, contrary to the tweet’s implication that Obama has presided over runaway health care costs, premiums are actually increasing less quickly than previously. How much does that context undercut the tweet? That’s a matter of opinion. Jon Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who advised both Obama and then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on health care policy, said that the RNC’s fact "is right, but that is actually good news, not bad news." Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed that it’s a reasonable bit of context. He acknowledged there are "differences of opinion" on why premiums are growing more slowly, including larger economic trends, long-term trends in health care and policies instituted under Obama’s law. However, Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, cautioned against placing too much weight on the historical trends. "Premiums rose," she said. "The most relevant point is that Obama and his advisers repeatedly and publicly said premiums would fall by the end of his first term if the ACA was passed. Instead, they rose." Indeed, we have previously given Obama a Promise Broken for his pledge to "cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year." Wilensky added that Obama may ultimately have been lucky in his timing. "Health care prices has been increasing unusually slowly for the last few years," she said. "How much of that is carry-over from the deep recession is unknown." Whether or not premiums grow more slowly over the long term, she said, will become clearer once the economy recovers more fully and puts upward pressure on prices. Our ruling The RNC said "the average family premium has increased by 29% under Obama!" The leading study confirms that rise, which occurred over the course of five years. If you calculate the increases on an annual basis, premiums have risen by about 5.8 percent a year under Obama, which is less than half of the average annual rise during the nine years before Obama took office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-02188	Ed Gillespie’s 2006 book "promoted an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/27/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-say-ed-gillespies-book-promoted-individu/	Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie rarely leaves a microphone without criticizing Democrat incumbent Mark Warner’s 2009 vote for Obamacare. The Democratic Party of Virginia says the attacks are hypocritical, maintaining that Gillespie once embraced a policy that is at the heart of President Barack Obama’s health reform law -- an individual mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty. "Gillespie’s memoir promotes an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code," the party stated in a March 24 news release. The Democrats were pointing to words that Gillespie -- a former White House adviser and chairman of the Republican National Committee -- wrote in his 2006 book, "Winning Right: Campaign politics and conservative policies." We wondered if Gillespie’s memoir really did promote an individual mandate for health insurance -- the bane of many conservatives who oppose Obamacare. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Americans without health coverage start paying a penalty this year. By 2016, the levy grows to $2,085 per family or 2.5 percent of household income -- whichever is greater. Certain tax filers facing financial hardship and other situations are exempt. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, told us in an e-mail that "Ed never supported the individual mandate." Gillespie made a similar statement to the Washington Examiner last December, before he announced his candidacy. "If I run against Sen. Warner, my critique of Obamacare will be consistent with my past positions in opposition to an individual mandate and too much government intrusion in our health care sector," he said. But Democrats point to a 2006 book passage in which Gillespie wrote that health care reforms should ensure that uncovered adults gain health care insurance so they won’t remain "free riders" who get care at others’ expense. "A more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so," Gillespie wrote. "One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance. Annual filers would have to attest that they have some form of health coverage or else the ‘standard deduction’ on their income tax would be cut in half." Right after this passage, Gillespie discussed another way to ensure all adults provide for their own health care. "Another approach would be the creation of tax-free Health Savings Accounts that would be refunded after a certain period for any use," he wrote. "If after seven years, an individual didn’t use his HSA funds for health care, the money would be treated like an income tax refund. The inducement of tax-free savings for those who are healthy would provide an incentive for more people to obtain insurance coverage.". We twice asked Gillespie’s campaign why his suggestion to cut the standard deduction for uninsured people should not be considered support for a mandate. Logan did not provide a direct answer, saying Gillespie was writing about "various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time." Logan also pointed us to an op-ed earlier this month in Forbes in which Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, said the passage In Gillespie’s book amounts to an "anti-mandate approach." Matthews told us he "assumed" that Gillespie, in his 2006 book, was endorsing an unsuccessful proposal President George W. Bush made one year later offering tax breaks to insured households. Bush’s "carrot" approach sought voluntary compliance; it did not mandate the purchase of health insurance, but would have rewarded most people who had coverage. That’s different from Obama’s "stick" approach of insisting people obtain coverage or face tax penalties. But Matthews added that the Gillespie campaign has never told him his assumption is correct and that Gillespie’s language in the book is unclear. Logan also pointed to a column from the conservative National Review magazine which said "some of the language (‘ensure,’ compliance’) sounds pro-mandate, but the actual policies described strongly resemble the proposals of the Bush administration and of Paul Ryan, which very few conservatives have described as the equivalent of a mandate." We spoke to two health care experts who had a different take on Gillespie’s prose. Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, told us the policy Gillespie described is "the functional equivalent of an individual mandate without using the words mandate and fine." "Absolutely, that’s an individual mandate," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, after reading Gillespie’s passage. Tanner said the passage sounds like an endorsement Massachusetts health care reforms that then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a few months before Gillespie’s book was published. The law imposed tax penalties on state residents who could afford insurance and refused to buy it. In November 2006, a few months after his book was released, Gillespie specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan. "You see Mitt Romney in Massachusetts is taking some steps toward individual requirements for people to carry their own insurance. I think the party is probably open to that kind of approach," Gillespie told C-SPAN. "Others are proposing small business health plans and greater transparency and putting the consumer closer in touch with the health care expenditure. I think that’s a good direction." Logan, Gillespie’s spokesman, said the interview establishes his boss’s mindset: While Gillespie opined that the GOP might be open to an individual mandate, Gillespie added he personally thought a "good direction" was to pursue a different approach. In ensuing years, Gillespie emerged as a steadfast opponent to the individual mandate in Obamacare. In November 2009, he told ABC News that the health reform bill under consideration was a "monstrosity" in part because of "the mandates in it." As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, the individual mandate was discussed in Republican circles more than 15 years before Obamacare even existed. In 1993 some Republican senators signed onto a bill that would have required everyone to buy insurance. The legislation was an alternative to then President Bill Clinton’s failed health care reform plan that required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated insurers and health care providers. Our ruling Democrats said Gillespie’s book "promoted an individual mandate." Gillespie’s 2006 memoir states that one way of reforming health care is to require people to carry insurance or have their standard tax deduction cut in half. That fits the definition of an individual mandate. Gillespie’s campaign denies this is the case, but declines to provide a clear explanation. It should be noted that Gillespie offered tax consequences as one possibility for reforming health care. His book suggested Health Savings Account as another way to ensure adults get coverage. Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines "promote" as "to help bring about" something. Although it may not have been Gillespie’s intention, his unclear book passage can be easily interpreted as advancing the idea of individual mandates during a formative time for health policy. So we rate the Democrats’ claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic Party of Virginia	None	None	None	2014-04-27T00:00:00	2014-03-24	['None']
pomt-08574	"Over the past year ... our 16 counties have hemorrhaged more than 6,000 jobs with no apparent end in sight."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/27/steve-southerland/steve-southerland-says-allen-boyds-north-florida-d/	Locked in a competitive race for a North Florida Congressional seat, Republican Steve Southerland is highlighting unemployment statistics to say the district is hemorrhaging jobs. On Sept. 17, 2010, Southerland issued a press release entitled "Southerland calls for leadership on job creation." The release was in response to an Agency for Workforce Innovation jobs report detailing August 2010 unemployment figures. The report found that statewide, the unemployment rate rose .2 percent since July, from 11.5 percent to 11.7 percent. Southerland, a funeral-home owner, seized on the figures as a way to criticize his Democratic opponent, incumbent U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd. "Allen Boyd voted for the reckless $787 billion stimulus giveaway with an assurance that his vote would create Second District jobs," Southerland said in the release. "Over the past year, however, our 16 counties have hemorrhaged more than 6,000 jobs with no apparent end in sight. As an experienced small businessman, I am prepared to lead where Allen Boyd has failed. I will fight to create permanent new jobs in Florida and restore common sense economic policy in Washington." Southerland is right that Boyd voted for the 2009 stimulus. But he has his jobs number wrong. Let us explain. The Agency for Workforce Innovation report included county-by-county employment statistics for August 2010, July 2010 and August 2009. For each time period, the report measured the size of the labor force, the number of people employed and the number of people unemployed. The report then calculated an unemployment rate. We gathered the relevant statistics for the 16 counties that make up the 2nd District -- Dixie, Lafayette, Suwanne, Taylor, Jefferson, Leon, Gadsden, Wakulla, Franklin, Liberty, Gulf, Calhoun, Jackson, Bay, Okaloosa, Walton -- to run our own calculations. Here's what we found: From 2009 to 2010, the labor force (i.e. the people available to work) grew in the 16-county area from 497,407 to 501,650. That's an extra 4,243 available to work. In the same time period, the number of employed people shrank from 457,896 to 456,089 -- a drop of 1,807 people. Lastly, the number of unemployed people grew from 39,511 to 45,561, an increase of 6,050. We'll save you some of the mental math gymnastics and tell you that if you add the number of employed people (the second set of numbers) to the number of unemployed people (the third set of numbers), you get the labor force for the 16-county area (the first set of numbers). Why does this all matter? Southerland in his statement is saying the 16 counties that make up the 2nd District lost more than 6,000 jobs. It's true that about 6,000 more people were unemployed in August 2010 than August 2009 (6,050 to be exact), but the district hasn't lost near that many jobs. In the same time period, 1,807 less people are employed -- meaning that 1,807 jobs were lost. That is, of course, a significant number, but it's way lower than what Southerland claimed. We ran the figures and Southerland's statement by Robert Barro, the Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He agreed that "lost jobs" should equal the change in the number employed, not the change in the number of unemployed. We rate Southerland's statement False.

pomt-03555	"If you are black or brown, you are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked" in New York City.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/23/lynn-derbyshire/university-rhode-island-professor-says-black-or-br/	Amid the ongoing debate over whether Rhode Island should arm its campus police, several University of Rhode Island faculty members expressed concern that students, especially minority students, could be targeted by police who haven’t been adequately trained. (The state Board of Education is expected to vote on the issue Thursday night.) One of the URI opponents is Lynne Derbyshire, an associate professor of communication studies and women’s studies. "All of us who have grown up in the U.S. have grown up making distinctions with regard to skin color," Derbyshire was quoted as saying in the May 16 Providence Journal. "If you are black or brown, you are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked. If we arm campus police, we are potentially endangering students of color." We were curious about her claim on minorities. Are they really being stopped and frisked nine times more frequently than whites? We e-mailed her and asked for her source. She responded quickly, saying she had told the reporter that the data involved New York City, an element not mentioned in the story. We checked with the reporter, who said that Derbyshire had also mentioned other estimates reflecting racial bias, such as a study saying that persons of color are five times more likely to be stopped by police while driving on Route 95. We decided to check the New York numbers. She subsequently sent us a link to a 2009 study by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which was suing the City of New York on behalf of people who claimed they were being stopped and frisked simply because of race. (The trial ended Monday; a federal judge is expected to issue a decision later this year.) The city's stop-and-frisk policy, implemented in 2002, has sparked conflicting claims, with critics saying the pattern of stops illustrates a racial bias and supporters saying that it has kept the streets safer. Using data collected by police from 2005 to the first half of 2008, the center concluded that 8 percent of those frisked were whites, who make up 44 percent of the city's population. In comparison, 85 percent of those frisked were blacks and Latinos, who make up 53 percent of the population. That's 10 times more frequent if you adjust for the city racial makeup -- close to the figure Derbyshire cited. But the report also shows that odds of being frisked if you're white increased over those years, reducing the racial disparity. When we looked at the report's numbers for 2007, the frisk rate was 15 percent for whites, 35 percent for Latinos and 51 percent for blacks. If you adjust for population, blacks and Latinos were 4.8 times more likely to be frisked than whites. Finally, when we analyzed the 2011 data, available through the website of the New York Civil Liberties Union, things had apparently gotten worse; adjusted for the 2010 population balance, blacks and Latinos were 7.5 times more likely to be frisked in cases where race was listed. The data show that the biggest factor is the racial disparity among people stopped in the first place. Among those stopped, only 11 percent were white. Once stopped, whites were patted down 41 percent of the time compared with 54 percent for blacks and 55 percent for Latinos. But things get more complicated. When the RAND Corporation, the nonprofit global policy think tank, analyzed the data, it warned that the technique of comparing the frisk numbers to the population profile "has been widely discredited" as a gauge for racial profiling. The reason: if the suspects in most of the crimes in a particular neighborhood involve people of a particular race, an unbiased police department is naturally going to be stopping more people of that race. RAND, which was hired by the New York City Police Foundation, tried other admittedly imperfect ways to compare the racial balance of the people actually stopped with the pattern one would expect if police behavior was untainted by racism. RAND still saw bias, but the degree was much smaller. For example, when it came to being frisked once stopped, the rates under comparable circumstances, were 29 percent for whites, 34 percent for blacks and 33 percent for Latinos; a difference, but not a huge one. The RAND study, in turn, sparked its own criticism. An analysis by a Columbia University professor said the study "strongly understates the racial disparities" in the likelihood of being frisked. And then another study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found there was no racial bias on the part of the New York City Police Department, at least among blacks. To put this in perspective, these studies are trying to assess the deeper question of whether the numbers translate into racism. Derbyshire's statement, made in the context of concerns about racism, simply says that the odds of being stopped and frisked are nine times higher for those who aren't white. How likely is it that any of these findings would apply to the URI campus where Derbyshire teaches? The best-known studies of racial profiling by police in Rhode Island were released in 2003 and 2006. But they involved drivers, not pedestrians. The 2003 analysis found that non-white drivers were 2-1/2 times as likely to be searched than white drivers, even though police were more likely to find contraband among the whites. A followup study three years later, showed only modest improvement. Our ruling Lynne Derbyshire, arguing against arming campus police in Rhode Island, said, "If you are black or brown, you are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked" by police in New York City. The context in which she made her statement suggests that such racial profiling is a threat for students here. We don't believe that population-wide data from the nation's largest city, which has had an aggressive stop and frisk policy for more than a decade, are particularly relevant to a debate involving two state colleges, neither of which are in an urban setting, and a rural university which has an annex in downtown Providence. But if we apply the Truth-O-Meter to the New York data, the study Derbyshire supplied showed a tenfold risk of being frisked if you are black or Latino in New York City. Newer data show that that risk is somewhat less than she said. We'll leave it to others to debate the degree of racism reflected in the numbers, but Derbyshire's statement about the probability of being frisked if you are a person of color in New York City is close enough to the latest data to warrant a Mostly True.

pomt-09456	Says Gov. Charlie Crist has called him "a rock star."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/05/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-crist-called-him-rock-star/	State Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, is trying to appeal across party lines with an eye toward the general election. He's portraying himself as a politician focused on principles rather than partisan warfare. The "About Dave" page on his campaign Web site says, "The Naples Daily News called him 'the real deal,' and Governor Charlie Crist has praised him as "a rock star." It does not explain the context or source for the Crist quote. Given how partisan politics have become, it's surprising to see such favorable comments from someone of the opposite party. So we wondered if the Republican governor really described a Democratic legislator and attorney in such favorable terms. We found the quote in an April 19, 2007, post on the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog titled, appropriately, "Aronberg is Crist's 'rockstar.' " Here's what it said: "To be honest, about anything Sen. Aronberg does is important to me," Crist said when asked about Aronberg's proposal to revise state sex offender residency rules. "The guy is brilliant. He's a rockstar, and I have such great respect for him. And he's just a good, decent man. And almost everything I can think of that he's ever promoted or pushed has been something I'm able to support gladly." The "rock star" quote was repeated in several other articles, mostly in the Palm Beach Post. A May 14, 2007, Palm Beach Post article said: "After Crist gushed last month about Greenacres Democratic state Sen. Dave Aronberg ('The guy is brilliant. I mean, he's almost a rock star.'), Aronberg got a tape and planned to give it to his mom for Mother's Day." You'll notice the Post version of the quote includes the qualifier "almost," but we listened to audio from the original Miami Herald interview and indeed Crist unequivocally says, "He's a rock star." The "rock star" quote even played a role in a debate among Republicans about whether to support Aronberg. A Palm Beach County-based lobbyist wanted to launch a Republican committee to endorse Aronberg "citing the Democrat as 'honest' and having 'integrity,' and invoking Crist's praise of Aronberg as a 'rock star,' " the Palm Beach Post reported July 19, 2008. Then party chair Jim Greer nixed the idea of the Republican party backing the Democrat. So Aronberg is correct. Crist sang his praises and put him on the big stage. We find his claim True.

pomt-11046	"Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump’s private messages in undercover sting."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/28/blog-posting/website-falsely-claimed-twitter-caught-leaking-pri/	An old headline making new waves on social media falsely claimed Twitter was caught leaking President Donald Trump’s private messages to the Justice Department as part of an undercover sting operation. "Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump’s private messages in undercover sting," said a Jan. 11, 2018, headline from Neon Nettle, an online news site created to provide an "educational and thought provoking" alternative to the mainstream news media, according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice," the Neon Nettle story said. The headline is based on comments made by a Twitter engineer, but the engineer never said he had leaked information to the Justice Department. The story cited a video from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O’Keefe, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building and was sued for $1 million in 2017. Project Veritas has a proven history of using undercover reporting, hidden cameras and selectively-edited video recordings to serve a predetermined narrative. In 2017, the organization sent a woman posing as a sexual assault victim of Roy Moore — a candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama — to the Washington Post in an apparent effort to discredit the paper’s investigation into Moore’s predatory behavior. For this particular sting video, Project Veritas used hidden cameras to surreptitiously record two separate conversations between undercover journalists and Clay Haynes, a senior network security engineer at Twitter, according to LinkedIn. The journalists, dressed in disguises, asked leading questions in a clear effort to elicit certain responses from Haynes. "We’re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation (into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election)," Haynes, who also expressed his personal disdain for Trump, said at one point. "Basically, giving them every single tweet that he’s posted. Even the ones he’s deleted, any direct messages, any mentions." In the second interview, Haynes said of the possibility of turning over Trump’s messages, "We have a subpoena process for that very reason." When asked whether Twitter was working with the Justice Department, he declined to comment. Both interviews occurred in January 2018, and Twitter issued a statement after Project Veritas published its video. "The individual depicted in this video was speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent or speak for Twitter," a company spokesperson said. "Twitter only responds to valid legal requests, and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request." "We deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a predetermined narrative," the spokesperson said. "Twitter is committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules." It is unclear from the video whether Haynes knew he was being recorded, though he does not seem to be aware. It is illegal to record a private conversation without the consent of both parties in California, where the video was taken. As Snopes previously noted, Project Veritas’ videos are "virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips of the involved conversations" because they use "stitched-together, out-of-context remarks with no indication of what occurred or what was discussed just before and after the included portions." According to Twitter’s Help Center, legal processes are required to trigger the release of private messages. "Non-public information about Twitter users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process," the company policy said. "Requests for the contents of communications … require a valid search warrant or equivalent from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter." Haynes did not say that Twitter leaked private messages from Trump. He said only that the company would be "more than happy to help the DOJ" were such help ever triggered by a legal process. We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any reports that Twitter was cooperating in this fashion with special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the 2016 election, although the company did meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss Russian bot accounts on its site. But even if we were to take Project Veritas’ video at face value, the Neon Nettle headline was misleading. The video showed Twitter to be capable of granting access to Trump’s private messages — a capability that most technology companies maintain — but the company was not caught leaking them. Neon Nettle did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-06-28T10:46:37	2018-01-11	['None']

pomt-00500	Wisconsin "was literally broke" when Republicans took office in January 2011.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/26/jim-steineke/jim-steineke-says-wisconsin-was-broke-when-republi/	Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke frequently uses Twitter to spar with political opponents, and a recent exchange got more heated than usual. The Kaukauna Republican criticized Democrats, liberals, the proposed Milwaukee streetcar and high speed rail in a vigorous exchange June 18, 2015. In the midst of the discussion, he tweeted: "WI was literally broke when we got here. Been cleaning up your mess ever since." That is an oldie but goodie on the PolitiFact Wisconsin jukebox. We rated the "broke" claim False when Gov. Scott Walker made it in early 2011. Nevertheless, we asked Steineke -- who like Walker was elected in November of 2010 -- for backup for the claim. We did not hear back and soon after the request, the tweet was deleted. But it lives on in the archives, and in various retweeted versions. Walker’s claim came Feb. 21, 2011, as protests got underway against the budget repair bill, which later became Act 10. The bill curtailed collective bargaining rights for most public employees and required them to pay more toward health care and pensions. The governor declared he would not negotiate on the bill: "We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years." He repeated the mantra in his budget speech: "The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it’s time to start paying our bills today -- so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow." A spokesman said Walker was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patient's Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision. Other factors cited included the Medicaid and corrections deficits, as well as the state’s "structural deficit" which at the time was estimated at $3.6 billion. When we cracked a dictionary to look up the word "broke," we found listings that included: "having no money; bankrupt" and "without money; penniless." But numerous experts told us the state wasn’t teetering on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency and, under federal law, could not make such a declaration. In January 2011, Moody’s -- which studies and rates debt issued by governments and corporations -- had said Wisconsin fared well when compared with other states. What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans. Indeed, by law, each Wisconsin budget must be balanced -- that was what the budget repair bill was aimed at fixing. Walker would go on to repeat the "broke" claim in a Sept. 2, 2011 fund-raising appeal. We declared that claim Pants on Fire, because at that point the state had passed a balanced budget with a structural surplus that Walker had celebrated as fiscally sound. Our rating Steineke tweeted that Wisconsin was "literally broke" when he and other Republicans took office in 2011. When Walker made the "broke" claim, we rated it False. It still is.

pomt-09166	Under the new health care law, the elderly will be denied care when they have "passed the age limit for treatment."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/jun/07/dan-fanelli/fanellis-video-suggests-obamacare-will-cut-treatme/	Dan Fanelli, a retired airline captain and Republican running against U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who represents the Orlando, Fla., area, has a catchy video on his website related to the health care bill dubbed "Obamacare." Set in a doctor's office with somber orchestral music as the backdrop, a sympathetic doctor rolls up his chair to talk to an elderly white-haired man in a patient's gown. "I'm sorry. I've tried everything," the doctor says. "But doctor, I've already waited over six months,'' says the patient. "I can't bear this any longer." "It's not that it's ...," the kind doctor hesitates, placing his hand on the patient's shoulder. "They denied you because you passed the age limit for the treatment." The depressed old man's gaze averts downward -- perhaps a hint that he realizes he will die? Will the new health care bill approved by Congress translate to denying treatment to sweet old men like the one featured in the video? Will somber-faced doctors be telling grandpa that he is too old for treatment? We had to check this out. First we contacted Fanelli, who said he posted the video on his website in late March. We asked if he could point us to any documentation -- such as a section of the bill, a position paper from an organization -- to support his conclusion about age limits. The simple answer: no. "You are asking for substantiation. I can't go to a page in the bill but what I can tell you is the country is over $13 trillion in debt. ... The medical program increases the number of recipients substantially. When you increase the number dramatically ... where is the money going to come from? It is obvious it's going to have to be only certain people are going to get certain coverages. ... The commercial is to show what is going on in other countries with socialized medicine. You can't add more services when you don't have enough money to pay the government bills currently, and that's what we've done." Fanelli said he has his own family experience to draw his conclusions. "My aunt lives in France and had been denied for a procedure," to get a pacemaker, he said. "The reason she was denied was because she was too old. Common sense tells me when you increase the number of people covered, and you don't have enough money to go around ... there's eventually going to come to point where we say what can we afford, what we can't afford." Ultimately his French aunt was able to get the procedure, according to Fanelli. Fanelli said the video "is a metaphor for what is used in England where they use age to determine what services people are going to get." Our friends at FactCheck.org researched a question about age limits and health care in England in July 2009. The article quoted a nonprofit in England, Age Concern and Help the Aged, that ageism does occur -- for example a doctor refusing to refer an elderly patient to a consultant. But the nonprofit also stated that a national organization was created to improve health care for the elderly and one of its standards was "rooting out age discrimination." Steve Ullmann, professor and director of Programs in Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said "there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in England," for certain treatments though "you can buy them out of pocket outside of the National Health Service." Back to health care in the United States. We asked specifically if Fanelli had found an age-limit in the health care bill. "I have tried to look at that bill and it's a masterful mess,'' said the 54-year-old retired airline captain and Navy reserves retiree. When we asked about whether Fanelli had read about an age cutoff in news articles, he replied: "I have been at lectures." He heard one from a brain surgeon. "I don't remember the name. I wasn't anticipating getting a phone interview on this." We contacted him again the next day to clarify if he had read any news articles about an age limit and he said: "There are various articles. I can't quote verse, page and date. ... We arrived at the claim because there is not enough money generated in tax revenue to pay for the current expenses for the U.S. government and this is going to be an additional expense." Among Fanelli's claimed sources is his wife's dermatologist, Dr. John Meisenheimer of Orlando. He said the doctor saved his wife's life when she had skin cancer. Meisenheimer also is the doctor starring in Fanelli's video. "Meisenheimer has discussed they are going to be picking and choosing," Fanelli said. "It is generally accepted by medical health professionals there will only be limited amount of money. Most people believe it will be younger people as opposed to older people." We called Meisenheimer, a board-certified dermatologist for more than 20 years, to get his explanation of the video. "The ad is a metaphor for ageism," Meisenheimer said. "This isn't about 'death panels.' Death panels do not exist." (PolitiFact agrees with Meisenheimer about death panels. That was a claim made by Sarah Palin in August 2009 that we rated Pants on Fire.) But the health care bill makes cuts to Medicare, he said, and that will lead to less care for the elderly. "It can be a very slippery slope. It's not going to happen like in the commercial,'' said Meisenheimer, whose office website states that he accepts Medicare patients. "Doctors will have to make a decision: where is the best use of money? Do I use it for a 95-year-old who has skin cancer or for somebody younger? ... There is not enough money there in the can for everybody." The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Medicare provisions are estimated to result in a net reduction of $428 billion between 2010 and 2019. It also states that the bill supports "comparative effectiveness research" to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatments, but that the findings "may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage." So that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, that can't be used to create an age limit for that treatment. We also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare. Spokesman Peter Ashkenaz told us in an e-mail that there are no age limits for treatment under Medicare. "There are no eligibility changes to Medicare in the new law," he wrote. Fanelli said his video hasn't aired on television, though it's on his campaign website and on YouTube. We sent links to Fanelli's video to experts on the health care bill: Ullmann at the University of Miami; Alwyn Cassil, director of public affairs for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization; and Len Nichols, Director for the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University. All three said there is nothing in the bill that would cut off treatment based on an age limit. The video "has no basis in reality whatsoever," Cassil said. "There is nothing in that bill that I am aware of, or certainly every reporter who has combed every inch of it that mentions anything about 'age limits.' '' So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays "Obamacare," but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene. He referred us to his wife's dermatologist -- who also happens to be the star of the commercial -- but the dermatologist did not produce any conclusive evidence, either. So the ad has lots of melodrama but no facts. We find the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Dan Fanelli	None	None	None	2010-06-07T15:39:23	2010-06-03	['None']

pomt-13085	The list of voters that North Carolina Republicans "tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/07/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-tried-purge-black-democrats/	While campaigning on Hillary Clinton’s behalf, President Barack Obama has told people not to take their right to vote for granted, "Don’t boo, vote!" At a Nov. 2 rally in North Carolina, Obama told the story of a 100-year-old woman from the town of Belhaven, N.C., whose voter registration status had been challenged by Republicans just a few weeks prior. The woman, Grace Bell Hardison, contested the challenge, and her county elections board upheld her status as a registered voter. "And you better believe she's going to vote," Obama said. "But this 100-year-old woman wasn't alone in being targeted. The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic. That didn’t happen by accident. It's happening in counties across the state. Now, there was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal, as well." Two days after Obama spoke, a federal judge ordered three North Carolina counties to restore voter registrations for about 4,000 individuals whose registration had been revoked within 90 days of the election. The NAACP brought the lawsuit. Still, we were curious about Obama’s claim that Republicans in North Carolina tried to purge a list of voters that was two-thirds black and Democratic. In his remarks, it was unclear if Obama was talking about the state as a whole or a smaller area. A spokesman told us that he was referring specifically to Belhaven, the town where Hardison lives. For the local area, Obama’s numbers are close to on target, according to figures we received from the Beaufort County Elections Board. Ricky Radcliffe, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Belhaven mayor in 2015, and three of his associates submitted 138 voter registration challenges to the election board. Radcliffe had sent out mailers for his campaign to Belhaven residents based on voter registration information, and 138 of the mailers returned as undeliverable, so he and his associates contested their registration status. Of these 138 people who had their voter registrations challenged, 80 were black Democrats. That’s about 58 percent — just shy of the two-thirds Obama said. It appears that black people were at least slightly overrepresented in this group; black people of all political parties make up about 66 percent all the Belhaven challenged voters. But the town of Belhaven overall is about 54 percent black. We don’t have city-level political party data for Belhaven, so we can’t know if Democrats were overrepresented, too. Obama used this case to support his claim that Republicans are stopping black Democrats from voting in counties "all around the state" of North Carolina. Of North Carolina’s 100 counties, just three were involved in the most recent legal proceedings over voter roll purges: Beaufort, which we already discussed, Moore and Cumberland. Moore County removed 374 voters from the rolls, and 14.4 percent were black Democrats. Black people of all parties made up about 18 percent of the removed voters and 14 percent of the Moore County population overall. Jay Delancy, director of the Voter Integrity Project, an anti-voter fraud advocacy group that brought the challenges in Moore County, told us that his group strips out race and party when it looks for potentially fraudulent voter registrations in order to avoid bias. We were unable to get data from Cumberland County in time for publication. We were, though, able to get data for North Carolina overall. The state elections board told us that there were 6,612 total voters removed from the rolls in 2016, though many were re-added due to the recent court order. A plurality of those removed, 25.7 percent, were black Democrats. For comparison, white Republicans accounted for 18.44 percent. Black people are overrepresented among those removed from the rolls in 2016, compared to the North Carolina voting population at large, and white voters are underrepresented. Race Voter roll challenges North Carolina voters Black 37.07 percent 22.23 percent White 50.69 percent 69.54 percent Other 12.24 percent 8.23 percent Obama’s remarks may give a listener the impression that Republicans have tried to remove a selection of voters that’s two-thirds black and Democratic statewide, and that’s not the case, based on the state’s data. It’s worth noting that a federal appeals court found in July that North Carolina’s strict voter identification law was designed to "target African-Americans with almost surgical precision," potentially making it harder for black people to vote. The court struck down the law. Our ruling Obama said, "The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic." Obama’s phrasing left the scope of his claim open for interpretation. One could think he was speaking of the state of North Carolina as a whole, in which case his claim would be incorrect, as about 25.7 percent of the statewide list of people removed from the voter registration rolls were black Democrats. But Obama’s staff told us he was talking specifically about just 138 challenges in the town of Belhaven, N.C. Of those challenges, 58 percent were black Democrats — just under two-thirds. Republicans did bring these challenges.

pomt-14946	Says "only about 2 percent" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/26/thomas-norment-jr/norment-says-only-2-percent-virginia-guns-sales-do/	Efforts to widen Virginia’s background checks on people seeking to buy firearms underwhelm state Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City. "We have a pretty comprehensive background check right now," Norment said during a recent debate with Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax. "Right now, statistics in the commonwealth of Virginia show that only about 2 percent of the guns that are being bought or sold are outside of that universal background check," Norment added. Gov. Terry McAuliffe wants a reluctant General Assembly to expand Virginia’s background check to all prospective gun buyers. His call came in the wake of the Aug. 26 fatal shootings near Smith Mountain Lake of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward. The law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct a computerized check to determine whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales and transfers between individuals are exempt. We wondered whether Norment was right in saying only 2 percent of Virginia sales fall into that exempt category. Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, told us Norment erred. "As best we can determine, there are no state-by-state statistics available for the source of a firearm used in a crime," Ryer wrote in an email. Ryer is correct. Neither the Virginia State Police nor the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center "has any way of tracking the volume of private sales in Virginia," said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. We also should note that there are no conclusive national statistics about the percentage of guns that are sold without a background check. Many gun control advocates - including McAuliffe and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. - have said it’s "estimated" that 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occur without background checks. But this claim is based on a small-sample survey of purchasers that’s almost 21 years old and counts some guns that were brought before a national background check law took effect. As we’ve reported, even the researchers of that study say they "don’t know" if their findings are relevant today. There’s been no updated national study. A final note: The killer of Parker and Ward bought his gun legally and passed a background check, according to law-enforcement officials. Our ruling Norment said "only about 2 percent" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks. A spokesman says Norment erred, and we agree. No one knows how many guns are sold privately in Virginia or nationwide these days. Statistics aren’t available. We rate Norment’s statement False.

pomt-07987	In Wisconsin, 98 percent of all small businesses will qualify for income-tax relief under my plan, freeing them to expand and create jobs.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-tax-cut-plan-w/	When newly elected Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, offered up a tax cut plan for small business, it was reasonable to expect the GOP-led Legislature to approve it with few changes. Turns out there are many practical obstacles to turning a campaign tax promise into reality. Republican lawmakers are considering significant changes to Walker’s proposal, with a key meeting set for Jan. 20, 2011. Some background: In the 2010 election, Walker promised a 1 percentage point income tax-rate cut for businesses with 50 employees or fewer. After he took office Jan. 3, 2011, he changed and trimmed the plan substantially, proposing a credit targeting businesses with less than $500,000 in gross receipts. Even that scaled-back idea carried an $80 million price tag over two years. In touting the change, here is what Walker said in a Jan. 5 news release: "This legislation will provide tax relief to thousands of business owners, freeing them to expand and create jobs," Walker’s office said. "98 percent of all small businesses will be eligible for tax relief under the Governor’s proposal." That’s a broad statement. Does virtually every small business in the state stand to benefit from tax relief? And is it enough to spur job growth, as Walker claims? To back the claim, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided us state tax-filing data showing that 98 percent of all Wisconsin businesses are under the $500,000 in gross receipts -- and therefore eligible to apply. That number is not in dispute, but let’s drill down. The information provided by Walker showed that in slightly more than half of tax returns, the businesses reported minimal gross sales -- somewhere between $1 and $10,000. For that group, there would be negligible tax savings -- based on Walker’s data, it would average just over $1. That’s barely enough for a candy bar, much less a salary for a new employee. Beyond that, there are two problems with the data provided. First, it calculated the tax credit based on an earlier, more generous version of Walker’s current proposal. And second, it doesn’t account for businesses that don’t make a profit. We couldn’t obtain similar data on Walker’s current proposal, but the state Department of Revenue provided another way to look at the expected size and reach of the 15 percent tax credit he proposed. The department gave us a chart that projects the average tax credit for personal income tax filers who reported some portion of their income from business. (Most small business owners use the personal-income tax system to report their business income.) The data showed the largest group, with nearly 40 percent of those filers, was under $50,000 in income. The average credit for that group: $37. That’s at the low end. The average credit tops out at $3,205 for a small group of high earners. They make up about 1 percent of those expected to qualify for the credit. The overall average for all the 252,000 filers who could qualify for the credit -- $145. More than two-thirds would get less than $100 on average. From both sets of statistics, it’s apparent that -- for the majority of those eligible -- the tax credit is enough to stock up on a limited supply of paper clips and printer paper, but not nearly enough to create a job. Right off the bat that takes some wind out of Walker’s claim that the credit would quickly spur needed job creation. The problems don’t stop there. Businesses that don’t turn a profit in 2011 would not get a credit -- unless they make money in a future year and take it then. Walker’s plan -- set up as an offsetting credit -- kicks in when taxes are owed. It was not set up as a refundable credit; that could have allowed businesses to get it regardless of whether they made a profit. So some percentage of small businesses may be eligible based on gross receipts but won’t qualify for a credit next year because they made no profit and therefore have no state tax liability. How many is that? State officials couldn’t say exactly. But the number is apparently substantial. Walker’s information listed 335,000 business tax returns that would meet his gross-receipts test, but revenue officials said a much smaller number -- 245,000 filers -- likely would qualify to get the tax credit. They attributed some of the difference to filers who didn’t profit enough to owe taxes. So the no-profit issue means those businesses won’t be getting a credit any time soon. Finally, in some cases the tax credit would go to self-employed business people who have no employees. Some critics question how job creation would result from giving them a small credit. Bill Smith, head of the state’s leading small-business membership group, likes Walker’s plan -- but not because it would propel hiring by those who get the credit. "I’m not suggesting you’re going to have all this wonderful job creation out there," said Smith, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. Smith said the public should view the tax credits as a kind of indirect economic stimulus, because that $37 credit or $100 credit (or whatever amount it is) will be spent at restaurants or hardware stores or at other Main Street businesses, helping those operations during tough times. Smith also said Walker’s tax plan, along with other measures like lawsuit limits, would boost the spirits of business owners who are pessimistic right now. Walker’s original small-business tax cut -- the one targeted at 50-employee firms or smaller -- would have included firms with $2 million or more in gross sales, Smith said. So it would have reached a much larger group than his current plan. Another small-business group leader, with the Independent Business Association of Wisconsin, said it’s possible that as few as 20 percent of the group’s members would fit under the $500,000 sales threshold. Bart Adams, an accountant and IBA board member, said the group is not taking a position on Walker’s proposal. Let’s return to the bottom line: Walker said 98 percent of small businesses "will be eligible" for job-creating tax relief under his emergency plan to jump-start the lagging Wisconsin economy. There are that many businesses under the $500,000 threshold -- but that’s just the beginning of the story. They may all be eligible to apply, but many won’t qualify for a tax credit of any significant size. And the number gets substantially reduced because unprofitable businesses won’t see a credit until they turn around. Even business advocates don’t contend it would help recipients create jobs, as Walker claims. We rate Walker’s claim False.

pomt-10529	"Obama's liberal fiscal agenda: Over $874-billion in new spending."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/29/republican-national-committee-republican/funny-math-doesnt-quite-add-up/	Nothing confirms a Democratic front-runner's status quite like being baptized a tax-and-spend liberal by the national Republican Party. The Republican National Committee did it to Sen. Hillary Clinton in November, unveiling a "Spend-O-Meter" to tally new spending associated with her policy proposals. PolitiFact found its calcucations to be Mostly True in terms of a projected cost of $777.6-billion, but way off with the inclusion of an $80-billion baby bond proposal that Clinton had decided against. Read our analysis here. Now, the RNC is going after Sen. Barack Obama, charging that Americans would have to finance more than $874-billion in new spending if the Illinois senator makes good on his promises over one term in the White House. As custodian of the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact has an affinity for graphic widgets. And, the Spend-O-Meter does a reasonably good job of accounting for Obama's spending proposals. See it for yourself. Problem is, it's not entirely honest and accurate. Two proposals the RNC cites — an economic stimulus package of tax rebates and business incentives, and a plan to help create a nuclear fuel bank to store enriched uranium — already have been enacted into law in the 110th Congress. What's more, some aspects of Obama's energy plan were covered in a 2007 energy law enacted in December. So even accounting for differences between Obama's plans and the new laws, most of the projected cost the RNC cites wouldn't really be "new" because significant spending in these areas is already underway. The Republican tally sheet also notably categorizes Obama's package of tax cuts and credits aimed at workers earning under $50,000 as new spending. That is an eyebrow-raiser, because the GOP assiduously avoided calling tax cuts spending when it rallied support for President Bush's tax plans. Republican front-runner Sen. John McCain also is avoiding the label when he talks about his proposed tax cuts, which would keep more than $5-trillion in potential revenues from reaching the Treasury over a decade. For good reason: Tax cuts technically aren't new spending. But because they reduce government collections, the cuts require corresponding spending cuts in order to be "budget neutral" and not increase the size of the deficit. Many of the dozen proposals and cost projections cited on the tally sheet come directly from Obama's campaign Web site. The RNC is right about five proposals that would be new spending: • A plan to spend about $18-billion a year on elementary education. • Expanding the AmeriCorps national service program at a cost of about $3.5-billion a year. • Doubling the size of a foreign assistance fund, from $25-billion to $50-billion, that's directed at meeting the United Nations' Millennium Development Goal of reducing global poverty. • Providing at least $2-billion in aid to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries. • Creating a $1.5-billion fund to help states implement paid-leave systems. Other RNC claims are dubious or make priority assumptions. For example, Obama has proposed creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that would invest $60-billion over a decade in highways, new technology and other projects. The Spend-O-Meter says this would mean $6-billion a year in new spending, and $24-billion during a four-year presidential term. But Obama has not specified how the money would be parceled out. The RNC also assumes Obama's proposal to expand health coverage to uninsured Americans — which Obama's campaign estimates would cost $50-billion to $65-billion a year when fully implemented — would cost the higher amount immediately when he takes office. The Spend-O-Meter also does not factor Obama's companion proposal to cover much of the cost by allowing Bush's tax cuts on dividends and capital gains and for individuals making more than $250,000 a year to expire in 2010. On energy, the RNC tally sheet counts the full $150-billion cost of Obama's plan to expand funding for biofuels and other forms of alternative energy, invest in clean coal technology and invest in a new, digital electricity grid over the next decade, even though the issues were addressed to one degree or another in last year's energy law. Tens of billions of dollars have been authorized in those areas, making it difficult to categorize Obama's entire plan "new spending." Obama's tax plan aimed at giving $85-billion a year in relief to middle-income Americans also is lumped into the new spending category, though the Spend-O-Meter correctly notes that the plan would also raise taxes on capital gains and dividends and eliminate the preferred tax treatment of "carried interest" — a key source of private equity and hedge fund profits that's taxed at the 15 percent capital gains rate instead of the 35 percent rate wealthy Americans pay on ordinary income. In other words, Obama is making the wealthy pay more in taxes, offsetting some of the breaks to their working-class and lower-income counterparts. So it's unfair to categorize all of the middle-income breaks as new spending. RNC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson said Obama's plan amounts to new spending because it calls for both tax cuts and increases, and because he hasn't detailed precisely how he would offset the cuts with reduced spending. The RNC also focuses on Obama's plan to provide $1-billion over five years for job training and career advancement, failing to acknowledge that the Bush administration is trying to consolidate several existing programs into a single grant program for which it has requested $2.8-billion in funding for fiscal 2009. Should the administration succeed, it's unclear whether Obama's plan would add new spending to this amount or divert money from those grants for a new effort. Two Obama initiatives cited in the Spend-O-Meter have been addressed in large part by new laws passed in Congress. Many of the goals of Obama's $75-billion economic stimulus package were addressed in the $124.5-billion, 10-year package President Bush signed in February 2008. The package includes business tax breaks, rebate checks for individuals and provisions raising federal mortgage loan limits. Obama could, of course, come back with more proposals, including ones dropped in congressional negotiations. But it's highly unlikely that a President Obama would need to press for a stimulus package as big as the one Congress just enacted unless the economy truly tanks. Congress also dealt with an Obama proposal to provide $50-million to help create a nuclear fuel bank administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency when it rolled the amount into the fiscal 2008 omnibus spending bill. The nonproliferation effort is intended to discourage countries from developing their own enrichment facilities. So putting it all together: If we subtract the $75-billion stimulus proposal and $50-million nuclear fuel initiative from the RNC's total of $874.4-billion and do not count tax cuts as new spending, the total spending associated with Obama's proposals would be about $459-billion. Because Republicans have correctly identified roughly half of the Obama spending proposals as new spending, we rate the Obama Spend-O-Meter Half True.

Sen. Hillary Clinton unveiled an attack ad for the Wisconsin primary in which a narrator chides Sen. Barack Obama for ducking debates. Two more debates are scheduled between the two candidates before March 4, 2008; Clinton wants more, though. "Maybe he'd prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions," sniffs an off-screen narrator. "Like why Hillary Clinton has the only health care plan that covers every American, and the only economic plan that freezes foreclosures." We'll confine ourselves to examining the health care claim here. Clinton is correct that her plan is the only one among the presidential candidates to require health care coverage for all Americans. John Edwards was another candidate pushing universal coverage, but with his exit from the race on Jan. 30, 2008, Clinton now stands alone. None of the Republicans promote universal health care. Barack Obama has said he wants affordable coverage for everyone, but his plan has no mandate to require coverage. At the most recent Democratic debate on Jan. 31, 2008, Obama said he opposed the mandate for logistical reasons. Enforcing a mandate will require some sort of penalty, such as fines, to ensure compliance, he said. "And that, I don't think, is helping those without health insurance," Obama said. Obama has said he wants to cover every American, but experts say it's unlikely he will without a mandate as part of his plan. Earlier in the campaign, Obama said his plan did provide universal coverage, but we found that claim Barely True; read our ruling here . Because Clinton does include a mandate in her plan, she is correct in saying that she is the only candidate for president with a plan that mandates health care for all Americans.

pomt-09561	Obama came into office "with a $1.3 trillion deficit before I had passed any law. ... We came in with $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/29/barack-obama/obama-inherited-deficits-bush-administration/	In a spirited and unscripted debate with the House GOP, President Barack Obama said Republicans were wrong to portray him as running up large deficits. Speaking at a retreat for House Republicans in Baltimore on Jan. 29, 2010, Obama was particularly critical of a question from Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. Hensarling asked Obama, "You are soon to submit a new budget, Mr. President. Will that new budget, like your old budget, triple the national debt and continue to take us down the path of increasing the cost of government to almost 25 percent of our economy?" "The fact of the matter is," Obama replied, "is that when we came into office, the deficit was $1.3 trillion -- $1.3 trillion. So when you say that suddenly I've got a monthly deficit that's higher than the annual deficit left by Republicans, that's factually just not true, and you know it's not true. And what is true is that we came in already with a $1.3 trillion deficit before I had passed any law. What is true is, we came in with $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade." We checked Hensarling's claim in a separate item. Here, we'll look at Obama's claim that he came into office with a $1.3 trillion deficit and $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade. On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the deficit for fiscal year 2009 was projected to be $1.2 trillion. The 10-year projection was estimated to be about $3.1 trillion. So Obama's number was very close on the 2009 deficit -- he said $1.3 trillion -- but substantially different from the 10-year projection -- he said $8 trillion. There are two reasons why he differs from the CBO. On the difference between the $1.2 trillion and the $1.3 trillion, the Obama administration credited a small portion of spending on its watch to policies of the previous administration. The reason for this is that the federal government runs on a fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, so Bush and Obama technically split responsibility for 2009 spending. The large difference on the 10-year projection has to do with Bush administration tax cuts. The CBO creates its estimates based on current law, which means the CBO assumes that the Bush tax cuts will end in 2010 and everyone will start paying higher taxes in 2011 and going forward. The Obama administration, on the other hand, assumed in its baseline that those tax cuts would be renewed. Economists we spoke with -- Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, and Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst of the conservative Heritage Foundation -- both said they believe the White House approach is more realistic because it assumes current policy will continue. So the CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. It does highlight, however, that when it comes to budget projections, people can have differences of opinion about what to include. In any budget projection there is room for interpretation, but it seems reasonable to assume for a baseline that the Bush tax cuts will continue. Obama's numbers are fairly solid, so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-29T18:25:42	2010-01-29	['None']

pomt-06183	"You look at defense … we're spending more than the rest of the world combined."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/13/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-spends-more-all-othre-countri/	Throughout the campaign, Republican presidential candidates have targeted Medicare, Medicaid and other federal entitlement programs for future budget cuts. But, this week, one candidate set his sites on the United States’ defense budget, which he said should be on the table, as well. "If you look at defense … we're spending more than the rest of the world combined," former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said Monday, December 12, 2011 in a debate with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. "If you can’t find some efficiencies there …" That the United States spends more on military than any other country in the world is not up for debate, analysts we contacted agreed. The United States, which guarantees the security of the 28 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, among other allies, spends at least six times more than the next largest spender, analysts said. But do we, as Huntsman suggested, spend more than the rest of the world combined? PolitiFact is on the case. Tracking military spending across the globe is always a challenge, according to industry analysts. Exchange rates and purchasing power, among other factors, can make it difficult to equate translate spending across borders, and many countries, including China, Russia and North Korea, don’t openly report their military budgets. Nevertheless, a number of military analysts and international agencies have attempted to crunch the numbers, and most find Huntsman’s claim in doubt, concluding that the United States makes up closer to 40 or 45 percent of the world’s total military spending instead of the 50 percent plus suggested by Huntsman. In London, for instance, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an international think tank considered among the world’s military spending authorities, summarizes the military budget of countries across the globe in its annual report, "The Military Balance." The report does not, however, compare the United States’ budget to the world totals. Instead, Michael O’Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. took up that task while researching his recent book, "The Wounded Giant: America's Armed Forces in an Age of Austerity." O’Hanlon’s calculations, based on the IISP data, show that, although the United States led the world in military spending in 2009, it did not exceed the total spending of the rest of the world. According to O’Hanlon’s count, the U.S.’s $660 billion made up about 45 percent of the world total of $1.46 trillion. These numbers include both the federal defense budget, as well as war-time spending. "It's close to right, but it's not quite right," O’Hanlon said Tuesday, referring to Huntsman’s claim. "He’s close enough to be arguable … but I find it a little sloppy." The United States’ share of world military spending would be even lower, O’Hanlon said, if analysts increased their estimates for countries, like China, that don’t report military spending. "There are disagreements about what countries like China actually spend because they don't exactly have an open and transparent budgeting process," said Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent think tank on defense and related spending. "It really is more of a guesstimate for China and Russia," Harrison said. The IISS conservatively estimated about $70 billion in Chinese military spending in 2009. But, if it were to increase the estimate as high as $150 billion, as do many analysts, that would raise the total world figure and lower the United States’ share as low as 40 or 42 percent, analysts said. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, considered along with IISS among the world’s military spending authorities, estimated that China spent $119 billion on defense in 2010, the second most in the world. Using that number, total world spending reached $1.63 trillion and America’s $698 billion spending total made up about 42 percent of the world total, according to the Institute’s 2010 background paper on military expenditure data. "It’s hard to tell because the numbers don’t translate exactly, but (United States spending is) more in the range of 40 or 45 percent," said Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. "Fifty percent is definitely a little high," Korb said. Our ruling: The evidence supports Huntsman's underlying point -- that the U.S. spends far more than other countries on defense, but it falls short of his claim that U.S. spending exceeds that of all other countries combined. International research shows that United States’ defense funds make up between 40 and 45 percent of the world’s total military spending. We rate Huntsman’s claim Mostly False.

But it didn’t take more than a few hours for the general election to start. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., appeared on West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval’s show, the morning after election night. In the general election, Manchin faces Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in what most observers see as a competitive race. Manchin portrayed himself as a fiscal conservative both as governor and in the Senate in his interview with Kercheval. He expressed concern about the rising federal debt, which exceeds $21 trillion in the broadest measurement. "By 2022, just the interest payment on our debt will be greater than the defense of our country," Manchin said. Is Manchin right? We found that he’s at least certainly close. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective, factual reporting on issues that matter. Donate now to our Spring Campaign and go on the record as saying facts matter! In 2017, the last year for which complete data is available, defense spending stood at $590 billion. Net interest on the debt stood at $263 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress. So defense spending is currently more than twice as big as net interest. However, net interest is expected to grow faster than defense spending over the next decade. That’s according to CBO’s most recent Budget and Economic Outlook report, which projects a variety of budget categories 10 years into the future. (See Fig. 2.1 here.) Between 2018 and 2028, CBO projects, both defense and interest will rise, with interest overtaking defense spending in fiscal year 2023. In 2023, defense spending will be $679 billion and net interest will reach $702 billion. The gap will only grow from there. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So CBO has it one year later than Manchin said. That said, things could change between now and then — and CBO’s assumptions are not the only way to make these projections. CBO’s projections assume that defense spending will return to tighter levels in 2020, after the current spending bill expires, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, Congress has regularly raised the spending limits since they were first imposed in 2011. And if Congress acts as it has in the past, that would change the calculations. However, CBO does not specify the amounts under this alternative assumption, so that scenario is too speculative to consider. Our ruling Manchin said, "By 2022, just the interest payment on our debt will be greater than the defense of our country." The closest official estimate we could find says that net interest will pass defense spending in 2023, or one year later than Manchin said.

pomt-06302	"41 cents out of every dollar (the U.S. spends) is borrowed from places like China."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/16/public-notice/drug-addict-tv-ad-says-us-borrows-41-cents-dollar/	Imagine America as a sweaty, scruffy, cigarette-smoking dude -- with a drug problem. That vision comes to life in a new political ad: "America could learn a lot from a drug addict," says Addicted Dude. "Even though this country’s $14 trillion in debt, Washington raised the debt ceiling 10 times in the last 10 years. Each time – it’s like another hit – another spending hit. But you’re the junkies. "41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China. So China is like your dealer, and your addiction and your dealer control your life. To borrow less, you need to spend less. Yeah … Washington could learn a lot from a drug addict." The ad was paid for by the Public Notice Research & Education Fund, a sister organization to Public Notice. In a press release, Public Notice said it was airing the ads in hopes that the "super committee" in Congress working on a new budget would adopt more spending cuts. Public Notice says its mission is "to increase the public’s awareness and understanding of the economic issues that affect their daily lives, communities, and children and grandchildren." That sounded rather generic to us, and we wanted to know more about Public Notice. However, as a 501(c)(4), Public Notice is not required to disclose its donors. Public Notice’s executive director, Gretchen Hamel, is a former spokesman for the House Republican Conference. We decided to fact-check the ad’s claim that "41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China." To check this item, we turned to two government agencies that monitor the economy. We consulted the most recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see if 41 cents of every dollar is borrowed. The numbers show that for fiscal year 2011 (which ended Sept. 30, 2011), the federal government took in $2.3 trillion and spent $3.6 trillion. So the shortfall between receipts and outlays was about $1.3 trillion. That means about 36 cents of every dollar spent was borrowed. That’s pretty close to the 41 percent the ad cited. When we contacted Public Notice, they told us they took their numbers from an earlier report published in June 2011 that included numbers for fiscal year 2010. The numbers we used were for fiscal year 2011 and published Nov. 7, 2011. Next, for the sake of thoroughness, we checked how much U.S. debt is held by China. China is the number one foreign country holding U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. China holds $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt, followed by Japan with $957 billion; the United Kingdom with $422 billion; and a group of oil-exporting countries that collectively hold $230 billion. (See the entire list.) So is Addicted Dude a good analogy for our budget situation? If China is our drug dealer, China’s offering us the good stuff at an extremely low mark-up -- interest rates on U.S. Treasuries are near rock-bottom right now. On the other hand ... that’s how they get you hooked. So we’ll leave it up to you to decide whether the metaphor is apt. The ad from Public Notice says, "41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China." China is indeed the country that holds the most U.S. debt. But the most recent numbers on U.S. debt put the borrowed amount slightly lower, at 36 cents on the dollar. So we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-10360	Says Obama opposes lower gas taxes, nuclear power, new offshore drilling and doesn't have "new solutions" to the energy crisis.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/07/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-ad-right-on-drilling-and-taxes-wrong-on-other-/	A new TV ad from the Republican National Committee picks up where the McCain campaign's James Bond ad left off, portraying Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of lower gas prices and new sources of energy. The ad begins with a honeycomb of scenes: traffic, gas prices, the sun. Sen. John McCain is shown against a green forest as the honeycomb fills with pictures of solar energy cells, a windmill, a nuclear cooling tower. "Record gas prices. A climate in crisis," the announcer says. "John McCain says solve it now with a balanced plan: Alternative energy, conservation, suspending the gas tax, and more production here at home. He's pushing his own party to face climate change." When Obama appears, the announcer says, "But Barack Obama? For conservation, but he just says no to lower gas taxes, no to nuclear, no to more production. No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line." The screen says, "No Lower Gas Taxes . . . No Nuclear Power . . . No New Offshore Production . . . No New Solutions." When we examined the McCain campaign's James Bond-inspired ad about a week ago, we found it was right about Obama's stance on gas taxes and offshore drilling but was Pants on Fire wrong about his positions on nuclear power, electric cars and innovation. The topics in the RNC ad will be new to viewers who haven't seen the 007 Web ad, so here's how they claims rate: • The RNC ad is right on gas taxes. Obama opposes the McCain proposal for a summertime suspension of the federal gas tax. Obama has said he doubts the benefit would be passed to consumers and, even if it were, they would get only 30 cents a day. • The ad wrongly says Obama opposes nuclear power. In fact, turn to page 4 in Obama's energy plan and you'll find he supports "Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy," although he emphasizes the importance of securing nuclear fuel and finding safe places to store nuclear waste. • The ad is correct that Obama opposes expanding the offshore production of oil. • It is wrong to say Obama offers "no new solutions." Obama's 11-page energy program is filled with proposals such as incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and expanded research for biofuels, and solar and wind power. So let's check the score for the RNC: two right, two wrong. Overall, that sounds to us like the ad is Half True.

pomt-13516	"The Dallas Cowboys can’t put a sticker on their helmets for the 5 police officers who were killed."	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/01/james-woods/james-woods-says-dallas-cowboys-cant-honor-dead-of/	After San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick didn’t stand during the playing of the national anthem before a game, actor James Woods chided the NFL over a decal that hasn’t been approved for Dallas Cowboys helmets. On Aug. 27, 2016, Woods tweeted: "Kaepernick doesn’t stand for the national anthem, Rams players can walk onto the field with their hands up for the ‘hands up, don’t shoot,’ and other players can wear t-shirts saying I can’t breathe. But the Dallas Cowboys can’t put a sticker on their helmets for the 5 police officers who were killed. Way to go NFL…." We wondered if the actor stuck to the facts. Woods posted his tweet after Kaepernick didn’t join others standing during the anthem before his team’s Aug. 26, 2016, preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. Afterward, Kaepernick said: "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder." Woods otherwise referred to five Rams players raising their arms in support of protests in Ferguson, Mo., during player introductions before a Nov. 30, 2014, game. The NFL didn’t discipline the players; spokesman Brian McCarthy told CNN: "We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation." And the decal? After the July 7, 2016, shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers, the Dallas Morning News reported, Cowboys officials led by tight end Jason Witten honored surviving family members at the Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, Calif., in part with players entering the field arm in arm with officers. The newspaper said in a July 30, 2016, news story: "The idea to come out arm-in-arm belonged to Witten. So did the idea to wear a patch on their helmets in this camp that reads Arm in Arm. The Cowboys have asked the NFL if they can wear that patch on their helmets this season. Discussions are ongoing." Eleven days later, Stephen Jones, the team’s executive vice president, told reporters that NFL officials had told the Cowboys that players couldn’t wear the Arm in Arm decal during preseason or regular-season games--though the decals could remain on helmets during training camp practices, according to an Aug. 11, 2016, News story, which said the Cowboys had placed the decal on the back of each helmet after the ceremony initiated by Witten. Jones said then: "Everyone has to be uniform with the league and the other 31 teams. We respect their decision." We spotted Section 4, Article 1 of the league rules stating: "All visible items worn on game day by players must be issued by the club or the League, or, if from outside sources, must have approval in advance by the League office." More directly, Section 8 of the rules states that on game days, items "to celebrate anniversaries or memorable events, or to honor or commemorate individuals, such as helmet decals, and arm bands and jersey patches on players’ uniforms, are prohibited unless approved in advance by the League office." (The rules also bar any "detachable kicking toe." Now you know.) And what is allowed? "All such items approved by the League office, if any, must relate to team or League events or personages," the rule says. "The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns. Further, any such approved items must be modest in size, tasteful, non-commercial, and non-controversial; must not be worn for more than one football season; and if approved for use by a specific team, must not be worn by players on other teams in the League." We asked Rich Dalrymple, a Cowboys spokesman, about Woods’ tweet. He didn’t speak to its accuracy other than to share news stories on the decal’s debut and the league decision not to allow the decals to be worn during games. Dalrymple said the request and denial occurred by telephone. Before our clock ran out, our attempts to query the NFL about the decals and Woods’ tweet didn’t draw a whistle--or any response. Our ruling In a tweet, Woods said the "Dallas Cowboys can’t put a sticker on their helmets for the 5 police officers who were killed." NFL rules give the league control over decals on helmets which must relate to team or league "events or personages." This limit likely explains the league’s disapproval of the decals honoring the felled officers. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-05264	"The Republican from Georgia [U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston], he hasn’t even been to a NASCAR race."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/30/dale-earnhardt-jr/dale-earnhardt-jr-accuses-congressman-never-attend/	A proposal from U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah poses a conundrum that may be as tough for some as choosing between God, America and apple pie. Fiscal conservatism or NASCAR? Kingston recently backed a successful amendment to a defense bill that would block the military from spending millions of federal dollars on sponsorships for pro sports teams. He thinks the money should support service members instead. If the defense bill passes as amended, it would end the U.S. National Guard’s sponsorship of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. Earnhardt resorted to fightin’ words. The day after the amendment passed, he told reporters that Kingston needed to do his "homework" on how sponsorships attract military recruits. "The Republican from Georgia, he hasn’t even been to a NASCAR race," Earnhardt told reporters May 18 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, according to an article in The Sporting News. Other news outlets posted similar accounts of his statement. That’s almost as bad as calling Kingston a "Yankee." Could this be true? The effort to end military sponsorships of professional sports is a bipartisan affair. Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota offered the amendment, which passed May 17, alongside Kingston. According to Kingston’s office, the Defense Department plans to spend as much as $80.3 million on this type of recruitment advertising this fiscal year. Other NASCAR drivers are on the military payroll. The U.S. Army backs Ryan Newman. The Air Force sponsors Aric Almirola. To Earnhardt, these partnerships are a no-brainer. Kingston is out of line. Watching NASCAR is as essential to being a Republican politician from the South as going to church or kissing babies. A reporter at Charlotte Motor Speedway asked Earnhardt whether he would invite Kingston to a NASCAR race. "Yes, because he’s a Republican from Georgia," Earnhardt said, according to The Sporting News article. "He ought to have seen a NASCAR race by now." We called Kingston’s offices repeatedly for more than a week but received no response. Earnhardt’s office didn’t return our calls either. We therefore searched far and wide for evidence that Kingston had attended a NASCAR race. Maybe we’d find a photograph of the gentleman from Georgia shaking hands with Jeff Gordon or watching the Daytona 500 from the infield, perched on a folding chair atop an RV. Instead, we found him at just about everything but NASCAR. We spotted Kingston on HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher" last year, being berated by the liberal comedian for being a creationist. One year before that, Kingston rubbed elbows with President Barack Obama in Air Force One as they flew from Savannah to Washington. And three years ago he appeared on the set of the Miley Cyrus movie "The Last Song." He was an extra for the film, which featured scenes on Tybee Island. To our surprise, we also found three news accounts that said Earnhardt was right. The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, said in a May 18 article that Kingston’s office confirmed that he has never attended a NASCAR race. A May 17 article in USA Today said Kingston himself acknowledged it. A May 22 story in the Savannah Morning News says that Kingston’s never been to a race, but he did display an Earnhardt license plate on the front of his pickup for five years. It’s strange but true. Kingston has never been to a NASCAR race. Earnhardt earns a True.

pomt-06251	Says U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson "voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/nov/30/sean-hannity/foxs-sean-hannity-says-sen-nelson-voted-dems-nearl/	Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack announced his U.S. Senate bid in a Nov. 28, 2011, interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. Mack -- with some help from Hannity -- tried to sell the message that the incumbent, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, moves in lockstep with President Barack Obama. "I am going to run for the United States Senate because frankly, I think the people of Florida have had enough," Mack said. "They've had enough of every time they turn around, Sen. Nelson is supporting and helping Barack Obama with Barack Obama's agenda of more government whether it's helping him with Obamacare. You know, Sen. Nelson was there right by Obama's side. Whether it was the stimulus, again, Sen. Nelson was right by Obama's side to make sure that was passed. Whether it was trillions of dollars in more spending, more tax increases, you name it on down the line. Sen. Nelson has been one of Barack Obama's go-to guys in the Senate." This web ad, paid for by Friends of Connie Mack at lockstepliberals.com, shows Obama and Nelson embracing. And Hannity suggested that Nelson, first elected in 2000, is also in lockstep with his party: "Well, the other thing is he's voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time. I was looking up his record," Hannity said. "He praised Obama during the last election. Now he doesn't want to be seen with Obama, which is pretty interesting. And I think the thing that has resonated nationally ..." Here, we decided to check Hannity, since he offered the most precise measure of Nelson's partisan leanings -- that he "voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time." We couldn't reach Hannity and during the interview he didn't specify any timeline for Nelson's votes, so we focused on the most recent vote analyses from a few different organizations that compare Nelson's voting record with the rest of the Senate. OpenCongress. Created by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, OpenCongress measures how often senators vote with their party, factoring in every single vote since the beginning of the current 112th session of Congress. According to OpenCongress, Nelson voted with his party on 190 out of 209 votes, a percentage of 90.9 percent. While seemingly high, that voting record actually put him near the bottom of Democrats in the U.S. Senate -- ranking 39th out of 51. Why? Because the percentage itself is a poor indicator of partisanship, OpenCongress itself says. "Since the vast majority of the hundreds of votes factored in are routine in nature, the result is that even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score on voting with their party," the website says in a disclaimer. Relatively, then, Nelson ranks among more moderate Democrats. U.S. Congress Votes Washington Post database. The Washington Post analysis measured 208 votes in the 112th Congress, finding that Nelson voted with his party 94 percent of the time. The database shows about 39 senators, Republicans and Democrats, voted with their party more often than Nelson (there are a lot of ties included). National Journal ranking. The National Journal measures votes differently, only examining votes taken on key economic, social and foreign policy issues. The publication then assigns members a composite score and commensurate ranking. In 2010, Nelson ranked as the 42nd most liberal and 53rd most conservative senator, according to the Journal. The Journal placed Nelson in the "centrists" category. CQ Vote Studies. Congressional Quarterly's analysis assigns members a score based on "party unity" -- or the frequency that someone votes with their party on occasions when a majority of Republicans oppose a majority of Democrats. If both parties supported a piece of legislation it wasn't included in the analysis -- in 2010, CQ analyzed 299 votes in the Senate. Nelson received an 89 percent in 2010. (To view historical data requires a subscription but CQ emailed us a chart showing Nelson's scores for a decade which ranged from 76 to 93 percent in the past decade. CQ told us that Nelson's score is 90 percent so far in 2011 as of 3 p.m. Nov. 29, 2011.) Our ruling Hannity said that Nelson "voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time." The Washington Post database shows Nelson voted with his party 94 percent of the time for the current session -- and OpenCongress shows a slightly lower figure at 90.9 percent with CQ not far behind at 89 percent. But simply reporting the figure doesn't provide context. Even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score when it comes to voting with their party, in large part because most votes are routine in nature. A more useful measure might be comparing the relative position of one senator to another, or comparing the position of all senators en masse. That comparison shows that Nelson is much more of a moderate than Hannity's figure suggests. Nelson is the 42nd most liberal senator out of 100, according to the National Journal, while OpenCongress says there are 38 more reliable Democratic votes. That's why we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08309	Patrick Rose "voted to explore a state income tax."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/oct/30/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-patrick-rose-voted-explore-state-/	On two fronts, it's suddenly income-tax season. The other day, Green Party gubernatorial candidate Deb Shafto called for creation of a state income tax in a televised Austin debate with Democrat Bill White and Libertarian Kathie Glass. And channel flippers that night might have spotted a TV ad by GOP Texas House hopeful Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs in which the narrator says incumbent Democrat Patrick Rose of San Marcos "voted to explore a state income tax." Isaac referred to his claim again in a TV faceoff with Rose aired live Oct. 20 by Austin's Fox News, saying: "I will not work towards investigating an income tax." Rose shot back: "My opponent is lying about a state income tax." Their exchange reflects a sensitive political reality. Most Texas elected officials are loathe to even mention a state income tax. They've seen the idea crash and burn. Nearly 20 years ago, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock advocated an income tax, then quickly backed down before championing a proposed constitutional amendment -- which passed -- that requires statewide voter approval of an "i" tax before it could ever happen. Texas is among seven states that don't levy an individual income tax, according to the nonpartisan Washington-based Tax Foundation. Foundation spokesman William Ahern told us that the other 43 states require residents to report their income on a form similar to the federal 1040 and pay a certain amount on the income the state considers taxable. So how is it that Rose voted to explore that option? Corbin Casteel, Isaac's consultant, pointed us to Rose's 2009 vote for a measure ordering a study of "circuit breaker" property tax programs. The term "circuit breaker" refers to the programs' intent, which is to keep households from being overloaded with property taxes. The 2009 bill was later vetoed by GOP Gov. Rick Perry. Casteel pointed out that Perry said in his veto message that the circuit-breaker tax could function like a progressive income tax. Progressive tax rates result in higher earners paying higher taxes compared to their lower-earning counterparts. Before weighing Perry's analysis, we first confirmed that Rose voted for the cited legislation, House Bill 3983. Next, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, the bill author, told us that Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, added the section mandating the study. The Senate Journal says Watson's amendment was adopted by the Senate in a May 22, 2009, voice vote. (Watson's proposal previously had been attached to a bill by GOP Sen. Tommy Williams of The Woodlands, the Journal says, but that measure died.) Watson's amendment would have directed the comptroller to examine "circuit breaker" programs as a "means of expanding and protecting the homestead interests of low-income and moderate-income families." It says that the study should cover potential effects of various provisions, including "limiting which taxing units are involved; basing eligibility on a maximum annual income level; limiting the dollar amount of the benefit that a property owner could receive in the program; and basing eligibility on a minimum ratio of residence homestead ad valorem taxes imposed to annual income, including a progressive scale of minimum ratios based on annual income." There's no mention of an income tax in the proposal. Next, we turned to Perry's June 2009 veto message, which says circuit-breaker "programs are designed to provide property tax relief to certain individuals based upon their income." If "such a program were to be adopted in Texas," the message says, "it would make the distribution of the property tax burden less equitable by shifting it to middle-class property owners. This would make the property tax function more like a progressive income tax in that the tax burden would slowly be pushed upwards until only the owners of the most valuable property paid any actual tax." As of 2008, 33 states had such programs, according to a 2009 report by the non-partisan Massachusetts-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, which says on its website that it looks at issues involving the use, regulation, and taxation of land. It shows Texas and Florida as the only states with neither an income tax nor a circuit breaker on its property taxes. We asked the institute's Adam Langley, who helped research the report, to compare circuit-breaker programs to state personal income taxes. "An income tax and circuit breaker are very different things," Langley said. "An income tax is imposed on your income. A circuit breaker is not imposed on your income. It's based on your property taxes. But the degree of property tax relief you get is related to your income. Its effects are in some ways simliar to a progressive income tax. But you don't need to collect income taxes from everyone in a state to get a circuit-breaker program up and running." Ahern of the tax foundation said it doesn't make sense to term a circuit-breaker tax an income tax. "It's income-dependent tax relief," Ahern said. "That does not translate into income tax." Casteel stood by his candidate's statement, saying in an e-mail that the study that Rose voted to support was "to explore basing property taxes on income. A tax based on income is an income tax. Can't get any plainer than that." Our take: Isaac would have had a legitimate point if he'd limited himself to saying Rose voted to study a property tax mechanism that's related to income. But his statement grossly overstates things. Indeed, we'd suggest, if Watson's proposal had even been judged the back door to an income tax, it would never have drawn legislative backing.

pomt-02681	"Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/07/gene-sperling/there-are-3-unemployed-people-every-job-opening-ob/	About 1.3 million Americans rang in 2014 with a loss of long-term unemployment benefits, due to Congress’ failure to renew the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program before its Dec. 28 expiration. Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama and director of the National Economic Council, is pushing Congress to extend the benefits. The Senate passed a key procedural hurdle Tuesday, but the House is not considered likely to follow suit. To receive the benefits, the law requires that people actively look for jobs. On CNN’s State of the Union, Candy Crowley suggested that some people may be able to game the system. Sperling pushed back against that idea, emphasizing that a large majority of the unemployed are honestly trying to find jobs in a tough economy. "Most of the people are desperately looking for jobs," he said. "You know, our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)." We thought we’d check whether Sperling’s ratio of people to job openings is on target. To check the 3-to-1 ratio, we needed to know two things: the number of available jobs and the number of unemployed Americans. A White House spokesman referred us to a couple of Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. There were 3.925 million job openings in October, according to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from Dec. 10. For an apples-to-apples comparison, we’ll use October unemployment numbers the BLS released in their Nov. 8 report, even though they’ve since published November data. They said 11.3 million people were unemployed. That just counts people who are actively looking for work, not those who have stopped looking due to discouragement or retirement. That’s a ratio of 2.88-to-1 or, once you round off, roughly 3-to-1, just as Sperling said. We should note a few caveats, though. Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economics professor, pointed out that Sperling’s ratio isn’t perfect. "The numbers that Sperling reported are about correct, but there is actually a lot more competition for jobs than that because many employed people are also applying for the same jobs that the unemployed are applying for," she said. On the other hand, it’s worth noting that Sperling’s claim implies that for each job opening, there are three qualified applicants employers can choose from, but that’s a generous assumption. "So it is possible for there to be a relatively high number of applicants for a job but employers may still feel like it is hard to hire because the people applying don't have the skills they are looking for," Sinclair said. "Or people may not apply to the jobs that are out there because they are not a good fit for any number of reasons." James Sherk, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Sperling’s statistic is good for comparing change over time. For example, Sherk said, the economy is worse now than it was in 2006, though the ratio has been improving steadily as of late. Also worth noting is that many employers fill vacancies without publicizing them. According to one report, employers with no recorded vacancies at the end of a month account for 42 percent of hires in the next month. That means the number of job openings the BLS survey records will always understate the actual number of openings. Our ruling Sperling said that in today’s economy, there are three people looking for work per job available. We crunched BLS numbers and got the same ratio, as did economists. The BLS data has shortcomings, some that would make the ratio higher and some that would make it lower. It also might not accurately reflect what the climate looks like from the perspective of employers or job seekers. Still, these are minor quibbles. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06096	Says "kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/05/chris-christie/chris-christie-repeats-misleading-statistic-newark/	Gov. Chris Christie pushes his plans to reform New Jersey public schools using student performance in urban school districts as one of his statistical battering rams, but consistently misrepresents the high school graduation rate of the state’s largest district. Christie claims fewer than 25 percent of freshmen in Newark high schools graduate in four years. PolitiFact New Jersey debunked similar statements twice -- first in June, then again in November. But the governor hasn’t learned his lesson and keeps repeating the statistic. On Nov. 18, the day after we published a story criticizing Christie for his use of the statistic, the governor delivered the keynote address at a Notre Dame education forum. He said there: "How hard is it to understand failure, when in Newark, the children this year, two months ago, who entered the ninth grade, 23 percent will graduate in four years with a high school diploma." More recently, in a Dec. 29 radio interview on WOR-AM, host John Gambling asked Christie what his biggest disappointment was in 2011. "The biggest disappointment is that we didn't get any education reform this year, and we really need to. Now, members of the Legislature are telling me that we're going to get to it in the first quarter of 2012. So I live in hope, John," Christie said. "But my biggest disappointment is, when you know that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years, 23 percent." He said to Gambling later in the interview, after also citing per-pupil spending costs in Newark: "that's why education reform is so necessary and that's the biggest disappointment from 2011 is that we didn't get it done." Actually, more than half of Newark’s ninth grade students will graduate from high school in four years, because there’s more than one way recognized by the state Department of Education to earn a high school diploma. But Christie cites the lower number, which represents a segment of the city’s high school graduates. Both graduation rates are included in a presentation based on a study by a private consulting firm that had ties to Christopher Cerf before he was named New Jersey’s acting education commissioner. The smaller percentage -- 22 percent, not 23 percent, according to the presentation -- only includes students who graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment, a state standardized test. But there are other routes to graduation. Students can take an alternate exam, now called the Alternative High School Assessment, to finish high school and some students are exempt from testing. In all, 55 percent of students graduate from Newark’s high schools in four years, according to data from the 2009-2010 school year. Though there is debate about the merits of the alternate exam, it is still a state-approved way to graduate from high school. And when Christie cites a graduation rate without explaining who it represents, he ignores a group of the students he argues it’s imperative to help. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Christie said "that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years." The claim has been debunked twice but Christie continues to repeat the erroneous statistic. About 55 percent of Newark freshmen graduate in four years, not 23 percent. Consistently repeating a proven falsehood isn’t just wrong, governor, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03754	Paul Ryan’s budget "keeps the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/08/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-house-budget-ends-obamacare-keeps/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently offered a scornful analysis of the federal budget proposal approved by the House of Representatives. In a March 25 radio interview, Scott directed much of his criticism at the author of the plan, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. "He keeps all of the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits," Scott said. We wondered whether Scott’s charge is accurate. First, a little background. Ryan is the House Budget Committee chairman and has long called for lower tax rates and reduced federal spending. Scott, a member of the panel, disagrees with the GOP’s approach. He supported an unsuccessful budget proposal by the Congressional Black Caucus last month that would have raised $2.7 trillion in new revenues over the next 10 years. Republicans muscled Ryan’s spending plan through the House on March 21. It would balance the budget in 10 years by substantially shrinking the government, privatizing Medicare and simplifying the tax code. Ryan’s budget, which also would end Obamacare, passed without a single supportive Democratic. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, passed a competing budget plan on March 23 that would raise taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years and leave Obamacare intact. No Republicans voted for the measure. Neither of the plans is likely to be enacted. Instead, they will serve as opening bargaining positions for the House and Senate as they enter budget negotiations. The budgets are based on 10-year revenue projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is required to make its estimates on the assumption that current tax laws will remain intact, including revenues that would generated by Obamacare, which was approved in 2010. So Scott is correct that Ryan, in writing the House budget, calls for the end of Obamacare but relies on revenue estimates that include Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act takes many steps to raise revenues. The biggest ones are cutting in half the maximum amount of money employees can put in nontaxable health savings accounts, penalizing companies with more than 50 employees that don’t provide health insurance and imposing an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans. If Obamacare is repealed, the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation have estimated that revenues would decrease by $1 trillion over 10 years. Now, here’s where things get fuzzy. Ryan and other House GOP leaders say they want to eliminate the Obamacare taxes. Their budget also calls for a revenue-neutral overhaul of the tax system. They want to reduce the number of individual tax brackets and cut top tax rates. They say they would pay for all these reductions by eliminating the alternative minimum tax and getting rid of many loopholes and deductions. But the Ryan budget does not name even one loophole or deduction it would axe to pay for reducing rates and make up for $1 trillion in lost Obamacare revenue. That work would be left to the House Ways and Means Committee. Cutting tax breaks would be a sensitive job. The largest breaks to individuals are not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their health care plans and pensions, and the mortgage interest deduction. Ryan has had some criticism from the right -- including the Heritage Foundation and Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga. -- for keeping the $1 trillion that equates to Obamacare taxes in his budget. "These tax hikes are the oxygen that fuels the fire of ever bigger spending," the Heritage Foundation wrote. Our ruling Scott said the House budget "keeps the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits." There’s no doubt the GOP plan would eliminate the Affordable Care Act. But the tax part of Scott’s claim has a bit of complexity. The House budget is based on revenue projections that assume Obamacare taxes will continue. What Scott didn’t say is that the plan calls for replacing the Obamacare levies with revenues that would come from reducing income tax breaks. We can’t entirely fault Scott for the omission, however, because the House budget doesn’t identify any tax breaks that would be pared -- it merely assigns that crucial work to a committee. So Scott’s statement is accurate, but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2013-04-08T06:00:00	2013-03-25	['Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

pomt-12469	Under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/headlines-say-gop-bill-makes-sexual-assault-pre-ex/	Some blogs this week circulated a bombastic claim about the House Republican health care plan: that it would make sexual assault a pre-existing condition that might result in denied coverage. "Under Trumpcare plan, rape would be considered a pre-existing condition," said the Resistance Report May 3. "In Trump’s America, rape is a pre-existing condition," read a headline by the Cut, a New York Magazine blog. We found similar headlines on Bustle and the Intellectualist, as well as in some viral tweets. We should say right off the bat that the Cut has since changed its headline and issued a correction, as did Mic. The updated headlines say sexual assault "could" be a pre-existing condition, which is more accurate because it is not so definitive. Here’s what’s wrong about the viral narrative. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections. These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault. But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says. They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically. But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems. Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage. These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist. None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify "sexual assault" or "rape" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions. For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market. If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance. "This is not something specific about sexual assault," said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. "But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future." What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Act and how repealing the law would affect women. Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge. The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition. What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. "The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point," Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition. To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s "health status." Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare. This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said. "Could" is the key word. What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond. The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco. For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line. Sexual assault "is the tip of the iceberg," Brindis said. "There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid." Our ruling Various bloggers wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from "would" to "could." The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10287	Oil companies "haven't touched" 68 million acres where they already have rights to drill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/18/barack-obama/68-million-acres-isnt-going-untouched/	In the debate over how much new oil drilling to allow, Sen. Barack Obama has made a simple but potent-sounding argument against moving too fast. Before opening up new areas to drilling, Obama says, the oil companies should be required to drill the acreage they already have. In an Aug. 4 speech in Lansing, Michigan, Obama said, "I also believe that in the short-term, as we transition to renewable energy, we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas. But we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but haven't touched. And if they don't use it they should lose it; we should require them to give up their leases to somebody who's going to do something. That's common sense." Obama was echoing a claim made by the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee. The Obama campaign pointed to a June report by the Democratic committee staff, which had cited the fiscal 2007 statistics from the Interior Department's Minerals Revenue Management -- which classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as "non-producing," along with another 889,378 acres of territory that had been leased for coal, geothermal, or other mineral production. The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican demands that Democrats move to allow drilling in Alaska's protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and offshore areas that also are currently off-limits to the oil and gas companies. A Democratic House bill would bar new oil and gas leases to leaseholders who have not met benchmarks to "ensure" oil and gas production within five years on the leases they already hold. But Obama's statement was misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68 million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. What Obama did not take into account is the long, complex process that companies most work through, both in federal red tape and in geologic exploration, before leased property becomes a producing oil or gas field. The government classifies that acreage as "non-producing" simply because the companies aren't taking oil and natural gas out of it now. David Curtiss, director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' Geoscience and Energy Office in Washington, DC, says it's wrong to assume that "the only lease that is being actively worked is one that has a drill rig on it." The Interior Department issues leases for onshore territory for 10-year initial terms. The department issues offshore leases for five, eight or 10-year initial terms, depending on the depth of the water. Dave Smith, a spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service, which handles offshore leases, says those initial terms are calculated according to how long the government thinks it will take oil and gas companies to find and start producing oil or gas. For both onshore and offshore leases, the companies have to comply with government permitting requirements as they undertake a lengthy scientific exploration process that culminates in test drilling to determine whether there is enough oil or natural gas in a particular spot to warrant full-scale drilling. All the while, the companies are paying rent to the federal government for acreage that is classified as "non-producing." It can take more than 10 years for a company to start producing oil or natural gas from a leased parcel, but as long as the company can demonstrate that it is making serious efforts to find some, the leases are extended. If the company cannot show that it's actively working the parcel, the lease is not renewed. Sometimes companies don't renew leases if their early work leads them to believe adequate reserves of oil or gas don't exist. It's probably correct to say that some portion of the 68 million acres of non-producing leases truly is not being "touched." It's not clear that such a statistic exists and the Obama campaign didn't seem to have it. But Obama's statement, coming from House Democrats, suggests that 'non-producing' acreage where drilling is permitted is land that oil companies are ignoring. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

pomt-12575	Says Adolf Hitler "didn't even sink to the level of using chemical weapons. ... He was not using the gas on his own people the same way that (Bashar al-)Assad is doing."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/11/sean-spicer/did-adolf-hitler-use-chemical-weapons/	Sean Spicer turned heads in the White House briefing room during a discussion of the situation in Syria when he wrongly claimed that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons. Spicer, President Donald Trump’s top spokesman, was discussing why Russia might withdraw support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and referenced Assad’s attacks on his own people. "You had someone who is despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons," Spicer told reporters April 11, 2017. Spicer attempted to clarify his point when pressed by reporters. "He was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing," Spicer said. "He brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that. But (not) in the way that Bashar al-Assad used them where he went into towns, dropped them down, into the middle of towns." We believe Holocaust centers refers to concentration camps. As for the rest of Spicer’s statement, there is a reason Nazis and Hitler became synonymous with the term gas chamber. That’s because they pumped hydrogen cyanide gas into the killing rooms packed with Jews, Roma, and others singled out for extermination by Nazi leaders. At concentration camps such as Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen, Jews were taken from cattle cars and forced into "showers," where guards released the gas. At the height of deportations, an estimated 6,000 Jews died each day in the Auschwitz gas chambers. Spicer appears to be trying to limit his definition of chemical weapons to those dropped from planes or fired through cannons, as Assad has been alleged to have done. That sells short the definition in the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took force in 1997. Here’s the convention’s definition: 1. "Chemical Weapons" means the following, together or separately: (a) Toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for purposes not prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and quantities are consistent with such purposes; (b) Munitions and devices, specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices; (c) Any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices specified in subparagraph (b). The Nazis’ hydrogen cyanide meets the first condition and the gas chambers would qualify as a "device" in the second. There is no mention that chemical weapons are only those used on the battlefield. Brian Finlay, president of the Stimson Center, a Washington defense policy group, told us that "the Nazis would surely have been in contravention of the (Chemical Weapons Convention) had it being in effect during the second World War." For what it’s worth, the consensus view is that Hitler did not use chemical weapons in battle. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But Spicer’s qualification that Hitler didn’t use them on his "own people," overlooks that German Jews were full citizens until they had their rights stripped away by Hitler’s totalitarian regime. A large number had assimilated and some had become Protestants. It’s possible Spicer was thinking of Austrians, Hitler’s birthplace, but Austrian Jews fared no better than German ones. Spicer, in a statement after the press briefing, said: "In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable." Our ruling Spicer said Hitler never used chemical weapons. The Nazi regime brought an industrial approach to mass murder of its citizens and others it sought to exterminate. The construction of gas chambers and the use of deadly gas was fundamental to that strategy. While the convention against chemical weapons did not exist in World War II, the modern definition would encompass the Nazi gas chambers. It makes no difference whether victims are brought to a room filled with deadly gas, or if the gas is sent to them in a bombing raid. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06876	"The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/31/travis-rowley/young-republican-chairman-says-board-elections-hea/	Controversy continues to churn over the issue of voter identification one month after the General Assembly passed a voter ID bill. Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it into law on July 2. Under the new law, voters in the 2012 election will be asked to show some form of identification; in 2014, they’ll be asked for an ID with a photo. Opponents have continued to complain that it's an expensive solution -- cost estimates for providing free IDs vary widely -- for a problem that essentially doesn't exist. They also maintain it will lower turnout of the poor, elderly and minorities. Supporters say requiring an ID is essential to the integrity of an election. The law allows registered voters without an ID to cast a provisional ballot. That ballot will be counted later if the local Board of Canvassers determines that the signature on the ballot application matches the signature on the person's registration. On July 19, GoLocalProv published a column by Travis Rowley, pundit, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, and a supporter of voter ID, arguing that past abuses made the new law necessary. (The column grew out of a challenge he accepted during the July 8 edition of Channel 36's "A Lively Experiment" to cite a single conviction for voter fraud in the state.) In the column, Rowley talked about cases in East Providence involving people who voted where they had their businesses -- not where they actually lived. He mentioned anecdotes of people supposedly posing as other voters, citing the claim of Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat. Williams says that she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names. (Rowley reported, incorrectly, that it was last year. Williams never filed a complaint.) At the end of his column, Rowley played the illegal immigrant card: "The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections," he said. We were intrigued. So we called Robert Kando, executive director of the board, to find out about these cases. Kando said that during his six-year tenure with the board, it has heard just one such claim. A check of Journal archives uncovered no cases and former elections board Chairman Roger Begin, who served from 1994 to 2006, said he could not recall any instances. The case Kando recalled "was during one of our recount hearings -- it was not the last election, it was a while ago -- where a losing candidate or the candidate's wife, who was looking for a new election, said, 'We saw people who we know aren't U.S. citizens and we know they voted.' The question then was, 'Who?' They said, 'It's just someone that we knew. But we didn't know their names.' " Given that lack of specifics, Kando told us, "there was no need to ask any more questions." In addition, no complaint was ever filed with the board. So we sent messages to Rowley on July 22, via email and his website, to tell him what Kando said and to ask if he had additional information. While we waited for a response -- we have yet to receive one -- we did some further checking. With Kando's help, we went back and checked the records, including listening to the tape of the Sept. 20, 2006, meeting that served as the source of Kando's statement. It turned out that his recollection of that meeting five years ago was off a bit. The agenda included complaints from two unsuccessful Providence candidates who said they had seen evidence of voter fraud. The board took testimony from both Laura Perez and Eulogio Acevedo, along with hearing from Acevedo's wife, Maryelyn. Contrary to Kando's recollection, the Acevedos made no reference to fraud by illegal immigrants. But Perez did. She had lost to Grace Diaz in the District 11 primary and in her complaint letter she said, "I personally witnessed an individual who voted but is not an American citizen." She reaffirmed that statement during the hearing. Her other allegations of irregularities involved five people, but none of those complaints involved citizenship status. The board voted to send both complaints to the state police for investigation. Perez told us police never contacted her. Perez's letter gave no names. She told us she knew the identity of the woman -- and that the woman was in the country illegally -- but wasn't going to reveal the name until the state police contacted her. State police Lt. John Lemont, assistant detective commander, said he recalled the case, one of several that police were probing at the time. But in her letter, "there wasn't information specific enough to go forward with an investigation. We therefore closed the investigation." Asked if he's heard of other allegations of voter fraud involving illegal immigrants, Lemont said, "I'm unaware of any other complaint, other than this one person." There have been successful prosecutions, but those have been "based on people voting in the wrong district." The Sept. 20, 2006, elections board meeting also included a presentation by Terry Gorman, president of the then-fledgling Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement. He was seeking support for a voter ID law. Gorman offered no evidence of voter fraud by illegal immigrants. The only other person to speak on the topic that day was Angel Taveras, now mayor of Providence, who was at the meeting to represent a client but stressed that he was testifying as a private citizen. He complained that citizenship status was being singled out. "We should make sure there was NO fraudulent voting," he said, predicting that if an investigation is undertaken, "I think what you're going to find is there is very little, if any, of it." Perez herself, who believes a lot of the votes cast in her district were done by people paid to engage in voter fraud, said she doubts that many undocumented immigrants were engaging in the practice. "Undocumented people are less likely to run that type of game," she said. "They're not going to take the risk. For $100? Hell no." So, in summary, when Rowley talks about the "official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting," his statement implies there were several complaints. There weren’t. There was just one. In 2006. There's a grain of truth to his claim. Perez did report one case. But because Rowley substantially overstated the evidence regarding illegal immigrant voting, the Truth-O-Meter rates his statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-12379	"When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/02/mike-mccabe/richest-1-percent-pay-lowest-rate-state-and-local/	Two weeks after indicating he will run for governor of Wisconsin in 2018, the leader of a nonprofit organization that encourages citizens to challenge the political establishment listed some of the reasons why. The potential candidate is Mike McCabe, who runs Blue Jean Nation and was a founding member of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics. Appearing on the May 21, 2017 edition of "Capital City Sunday," a public affairs show on WKOW-TV in Madison, McCabe said the state needs to raise the minimum wage "to turn that into a living wage" and make education "debt free." He added: "And we’ve got to change a tax system -- when you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate." Claims about the 1 percent, or the richest of the rich, are among our most popular. Let’s see how this one stands up. His evidence McCabe, who says he is not a member of any political party, cited a 50-state analysis of state and local taxes published in January 2015 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research organization based in Washington, D.C. Experts told us it is the only recent report of its kind on state and local taxes in Wisconsin. The report measured total state and local taxes as a share of family income for non-elderly taxpayers. In Wisconsin, according to the report, the top 1 percent pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than other income groups: Lowest 20%: Less than $22,000 Second 20%: $22,000 – $38,000 Middle 20%: $38,000 – $61,000 Fourth 20%: $61,000 – $91,000 Next 15%: $91,000 – $163,000 Next 4%: $163,000 – $399,000 Top 1%: +$399,000 8.9% 10% 10.2% 10.2% 9.2% 7.8% 6.2% (Nationwide, the gap was wider: The bottom 20 percent of earners pay 10.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes each year, compared to 5.4 percent paid by the top 1 percent.) It’s important to note that while the study supports McCabe’s statement, it uses a methodology that is accepted by some experts but criticized by others. Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us that any effort to assess who bears the burden of state and local taxes depends in part on assumptions that are made. Jared Walczak, an analyst with the Center for State Tax Policy at the free market-oriented Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C., said this study’s "assumptions do not provide a meaningful way to assess the question" about the 1 percenters in Wisconsin. The Tax Foundation expressed criticism at the time and Walczak emphasized to us that the study omits some taxes altogether -- such as business license taxes, gross receipts taxes and severance taxes. And the study includes one federal provision -- the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes paid -- to make state tax systems "look more regressive." However, data for the omitted taxes were not available, the institute told us. And even if the federal deduction were not considered, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin would still have a lower state and local tax burden than other income groups in Wisconsin. Richard Auxier, state and local tax policy expert at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, noted state and local taxes in the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, are regressive: They rely largely on sales and property taxes, which generally take a bigger bite out of the incomes of lower income people than higher income people. He also said that although Wisconsin’s income tax is relatively progressive, its earned income tax credit, which eases the income tax burden on lower-income residents, isn’t overly generous. So, given the generally regressive nature of taxes states rely upon, McCabe’s statement is not surprising. Indeed, if he made the statement about 48 of the 50 states (except Alaska and California, plus the District of Columbia), it would be on target, according to the report he cited. Our rating McCabe says: "When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate." His claim is based on a 2015 report which found that the top 1 percent of earners (income of $399,000 and above) pay 6.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes -- a lighter burden than six lower income groups. It’s important to note that the report’s methodology has its critics, but it is the latest available study that attempts to assess state and local tax burdens. With that caveat, we rate the statement Mostly True. More fact checks on the richest Mark Pocan: Under "Trumpcare," the Republican replacement for Obamacare, "$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country." Half True.

pomt-13643	Says the media distorted what happened with a baby at his rally.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-accurately-says-media-wrong-he-kicked/	Donald Trump is crying foul at news reports alleging he kicked a crying baby out of a Virginia rally last week. "The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ‘the baby’ and so much more. Very dishonest!" he tweeted. We looked into his widely reported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues. But is it true that babygate isn’t based on reality? Trump’s charge of media distortion sticks. The "scandal" started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in. "I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it," he said. "What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want." As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment. "Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," he said. "I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay." These sentences caught fire in the press. Here’s a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets: • New York Daily News: "SEE IT: Donald Trump kicks crying baby out of rally" • Rolling Stone: "Watch Donald Trump Throw Crying Baby Out of Rally" • New York Times: "Donald Trump Jousts With a Crying Baby at His Rally" • Fox News: "Trump has infant removed from rally for making noise" • Salon: " ‘You can get that baby out of here’: Donald Trump, upstaged by crying baby, orders it removed from rally" • Wired: "Trump didn’t just banish a baby. He banished a mother" • Baltimore Sun: "Trump banished the baby, humiliated the mother" But, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, Trump didn’t actually kick the baby out of his rally. Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale cleared things up that day, writing that Trump’s "get the baby out of here" comment came as the mother was already exiting. "A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump’s tone is eternally hard to read," Dale wrote. "But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother’s own decision to depart." NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and "the baby stayed." Tur reported about the incident on Bloomberg’s With All Due Respect (around the 30 minute mark). Another guest on the program, the Washington Post’s Phil Rucker, agreed: "I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke." The Associated Press reported that after saying "you can get that baby out of here," Trump "then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying." Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated Facebook posts soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her: "I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child's belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn't out of there sooner. ... "I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment. "I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally." Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote. "I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation," she said. At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories. Our ruling Trump said the media distorted what happened with a baby at his rally. Many media outlets reported that Trump "threw out" or "ejected" a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident. But this isn’t true. Trump’s comments came as the mother was already voluntarily exiting from the rally.

pomt-13086	"It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/nov/07/donald-trump/trump-misses-details-when-saying-florida-insurance/	GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been on the stump trying to chop down Obamacare, warning that Floridians are on the hook for big premium increases next year. "It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike," he said at a Nov. 3, 2016, campaign rally in Jacksonville. It’s a favorite talking point for Trump, who vows to repeal Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified option. But in this instance, Trump's talking point is missing a lot of context. Trump is talking about a small portion of people who get health insurance in Florida, and he neglects that most of the plans with increases will get subsidies to offset the cost. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which oversees insurance company requests for changes in premiums, did not answer our questions about increases next year. But the agency announced in September that premiums for individual health insurance plans sold in Florida in 2017 would go up an average of 19.1 percent. That is for any individual plan that meets the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements, whether it’s sold on the federal exchange’s HealthCare.gov or not. The premium changes depend on the company: For plans sold on the exchange, Health First’s increase is the lowest at 11.7 percent. Humana’s premiums are going up at the highest rate, 36.8 percent. Changes for compliant plans sold off the exchange range from a high of 27.3 percent for AvMed, to a decrease of 1.5 percent for premiums with Cigna. The nationwide average for premium increases is about 25 percent, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. One thing Trump didn’t mention is that customers who buy plans off the exchange won’t necessarily be paying the full price of those increases. About 1.53 million Floridians bought their coverage off the federal exchange in 2016. Out of those, 1.42 million -- 93 percent -- were subsidized in part by the federal government to make the plans more affordable. The average premium tax credit in Florida was $305. About 1 percent of customers who buy a plan off the exchange earn too much income and do not qualify for any subsidies. They will have to pay the full increase. Also, people have the option to choose a different, cheaper plan. For 2017, Health and Human Services has estimated that 86 percent of Floridians who buy a plan off HealthCare.gov will be able to find a plan for $100 a month or less. Amid double-digit increases last year, average premiums after subsidies went from $82 to $84, the agency said. Again, Trump is talking only about people who buy insurance on the exchanges. People who get insurance through work wouldn’t necessarily see the same increase. Small group plans, for example, will see an average premium increase of 9.5 percent, for example. In Jacksonville, Trump also said that "over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year." For 2017, every Florida county still has at least one Obamacare option on the exchange. Last year, Florida Blue and UnitedHealthcare were the only two insurance companies to offer policies in all 67 counties. UnitedHealthcare announced earlier this year it would leave the exchange in Florida and dozens of other states. Our ruling Trump said, "It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike." The state announced in September that ACA-compliant plans would see an average premium hike of 19.1 percent. That’s lower than the national average of 25 percent, but is still a sizable increase. Most people who buy those policies qualify for federal subsidies, however, so they likely won’t see an increase as high as Trump is implying. And the vast majority of Floridians get their insurance through their job, where increases aren’t going to be as high. Those are important points he didn’t mention, so we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6699ef-5777-4860-a17e-dcf06d0032a5	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-07T15:15:06	2016-11-03	['None']

pomt-13211	"The director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who (Syrian refugees) are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don’t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-refugees-safely-back-grounded/	During a U.S. Senate debate at the City Club of Cleveland, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman was asked for his views about refugees from Syria and what the U.S. role should be. Portman said that refugees face a dire situation due to actions of the Syrian government, but it would not be wise for the United States to increase the number of refugees admitted. "Before the Homeland Security Committee, the director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who these people are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don’t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that," Portman said. "That to me is not a good thing for the United States to do." Is that what FBI Director James Comey said? Let’s take a closer look. The United States vets all refugees through an extensive process that involves the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department and other agencies. The process can take two or even three years, as Democrat Ted Strickland said during the debate. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks, and because of special concerns about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. Comey spoke to the Homeland Security Committees of both chambers of Congress last year, sharing much the same opinion both times. His opinion was not exactly what Portman implied. When Comey spoke before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey whether there is concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases don’t contain complete information for every refugee. Comey said the procedure isn’t perfect. "We can only query against that which we have collected," Comey said. "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but ... there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person." So Comey was saying that, despite the thoroughness of the process, he couldn’t guarantee there would never be a problem or that no terrorist would ever slip through the cracks. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because the United States has had a presence there for more than a decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the same hearing that it’s possible a refugee could have an unknown criminal past or suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. That said, despite the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said the process works and has been improving over the years. "The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago," Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. "The bad news is, there is no risk-free process." Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. "There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that," he told the Senate committee. "From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps." He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. "We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news," Comey said. "The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria." We’ll also note that, especially given the extra scrutiny for Syrian refugees, experts have told us it "makes no operational sense" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program. "Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?" Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously. Finally, we should note that we’ve looked at claims from Donald Trump before that the United States doesn’t have a system to vet refugees. That more extreme claim is False. Portman’s claim offers more nuance and context. Our ruling Portman said, "The director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who (Syrian refugees) are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don’t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that." Portman had a point that Comey expressed concerns about information gaps on potential Syrian refugees. However, he exaggerated the extent of Comey’s concerns when he said that Comey indicated that "we cannot figure out" who they are, and that we have "no information on them." All told, Comey said the vetting process is thorough, but imperfect. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-07614	"According to 2009 estimates, an agreement with Panama could result in almost 1,900 Florida jobs in the first year – and about 15,000 jobs after five years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-presses-panama-trade-agreement-after-in/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott led a delegation of state business leaders to Panama March 17-18, 2011, where Scott met with government leaders, surveyed the expansion of the Panama Canal, and urged President Barack Obama to send a free trade agreement between Panama and the United States to Congress for ratification. Scott said the free trade agreement, which has been languishing since 2007, could mean jobs for Florida's less than bustling economy. "In Panama, I saw firsthand the construction being done to expand the Panama Canal," Scott said on March 18 during his weekly radio address. "Florida must be ready for the massive Post-Panamax ships from Asia, Europe and Central and South America that will come and go through the canal. "After meeting with Panamanian trade leaders, I am convinced more than ever that free trade agreements with Panama and other Latin American countries are essential to Florida's future. Florida has an important stake in ratification of trade agreements with both Panama and Colombia – agreements that have been waiting for congressional ratification since 2007. "According to 2009 estimates, an agreement with Panama could result in almost 1,900 Florida jobs in the first year -– and about 15,000 jobs after five years," he said. "Florida exporters will lose market share if these agreements are not in place." At a time when the state's unemployment rate sits at 11.9 percent, we thought it appropriate to check Scott's job-creation figures. Republicans have been pressuring Obama to submit the Panama trade agreement and another agreement with Colombia to Congress for ratification. White House officials have said the president plans to pursue both trade deals -- which have been languishing since 2007 -- though each has problems that need to be addressed. In Colombia, it's concerns over labor rights. In Panama, it's the country's history of being a tax haven as well as a requirement that at least 40 workers must agree to start a union. The agreement with Panama would make 88 percent of U.S. commercial and industrial exports duty-free immediately, with remaining tariffs being phased out over a 10-year period, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. More than 60 percent of farm exports to Panama would also be immediately duty-free upon the agreement's ratification. Scott's job-creation estimates come from an analysis produced by Enterprise Florida, an economic development public-private partnership chaired by the governor. The group produced a six-page report in May 2009 discussing the implications of the Panama-U.S. trade agreement in Florida. Much of that analysis, the report says, is developed using estimates and trade scenarios developed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Chamber predicted that U.S. exports would grow at an annual rate of 25 percent if the trade agreement is approved, compared to 16.5 percent if a trade agreement is not reached. That would translate to an additional $263 million in exports in the first year of the agreement, Enterprise Florida said. By the fifth year, exports would be $2.8 billion higher annually. U.S. imports from Panama would not increase substantially, the analysis concluded. What would that mean for Florida? Enterprise Florida concluded that by using the chamber's growth assumptions -- and the U.S. Department of Commerce's "rule of thumb" that each additional $1 billion in exports creates 11,000 jobs -- Florida would see an additional 995 jobs in the first year of the agreement and 10,600 additional jobs after five years. On top of that, Enterprise Florida said, the state would see an increase in services exports -- tourism, education and training, banking -- that would create 900 jobs in the first year and 4,500 by the fifth year. Added together, that's a total of 1,895 jobs in the first year and 15,100 by the fifth year, according to Enterprise Florida. Scott properly cites the totals in his figures, but he doesn't explain just how speculative they are. To create job estimates, Enterprise Florida first had to estimate the increase in export traffic produced by the agreement, then estimate the dollar figures associated with that increase. The group then had to estimate how much of that increase would be confined to Florida. And then they had to produce job estimates using another estimate that $1 billion in additional exports create 11,000 jobs (we found other estimates that say $1 billion creates 6,000, 9,000 or even 25,000 jobs). What's more telling is that the United States International Trade Commission attempted to determine the economic impact of the Panama treaty -- just like Enterprise Florida -- and said it couldn't. In a 175-page study that relied on 2006 data, the trade commission said that Panama ranks as the 45th-largest market for U.S. exports ($2.5 billion), and accounted for less than 0.5 percent of total U.S. exports ($929.5 billion). The chief export to Panama is petroleum products. U.S. merchandise imports from Panama, meanwhile, were valued at $337.6 million, making Panama the United States' 102nd-largest import supplier. Panama's biggest export is fish. "It was not possible to quantify the impact of the (trade agreement) on U.S. gross domestic product, overall trade, aggregate employment and overall consumer welfare," the commission wrote. Later, the commission said that any impact on the U.S. economy would be small. The trade commission predicted that, as a result of the trade agreement, the largest growth will accrue in the U.S. exports of rice (145 percent), pork (96 percent), beef (94 percent) and passenger vehicles (43 percent). "Again, these would amount to a very small dollar-value increase given that, with the exception of rice, the U.S. exports of these goods to Panama represent less than two-tenths of one percent (0.2 percent) of U.S. exports to the world and even a smaller portion of U.S. production," the commission wrote. Imports would not grow significantly because most Panamanian products already enter the United States duty-free, the commission said. In trumpeting a possible trade agreement with Panama, Scott tried to highlight the benefits to Florida by saying the agreement "could result in almost 1,900 Florida jobs in the first year – and about 15,000 jobs after five years." Scott rightly couches his job claim by noting that it's an estimate and offering the qualifier "could," so we can't fault him too much. But the fact is the analysis Scott relied on to make his claim is based on a series of significant assumptions or estimates, and a much more thorough analysis concluded that determining the impact on jobs created by the trade agreement with Panama was not possible. The lesson here is to be wary of any job estimate figure. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-03-21T12:00:42	2011-03-18	['Panama']

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The URL directs people to a three-question survey. Once completed, it asks the person to share the page to their Facebook to finalize the deal. Similar surveys that indicate Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Air, are giving away free tickets have circulated for years. But just like the Alaska Airlines survey, these are all hoaxes. In October 2016, Alaska Airlines posted tips for spotting scams like this, which featured a screenshot from the survey being circulated above. The post goes on to say that if a promotion is real it will be shared by a verified Alaska Airlines social account and it will use current Alaska Airlines branding. They also said the promotion should be hosted on an Alaska Airlines official website. "If you are sent to a website that is not alaskaair.com, promoted from alaskaair.com and/or does not have any affiliation or links to Alaska’s official websites, then it could be a fake promotion," it says.

pomt-12706	"Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent" since Tony Evers became state school superintendent.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/10/tony-evers/tony-evers-says-graduation-rates-surpass-90-percen/	Few states top Wisconsin’s K-12 graduation rate -- and the rate has gone up in recent years. State School Superintendent Tony Evers boasted on his Facebook page on Feb. 13, 2017 that "Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent" since his election. Evers is seeking a third term in the April 2017 election against challenger Lowell Holtz, a former school superintendent and principal. When asked to back up the Facebook claim, the Evers campaign pointed to graduation rates published by the agency Evers oversees, the Department of Public Instruction. The reports, they say, show a rate of 85.7 percent in 2009-10 (Evers’ first year) that rose to more than 90 percent in subsequent years. Case closed? No. Let’s put our red pencil and green eye shade to work. How rates are tracked The state and federal governments employ two methods to track changes in the four-year graduation rate. The first method -- dating to the 1960s -- estimates the four-year graduation rate from aggregate figures on enrollment and graduate counts. It shows Wisconsin’s rate was above 90 percent before Evers even took office. The latest figure reported under that method: 92 percent, in 2011-12. The second method, which is newer and more accurate, tracks detailed student-level data. That method dates to 2009-10 in Wisconsin. It shows a rising rate from 85.7 percent in Evers’ first year up to 88.4 percent in 2014-15. So neither approach backs up Evers’ claim. For the record, the state’s rate of 88.4 percent for on-time graduation (four years) ranked 6th-highest nationally by the latest numbers, which is actually a drop from No. 2 four years earlier. Behind the claim So where do the numbers cited by the Evers campaign come from? Those numbers look at how many students from a 9th-grade class graduate over five or six years, not four years. Wisconsin began tracking so-called "extended-year graduation" in Evers’ first year; dozens of other states also collect it. Viewed this way, Evers campaign says, the class of 2009-10 four-year graduation rate for the class of 2009-10 was 85.7 percent. It rose to 89.5 percent after five years and to 90.4 percent after six years. A similar growth pattern appears in later years, when you track an individual class. But we can’t judge if the same thing was happening before Evers, because the collection of the extended-year graduation rate didn’t start until his second year. So we can’t fully evaluate whether these figures show that "Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent" since he took over. But, even if they did, it would apply to the less-used "extended-year rate," not the more conventional 4-year rate that is better known to the average person. Our rating Evers claimed on Facebook: "Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90%" since he became state school superintendent. By the traditional measure -- graduation in four years -- Wisconsin’s rate is one of the best in America, but still below 90 percent using one approach. Using the other, it topped that mark before Evers even took office. Meanwhile, the extended-year graduation rate provides an element of truth to the claim. That puts it at Mostly False.

pomt-00834	"Small businesses (are) going out of business in record numbers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/24/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-small-business-are-going-out-business-rec/	Republican Sen. Ted Cruz became the first big-name politician to announce a 2016 presidential bid during an address at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. Cruz, of Texas, asked the audience to "imagine" (a word he used 38 times) what he believed a conservative administration could accomplish. "Think just how different the world would be. Imagine instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth," Cruz said. "Instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers, imagine small businesses growing and prospering. Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers." Let’s leave imagination land and return to the real world to evaluate whether businesses are closing their doors "in record numbers." Cruz’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries, so we hunted down the data on our own. We found that while the height of the recession was particularly tough on small businesses, it’s quite a stretch to say things are still worse than ever. To begin, one common definition for "small business" is 500 employees or fewer, so we’ll keep that in mind as we go through the numbers. But also know that 90 percent of those small businesses have 20 or fewer employees, which might be closer to what an average person considers a "small business." The Center for Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau surveys private businesses and their administrative records to track the number of firms and establishments over time. We want to look at firms with fewer than 500 employees, not establishments, which would include every single Starbucks across America. Firms are a count of companies no matter the number of locations, which allows us to single out small businesses in the truest sense. The number of firm "deaths" — meaning every location owned by a business was completely closed down — for businesses with fewer than 500 employees has been trending up since 1984. The peak came in 2009 during the height of the recession, when nearly 500,000 small businesses closed their doors. However, as of 2012 (the last year available) the number of business deaths had fallen back to where they were in 2005, 1998 and 1988. Data for the last couple years is not available, but if the trend from 2010 to 2012 holds, those numbers would likely paint an improved picture, said Zoltan Acs, on leave as director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University. "Those are all recession years and we know that we’ve been adding jobs for the last couple years so this is no longer happening," Acs said. "But the data is not up to date." The steady rise in businesses closing also looks less drastic when you compare the number of closures to the total number of small businesses. As you can see by the chart below, the rate of closures came close to peak levels in 2009, but the high point remains the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the percentage of businesses that closed exceeded 10.5 percent. More recently, the rate is on par with much of the last three decades. In addition to the rise in business closures during the recession, another decades-long trend has concerned economists: People are creating small businesses at a slower rate. Together, the two issues created a situation where "business deaths exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data," according to a May 2014 Brookings Institute analysis. As it was, from 2008 to 2011, the economy lost a significant number of small businesses annually, the first instance of back-to-back years of negative small business growth in the 35 years of available research. That’s certainly alarming. However, the most recent data from the Center for Economic Studies shows the economy gained 84,674 small firms in 2012. "It’s not a really clear picture," said William McDowell, an entrepreneurship professor at Middle Tennessee State and president of the Small Business Institute. "It’s all a big mess when you try to make some broadstroke statements. There’s no real research to defend what he’s trying to show." Our ruling Cruz claimed small businesses were "going out of business in record numbers." In terms of sheer volume, that was true in 2009, at the height of the recession, though the data only goes back to 1977. However, the total number of closures has since fallen. Data for the most recent year, 2012, shows business closures at about what they were in 2005. The percentage of firms that closed was quite high in 2009, but it wasn’t the highest point, and more recently, it is in line with historical figures. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

pomt-05280	Prince William County "has cut violent crime in half" since instituting a crackdown on illegal immigration.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/may/25/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-says-prince-william-county-cut-viole/	In announcing his candidacy for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart touted his record of combating crime and illegal immigrants during his years as chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. "We have cut violent crime in half since we instituted what is probably the nation’s toughest crackdown on illegal immigration," Stewart, a Republican, said in an April 11 interview on NBC 12. Stewart was referring to a law passed by the Prince William County Board of Supervisors in October 2007. The law initially required county police to determine the immigration status of anyone detained if there was probable cause to suspect the person was not a legal U.S. resident. The policy went into effect in March 2008. Because of concerns officers would be accused of racial profiling, the board amended the law in April 2008 to require that police investigate the immigration status of everyone arrested for violating state or local laws. We checked to see if violent crime has in fact dropped by half in Prince William since the county started the crackdown and, if so, whether the immigration law caused the decline. The answers, we learned during many hours of research, are complex and often contradictory. Statistical issues Stewart’s campaign told us the candidate’s claim is based on statistics kept by the Prince William County Police Department. Annual reports compiled by the local police show 767 violent crimes -- which they define as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- reported to the department in 2006 compared with 402 in 2011. That’s a drop of 47.6 percent. But numbers in the Virginia State Police’s annual Crime in Virginia report show Prince William has experienced a much more modest decrease in violent crime between those years. The State Police reports -- which define violent crime as murder, robbery, aggravated assault, forcible rape and "other forcible sex crimes" -- show only a 24 percent decline in the number of violent crimes between those years. That’s barely above the 22 percent drop off in violent crime experienced throughout Virginia from 2006 to 2011, according to State Police reports. On the other hand, Prince William significantly topped the combined performance of its neighboring counties -- Fauquier, Loudoun, Stafford and Fairfax -- which saw a 27 percent increase in violent crime between 2006 and 2011. For additional insight, we turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its statistics show the number of violent crimes reported by the Prince William County Police Department dropped 23 percent from 2006 to 2010, the latest year available. That’s slightly above the 21 percent drop across Virginia, according to FBI data. Prince William’s annual crime reports, meanwhile, show a 33.4 percent drop in violent crime during that time frame. Why are the numbers so different? Jonathan Perok, a spokesman for the Prince William police, said the county uses two different methods for recording crimes -- an old summary system for compiling its annual county reports and an incident-based system it uses when reporting its data to the state police. Under the county’s system, the most serious offense in a criminal incident is counted. For example, in an incident involving a murder and a robbery, only the murder would be tallied. But the county reports a different set of statistics to the State Police, who count all offenses in an incident when compiling their annual crime reports. Adding to the confusion, the data sent to the state is in turn given to the FBI, which converts it back to the old summary data for its national report. Perok said the FBI’s converted numbers never match Prince William’s original statistics. The old summary system on which Prince William bases its reports has been used nationwide since the 1930s, according to the FBI. But law enforcement agencies have been switching to incident-based reporting, which offers more details. Our confusion over the statistics was shared by the co-authors of a 2010 study, sponsored by the University of Virginia, examining the impact Prince William’s crackdown on immigrants had on its crime rate. "We ran into a very similar situation that was driving me absolutely crazy because we were coming up with completely different trends for similar time periods," said Tim Carter, a report co-author and the head of James Madison University’s sociology department. The authors noted the problem in their study, and ultimately relied on Prince William’s police reports for much of their research. Norman Westerberg, program manager with the Virginia State Police, was puzzled about why Prince William would use old summary reporting to tally crimes for its annual reports. He said the incident based format is more comprehensive. But Dana Schrad, executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said other local agencies throughout the commonwealth still use the old summary reporting system. She said keeping data in the old format allows for historic comparisons with crime data from earlier years. Some police officials think the older system provides a more accurate view of crime in their communities, she added. When to start counting We encountered another statistical problem with Stewart’s statement. He said there has been a 50 percent drop in violent crime since the policy was "instituted," meaning started. The law, as we’ve noted, didn’t pass until October 2007 and didn’t go into effect until March 2008. Stewart gets near his 50 percent claim by using 2006 county police statistics as his base year to start measuring the decrease in violent crime. But that’s more than year before the law was "instituted." If we use 2007 as the starting point, the violent crime drop was 35 percent between that year and 2011, according to the county’s annual reports. State Police reports show violent crime in Prince William decreased by 2 percent during that time. Violent crime in Virginia went down 21 percent during that span. The Stewart campaign says 2006 is a legitimate starting point because it was the last full year before the crackdown came up for consideration. Public debate over the measure began in mid-2007, they said, beginning the drop in violent crime. Cause and effect Next we turn to the implication of Stewart’s statement -- that the immigration law caused the decrease in violent crime. The UVA study, which the Stewart campaign urged us to read, offers no definite answer to this part of the claim. The report said violent crime in the county rose from 2004 to 2006 and then fell during 2007 and 2008. The drop was largely due to a 36 percent decline in aggravated assaults. The report said aggravated assaults really began falling in July 2007, when controversy over the proposed policy began to rise. "It’s probable, but by no means certain, that the drop in aggravated assaults is attributable to the immigration policy that the county adopted," Tom Guterbock, one of the report’s authors, told us. "It’s a very conspicuous drop … Other counties (in northern Virginia) didn’t see such a drop." But Guterbock, the director of the Center for Survey Research at UVA, said other report co-authors were "less sure" the law caused the decrease. The report says, "On balance, our conclusions about the policy’s impact on crime must be cautious due in large part to the lack of historical data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants." Until the law went into effect, Prince William did not tally figures for crimes in which the suspects were illegal immigrants. The report said illegal immigrants, since the crackdown began, have committed only a small to modest percentage of crimes in Prince William, including aggravated assaults. The report raises other possible reasons for the drop in crime, particularly aggravated assaults. Immigrants may have become more fearful of reporting crimes once the law went into effect, according to the study. Our ruling Stewart’s said violent crime in Prince William County has been cut in half since the county "instituted" its 2008 crackdown on immigrants. The claim only comes close to holding up when Stewart uses statistics kept by the county police and starts his count with crime data from 2006 -- more than a year before crackdown began. Data from the state police -- which uses a more comprehensive formula than Prince William to count violent crime -- tells a different story. It shows only an 24 percent drop in Prince William from 2006 to 2011 just above Virginia’s average. FBI statistics, based on reports from the county’s police, show a 23 percent reduction in violent crime from 2006 to 2010, slightly above Virginia’s decline. It’s important to note, however, that Prince William did outperform its neighboring Northern Virginia counties, which saw violent crime increase from 2006 to 2011, according to state police figures. Stewart’s statement implies Prince William’s drop in violent crime was caused by the crackdown. Experts who studied the impact of the law came to no definitive conclusion on that point. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False.	None	Corey Stewart	None	None	None	2012-05-25T06:00:00	2012-04-11	['None']
pomt-09446	"Todd Staples recently tried to woo his supporters and right-wing base by suggesting the Agriculture Commission cut programs intended to feed the elderly and disabled, many of whom are veterans."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/08/hank-gilbert/democrat-hank-gilbert-says-agriculture-commissione/	Just before extinguishing Kinky Friedman’s political cigar in the Democratic primary for agriculture commissioner, Hank Gilbert lit into his November opponent, incumbent Republican Todd Staples. In a March 1 news release, Gilbert accused Staples of using some of the state’s most vulnerable residents for political purposes. "Todd Staples recently tried to woo his supporters and right-wing base by suggesting the agriculture commission cut programs intended to feed the elderly and disabled, many of whom are veterans," the release said. We wondered what Gilbert was talking about. Gilbert’s campaign told us that he was referring to the Texas Department of Agriculture’s response to a request from Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus that state agencies submit plans for cutting 5 percent of their general revenue budgets. Experts say lawmakers could face a shortfall of $11 billion or more in projected revenue when they gather again in 2011. In their Jan. 15 letter to the agencies, the leaders said "reducing direct services should be your last option, but should be identified, if necessary, in order to meet the 5 percent target." Decisions on the agencies’ proposals are expected within six weeks. The Agriculture Department’s proposal, submitted Feb. 15, listed $7.2 million in possible cuts, the largest a $2 million reduction to a program that gives grants to organizations that serve meals — a direct service — to homebound Texans who are elderly or disabled. The cuts would reduce the program’s grant money for 2010 and 2011 by 10 percent. "Reduced funding would likely impact the number of meals served to elderly and disabled Texans by eligible organizations," the department’s plan states. Bryan Black, a department spokesman, said the agency does not know exactly what the impact would be because recipients of grants — 192 were awarded for 2010 — can use the money for things besides food, including salary, equipment and transportation costs. We also wondered if Gilbert is correct that "many" of the recipients of the meal aid are veterans. The Gilbert campaign said it did not have figures to support the veterans reference. Black said the Agriculture Department doesn’t track whether veterans are among meal recipients. However, a spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels and More, an Austin recipient of the grant money, told us that about 30 percent of the organization’s clients are men, and a "significant" share of those are Vietnam and World War II veterans. Dan Pruett, president of the local Meals on Wheels, said the grant money from the Agriculture Department had improved the group’s ability to serve the older population. Finally, there’s Gilbert’s statement that the food delivery grants were targeted because Staples was trying to appeal to his "right-wing" base. That’s the sort of speculative political claim that our fact-checking team doesn’t usually address, but we were curious about Gilbert’s reasoning. An explanation came from Vince Leibowitz, a spokesman for the Gilbert campaign, who said Staples’ action signals to conservatives that he’s willing to trim what they consider to be frivolous social programs. Black said that proposed reductions to state-funded grant programs were made equitably and that none was singled out for larger cuts. Summing up: Gilbert accurately described part of the Agriculture Department’s budget-cutting proposal. But it’s misleading to suggest that the food program was targeted for reduction. Nor did Gilbert present any evidence that Staples suggested the cuts to pander to his right-wing supporters. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07040	"My husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/01/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-shes-never-received-penn/	In an interview on Fox News on June 26, 2011, host Chris Wallace asked Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann about a story that appeared in the Los Angeles Times the day before that accused her of being hypocritical in her opposition to farm subsidies because her late father-in-law's farm, in which she and her husband own a partnership stake, has received nearly $260,000 worth of crop subsidies. "Regarding the farm," Bachmann said. "The farm is my father-in-law’s farm. It’s not my husband’s and my farm. It’s my father-in-law’s farm and my husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm." The farm in question sits on 949 acres in Independence, Wis., and was operated by Bachmann's father-in-law, Paul Bachmann. The congresswoman told The Associated Press that her husband became a trustee of the farm because his father had dementia before he died in May 2009, and that her husband "oversees the legal entity." However, records show the Bachmann Farm Family Limited Partnership was formed in 2001, and Rep. Bachmann and her husband have a stake in it. All of Rep. Bachmann's financial disclosure forms, filed with the Clerk of the House, list the Bachmann Farm Family LP as an asset of hers worth between $100,000 and $250,000. Paul Bachmann received nearly $260,000 in farm subsidies between 1995 and 2007, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by the Environmental Working Group. The lion's share, about $250,000 of it, was corn and dairy program subsidies. There are no records of any crop subsidies after 2007. In December, 2010, Bachmann told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that any subsidies going to the farm were for her in-laws. "I'm very proud of them," she said. "They came to the United States essentially to get away from socialism in Europe." Despite hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies applied for, and awarded to, her father-in-law, Bachmann has consistently positioned herself against them. In 2008, for example, she voted against a $290 billion, five-year farm bill (which passed despite the veto of President George W. Bush). "It exemplifies the very worst of Washington's ways," Bachmann said in a May 23, 2008, Gannett News Service story. "It is loaded with unbelievably outrageous pork and subsidies for agricultural business and ethanol growers." "Americans are being squeezed by taxes and rising living costs, and Congress wants them to pick up the tab for pet earmarks and wealthy landowners," she said. As she did in her Fox News interview on June 26, 2011, Bachmann told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune last December that she has never received "one penny" from her in-laws' family farm in Independence, Wis. But her congressional financial disclosure forms say she has. According to her 2009 financial disclosure form, the Bachmann Farm Family LP brought her income between $15,001 and $50,000. The form even has "farm income" written in to describe the type of income. The 2008 form shows the same thing, farm income between $15,001 and $50,000. The 2007 also lists farm income, but the online copy does not make clear which income range Bachmann checked that year. The 2006 form lists farm income between $2,501 and $5,000. In other words, at a minimum Bachmann has received somewhere between $32,503 and $105,000 in farm income between 2006 and 2009, according to her disclosure forms. That's a lot of pennies. We got no response to queries sent to the Bachmann campaign. But Matt Lewis of the Daily Caller reported on May 15, 2011, "Bachmann’s team tells me the family farm was put in a trust in order to provide for succession, which means that while the financial disclosure paperwork shows her as benefiting by virtue of her role as trustee, she has not received any of the money and is not involved in any operational decisions." But that doesn't add up, according to several campaign finance experts we spoke to. "I don’t know of any other possible explanation for her financial disclosure reports (other than that she received income from the farm partnership)," said Brett Kappel, a lawyer with the firm Arent Fox LLP who specializes in campaign finance law. "If she was just a trustee and received no income she would have to report her position as a trustee, but wouldn’t have had to report any income from the farm." Said Jock Friedly, whose website Legistorm tracks data on congressional salaries: "There does appear to be a conflict between her claims to the AP, to Fox News and on the financial disclosures. In particular, if her husband 'oversees the legal entity' but she and her husband and dependents have no personal stake, they need not report it as far as I can see from reading the House ethics manual. As a practical matter, I have seen some people report on the financial disclosures that they oversee assets but point out that they are not their own and that they have no personal stake in them. Most people will report it in the 'Agreements' or 'Positions' section of their disclosure instead of under assets, since that’s where it really belongs if you are entrusted with managing someone else’s money." Friedly said it's possible that she technically didn't get a penny because the profits may have been treated as retained earnings and invested in things such as new tractors. "But the key point here is that while she may not have received a distribution yet, that’s because in theory the entire enterprise is more valuable, with more money in the bank account or in farm equipment. She will get it later on. So from her perspective, she hasn’t gotten one penny. And even worse than that from her perspective, she’s stuck with the tax bill of having to report it on her 1040 Schedule K as a partnership distribution. And while it may seem unfair to get taxed and not get benefit, presumably over time that money will actually come into her bank account and she won’t have to report the distributions." In short, something's not right here. Either Bachmann reported something that didn't need to be disclosed or she got money from the farm at the same time it was benefiting from crop subsidies. Perhaps, as Friedly said, Bachmann won't see her first penny until she draws down the assets of the limited partnership. If that's the case, and it's a matter of delayed earnings, we still think it would be misleading for Bachmman to claim she hasn't made any money from the farm. Unless or until Bachmann steps forward to explain the discrepancy between her financial disclosure statements and her public pronouncements, we have to rely on the disclosures, which say she received at least $32,501 in income. So we rate her claim as False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-07-01T17:00:32	2011-06-26	['None']

pomt-04834	Florida has "more concealed weapons permits than any other state."	true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/14/rick-scott/florida-no-1-concealed-permits-rick-scott-says/	After yucking it up on a Gulf of Mexico fishing trip, Govs. Rick Perry and Rick Scott sat for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News Channel’s Your World with Neil Cavuto. In the interview (transcript here), the governors talked about why Scott and not Perry was selected to speak at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, as well as Mitt Romney’s decision to select U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as his running mate. They also were asked to comment about a recent shooting near Texas A&M University. Both Perry and Scott cautioned about using the shooting as evidence that people’s gun rights should be restricted. Scott then stated an amazing statistic about guns, if true. "I mean, I think we have more concealed weapons permits than any other state because Floridians care about their right to bear arms." Florida is the fourth-most populous state in the country, so it’s no surprise it would be high on a concealed permit list. But is it No. 1 ahead of Perry’s Texas, which has 6 million more residents, and California, which is nearly double the size? Turns out, yes. Scott is correct. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recently studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state. Their report, available here, is dated July 2012 and includes concealed weapons permit data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases. The top 10 of valid permits by state breaks down like this: 1. Florida -- 887,000; 2. Pennsylvania -- 786,000; 3. Georgia -- 600,000; 4. Texas -- 519,000; 5. Indiana -- 406,000; 6. Washington -- 351,000; 7. Utah -- 347,000; 8. Tennessee -- 341,000; 9. Michigan -- 296,000; 10. Virginia -- 279,000. There’s two caveats to this list. First, several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. So people living outside of Florida may have a Florida permit. Records don’t distinguish by location. Second, it’s worth noting that many states have reciprocity agreements regarding concealed weapons permits, meaning that a Texas license is valid in Florida and vice versa. We don’t think either is enough to question the validity of Scott’s remark, however. Three large states are missing from the Top 10 list. Illinois does not issue concealed weapons permits. California and New York are considered a "may issue" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That in turn makes it harder to get one. As a result, California has just 35,000 active permits, representing .1 percent of the adult active population, according to the analysis. Florida, a "shall issue" state, had a concealed weapons permit rate of 6.2 percent of its active adult population. Georgia ranks first at 11 percent. Our ruling Scott said Florida has "more concealed weapons permits than any other state." A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office study backs Scott up. The state has about 887,000 valid concealed weapons permits, nearly 100,000 more than the next closest state, Pennsylvania. We rate this statement True. (Correction: Our concluding graphs originally gave Georgia the No. 2 ranking and ignored Pennsylvania, which is rightly No. 2.)	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-08-14T18:36:34	2012-08-13	['None']

pomt-08817	Lincoln Chafee "voted with President George W. Bush and the conservative leadership 76% of the time."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/15/democratic-governors-association/democratic-governors-association-says-chafee-suppo/	The Democratic Governors Association, through its website SenatorChafee.com and via Google ads promoting it, continues to attack Lincoln Chafee, the former Republican now running for governor, asking "Is Chafee Really Independent?" The website says, "Senator Chafee supports the conservative economic policies of President Bush and opposes action that would really benefit the working families of Rhode Island. In fact, while in the Senate, Chafee voted with President George W. Bush and the conservative leadership 76% of the time." As a measure of loyalty, 76 percent doesn't strike us as being particularly supportive of then-President Bush and the conservative leadership. Are we talking about the same guy who refused to vote for Bush's reelection in 2004, who was attacked as being in RINO (Republican in Name Only) and who was chastised by the conservative Club for Growth for abandoning "Republicans to side with liberal Democrats"? Democratic Governors Association spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that the 76 percent comes from averaging the percentage of votes Chafee made against Bush, as compiled by Congressional Quarterly, and subtracting that number from 100. From 2000 to 2006, she said those figures were 12 percent, 16 percent, 7 percent, 23.1 percent, 24 percent, 44.4 percent and 29 percent, respectively. But that comes out to 77.8 percent support, not 76 percent. Bittner was unable to explain the discrepancy. The math is dead wrong for another reason: you can't get an accurate average by averaging individual percentages based on a voting record in which the number of votes differs from year to year. When we challenged Bittner about the calculation, she said, "What we're trying to demonstrate is the depth of commitment that Chafee had to supporting Bush's agenda. Beyond, that I'm not going to get into math questions." Still hoping to get an accurate percentage, we asked Bittner what the actual number of votes was. She said she didn't have the data available. So we turned to "Politics in America 2006," an almanac from Congressional Quarterly, and found the annual percentages cited by the governors association. It turns out they do not reflect how often Chafee voted with Bush and the conservative leadership. They only reflect his votes supporting the president. (The percentages are based on the editors' assessments of what the president probably wanted, as gleaned from speeches and other sources; not all votes were included.) The other problem with the percentages cited by Bittner: Bush wasn't president in 2000. So when the association says that Chafee opposed the president 12 percent of the time in 2000, they're talking about Democrat Bill Clinton, not Bush. The almanac includes a separate listing of how often Chafee voted with his Republican colleagues in the Senate, but those percentages make Chafee look even less loyal to the GOP. Unfortunately, the almanac doesn't include vote totals, so we couldn't calculate Chafee's overall voting percentage in either category. So we went to a source that does have the numbers we needed -- the U.S. Congress Votes database at WashingtonPost.com. It indicates how often candidates follow the party line and gives the total number of votes that serve as the basis for the calculation. It does not estimate how often a member of Congress supports or opposes the president. Chafee served in the 106th through 109th Congresses, casting 2,244 votes. He voted with the Republican Party 1,577 times. That's 70 percent, not 76 percent. That may not seem like a big difference, but consider the context. During the 2001-2002 sessions, the only Republican senator less likely to vote with the GOP was James Jeffords of Vermont, who left the GOP in 2001 to become an Independent. Chafee voted with his party 71 percent of the time. In the 2003-2004 sessions, Chafee ranked lowest in party loyalty among all Republicans, voting with the GOP 78 percent of the time. And during the 1999-2000 and 2005-2006 sessions, Chafee was the least likely of ANY senator -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote with his or her party (62 percent and 68 percent, respectively). The folks at the Democratic Governors Association are taking estimates of how often Chafee supported Bush, manipulating them improperly and mischaracterizing them by ignoring how often he opposed his mostly conservative GOP colleagues. We recommend courses in remedial math and history. To help motivate them, we'll give them a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Democratic Governors Association	None	None	None	2010-08-15T00:01:00	2010-07-29	['George_W._Bush', 'Lincoln_Chafee']
pomt-05510	Says oil "production's down where Obama's in charge."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/13/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-oil-production-obama/	A new Web ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS targets a presidential talking point on America’s oil production. It argues that President Barack Obama takes credit for drilling that resulted from President George W. Bush's policies, while glossing over a recent decline in production on public land. "Tell Obama, stop blaming others, and work to pass better energy policies!" a narrator says. The ad starts with Obama’s claim that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high, something we’ve twice rated Mostly True. Then a narrator asks: "Oh, really? His own administration admits production's down where Obama's in charge." On screen, the ad displays a statistic from the Interior Department published by an energy news service that, "Oil production fell by 14 percent … on federal lands and waters." That’s a one-year statistic we’ve also rated Mostly True. This ad focuses on Obama’s role in domestic oil production on government land. We’re evaluating the claim that the president's oil "production's down where Obama's in charge." The data Greenwire, the energy news service cited by Crossroads, published Interior Department numbers for oil production on federal lands and waters in a Feb. 27, 2012, story, citing them in a second story, which was the piece Crossroads used. The story said, "Oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal 2011 below the previous year on federal lands and waters, according to statistics provided last month by the Interior Department." So, oil production on federal lands, onshore and offshore, fell from 2010-11, according to Obama administration agencies. So far, so good, for Crossroads’ analysis — other than the fact that it failed to cite a time period for the statistic it quoted from Greenwire. Does that matter? Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. "From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend," he said. We pulled the numbers since 2003 from a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, also based on data from the Interior Department and its Office of Natural Resources Revenue. Bush was in office from January 2001 to January 2009. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led. The Obama administration points out that the average production for Obama’s first three years is a 13 percent increase over the average production over Bush’s last three years. We note that: • From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent. • From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent. Crude oil sales from federal lands Fiscal year Offshore (million barrels) Onshore Total Percent change from prior year 2003 579 101 680 n/a 2004 572 97 669 -1.6% 2005 542 96 638 -4.6% 2006 471 101 572 -10.3% 2007 514 105 619 +8.2 2008 462 104 566 -8.6% 2009 527 105 632 +11.7% 2010 618 108 726 +14.9% 2011 514 112 626 - 13.8% Source: EIA; some numbers slightly off due to independent rounding in source data What’s likely to happen this year and next? EIA doesn’t have projections for total production on federal lands, says spokesman Jonathan Cogan, but does project that offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico will continue to lag through 2013, with a drop of less than 4 percent from 2011. (Here’s the data in millions of barrels per day, though it’s calendar year data vs. the fiscal year data we show above.) Who’s to credit or blame? So, does Bush get credit for domestic oil expansion on private land and Obama the blame for a drop in public production, as the Crossroad ad describes? The picture is quite a bit more complex than a 30-second ad allows. "I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can," said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. "If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did." The expansion of fracking, for example — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades. "That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles," Hakes said. "There are just too many factors." So, Obama certainly shouldn’t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush. Meanwhile, the story of the one-year dropoff in public production has a significant asterisk: the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production — along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust. (Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA.) Oil production on federal land — not water — actually rose 3.7 percent in 2011. It was offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent. That’s something that Greenwire, the news service Crossroads cited in its ad, pointed out in its February story. "This is a pretty significant decline; it almost has to represent the impact of the moratorium," Dan Kish, senior vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, told Greenwire for the article. While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn’t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Republican President Richard Nixon, for example, ordered one in the wake of a 1969 well blowout in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium," Hakes said. Meanwhile, before the spill, Obama had announced a "fairly expansive stance" toward offshore drilling, including off the Florida Panhandle and the coast of Virginia, Hakes said. While that movement stalled with the BP disaster, the president has still moved toward arctic drilling off the coast of Alaska, alarming some environmental advocates. (We wrote about permit approvals under Obama in a fact-check of Rick Santorum, who had falsely claimed the president "put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling.") Our ruling A Crossroads GPS ad says Obama takes credit for Bush-era policies, then blames him for a downturn in oil production on federal lands. While it’s true that the effect of a president’s policies don’t show up in oil production for some time — in some cases, decades — the ad goes too far when it cites a 14 percent decline in production in a single year as evidence of the impact of Obama's overall energy strategy. The ad says oil production's down where Obama's in charge." The facts show that the decline represents a single year that followed years of substantial gains and occurred only offshore in the wake of a major oil disaster. The ad’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. CORRECTION: We updated this item on April 18, 2012, to add the change from 2008 to 2009 to our net increase/decrease calculation for oil production on federal lands under Obama. That changed a small net decrease to a net increase of 10.6 percent. Our ruling has not changed.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-04-13T12:05:39	2012-04-10	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-13311	Says "Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-said-trump-ticket-wants-deport-16-millio/	Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said he and Hillary Clinton support comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together, while Donald Trump wants to deport millions of people. "Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship," Kaine said during the vice presidential debate Oct. 4. "So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people." Kaine continued to say the Republican ticket has called for a deportation force and that they want to go "house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people." Pence said it was nonsense. So we wanted to know: Has Trump proposed to deport 16 million people, and do the Republican candidates plan to "get rid of" birthright citizenship? Kaine’s tally of 16 million possibly deported by Trump includes people who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and U.S. born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center). As Trump began his pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination, he presented an immigration plan that called for an end to birthright citizenship, saying it is "the biggest magnet for illegal immigration." That was the old version of Trump’s plan. Trump outlined his latest immigration plan a year later, on Aug. 31 in Arizona. His 10-point plan did not call for deporting 16 million people or ending birthright citizenship. He emphasized that he wanted to deport 2 million "criminal aliens." Trump’s ‘deportation force’ days Kaine’s comments aren’t unfounded. Trump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign. In that same Arizona speech, Trump talked about the broader undocumented population having to leave first in order to come back: "Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else." Clinton’s campaign pointed out a line in that speech where he said "anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation." Leading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but "they have to go." In a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. "If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way," Trump said. In November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, "How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?" "You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it," Trump responded. In that same interview, he said, "you’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely." Birthright citizenship So Trump has talked extensively about deporting the undocumented population, some faster than others. But that doesn’t mean he necessarily wants to deport their U.S.-born children. Trump hasn’t talked about birthright citizenship and "anchor babies" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents. "You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment," Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. "But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years." Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about his current position on birthright citizenship. Trump’s call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump’s campaign website, but a file of his first plan outlining it is still available. The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship, which says "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." That clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents’ immigration status. Pence, Trump’s running mate, cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009, introduced in the House but never brought to any vote. The bill sought to amend immigration law to consider a person born in the United States "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States if the U.S.-born person has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or national; a lawful permanent resident living in the United States; or an immigrant performing active service in the U.S. Armed Forces. So that would have prevented U.S.-born children of two parents without lawful or military status from obtaining citizenship. It is technically possible to end birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States to undocumented immigrants by repealing the 14th Amendment, said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. Otherwise, a measure like Pence’s bill that is signed into law could be challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court over 14th Amendment concerns. A big jump, plus legal concerns To reach 16 million deportations, Kaine assumes the citizenship of 4.5 million people who were born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally would be retroactively taken away under Trump. Trump said several times in 2015 that he does not think citizenship should have been granted to people with undocumented parents. But he has not proposed to deport them all or outlined a plan to revoke birthright citizenship that’s already been granted. The Clinton campaign disagrees, pointing to an August 2015 exchange between Trump and Bill O'Reilly, who asked, "Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here. If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?" Trump answered, "We have no choice. I'm sorry, Bill. We have to bring them out." Trump's responses to similar questions were also vague. In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he said undocumented parents would have to leave and unless they were "bad" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them. Again, that wasn't a clear proposal to deport 4.5 million people with citizenship. Doing so would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment. "Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively," said David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law. Any retroactive stripping of citizenship to those born in the United States to undocumented parents would likely be challenged by the courts, Costa said, because "they acquired citizenship under the longstanding interpretation of the law and the Constitution that was in effect at the time they acquired it." Such a retroactive law would be considered an "ex post facto" law (which means making an act illegal even though it was legal when committed). Ex post facto laws, which generally apply to criminal penalties, are prohibited by the Constitution. "I'm sure that it would be unconstitutional to change the birthright citizenship rule retroactively, probably as a violation of substantive due process," said Peter Schuck, an emeritus professor of law at Yale University. Our ruling Kaine said, "Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people. 11 million who are here without documents, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship." Trump has talked about the entire undocumented population of about 11 million people having to leave the country at some point in order to come back and reside legally. But Kaine assumes Trump would try to deport 4.5 million people who have citizenship because they were born in the country to undocumented parents. Trump has said birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment is questionable but has not proposed retroactively stripping it away and deporting this group. Trump did call for an end to birthright citizenship during the primary. His most-recent immigration plan does not mention the idea, though he has not renounced it altogether. As for Pence, he co-sponsored a bill seven years ago to amend birthright citizenship eligibility to children who have at least one parent with legal or military status. Kaine’s statement is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c19c66d8-2ec0-41f0-9dad-df909ccbf357 Clarification: The fact-check was updated shortly after publication to account for more of Trump's comments on birthright citizenship.

pomt-14861	"The Chinese are there" in Syria.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-china-involved-syrian-conflict/	Ben Carson suggested during the Fox Business News debate in Milwaukee that China is involved in the Syrian conflict. When asked if he supports President Barack Obama’s decision to put 50 special operations troops in Syria, Carson said any presence is better than no presence, especially given the forces at play. Here’s what he said in context: Moderator Maria Bartiromo: "Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president’s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?" Carson: "Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they — that’s why they’re called special ops, they’re actually able to guide some of the other things that we’re doing there. "And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way. "We also must recognize that it’s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there." We were curious about Carson’s assertion that the "Chinese are there" in Syria. According to the White House, China and experts, they are not. But before we dive into that issue, let’s sort out some semantics. What Carson meant Multiple media outlets, including our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, took Carson’s remarks to mean that Chinese troops are in Syria. But the Carson camp forwarded us a statement refuting that interpretation. Rather, his actual point was that China is providing "various military weapons and equipment that Syria is using in the current conflict," according to the statement which also included several links to articles on that point. "Dr. Carson does not believe that China is currently fighting in or deploying troops to Syria, and contrary to press reports, he has never made that assertion," the statement reads. "Regardless, Dr. Carson's claim that China is exerting its influence and has in the ongoing Syrian conflict is well-supported by evidence, even if it is not evidence commonly available to or easily accessible by journalists without the requisite language skills or knowledge about Chinese." However, Carson seems to be backtracking. On Nov. 11, the day after the debate, a top Carson adviser spoke specifically about "Chinese military advisers" in Syria when defending Carson’s remarks. "During Dr. Carson’s conversations with military operatives and people in Iraq, in that part of the world, (they) discussed with him multiple reports that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria operating with Russia (sic) special-operations personnel," the adviser told Business Insider. A Carson spokesperson also referred the Washington Post’s Fact Checker to a few blog posts speculating explicitly about Chinese military personnel in Syra. We also ran Carson’s statement by an expert on political campaign rhetoric. "Saying ‘the Chinese are there’ means the Chinese are there, not just that their weapons are there," said Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland. "He is making a clear, firm assertion. Had he made a more nuanced statement, such as ‘there is a Chinese influence there,’ there would be some room for debate on his meaning." No Chinese in Syria What’s the source of the idea that China is in Syria? The posts Carson’s spokesperson sent to the Washington Post all link back to a Sept. 27 report from the Lebanon-based news site Al-Masdar Al-’Arabi. According to the news site, a senior officer in the Syrian Arab Army said Chinese military personnel would join Russian marines in the Syria in the next six weeks. The story then got picked up by Russian state media, and the overseas media attention led China's Foreign Ministry to officially deny China’s presence in Syria in mid October, while its state-run media characterized the reports as "speculative nonsense," according to Reuters. Carson’s statement also prompted responses from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he was "speechless" over Carson’s claim that he has better intelligence than the administration. "I really can’t speak to what he was referring to, but unless you’re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I’m not sure what he was referencing," National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a press conference. "I have not seen evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria." Experts told us it would be very uncharacteristic for China — a country with a longstanding, though gradually changing policy of nonintervention — to send troops abroad, especially to the Middle East. "The Chinese have been very, very clear from day one that Syria is not something they want to take responsibility for," said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a global consulting firm. "It would go against absolutely everything we know about China. And Syria is the world's worst morass. ... The Chinese want no part of this." "There is no possibility that China is planning on sending troops into Syria," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "China doesn't send troops abroad except for peacekeeping purposes. China isn't interested in taking on the role of global policeman." Both Bremmer and Glaser noted that official Chinese statements on Syria are vague comments promoting peace and self-rule. "China opposes easy interference in other countries' domestic affairs. China supports Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its approach to find its own path of development that is consistent with its national circumstances," China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a visiting Syrian official in mid October. The same sentiment is expressed in a five-point proposal for the Syrian conflict put forward by China during the United Nations’ Geneva II peace conference in 2014, as well as the four-step initiative it offered at the Syria peace talks in Vienna at the end of October 2015. That came as news to Bremmer, who noted he’s not surprised that the neurosurgeon flubbed a statement about foreign policy. Is it possible that some Chinese officials are in Syria discreetly? "There are 1.3 billion Chinese, they're in a lot of places. China’s got an economic interest in Syria obviously, so would I be stunned that there were a couple of Chinese intelligence guys on the ground? No, but they're not playing a military role," Bremmer said. Our ruling Carson said the Chinese have a presence in Syria. In context, Carson’s comments suggested a military presence. That claim appears to be lifted from unconfirmed blog posts and a news report by a Lebanese news site. China and the White House have denied that Chinese troops are in Syria, and experts told us there’s no evidence to the contrary. Even if Carson meant something less than a military presence, China seems to be taking a hands-off approach to the conflict in Syria. We rate Carson’s claim False.

pomt-13842	"The folks in Washington" are "already forcing you to buy government health care."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/12/carlos-beruff/are-you-being-forced-government-health-care-nope/	Carlos Beruff, Marco Rubio’s Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, says he’s had enough of people in Washington making decisions and controlling people’s lives. Beruff’s new campaign ad, dubbed "Clean House," criticizes government intrusion into American life. "The folks in Washington have it all figured out," Beruff says in the ad. "They’re going to make your choices and run your life." He continued: "They’re already forcing you to buy government health care." PolitiFact is very familiar with inaccurate statements about the health care law. In fact, four out of seven PolitiFact Lies of the Year have been related to the Affordable Care Act, including that the 2010 law was a "government takeover of health care." The Lie of the Year in 2010 debunked statements that suggested the Affordable Care Act represented a "government takeover of health care." The main finding was that the plan would increase government regulation, but it would continue to rely on private insurers to provide coverage for most Americans. Beruff’s claim falls into a similar trap because it glazes over private insurers’ roles, but doesn’t go as far as to suggest a government takeover. The individual mandate Beruff’s spokesperson cited the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty, called the individual shared responsibility payment. That mandate, which took effect in 2014, is due every month an individual doesn’t have health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns, and increases every year a person remains uninsured. No one is forced to buy government health insurance via the individual mandate, but individuals are strongly incentivized to have the minimum essential health coverage to avoid the penalty. Some may consider the individual mandate to be "forcing" people to get coverage, but people can choose to remain without health insurance and defer to the fine, said Ben Sommers, an assistant professor of health and economics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health. Beruff’s point isn’t flat-out wrong, but his word choice is problematic, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. She said she wouldn’t have used the word "forced" because the mandate only strongly encourages having health care coverage, and it doesn’t have to be government coverage if your employer offers private insurance. The individual mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the Health Insurance Marketplace lays out 14 categories of hardship exemptions that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it. "Hardship" exemptions cover homelessness, filing for bankruptcy and foreclosure, and a family member’s death, to name a few examples. Dissecting ‘government health care’ Beruff’s bigger problem is with his characterization of the Affordable Care Act as "government health care." Yes, the mandate requires Americans to carry health insurance. But just as before the law, the majority obtain it from private sources, such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators. The law aimed to dramatically expand public health insurance through the federal-state Medicaid program. But a Supreme Court decision has allowed 20 states, including large ones such as Texas and Florida, to not extend coverage to more low-income residents using federal dollars. In 2014, 66 percent of people had private health insurance, and 55 percent of all people received insurance from their employers, according to a report from the Census Bureau. Any type of private health insurance must meet specific set of rules in the essential benefit package, said Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. But it’s still private, not government health care. Still, Tanner said it might be fair to call the coverage "government designated health care" because individuals can’t buy just any type of health insurance, he said. Beruff’s spokesperson echoed this argument. Our ruling Beruff said Washington politicians are "already forcing you to buy government health care." His statement makes a sweeping generalization, but there is some truth to the "forcing" part. The individual mandate incentivizes individuals to have health care or face a tax penalty. Of course, the choice is still theirs. The bigger problem is Beruff’s use of "government health care." This talking point was flawed around the law’s passage six years ago, and it’s no more accurate now. Just as before, the country’s health care system largely depends on the free market.

pomt-13560	Says Hillary Clinton wants illegal immigrants "collecting Social Security benefits."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-ad-says-illegal-immigrants-would-be-c/	Donald Trump's first ad of the general election campaign focuses on immigration, predicting what will happen if Hillary Clinton is elected. "In Hillary Clinton's America," it warns, "illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay, collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open, it's more of the same, but worse." We've previously looked at whether illegal immigrants convicted of crimes get to stay in the United States, a statement that rates Half True. But what about his other claim about immigrants getting Social Security? If you take the Trump ad literally, it is accusing Clinton of wanting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits — an easily disprovable assertion. Instead, for this fact-check, we’ll examine another interpretation: whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally. This reading dovetails with information cited by the ad, an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors strict immigration policies. There's some truth to that argument that immigrants would be getting Social Security benefits under policies favored by Clinton. But, like all things related to immigration, it can get complicated. Let's take this a step at a time. Undocumented residents can remain in the United States without fear of deportation if given "deferred action" designation by the Homeland Security Department. That means, in essence, we know you're here, we know you're undocumented, but we're not going to deport you for now. It's a temporary designation that must be renewed every two years. It doesn't make them citizens or legal; they can be deported if they are convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, excluding traffic tickets. But if they behave themselves (and the government keeps renewing their "deferred" designation), they get to stay. This "deferred action" status alone does not make them eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits. Once they have a deferred action designation, they are also given permission to work. The idea is, if we're willing to let you stay, you should be able to make a living and do it without being exploited by unscrupulous employers. In the past, the deferred action designation has been granted to groups like victims of human trafficking, foreign students affected by a natural disaster, or family members of citizens killed in combat. People with a deferred action are considered to be "lawfully present" in the United States, but only for the purpose of work authorization. They are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or other federal entitlement benefits available to citizens and people considered lawful permanent residents. However, they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare, where a portion of income goes toward funding the benefits. This is nothing new. Congress and President Ronald Reagan set up this system in 1986. It was updated in the late 1990s. To be eligible for Social Security, the program Trump is focusing on, a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and, like everyone else, couldn't start collecting until retirement age. But first they have to be given that "deferred action" designation, which brings us to two Obama administration programs designed to do precisely that. Both are supported by Clinton. Neither have been passed by Congress. The first is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It took effect in 2012 and has given deferred action designations to nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children and have lived here since 2007. As a practical matter, the children and young adults put into the deferred action category by DACA — and who start working — aren't going to be covered by Social Security for decades. That would be long after a Hillary Clinton administration — if there is one — has come and gone. As the Washington Post's Fact Checker noted, "if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43." The second program supported by Clinton is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. It would have given deferred action designations to as many as 4 million of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. It would have applied to people whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Their designations would have to be renewed every three years. It would let them apply for work permits if they passed background checks and paid a fee. Unlike DACA, this program has not taken effect because 26 states challenged it. A 4-4 Supreme Court decision blocked its implementation. That legal fight has also blocked an expansion of DACA. Because Clinton has vowed to defend both programs, Trump argues that illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security if Clinton had her way. But there are a few things to remember. Granting deferred action to someone who came into the United States illegally means they have a "lawful presence" in the United States. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. ("Lawful presence" is often confused with "lawful status" or "legal status," which means you are not in the U.S. illegally.) "They are getting a deferral of deportation, not a legal status," said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. "Only Congress can grant a legal status. Work authorization comes with the package when they get deferral, but by itself does not confer legality." Even if Clinton succeeds in implementing DAPA, these undocumented workers won't be eligible for any Social Security benefits for a minimum of 10 years. That's how long you have to work to be eligible. (Again, the children and young adults covered under DACA wouldn't be eligible for a Social Security retirement check until much later.) If Clinton were elected and subsequently re-elected, she would be gone from office for nearly two years before anyone would start collecting, and the amount they received would be tied to the amount they were taxed. And that assumes Clinton's successor continues the DAPA and DACA programs. In addition, these immigrants would have been working legally for a long time. They might not have become citizens or permanent residents, but they would have been working in the country legally for at least a decade, paying taxes and contributing to the Social Security Trust Funds. Finally, it should be noted that undocumented workers paid about $13 billion into Social Security in 2010 while the program paid those workers only about $1 billion in benefits, including people who have overstayed their visas or who obtained a Social Security number through fraudulent means. That extra $12 billion per year is money those workers would have a hard time claiming. We didn't hear back from the Trump campaign, but Trump's policy director, Stephen Miller, responded to the Washington Post, which ruled on the question of whether immigrants can collect Social Security benefits now, by saying that the net payments made to Social Security "will be dwarfed by net withdrawals" by people under DAPA and DACA. Our request for documentation to support that assertion went unanswered. But a 2015 report by the Social Security Administration says Miller is wrong. It projected that DACA and DAPA would initially increase the solvency of Social Security — which is due to run out of money in 2033 — by about three months. It would produce a small overall increase in revenue through 2045, a smaller overall decline from 2046 through 2082 and be neutral after 2082. Our ruling Trump says in his television ad that, under a Clinton presidency, illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security benefits. It is correct that Clinton has supported plans to give many undocumented immigrants the right to stay in the country through deferred action, which has already been done under the Obama administration's DACA program. As a consequence of that, they are allowed to work and become part of the Social Security system under rules that have long been in place. But Trump's ad gets at none of that nuance, instead insinuating that all illegal immigrants would be getting immediate handouts under Clinton's presidency. Even if the broader DAPA program were to be adopted today, it would take a minimum of 10 years of working — and paying into the Social Security system — before these immigrants would be able to start getting their retirement money back. With few exceptions, the first payments wouldn't be collected until after Clinton leaves office. Trump's statement has an element of truth but gives a misleading impression that all illegal immigrants will be getting Social Security paychecks during a Clinton administration.

pomt-03394	"Abortion is the second-most conducted surgical procedure in this country."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/jul/05/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-abortions-are-nations-second-most-/	Rick Perry made his case for legislation to step up standards for Texas abortion clinics partly by saying abortions are common. "Abortion is the second-most conducted surgical procedure in this country," Perry said on the July 1, 2013, edition of Bill Bennett’s "Morning in America" radio program. He made a similar statement the same morning on KFYO, 790 AM in Lubbock. That claim rang a bell. In February 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated a stronger declaration — that abortion is the country’s "most common surgery" — as Pants on Fire. Many people go to the hospital for medical procedures; in 2007, almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in the United States. Its researchers concluded that virtually every type of surgery, when classified broadly, was far more common than abortions. Abortions as surgeries? Perry’s office did not respond to our requests for backup information, while a physician who represents a national organization of specialists opposed to the Texas measure objected to describing abortion as a surgical procedure. Dr. Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and former medical director of the Women’s Health and Breast Center in Washington state, said by telephone that abortions are "minimally invasive" procedures, akin to colonoscopies, and do not involve surgical cutting unlike, say, hysterectomies. "We call these procedures, not surgeries," Levy said. "I don’t even think it’s appropriate to talk about" abortion "as a surgical procedure." The Merriam-Webster dictionary does not explicitly include "surgery" or "surgical" in its definitions of abortion: "The termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus: a : spontaneous expulsion of a human fetus during the first 12 weeks of gestation... b : induced expulsion of a human fetus." Abortion counts Levy’s challenge aside, we looked into the frequency of abortions and various surgeries. According to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, some 1.21 million U.S. abortions were performed in 2008, the latest year for which the institute has posted a tally. Institute spokesman Rebecca Wind has noted that Guttmacher’s abortion counts take in all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Wind told us that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014. The Guttmacher total exceeds the 825,564 abortions reported for 2008 and the 784,507 abortions reported for 2009 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the government figures are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions in California, Maryland and New Hampshire — three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary. By email, Wind told us she has heard the claim that abortion is the most common surgical procedure, but she said has not seen a factual citation backing that up. Nationally and in Texas, the number of annual abortions has declined, we confirmed for a February 2013 fact check. The Texas Department of State Health Services says "induced terminations of pregnancy" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008. Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us in February 2013 that 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 — some 5,100 fewer than the year before. Some abortions are induced with medicine. According to "Women’s Health Stats and Facts 2011" published by the the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, abortions performed with medication accounted for 17 percent of all non-hospital abortions in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2001. Such abortions by pill accounted for approximately 25 percent of abortions before nine weeks’ gestation, the organization said. Tallies of other procedures The same college publication says that among reproductive-age women, hysterectomy is the "second most frequently performed major surgical procedure after cesarean delivery," where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman’s abdomen. It does not say how this prevalence compares to abortions. Next, we looked for general breakdowns of common surgical procedures, starting from PolitiFact Ohio’s work. In a report issued in 2008 and revised in January 2009, the CDC reported that the nation’s most common outpatient surgeries in 2006 (the latest year with compiled estimates) included endoscopy of the largest intestine (5.7 million surgeries), meaning colonoscopy; endoscopy of the small intestine (3.5 million), meaning examinations through the mouth and throat; extraction of the lens (3.1 million); injection of prosthetic lens (2.6 million); and injection of an agent into the spinal canal (2 million). Its report said the leading diagnoses included cataracts (3 million) and benign and malignant growths (3.2 million). A CDC survey published in October 2010 estimates the number of U.S. inpatient surgical procedures in 2007 (the latest year of compiled information). CDC said about 7 million cardiovascular procedures were performed, including more than 1 million cardiac catheterizations. Among women, the centers said, cesarean sections and repair of current obstetric laceration were the most frequent obstetrical procedures performed; about 1.34 million cesarean sections were performed. Also, according to the survey, there were 5.5 million digestive system operations in hospitals that year. PolitiFact Ohio wondered if all the identified procedures were examples of surgery or could better be considered medical procedures and not surgeries. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, replied that while the term surgery isn’t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered "surgery." Keder said eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. Put another way, because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures — almost 45 million U.S. inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 — virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was more common than abortions. There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So, if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list. Finally, ACOG’s Levy emailed us figures she said she drew from federal databases. In 2011 among Medicare beneficiaries alone, she said, there were more than 1.8 million cataract surgeries. Among all U.S. residents, she said, there were an estimated 10 million wisdom teeth extractions. "This may be an analogous procedure to abortion — although actually more invasive — that it is typically performed in an office setting. If we then consider all of the excision and repair of skin lesions, some of which are quite complex for cancers, again the numbers are in the millions," Levy wrote. Levy said that according to the American Gastrointestinal Association, there are 14 million U.S. endoscopies a year, including 8 million to 9 million colonoscopies. We asked Levy if abortions might possibly be the second-most common procedure for women alone, though that is not what Perry said. She said by email that abortion is a common procedure among women. But, she wrote: "We can expect that women make up at least 50 percent of the population having colonoscopies, cataract surgery and wisdom tooth extractions, so abortion would definitely not be the second-most common surgical procedure among women." Our ruling Perry said abortions are the second-most common surgical procedure. This claim has substantial weaknesses--starting with whether an abortion is surgery. Bluntly, too, abortions do not appear to be more pervasive than numerous other medical procedures. Assuming 1.21 million abortions annually occur in the United States, and keeping in mind that 17 percent of these are induced by pills, the latest federal estimates for other surgical procedures indicate there are more than 2 million more eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye and there also are more surgical procedures involving the intestines or involving the extraction of wisdom teeth. Also, a procedure common among women who are giving birth -- a cesarean section -- has occurred more frequently than abortion. This claim not only lacks a factual basis, it’s ridiculous.

pomt-05805	"As Virginia’s governor, Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/23/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-george-allen-cut-spending-and-wast/	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently launched a television ad lauding the fiscal record of George Allen, who is seeking this year’s Republican nomination in Virginia for the U.S. Senate. The 30-second spot praises Allen for supporting tax cuts when he was a senator from 2001 to 2007. "And as Virginia’s governor, Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support," the ad says. Did Allen cut spending and waste as governor? U.S. Chamber officials did not respond to our repeated phone calls and emails. So we relied on state budget records and a small amount of background material the Chamber cited in its ad. When Allen took office in January 1994, he inherited an overall $14.7 billion budget for the fiscal year that started the previous July 1. At the end of his term, in January 1998, he left behind a $20.7 billion proposed budget for the fiscal year that started the following July 1. That means Allen endorsed $6 billion in additional spending when he was governor -- a 40.7 percent increase. But looking at overall spending may be unfair. Slightly more than half of the outlays during Allen’s years came from the non-general fund, over which a governor has limited control. The fund consists of earmarked revenues such as college tuition and federal highway grants. A better gauge, as we’ve noted before, comes from examining the general fund, which pays for public education, health programs and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes. The general fund was almost $6.8 billion when Allen took office. At the end of his term, he proposed a $9.9 billion general fund for the budget year beginning July 1, 1998. That means Allen endorsed $3.1 billion in additional general fund spending when he was governor -- a 45.6.percent rise. Although the general fund growth under Allen may sound gigantic, it was about average for a Virginia governor. The general fund budget has grown by 479 percent over the last 30 years, from almost $2.7 billion in 1981 to almost $15.5 billion this fiscal year. Many factors explain the expansion: population has grown, creating greater revenues and a greater demand for services; Medicaid costs have increased dramatically, often by 10 percent a year; and inflation. Allen tried to slow the growth by proposing a $2.1 billion tax cut in early 1995. The measure was opposed by the business community and defeated by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. After that point, Allen had little choice but to spend the revenues coming in. So how does does the U.S. Chamber square the general fund increases with its claim that Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support? Fine print in the Chamber’s ad refers to a story in The Washington Post on Feb. 25, 1995, that was headlined "Allen Announces Deal on Welfare." The article detailed an agreement Allen struck with lawmakers to require welfare recipients to gradually return to work. The legislation, considered a key Allen accomplishment, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Department of Social Services estimated in 2007 that welfare reform saved the state $957 million over its first 12 years. So the Chamber is not basing its claim that Allen that cut spending and waste on the bottom line of the state budget. It is referring to a program that Allen cut. Allen, while acknowledging that total spending increased during his administration, says he found savings by streamlining parts of Virginia government. In addition to welfare reform, he points a reduction in the state workforce and the repeal of many regulations. Throughout his campaign for governor and his term in office, Allen criticized the bureaucracy and the state regulations for wasting taxpayers’ dollars. As we noted in a previous Truth-O-Meter item, Allen trimmed the executive branch, which represents the bulk of state workers, by 10,000 employees, or 9 percent. But the state’s reliance on private contractors also grew significantly during his administration. The state did not keep records that allow a bottom-line analysis of Allen’s workforce policies. Our ruling Last August, we gave a False rating to Allen’s unqualified boast of "reigning in" state spending when he was governor. Spending continued its normal growth pattern during Allen’s term. Now, the national Chamber of Commerce, in a TV ad, says "Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support" when he was governor. There is some qualification in this statement. The claim does not square with the big picture left by Allen’s administration. General fund spending rose by 45.6 percent from the budget Allen inherited in 1994 to the one left behind in 1998. It should be noted that Allen’s major effort to control spending was thwarted by the Democratic-controlled legislature, and the growth under Allen was about average for a Virginia governor. The Chamber, however, is focusing on a detail in the big picture. In the ad’s fine print, the group backs its statement by citing welfare reform championed by Allen in 1995. The law passed with strong bipartisan support and is credited with saving Virginia $957 million over its first 12 years. Beyond the Chamber’s footnote, Allen could legitimately claim to have saved the Commonwealth money through some of his actions to pare the state workforce and regulations. So the claim is partially accurate, but omits the important point that bottom line spending went up significantly during the Allen years. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02337	Because of the federal health care law, "300,000 health plans canceled" in Florida.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/25/rick-scott/while-charlie-crist-says-obamacare-great-it-has-le/	A new TV attack ad against former Gov. Charlie Crist zeroes in on Crist’s support for Obamacare. Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, unveiled the ad March 24, 2014. Scott’s campaign said it will spend $2 million on the statewide ad set to start running March 27. The ad repeats snippets of Crist’s March 9 interview on CNN when he called Obamacare "great." "Great?" the narrator says. "News reports say 300,000 health plans canceled. Obama says patients may lose their doctors. The federal government says less work hours for American jobs," the narrator says, repeating Crist’s "great" comment. "Great, Charlie? Obamacare may have been great for Charlie’s political career, but it’s not great for the rest of us." Crist is a Republican turned independent who is now the Democratic frontrunner challenging Scott. There are a lot of claims about Obamacare in the ad, but we wanted to focus on one that has received considerable media attention in Florida: Were 300,000 health plans canceled? Florida Blue The ad flashed a picture of an October front page article in the St. Augustine Record about 300,000 plans from Florida’s version of Blue Cross Blue Shield, known as Florida Blue. In 2013, Florida Blue started sending letters to about 300,000 members that explained that the Affordable Care Act mandates that plans provide 10 categories of essential benefits. Some Florida Blue plans didn’t include those services, so those plans would be closed. But that didn’t mean those 300,000 members were stranded without insurance. The Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network obtained copies of letters received by Florida Blue consumers. The letters stated that due to the Affordable Care Act, the consumer’s particular plan "will be closed" and recommended another Florida Blue plan. "To help ensure that you have continuous health care coverage, you’ll be enrolled in this health plan effective Jan. 1, 2014, unless we hear from you by Nov. 1, 2013." The letters stated that consumers could choose a different Florida Blue plan. "We’ll help you find a plan that’s right for you," the letter stated. What happened to the 300,000? There’s more to the 300,000 number than the ad suggests. "It is important to note that the ‘300,000’ was a number that was being used when describing how many Florida Blue members could receive a notice that their policies would not be compliant with ACA requirements throughout all of 2014, if no extension was provided to these plans," spokesman Paul Kluding told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "In actuality, only 40,000 letters were mailed to members with Jan. 1, 2014, effective dates. Subsequent notices were sent to these members notifying them that their existing plans would remain active and unchanged through 2014." In November, Florida Blue announced it was giving policyholders another year to keep their coverage after President Barack Obama asked insurers to allow customers who wanted to keep the old plans to keep them for an additional year. "To date, most of the members in our pre-ACA plans have kept their plans," Kluding said. Former state Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, pointed to that decision by Obama and said, "few if any Floridians will lose their current health insurance policies." Florida Blue helped about 60,000 move to the exchange -- those were members who would benefit from moving to Obamacare plans either due to subsidies, the new coverage or premiums, Kluding said. If their income was below 400 percent of the poverty level (below about $94,200 for a family of four, for example), they would have gotten a subsidy to buy insurance on the federal marketplace. Some of these people may end up paying more but getting more robust coverage. It’s unclear how many, if any, would simply stop buying coverage altogether. But since Obama offered the extension, it’s too soon for us to conclude what will ultimately happen to the majority of the 300,000 Florida Blue members. This 300,000 number has become a political football with varying degrees of accuracy depending upon how it is worded. "Whether or not new plans are available (in some cases they are not and in others, as I said, they’re less desirable for consumers than those that were canceled), those policies were canceled as a result of Obamacare," Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair told PolitiFact in an email. "This is the central component to the ‘if you like your plan you can keep it’ falsehood, which I believe was rated ‘lie of the year’ by PolitiFact." The Republicans pointed to news articles from last fall after the initial news broke and before the extension. A Kaiser Health News article in October explained that while consumers were shocked by the cancellation notices, insurers were poised to place those with canceled policies on other plans. "By all accounts, the new policies will offer consumers better coverage, in some cases, for comparable cost -- especially after the inclusion of federal subsidies for those who qualify," the article stated. The AP article in early November stated that at least 3.5 million Americans had received cancellations but were being transition to other plans. Our ruling Scott's TV ad says, "300,000 health plans canceled," attributing the number to news reports. Last fall, Florida Blue started sending letters to 300,000 members stating that their plans didn’t comply with Obamacare and would be canceled. However, the ad omits key information here: Members were offered new plans that complied with the law. Obama later announced that people could keep their plans for another year and most of the Florida Blue members have kept their pre-Obamacare plans for now. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details, so we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-03-25T12:04:28	2014-03-24	['None']
pomt-14180	Says Sherwin-Williams is "making lead paint and poisoning people around the world."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/26/occupational-knowledge-international/online-petition-urges-sherwin-williams-stop-making/	Protesters demonstrated in front of the Cleveland headquarters of Sherwin-Williams on April 20, coinciding with the paint manufacturer’s annual shareholders’ meeting. "Covering the world with LEAD PAINT," one banner read. Months earlier, Occupational Knowledge International, a nongovernmental agency based in San Francisco, posted a Change.org petition calling on Sherwin-Williams and another paint company, PPG Industries, to stop using lead in their products. The headline to the petition reads, "Stop making lead paint and poisoning people around the world!" But the use of lead-based paint has been banned in the United States since 1978 because the element is a poisonous neurotoxin. It’s especially harmful to children, even at tiny levels of exposure. Could a U.S. company still be making paint containing lead? Unleaded, please The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the rules against lead-based paint. Because many pre-1978 homes and buildings still contain lead paint, the EPA also cracks down on improper renovation and demolition activity, because inadequate abatement can release lead particles into the air, soil and water. But the executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, Perry Gottesfeld, says American firms still make paint with lead. Reports suggest that global lead production is up more than 70 percent. The petition is aimed at protecting consumers around the world -- Occupational Knowledge International says that 2.5 billion people live in countries where lead paint is still sold for residential use. Many countries don’t have regulations concerning lead in paint. A 2014 article in the National Institute of Health’s publication, Environmental Health Perspectives, charts 40 countries worldwide where decorative paint containing lead is still sold. Sherwin-Williams director of corporate communications, Mike Conway, said the company does not produce lead-based paint intended for residential use anywhere in the world. That’s accurate. But Sherwin-Williams does have 16 licensees who produce and sell Sherwin-Williams branded paint overseas, in places like Haiti, Indonesia, Thailand, El Salvador, Peru, and Guatemala. Those licensees control what’s in their product, and sign agreements that their formulas will not contain lead, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. And in 2015, the Plain Dealer reported that "researchers from the University of Cincinnati and IPEN, an international non-governmental organization network, found lead at 360 times the acceptable limits in the Dutch Boy residential paint produced and sold by one of those licensees, Lebanon-based ChemiPaint." "We had one isolated case in Lebanon with a licensee who received a contaminated raw material from a Chinese supplier," Conway told PolitiFact. "When he mixed it into the batch, that caused the lead level to rise. We responded immediately and made sure they rectified the problem. No issues since then." Why lead in the first place If the downside is that it’s a poison, what’s the upside to using lead in paint? Tami Lasseter Clare, an associate professor of chemistry at Portland State University, said that it comes down to durability and cost. "Paint is composed of two things, the pigment and the binder," Clare said. "The pigment is the thing that gives it color and opacity, and the binder is the glue that sticks the pigment particles together." When lead is in its basic form, lead carbonate, it is a white mineral, making it a good pigment. But other stuff is white too, like zinc oxide, the white stuff in sunscreen, or titanium dioxide. Zinc is not as good at covering and hiding surfaces, Clare said, so titanium dioxide has become the main lead alternative. Titanium dioxide has hiding power, but the downside is its price, which fluctuates like crazy. "Major paint companies may be motivated to move away from materials having volatile prices to give better profit predictability," Clare said. But litigation is costly, too. In 2014, a judge in California ordered Sherwin-Williams and two other paint manufacturers to pay $1.15 billion into a fund for lead abatement, ruling that the companies created a public nuisance by promoting the use of lead paint in homes prior to 1978, while knowing the dangers it posed. The decision contained an excerpt from a Sherwin-Williams publication from 1900 that read, "It is also familiarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative poison, while zinc white is innocuous. It is true, therefore, that any paint is poisonous in proportion to the percentage of lead contained in it." The World Health Organization joined with the United Nations Environment Programme to form the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. Its objective is "to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead." Conway, Sherwin-Williams’ spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the company supports the global lead alliance program to eliminate lead in paint. The lead alliance’s goal for phasing out lead is gradual, and its first priority is to convince industry partners to stop using lead in decorative and residential paints that consumers buy off the shelf. There's another wrinkle to the paint debate. Sherwin-Williams also makes industrial coatings that are intended to be used only on outdoor metal surfaces such as cars and bridges. Sherwin-Williams does make industrial paint products that contain lead. Conway said the practice is not only legal but can be necessary to protect against corrosion. Gottesfeld wrote in Front Public Health that there are safer alternatives available for companies like Sherwin-Williams to use. The other paint manufacturer named in the petition, PPG International, held its shareholder meeting April 21, 2016, and the company’s CEO announced plans to eliminate lead from all PPG products by 2020. Our ruling Occupational Knowledge International, a group dedicated to eliminating lead paint, posted a petition on Change.org that says Sherwin-Williams is "making lead paint and poisoning people around the world." There is some truth to the claim but also some spin. Sherwin-Williams continues to make industrial paint products that contain lead, but those paints are exempt from the U.S. lead ban. Sherwin-Williams does not directly make or directly sell residential paint products that contain lead, but they have licensees who might. In one case, in Lebanon, Sherwin-Williams acknowledged a mistake that allowed lead into a residential paint product. Occupational Knowledge International’s claim about Sherwin-Williams is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. Clarification April 26: This story has been updated to clarify differences between paints intended for residential and industrial use, as well as the source of the claim that global lead paint production is up 70 percent. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01dd996a-61d3-4bee-9b14-9bb7c1e25372	None	Occupational Knowledge International	None	None	None	2016-04-26T10:00:00	2016-04-20	['None']
pomt-07772	"I campaigned on (the proposals in the budget repair bill for Wisconsin) all throughout the election. Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/22/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-he-campaigned-his-/	In the turbulent wake of his controversial plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has faced criticism that he gave no warning of such a dramatic plan during the long 2010 governor’s race. Walker has forcefully challenged that contention, most bluntly at a Feb. 21, 2011 news conference. A reporter asked if the move to limit union power was payback for pro-union moves made by Democrats in the past. "It’s not a tit for tat," Walker responded. "The simple matter is I campaigned on this all throughout the election. Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years." The statement echoed one at Feb. 17 news conference, in which Walker was even more emphatic that he campaigned on all the changes included in the entire budget-repair measure -- not just forcing employees to pay more for health and pension costs. Asked if he was "ramming through" the budget-repair bill, Walker said: "We introduced a measure last week, a measure I ran on during the campaign, a measure I talked about in November during the transition, a measure I talked about in December when we fought off the employee contracts, an idea I talked about in the inauguration, an idea I talked about in the state of the state. If anyone doesn't know what's coming, they've been asleep for the past two years." Now, we thought we were following the campaign pretty closely. It seemed to us like the first public hint Walker gave that he was considering eliminating many union bargaining rights was at a Dec. 7, 2010 Milwaukee Press Club forum, some four weeks after the election. So Walker’s claim he campaigned on all of this caught our attention -- and that of many readers, who have been e-mailing us asking us to check it out. There is no dispute that Walker campaigned on getting concessions on health and pension benefits from state employees. And, to be sure, that is an important part of the measure. But for Walker to be right, he has to be correct on the entirety of the plan. So we’ll look more deeply at the collective bargaining side of the equation, which has caused the ongoing firestorm in Madison. Here is a summary of the changes: For public employee unions except those covering public safety workers, the measure would narrow collective bargaining to wage issues, and only then within specific limits. It would end bargaining on such things as health care costs, pensions and working conditions -- rights granted to the public unions more than 50 years ago. Additionally: Wage increases would be limited to inflation or less. Employees would be able to opt out of paying union dues. An annual certification vote on the existence of each union would be required. And public employers would be barred from withholding union dues from worker’s paychecks. Walker’s proposal also repeals all rights to collective bargaining for more than 30,000 University of Wisconsin employees, something granted in 2009. For this item, we reviewed dozens of news accounts and various proposals on Walker’s campaign website to determine what he said about collective bargaining during the campaign. We talked to both campaigns in the governor’s race, and union officials. During the campaign, Walker prided himself on presenting many specific proposals to voters. Our Walk-O-Meter includes 60-plus specific promises. Indeed, his plans for the state Department of Natural Resources include at least seven specific elements, including appointment of a "whitetail deer trustee" to review deer counts. But nowhere in our search did we find any such detailed discussion of collective bargaining changes as sweeping as Walker proposed. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to provide evidence that Walker raised those issues during the campaign. "During the campaign he ran on giving local units of government the flexibility to manage their own budgets," Werwie said. "That is what he is continuing to say and do right now." He gave one example: a Walker proposal in July, 2010 to allow local units of government to switch from health plans that have high premiums to the state’s lower cost employee health plan. Walker’s camp said at the time that the switch would not have to be negotiated with unions; Walker would move to take the choice out of the collective bargaining process, they said. Labor officials disagreed and said they would fight attempts to change the collective bargaining law. Werwie also pointed to a campaign flier circulated by the American Federation of Teachers-Wisconsin, a union representing 17,000 public employees in the state. In addition to criticizing Walker comments on benefit cuts, the AFT flier notes a Walker comment about freeing up local governments from being "strangled" by mediation. And it points out his comment on the health plan switch he proposed in July -- the one that would take the choice of health plans off the table for unions. Both of those are part of collective bargaining and were discussed. But they are a far cry from what was proposed. For instance, during the campaign Walker talked about who controls the choice of health care providers. After the election he proposed eliminating any negotiations on the subject of health care. Walker’s campaign proposal on mediation and arbitration offers a similar contrast: He told the Appleton Post-Crescent in a lengthy question and answer session in 2009 that "you've got to free up local government officials to not be strangled by things like mediation and arbitration." As his website made clear, he was talking about a specific, significant change in teacher’s union arbitration -- not the dramatic changes on the table now. His current plan would largely eliminate the dispute-settling function of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission for all but public safety employees, according to Peter Davis, WERC’s general counsel. When it comes to the arbitration process, Davis characterized the changes Walker proposed in the campaign as a "hand grenade" and his proposal now as an "atom bomb." Another example: As the campaign rolled near a close, in late October 2010, Walker told the Oshkosh Northwestern that he would "ask all state workers" for wage and benefit concessions in the collective bargaining process. After the election, he proposed imposing concessions without negotiating and eliminating benefits as a topic of collective bargaining. Walker told the Oshkosh newspaper that if unions don’t give in on concessions, he would turn to furloughs to get cost savings. The use of furloughs was the approach taken by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a fairly typical cost-savings tactic. After the election, Walker said he wanted to avoid furloughs in favor of the concessions on health and pension costs, and wanted to limit bargaining to wages. Before the election Walker talked about seeking concessions in the context of face-to-face negotiations -- as in the Oshkosh Northwestern interview. He is moving to impose health and pension cost-sharing through legislation, without having taken his proposal to the unions. He once talked about expanding a statewide cost control system -- using collective bargaining -- beyond teachers to all state employees. But now he proposes an approach that would let individual municipalities set their own benefit levels -- with little input from unions. A reminder: We are not evaluating the merits of the proposal. Just what was discussed in the campaign. In October, as Walker held a steady lead in opinion polls over his Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, rumors circulated in union circles about Walker favoring a major power grab from unions. That’s according to Richard Abelson, who heads District Council 48 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which had negotiated with Walker for eight years in his position as Milwaukee County executive. Abelson, whose union endorsed Barrett, said: "We heard rumors he would remove pension and health as mandatory subjects of bargaining." But at that time, nothing so direct was publicly stated. Jeff Stone, a Republican state representative from Greendale, was the source of the notion, Abelson said. The two had a meeting as Stone laid the groundwork for a run for Walker’s soon-to-be-vacant county job. Stone confirmed for us that he told Abelson before the election he thought Walker might propose the bolder course. He said Walker told him nothing; he guessed it from Walker’s emphasis on cost cutting and the deficits plaguing the state budget. "This was the only way I could see he could do it," Stone said about balancing the state budget. But the sweep of Walker’s eventual proposal caught even Stone off guard. "Yeah, I was a little surprised (he put it all in)," Stone said. "But I also understand if you don’t control those things you will have trouble controlling costs." Abelson, the union leader, said Walker’s February announcement of his plan "went far beyond what anybody thought he would do. He didn’t talk about it during the campaign. If he had said that, some people who supported him would have had some second thoughts." Barrett’s campaign aide Gillian Morris also said they heard nothing in the campaign to suggest Walker would back sharp limits on union power -- and the repeal of all union rights for tens of thousands -- in his proposal. Bryan Kennedy, president of AFT-Wisconsin, the union that distributed the flier warning about Walker’s labor record, said he figured Walker would try to weaken collective bargaining and privatize a lot of state jobs. "But we were actually quite surprised by this," he said. Immediately after the election, in mid-November, Walker successfully lobbied lawmakers not to approve labor contracts negotiated under the Jim Doyle administration. Walker did not say he wanted to renegotiate them, nor did he say at that time that he had plans to lay aside those deals and impose changes without bargaining. Let’s sum up our research. Walker contends he clearly "campaigned on" his union bargaining plan. But Walker, who offered many specific proposals during the campaign, did not go public with even the bare-bones of his multi-faceted plans to sharply curb collective bargaining rights. He could not point to any statements where he did. We could find none either. While Walker often talked about employees paying more for pensions and health care, in his budget-repair bill he connected it to collective bargaining changes that were far different from his campaign rhetoric in terms of how far his plan goes and the way it would be accomplished. We rate his statement False. (Editor’s note: After this item was posted, a conversation surfaced between Walker and a person impersonating Walker campaign contributor and industrialist David Koch. In an audiotape released Feb. 23, 2011, Walker compares his union plan to a history-making act and portrayed his union plan as a "bomb." Walker aides acknowledge the tape is real, but say Walker simply was saying privately what he has said publicly about his budget-repair bill.

pomt-03656	"Over half" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students "receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/30/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-half-stem-graduate-degrees-given-/	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., recently cited one reason for overhauling the nation’s immigration system: Many of America’s young scientists these days aren’t American, and they need a way to become integrated into the U.S. economy. McCain made his case at an April 26, 2013, speech at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce summit titled "Reforming Immigration for a Better America." "I'll just very briefly mention, if a student graduates from a U.S. college with a science, technology, engineering (or) math degree and has an offer of employment ... they would be eligible to receive a green card to stay in this country" under the bipartisan legislation McCain supports. "I'm sure you are aware that over half of the students in the United States of America that are receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America. If they want to stay in this country, and they have a job, then we should be able to accommodate for that. It's obviously important for our economy." Is McCain correct that "over half" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students "receiving advanced degrees" aren’t U.S. citizens? We didn’t hear back from McCain’s office, but we were able to track down some data ourselves. We should begin by pointing out one caveat. The data we found -- statistics compiled by the National Science Foundation’s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics for 2009 -- divide degree earners into citizens and legal permanent residents on the one hand, and temporary residents (foreign nationals) on the other. So the data doesn't speak directly to McCain's formulation, which refers only to "citizens." However, since McCain referred to degree earners wanting "to stay in this country" -- something that permanent residents, like citizens, wouldn't have to worry about -- it seems reasonable to analyze his comment along the lines described by the NSF data. We should also note that there is sometimes a debate about what constitutes degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. PolitiFact Florida, for example, looked at whether anthropology is considered a STEM field and rated the claim that it was Half True. In an effort to most closely mirror McCain’s formulation, we looked at all advanced degrees (masters plus doctorates) in the fields of engineering and the natural sciences (which includes mathematics, but excludes the social sciences, such as anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology). Using this definition, 37 percent of students earning advanced degrees in 2009 were temporary residents; the rest were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The percentage of temporary residents is even lower -- 28 percent -- if you include the social sciences, which qualify under the NSF’s "science" category. Neither figure is over half. However, because certain subcategories of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (commonly known as STEM) have higher rates of foreign students, McCain would have been on safer ground if he’d phrased his claim more carefully. Here are some statistics for computer- and electronic-related fields: • Master’s degrees and doctorates granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 58 percent temporary residents • Master’s degrees granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 56 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in electrical engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in computer science in 2009: 54 percent temporary residents In general, temporary residents are more dominant in the pool of Ph.D.’s and less dominant in the pool of master’s degree earners: • Doctorates granted in all engineering fields in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in industrial engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in civil engineering in 2009: 61 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in materials engineering in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents • Doctorates granted in chemical engineering in 2009: 53 percent temporary residents Meanwhile, the predominance of temporary residents in these fields should remain for a while. Here’s data for current grad students (as of 2009) seeking a master’s or doctorate in STEM fields: • Graduate students in all engineering fields in 2009: 55 percent • Graduate students in electrical engineering in 2009: 74 percent • Graduate students in computer science in 2009: 65 percent • Graduate students in industrial engineering in 2009: 61 percent • Graduate students in materials engineering in 2009: 54 percent • Graduate students in chemical engineering in 2009: 51 percent Still, it’s important to remember some context: Doctorates in engineering and computer science account for a distinct minority of all graduate degrees in STEM fields. Once you factor in students seeking master’s degrees as well as students in other STEM subjects -- such as medical science, chemistry and physics -- the overall share of foreign students drops well below 50 percent. Our rating McCain said that "over half" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students "receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America." That’s actually incorrect -- the number is no higher than 37 percent. But McCain has a point that temporary residents account for over half of those earning degrees in many economically important fields, such as electrical engineering and computer science. We rate his claim Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2013-04-30T10:35:00	2013-04-26	['United_States']

pomt-10267	"We spent $3-million of your money to study the DNA of bears."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/john-mccain/mccains-bear-story-is-no-bull/	Railing against spending money on a bear DNA study in Montana has become a go-to line in John McCain’s stump speeches, a perfect example of the kind of wasteful federal spending that McCain has spoken out against for most of his career. McCain most recently tried the jab out before an audience of California evangelicals. "My friends, we spent $3-million of your money to study the DNA of bears in Montana. Now I don’t know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue," he said to laughter from the crowd gathered at Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., on Aug. 16, 2008, "but the point is, it was $3-million of your money." The U.S. Geological Survey is indeed conducting a study that involves the DNA of bears in Montana, but the Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project actually has received more earmarked funding than McCain mentions — to the tune of $4.8-million, according to Katherine C. Kendall, the researcher in charge of the study. The study had received $3.1-million in earmarked money by 2003, the year McCain first started taking aim at the project (he mentioned it on the Senate floor as part of a speech criticizing earmarks). But apparently McCain's campaign rhetoric hasn't been updated to reflect the additional $1.69-million the study's gotten since 2003. And, strictly speaking, the point of the project isn't really to analyze the bears' DNA, it's to use their DNA as a census-taker. The researchers collect hair left when the grizzlies scratch themselves on trees, then use DNA extracted from the hair to identify individual bears. This helps researchers count the number of grizzlies that live in Montana, considered one of the last strongholds of this endangered species. Kendall said it's a much cheaper — and safer — way to count them than traditional methods, which involve capturing grizzly bears and saddling them with satellite collars. It also has resulted in doubling the previous population estimates. The new figures, when paired with the results of another study on population trends, may eventually lead to removing grizzlies from the endangered list. McCain's math is a little dated. And he clearly is suggesting "the study of bear DNA" is a frivolous use of federal money, but we won't argue the merits of the project. McCain claims $3-million in federal money has been used to study the DNA of bears, and that's Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-25T00:00:00	2008-08-16	['None']

pomt-03794	"This (parent trigger) legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton’s top advisers."	false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/27/carlos-trujillo/carlos-trujillo-says-top-advisers-bill-clinton-and/	Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, says he doesn’t know why his "parent trigger" bill is creating a partisan fight in the Capitol. Yes, it’s supported by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, but it’s also popular with supporters of President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, he said. "This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton’s top advisers," he said on March 18, 2013, during the House Education Committee hearing on his bill. "Gov. Bush is a big supporter of this, so it’s not a partisan issue. I’m not sure why it’s turned into that." We wondered if Trujillo was right about the roots of the parent trigger bill. Did state Democrats miss the bipartisanship memo? The bill in question is HB 867, "Parent Empowerment in Education." The law allows parents at failing schools to demand changes, including asking for public schools to be turned into charter schools. Opponents say this power already exists under state and federal law, and teachers unions don’t like that public schools could be turned into charter schools. Supporters, like Bush’s Foundation for Florida’s Future, said it gives parents at those schools a "legal seat at the table" in turning around a school. California became the first state with a parent trigger law in 2010, and states including Texas and Indiana have followed in its footsteps. The nonprofit group Parent Revolution launched the California initiative and is supporting Trujillo’s bill. Asked to support the claim, Trujillo’s legislative aide Alex Miranda pointed us to the executive director of Parent Revolution, Ben Austin. Austin played a role in drafting the original California legislation, which was introduced by California Democratic Sen. Gloria Romero. That legislation was used as a model for Florida. Austin’s online biography says he has worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns and inside Clinton’s White House "in a variety of roles." Plus, he was "an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign," the website states. We asked Parent Revolution for more details about Austin’s working relationship with the presidents, as well as seven other board members and staffers whose bios included Obama or Clinton ties. Parent Revolution spokesman David Phelps told us the group designed California’s legislation to help that state qualify for a grant under Obama’s Race to the Top initiative. But he also said "the usual political definition of ‘top adviser’ " would not apply to their board members and staff. "President Obama has spoken frequently (as has Education Secretary Duncan) about the need for parents to be full partners in the decision-making process around their children's education," Phelps said. "Parent trigger and our work at Parent Revolution is a proactive response to those Obama administration calls." Phelps was not aware of Obama or Clinton publicly endorsing the measure. He also stressed that Florida is not using a carbon copy of California’s parent trigger law, as each state "has its own specific priorities and educational needs, and state legislators write bills accordingly." We caught up with Pat DeTemple, Parent Revolution senior strategist. DeTemple winced a little when we told him Trujillo’s statement. "I don’t want to speak for Rep. Trujillo," he said. He touched on Austin’s "political" role in Clinton’s White House and ticked off a series of Austin’s Democratic credentials. Okay, but does that make him a top adviser to either Clinton or Obama? "No, no," DeTemple said. "I was a general election director for Barack, and I was not a top adviser to him either, you know? Still, Trujillo has a point about the law attracting national Democratic support, even if Florida Democrats aren’t into it, DeTemple said. He pointed to Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as examples of high-profile Democrats who support the concept, as well as Obama's former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Opponents of the parent trigger movement, such as Orlando parent advocacy group Fund Education Now, say talking up liberal credentials is an attempt by supporters of parent trigger "to blur political lines and to declare support from Democrats for this conservative free-market effort." Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now, stressed the parent trigger law was picked up as model legislation by the conservative, pro-business advocacy group American Legislative Exchange Council after California’s parent trigger law survived a legal challenge. She called Trujillo’s Clinton/Obama claim an overreach. "Ben Austin and Mike Trujillo each worked on Obama and Clinton campaigns," she said. "That does not mean that Obama asked to have the trigger law written, or that he supports it." Our ruling In trying to persuade Democrats to support his parent trigger bill, Trujillo said, "This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton’s top advisers." He makes it sound as if the legislation were written in the West Wing. Parent groups, unions and activists may disagree vehemently on the bill, but they sound in agreement on one thing: The concept was not drafted by "top advisers" to Clinton and Obama. The people who had a hand in creating the legislation would more accurately be described as supporters of Obama and Clinton, not "top advisers." We rate his statement False.

pomt-07336	The Bush tax cuts "created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-bush-tax-cuts-created-8-million-/	During an interview on NBC’s Today show, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, offered some job-creation statistics to cast a favorable light on the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. Host Matt Lauer said to Boehner, "You talk about creating jobs. When the Bush era tax cuts were passed in 2001, unemployment in this country was 4.5 percent. Today it's at 9 percent, just down from 10 percent. So why are the Bush era tax cuts creating jobs?" Boehner responded that the tax cuts "created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession." Several readers suggested that we check Boehner’s statistics. So we did. Boehner's statement actually has several problems. One is the question of whether the tax cuts actually caused the job growth; more on that later. First, we’ll point out something more basic -- that Boehner’s chronology is off. The first of the tax cuts was passed in June 2001, so we haven’t hit a full 10 years since the first cut was enacted, and we’re only about eight years past the enactment of the second round of cuts. We’ll give Boehner the most generous parameters possible -- from the signing of the first tax cut in June 2001 until the pre-recession employment peak, which came in January 2008. (When we contacted Boehner’s office, they confirmed that this is the comparison he had in mind.) We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. Here are the numbers: June 2001: 132,047,000 people employed January 2008: 137,996,000 people employed Increase during that six-and-a-half-year period: 5,949,000 people That’s roughly 6 million jobs -- significantly below the 8 million Boehner cited. Now let’s turn to the jobs lost during the recession. We once again calculated the numbers in the way most favorable to Boehner -- from the peak of employment (January 2008) to the lowest point (February 2010). Here are the figures: January 2008: 137,996,000 people employed February 2010: 129,246,000 people employed Decrease during the roughly two-year period: 8,750,000 people That’s almost 9 million jobs lost -- almost twice what Boehner had said on Today. What’s going on? When we reached Boehner’s office, spokesman Michael Steel provided a different set of numbers -- numbers that we determined were from a different set of BLS statistics, known as the Current Population Survey. The numbers from the CPS data are produced by a smaller survey of individuals and families. They are best known for producing the widely tracked national unemployment rate, but the data also include an estimate of the raw number of employed Americans, which is what Boehner used. Here are the CPS figures for the same periods we looked at above: June 2001: 136,873,000 people employed January 2008: 146,407,000 people employed Increase over about six and a half years: 9,534,000 people January 2008: 146,407,000 people employed February 2010: 138,698,000 people employed Decrease over about two years: 7,709,000 people So using the CPS figures, Boehner actually underestimated the jobs created after the passage of the Bush tax cuts, rather than overestimating them. And his number of jobs lost in the recession was closer to the CPS number than to the CES number. In other words, using one set of data, Boehner’s way off, and using another set, he’s closer. What gives? For the periods studied, the two data sets’ varying methodologies appear to have produced large differences in the number of jobs created and lost. While both statistics have their advantages and disadvantages, the CES numbers are "usually preferred when talking about job growth or loss," said Stacey Standish, a BLS spokeswoman. And there’s this problem: What if we had used Boehner's 10 year figure rather than the six-and-a-half-year upswing of jobs? Over the full 10 years, employment has actually fallen by more than 1 million jobs using CES numbers and risen by 2.8 million according to the CPS figures. Either way, both figures are well below the job gains Boehner touted for the full 10-year period. Meanwhile, there are other concerns beyond the statistics. While J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he feels both CES and CPS are valid measures, he wondered whether Boehner had oversold cause and effect. "The real issue is the statement that the Bush tax cuts ‘created’ these jobs," Foster said. "Would the economy have created no jobs during this period but for the tax cuts?" And Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, argues that "the more basic point is that under either measure of employment gain, the proportional rise in employment in the Bush Administration after passage of his initial tax cut was comparatively small." Burtless put together a comparison of recent two-term presidential administrations’ job growth over the equivalent period -- the 81 months starting in the June after the president’s inauguration. George W. Bush produced smaller job gains than most recent administrations regardless of which employment measure is used. Employment under Bush grew by 4.5 percent using CES and 7 percent using CPS, whereas employment grew by double digits under presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, and also under the combined eight-year administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, who finished Nixon's term after he resigned, and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Only under Eisenhower was job growth more sluggish than it was under George W. Bush, and even then, it was only the case using one of the two BLS statistics. (Burtless did not compare job growth during the administrations of George H.W. Bush or Jimmy Carter because they served only one term each.) Where does all this leave us? First, under the most common yardstick for measuring employment -- the CES data -- Boehner's claim is significantly overstated. Second, while Boehner is closer when using a different statistic, it’s only more accurate if he uses a time period much different than the one he stated in the interview. And third, his suggestion that the tax cuts are primarily responsible for subsequent job growth is contentious at best (and the job growth he points to is modest compared to previous administrations). So the numbers Boehner offers are accurate only with significant adjustments. Overall, we find his statement too flawed to give it a rating higher than False.

pomt-14736	"Our larger domestic threat is from racial supremacist groups."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/18/andre-carson/rep-carson-miscasts-racial-supremacists-greater-/	The fear of terrorism is at a 10-year high, and with the firebombing of a mosque in Southern California and other incidents, American Muslims worry about being targeted for their religion. One of two Muslims in Congress, Rep. André Carson, D-Ind., aimed to rebut the notion that American Muslims pose much of a risk. Carson said on ABC News’ This Week on Dec. 13 that one neo-Nazi group was using the recent San Bernardino shooting as a "call to action." "The rhetoric that we're seeing, it concerns me," Carson said. "I think most of our largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups. I’ve worked in counterterrorism; I know this to be a fact." But Carson's statement about "racial supremacist groups" posing a larger threat than jihadists isn't cleanly supported by the data that he cites. Carson spokeswoman Jessica Gail said Carson based his assessment on a range of information. "The congressman believes that when looking at relative membership numbers, hateful rhetoric, racially based hate crimes, and fatalities by right-wing organizations, it paints a picture of a larger threat to the safety of Americans and society as a whole," Gail said. Gail noted the FBI reported that in 2014, 47 percent of hate crimes were racially motivated. But hate crimes include a range of offenses. Violations such as vandalism and intimidation -- a racial slur for example -- represent over half of all hate crimes based on race. While both are bad, the average person wouldn't put them in the same category as an attack by an Islamic extremist. Gail also cited work by the New America Foundation, which keeps a running count of fatal attacks on U.S. soil by "homegrown extremists" (it does not count people who were injured in attacks but did not die). The foundation breaks the attacks down into two categories for comparison, "violent jihadist attacks" and "far right-wing attacks." As for what the latter category includes, the foundation's summaries of each fatal incident describe assailants motivated by anti-government or anti-abortion beliefs. (We've previously noted how conservatives have said the analysis wrongly attributed some of the killings to right-wing zealots when the ideological connection was weak.) Jihadists had killed 45 people as of mid December. Non-jihadist extremists, in the foundation’s view, claimed the lives of 48. The totals go back to just after the 9/11 attacks and include the recent deaths in San Bernadino, Calif., as well as those slain at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. David Sterman, who oversees the New American project, downplays the slight numerical edge attributed to far non-jihadist violence. "Future attacks could certainly change which category has killed more people," Sterman told us. "However, the crucial point is not which group has killed more in any particular moment, but that the threat from both streams of extremist thought is very similar in death toll despite a narrative that views jihadist terrorism as having been vastly more deadly inside the U.S." That might suggest that Carson was technically correct but perhaps overstated his case. However, Carson runs into trouble because he specified "racial supremacist groups." In the New American database, only about half of the murders committed by the non-jihadist extremists' side of the ledger were tied to anger directed against any race or ethnic group. Just as often, the killers had expressed anti-government or anti-abortion views. For example, according to the database, the slaying of two police officers in Louisiana in 2012 was committed by members of the Sovereign Citizens movement. Adherents believe that they are not bound by any law passed by the government. The Southern Policy Law Center reports that followers include many blacks. Sterman confirmed that race-based attacks are a subset of the total. Once we factor this in, the foundation’s data set does not provide support for Carson’s statement. Another measure of threat Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University took a different approach to gauging which groups present the biggest risk to the public. Charles Kurzman, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and David Schanzer, a public policy professor at Duke University, went to the law enforcement community. In early 2014, they surveyed nearly 400 law enforcement officers across the country. They asked them to compare the threats from al-Qaida-inspired extremism and an umbrella category for extremism that includes anti-government, racist, anti-capitalist and other motivations. By a 2-1 margin, the officers put the threat of other extremists over that of jihadists. About 74 percent ranked anti-government driven violence among their top three concerns, while a bit under 40 percent put al-Qaida related extremists in their top three. Kurzman told us these results would not support Carson’s statement because "we did not distinguish white supremacists from other forms of non-Islamic violent extremism in our June 2015 report." And he noted that further analysis, set to be released in 2016, shows that more law enforcement agencies rank al-Qaida-inspired violence as a higher risk than racist extremism by a margin of 39 percent to 24 percent. Our ruling Carson said that the nation’s largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups, adding that he knew this to be a fact. His spokeswoman said that is based on his compilation of various trends and reports. However, we could find no data to support the view that attacks driven by overtly racist beliefs cause more deaths or are seen by law enforcement as a greater risk than jihadist extremism.

pomt-07866	"For [GM] to pay back everything it owes, it would have to sell its shares at $143 a share . . . where the highest value of a General Motors share ever was $43, $44, $46, whatever the dollars were . . ."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/09/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renaccis-gm-stock-claim-crashes-accuracy/	In April 2010, General Motors announced it had paid back its government loans, in full and five years ahead of schedule. PolitiFact rated the claim as Half True. GM had squared its government loans, but loans were only a fraction of more than $52 billion that the U.S. Treasury had committed to GM through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Most of the government's GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the General Motors Co., the new company that emerged from bankruptcy. While several economists told PolitiFact the repayment was undeniably a sign of progress, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government would end up losing $34 billion in TARP money extended to the automotive industry and auto finance companies. The CBO didn't break out how much of that was tied to GM, but GM received the largest portion of the total $85 billion. By last fall, however, the Treasury Department had revised its loss on the bailout downward, to $17 billion. Treasury officials declared the bailout a success. But declarations of success, for the bailout or for GM, were not unanimous. "I'm not sure we can determine one year later that General Motors is successful," Rep. Jim Renacci said on the "Sound of Ideas" on WCPN 90.3 FM. He said, "I think that for the company to pay back everything it owes, it would have to sell its shares at $143 a share . . . where the highest value of a General Motors share ever was $43, $44, $46, whatever the dollars were..." PolitiFact Ohio asked the staff of the 16th District Republican about the underpinning of his numbers. They referred us to a blog posting that cited an analysis from last August by CNBC auto reporter Phil LeBeau, "which states that for the federal government to recover its current net TARP outlays of $43 billion, each (GM) share would have to yield about $143 for the government to be repaid." That figure was cited by other reporters, too, about that time, as GM filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock that was projected for October. But events overtook the $143 estimate. GM kept altering several factors in its IPO, and by the time it occurred last November, analysts listed a payback figure in the low $50 range. (By then, CNBC had taken down the LeBeau’s posted analysis from its website.) The government sold part of its 61 percent stake in GM during the IPO in November, raising $13.5 billion and reducing its share in the company to 33 percent. Treasury also swapped some secondary shares, bringing in another $2.1 billion. Technically -- and it's an important financial distinction to make -- the automaker does not owe the government anything. GM repaid the government by giving it the bulk of its stock -- leaving it up to Treasury to get a good return on investment. Given the rest of his statement, we think Renacci was talking about the government breaking even on that investment, not GM repaying the government. The government’s stake in GM stands at $26.4 billion. Divide that by Treasury's 500 million stock shares and you get about $53 a share -- the price Treasury would have get to break even on the bailout. The Congressional Oversight Panel lists the break-even price as $54.28. Renacci's staff told us that the record high for GM shares was $40.85, even lower than the congressman stated, in 1999. But according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, and according to the oversight panel, GM's peak stock price was above $93 in April 2000. Those figures are for the old GM that sought bankruptcy protection and reorganized. Stock prices for the new General Motors Co. closed at $36.70 on Feb. 7. The senior Treasury official who oversees TARP told the Congressional Oversight Committee that the government hopes to sell the rest of its stake in GM within the next two years. Financier Steven Rattner, who was dubbed the administration's "car czar" as head of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, thinks taxpayers still could break even if Treasury is a little patient" and holds its stock longer. Selling the stock at recent non-peak levels, the government would lose around $7 billion on the entire GM bailout. So where does that leave us? Renacci relied on an outdated projection of the stock price needed for the government to fully recover its assistance to GM. The "break-even" price really is much closer to the current stock price than were initial projections. And Treasury's current loss level of $7 billion is less than half the $17 billion projected by Treasury last fall, when it declared the bailout a success. And the congressman is way off the mark with his citation of GM’s highest-ever stock price. Whether the new GM can be viewed as successful is a point we leave up for debate. But as to Renacci’s claim about GM stock and the government recouping its TARP investment, we rate the statement False.

pomt-09295	"We actually have not required in this law that you carry health insurance."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/22/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-health-care-law-doesnt-requ/	One of the most controversial elements of the recently passed health care law -- indeed, it has prompted lawsuits by state attorneys general, including Bill McCollum of Florida -- is a provision that tries to corral uninsured Americans into health plans. In a Jan. 19, 2010, news release, McCollum -- echoing the complaints of many fellow Republicans -- said that "Congress's unprecedented mandate on every citizen to purchase health insurance coverage or to face a penalty raises serious constitutional concerns. The health care individual mandate provisions as currently drafted violate constitutional principles and lack constitutional authority for Congress to enact." But some supporters of the bill object to the characterization of the new law as including an "individual mandate" to buy health insurance. One of the most forceful proponents of this view is U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from South Florida. At an April 5, 2010, town hall meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., an attendee asked, "Congresswoman, who gave you the right or the authority to determine whether or not I have to purchase health care?" Wasserman Schultz responded, "That's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. We actually have not required in this law that you carry health insurance. Let me explain what we did: What we did is that, just like when you're treated, that we categorize you differently in terms of your tax return when you're married versus single, just like we categorize you differently when you are a homeowner versus someone who doesn't own a home, just like we categorize you differently when you have children versus not having children -- what we are doing is you will be in a different tax status if you carry insurance versus not carrying health insurance. So you can feel free to choose not to carry health insurance. That's just going to be reflected in the tax category that you're in on your tax return. But there is no requirement in this law that you must carry health insurance." Clearly, there's a huge gap between what McCollum believes and what Wasserman Schultz believes. In fact, the two camps don't even agree on the terminology. Health care experts have traditionally called the provision an "individual mandate." Critics of the bill tend to use this term as well. But the official term written into the bill is a "shared responsibility payment" -- a euphemism that downplays how mandatory the payment is. Confusing matters further is that the bill includes provisions that are contradictory, in spirit if not in letter. Section 5000A is titled, "Requirement to Maintain Minimum Essential Coverage." It reads, "An applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage for such month. ... In general, if an applicable individual fails to meet the requirement ... for one or more months during any calendar year beginning after 2013, then, except (for hardship cases) there is hereby imposed a penalty" on a predetermined schedule. So except for people who are exempt -- those for whom insurance premiums would be a financial hardship, Americans with religious objections, American Indians, undocumented immigrants and prison inmates -- this section of the law uses the word "requirement" twice and "shall" once. That sounds like a mandate to us. Not so fast, says Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz. He cites two other provisions that would undercut the notion that the law imposes a mandate. The law also includes a section titled, "Prohibition Against Compelled Enrollment," referring to the newly created health care exchanges -- the virtual marketplaces where uninsured Americans and those without affordable insurance, starting in 2014, can go to buy a health plan. "Nothing in this title," the section says, "shall be construed to compel an individual to enroll in a qualified health plan or to participate in an exchange." In a separate passage titled, "Freedom Not to Participate in Federal Health Insurance Programs," the law says that "no individual ... shall be required to participate in any federal health insurance program created under this act (or any amendments made by this act), or in any federal health insurance program expanded by this act (or any such amendments)...." So, even as the bill talks of a "requirement" to obtain health insurance, it also issues a "prohibition against compelled enrollment" and a guarantee of "freedom not to participate in federal health insurance programs." What to believe? Essentially, it comes down to the eye of the beholder. The mechanism for enforcing the policy is the tax code. Indeed, the formula on how the penalties will be levied is defined in a way that only a tax accountant could love. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation summary of the law, "those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income. The penalty will be phased in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment." Got that? Some health care experts suggest that the tax penalties are not high enough to push uninsured Americans into health plans. The experts suspect that many people will opt to pay a modest penalty rather than pay for coverage. So there is indeed an opt-out. But it's a matter of interpretation whether you consider that more like a tobacco tax (in which the government uses taxes to to advance the policy goal of reducing smoking but stops short of using law enforcement to compel people to do so) or like a requirement for car insurance. For this reason, we don't think Wasserman Schultz's comment merits a False. But we also find that it's a significant exaggeration because she ignores what many people would reasonably describe as a mandate. Using government power to enroll people in health plans has never been a trivial part of the reform effort; it's always been central to the goal of getting more healthy people to pay into the system. When House Democrats first introduced their health care bill, the summary they released said, "All individuals would be required to get coverage, either through their employer or the exchange, or pay a penalty." While the summary cites the availability of subsidy assistance, it says nothing about ways to get around the requirement. The White House's own website explains that the law "asks everyone to take responsibility for improving America's health care. In order to lower costs for all Americans and extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, all Americans who can afford to purchase insurance will be asked to." And at the Blair House health care summit on Feb. 25, 2010, President Barack Obama acknowledged that when he ran in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, he was "opposed" to the individual mandate. But he added that he was later "dragged, kicking and screaming, to the conclusion that I arrived at, which is, is that it makes sense for us to have everybody purchase insurance." So, critics of the bill are not dreaming when they say that the individual mandate, by whatever name you prefer to call it, has always been a key part of the Democrats' health care reform push. Like many complex laws, the health care bill is sometimes contradictory, a reality that has fed confusion over what the newly enacted measure would actually do. We believe that on a technical level, Wasserman Schultz is correct -- Americans are "not required" under the law to carry health insurance. But her statement is still misleading. The bill's supporters may have been loath to remind voters about the individual mandate for understandable political reasons, but the notion of a "shared responsibility" to obtain health insurance has always been a publicly acknowledged part of the Democratic approach to overhauling health care. Wasserman Schultz's comment strikes us as a too-cute attempt to spin the bill in the wake of attacks by the bill's critics. We rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01436	"We have four combat-ready brigades out of 40 in the U.S. Army."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/06/dick-cheney/cheney-army-has-just-4-combat-ready-brigades/	There is no question that the Pentagon is spending millions of dollars in the effort to destroy the forces of the Islamic State group. By one estimate, fielding 2,000 troops in Iraq and maintaining a moderate level of airstrikes could cost between $200 million and $320 million per month. Former Vice President Dick Cheney warned that the military might not be up to the task that lies ahead. "The threat is increasing, and our capacity to deal with it is decreasing," Cheney said Sept. 24 on Fox News’ Hannity. "Because of what's happening to the U.S. military, the massive reductions in the budget, (and) the fact that we have four combat-ready brigades out of 40 in the U.S. Army." The next day, Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, said on MSNBC that Cheney’s figures weren’t correct. We decided to take a closer look at Cheney’s claim about the number of combat-ready brigades, largely because it can be difficult to quantify what qualifies as a "massive" budget cut. While you might think that a tally of combat-ready brigades is a simple number to find, it is not. The initial response we got from Army public affairs staff was, "a unit's state of readiness is not publicly releasable information." That said, in June, Col. Dan Williams, a senior planner for the Army’s Force Command, was interviewed on the status of a plan to increase the number of combat-ready brigades to seven by the end of the summer. "The concept, as originally briefed, was implemented, and we’re already there, but we also expanded it," Williams told the Air Force Times. "As funds have become available, we’ve been able to expand and get a more robust capability." A member of the Army public affairs staff confirmed that at the time of that interview, the Army indeed had seven combat-ready brigades and that the situation had improved since then. "Funding was restored, which allowed the Army to move away from budget prioritization and return to its normal readiness model," the spokesman said. The operational unit for the Army is a Brigade Combat Team, about 2,500 to 4,000 soldiers who bring a blend of fighting power and support functions that allow the brigade to operate on its own. For the Army, consistent training is a key piece of the puzzle to make sure that everyone in a team knows how to work together. In March 2013, sequestration -- the automatic budget cuts that kicked in when Congress failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan -- disrupted the Army’s training program. But in December of that year, Congress gave the Pentagon sequestration relief, hiking its budget by more than $22 billion in fiscal year 2014 and more than $9 billion in 2015. In the words of an Army public affairs staffer, that move "allowed the Army to buy back readiness. We haven't had to cancel any Combat Training Center rotations this year. So, readiness is stable." There might be some wrinkles in this picture. In March, Army vice chief of staff Gen. John Campbell told the Senate Armed Services Committee that not every unit has had the time to do all the training the Army would like. Campbell said some teams come into the Combat Training Center "at a low level of proficiency and cannot maximize this training event." But that seems like a nuance that doesn’t detract from the conclusion that the Army has at least seven combat-ready brigades, and maybe more, available for contingencies. That means Cheney is off the mark in his claim. Definition of 'combat-ready' doesn't matter As we researched this claim, we came across the particular way the Army uses the term "combat-ready." Technically, "combat-ready" excludes brigades that are already deployed. That means that even more troops are likely trained and prepared to fight than Cheney is letting on. (Cheney didn't return our requests for comment.) "If a unit is deployed, it's not ready," said Russell Rumbaugh, a senior associate at the Stimson Center, a think tank that focuses on broader defense issues. "Including if it's in Korea staring down the North Korean Army. Many people would probably call that a ready brigade. But since its not available for deployment elsewhere, the Army doesn’t consider it ready." The Army told PunditFact it has a total of 38 Combat Brigade Teams and of those, four are currently deployed. Col. Leonard Wong, a research professor at the Army War College, said in a pragmatic sense, a brigade’s deployment status might not be so critical. "The Army deployed brigades from Korea into Iraq, so I don't think that being forward-deployed means that the unit is not combat-ready," Wong said. "Actually, it doesn't make sense for a forward-deployed unit to not be combat-ready. A unit needs the right type of equipment, leaders, personnel, and training to be combat-ready." One final note: While Congress granted the defense department additional money, Army leaders express concern that readiness will suffer if new funds aren’t allocated in 2016 and beyond. Our ruling Cheney said that the Army has only four combat-ready brigades out of 40. While we don't have precise numbers, Army staff said there were seven combat-ready brigades in June, and that the situation has improved since then. Overall, there are 38 brigades not 40 as Cheney said. Making some allowance for shifting numbers, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14639	Says his views on reparations for slavery are the same as Barack Obama's and Hillary Clinton's.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-sanders/reparations-for-slavery-sanders-obama-clinton/	From single-payer health care to free college tuition for all, Bernie Sanders’ policy proposals have been both dismissed and lauded as radical. But when it comes to reparations for slavery, some fault the Vermont senator and presidential candidate for holding a more conventional view. Sanders’ opposition to reparations has been the subject of some controversy after Ta-Nehisi Coates called him out in The Atlantic, writing, "Unfortunately, Sanders’s radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy. What he proposes in lieu of reparations — job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education — is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy." Meet the Press host Chuck Todd followed up with Sanders about Coates’ column Jan. 24, asking, "Why aren't you for reparations because of slavery for African-Americans when you're calling for economic justice on so many other levels? Why do you stop short on that issue?" "Well, for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has," Sanders responded. "And that is, it is absolutely wrong and unacceptable that we have so much poverty in this country and it is even worse in the African-American community." Todd chided Sanders for not answering the question, but Sanders again deflected that it was for the same reasons as Obama and Clinton. Is it true that his position against reparations is the same as Clinton and Obama’s views? Sanders is right that Obama’s opposition echoes his own. (Coates calls this the conventional Democratic philosophy of "a rising tide lifts all boats.") Clinton’s stance is less direct but largely follows the same rationale. Sanders’ case against reparations First, let’s explain why Sanders is opposed to reparations for African-Americans. When first asked about the issue by Fusion at the Jan. 11 Iowa Brown & Black Democratic Forum, Sanders stressed the political impracticability and polarizing nature of the proposal, and suggested prioritizing current economic inequality in lieu of compensating for past injustices. "First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do. "So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino." On Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities. So how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton? Obama’s opposition In 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future. "I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools," Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate. Obama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire. He said that "nothing, including reparations, can fully compensate" for the stain of slavery before arguing that reparations could lead to negligence on other matters of racial injustices: "I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we’ve paid our debt' and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty. "These challenges will not go away with reparations. So while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems – and building a consensus to do just that." Obama explains he will not pursue reparations because the action could be used as an excuse not to work on other lingering problems for minorities. Here, Obama’s comments sound different from Sanders’. Sanders and Obama sound more aligned in these comments by Obama from July 2008, which both Obama and the Sanders campaign pointed out: "You know, I have said in the past — and I'll repeat again — that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed. "And, you know, I think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done, that, I think, is the best strategy. "You know, the fact is, is that dealing with some of the — some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars. And we're not going to be able to have that kind of resource allocation unless all Americans feel that they are invested in making this stuff happen. "And so, you know, I'm much more interested in talking about, how do we get every child to learn? How do we get every person health care? How do we make sure that everybody has a job? How do we make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect? "And if we have a program, for example, of universal health care, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because they're disproportionately uninsured. If we've got an agenda that says every child in America should get -- should be able to go to college, regardless of income, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because it's oftentimes our children who can't afford to go to college." Obama, as far as we can tell through searching Nexis, has not changed or revisited his stance on reparations since 2008. Clinton’s position Clinton’s recent and past comments suggest her ideas for helping the black community are no different from Sanders’ and Obama’s. Clinton didn’t directly answer the question about reparations at the Iowa Brown & Black Forum, but she also suggested investing in black communities and addressing poverty: "I think we should start studying what investments we need to make in communities to help individuals and families and communities move forward. And I am absolutely committed to that. There are some good ideas out there. There’s an idea in the Congressional Black Caucus about really targeting federal dollars to communities that have had either disinvestment or no investment, and have had years of being below the poverty level. That’s the kind of thing I’d like us to focus on and really help lift people up." In October 2015, she provided a similar response when asked by the hosts of the BuzzFeed podcast "Another Round": "I’ll tell you what, I think we need to make many more investments in everything from pre-school education to affordable housing, that’s my form of trying to give people the chance to be empowered, to make the most out of their God-given potential." As Fusion pointed out, this was largely Clinton’s answer in 2000 as well. When she was asked about reparations during her Senate campaign, she said African-Americans deserve an apology for slavery before pivoting to economic conditions. "But I think that the people I know and the people I work with want us to stay focused on the future, keep our economy going, keep providing good public education, quality affordable health care — do the things that will enable people to have the best futures for themselves, and that’s what I’m committed to doing." Our ruling Sanders said he opposes reparations "for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has." The reason, he said, is the need to focus instead on addressing current economic problems in the black community by improving education, providing jobs and addressing poverty. That is basically what Obama and Clinton has suggested in lieu of reparations. It’s worth noting that Sanders previously suggested that reparations were politically impractical and divisive. Obama and Clinton have not made comments to this effect. In 2007, Obama said reparations could be used an excuse not to do more for African-Americans. We rate Sanders' claim Mostly True.

pomt-05041	"Bill Nelson was the deciding vote" on the health care law.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/another-outside-group-says-bill-nelson-was-decidin/	Yet another conservative outside spending group is targeting Florida’s Democratic incumbent, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, with distorted claims about the health care law. This time, the group is called American Commitment. The ad claims to have "the facts," but then trots out several distortions we’ve already debunked. "Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law," the ad says. "Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law." On its website, American Commitment says it supports "free markets, economic growth, Constitutionally-limited government, property rights, and individual freedom" and advertises connections to other conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity. It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.) We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back. Here, we’re going to look at whether Nelson was the deciding vote. We fact-checked this statement in June 2012 when another outside spending group made the same charge. We've also fact-checked the ad's statement that the law was the largest tax increase in history on the middle class. We rated that Pants on Fire. And, we've previously looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False). The 2009 health care vote There’s no doubt that the health care law was passed with several very close votes. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.) Nelson was among the 60 senators who voted for the bill to go forward. Opponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill. We find that argument unpersuasive, because there’s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others. As we noted before, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn’t one of them. One of the detailed reports we’ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the Los Angeles Times. According to its report, some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. According to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., "knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward." At the meeting, Reid turned to Nelson of Nebraska, who also "had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal." Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to persuade Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade. "Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience," the Los Angeles Times reported. "And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md." There was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be able to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection. But he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted. We found several other news articles that focused on Nebraska's Nelson as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. He announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final bill. The Nebraska senator told CNN in December 2009: "I couldn’t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. … If you think it’s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it’s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?" Ben Nelson is retiring and not running for re-election. Bill Nelson’s role In the summer of 2009, Florida’s Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about Medicare Advantage and Medicare drug benefits. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a "starting point." "There are serious issues to be resolved," Nelson said in a speech on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. "This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans." In October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a "good start." In November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: "If we don't do something about health care, it's going to run our country into bankruptcy." The Orlando Sentinel described him as an "enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation." After the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson’s office issued a press release in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation’s "flaws" -- including that it didn’t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it. "Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday," stated Nelson’s press release. When we fact-checked this claim previously, Nelson Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact Florida in an email: "There’s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the ‘deciding vote.’ And there’s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote -- when he didn’t. Nelson didn’t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage." Our ruling American Commitment says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the "deciding vote" for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson's vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the "deciding vote" suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that’s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	American Commitment	None	None	None	2012-07-11T10:59:43	2012-07-10	['None']
pomt-07693	"Under the clear letter of the law, (Justice Clarence Thomas) must recuse himself" from the case challenging the constitutionality of the health care law.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/07/anthony-weiner/rep-anthony-weiner-law-clear-clarence-thoma/	A recent Fox News interview of Rep. Anthony Weiner was compelling TV -- if you enjoy political sparring. The New York Democrat argued that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas must recuse himself from the case challenging the constitutionality of the health care law because his wife, Virginia, made more than $700,000 working for groups that oppose the law. In the interview with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, there were feisty exchanges back and forth, and lots of cross talk. It ended with Weiner's sarcastic kicker, "Great interview. Aces." But in between, the two sparred on a couple of important issues that are sure to be debated as lawsuits over the health care law make their way to the Supreme Court. The court's vote is likely to be close, so if any justices were to recuse themselves, it could decide the case. In this item, we're focusing on Weiner's argument that Justice Thomas must recuse himself. Here's some of Weiner's back and forth with Kelly: "What it comes down to is a pretty clear federal law that requires judges and justices to recuse themselves whenever there is … an appearance of any bias in the case," Weiner said. The law, he said, "has certain categories where you must recuse yourself, and one of them is if you or your household, your spouse has any financial interest in the outcome. And we found out recently that Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Justice Thomas, has received more than $700,000 from organizations whose existence is based on making sure the health care law is ruled unconstitutional." Indeed, federal tax records show Virginia Thomas earned nearly $700,000 between 2003 and 2007 as a liaison between the conservative Heritage Foundation and George W. Bush's White House. Heritage has advocated strongly against the health care law passed by Democrats in 2010, and has consistently called for its full repeal (though Thomas obviously left Heritage before the law passed). In addition, she helped organize Liberty Central, a conservative advocacy group that argues the health law will discourage hiring and drive up health costs. Weiner added that "It got worse over the weekend because Justice Thomas basically said he agreed with his wife." The congressman is referring to comments from Thomas, speaking to a conservative group, in which he said that his wife was involved in organizations "in defense of liberty" and that "we believe in the same things, we are focused on defending liberty." "So now it's pretty clear he's stated his bias in this case before it's reached him," Weiner said. "And under the clear letter of the law, he must recuse himself." Kelly said Supreme Court experts she spoke with -- including some on the left -- told her that "having any sort of professional interest in a case, as his wife arguably does, is not grounds for recusal." "It'd be a different thing," she said, "if Clarence Thomas himself had stock in some company that was being affected. But they say this is not that." Said Weiner: "I'll read you from U.S. Title 28: 'Any justice must disqualify himself in any of the following circumstances: he individually, or his spouse, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy.' " Our fact-check here is Weiner's claim, "Under the clear letter of the law, (Justice Clarence Thomas) must recuse himself." Let's start with the section of U.S. Title 28 cited by Weiner. Under Section 455, it states that "Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." It then lists specific circumstances under which justices should disqualify themselves. One of them, "He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding." One of the key phrases in there is "financial interest," which is defined later in the section as "ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party." Weiner's argument is that Virginia Thomas' work for a group that actively opposed the bill means she has a "financial interest" in the outcome, and that Justice Thomas must therefore recuse himself. But several legal experts we spoke to disagreed. Rex Perschbacher, a professor at University of California-Davis School of Law, said the law "applies to more direct financial interests than Mrs. Thomas’." "It would have to be a financial interest in a corporation that was itself before the court rather than someone employed by an organization with an interest in one of the outcomes," Perschbacher said. "A greater problem here is that Supreme Court Justices have always considered themselves the ultimate arbiters of their own disqualification or recusal, and they do not apply an evenhanded or uniform standard whether it comes to family members or bias or relatives who may be involved as lawyers in the cases before them," Perschbacher said. "The justices of the Supreme Court see themselves, with some reason, as unique among the federal judiciary such that statutes like 455 (applicable to all members of the federal judiciary) apply to them with less force than to the usual district or circuit judge." David Garrow, a professor at the University of Cambridge who follows the Supreme Court, and a self-described liberal Democrat, said, "Justice Thomas should not recuse himself, and the recent boomlet of contentions that he should, in this matter and/or others, because of Ginni's beliefs and work, is entirely unmerited." Weiner "is clearly wrong," said Washington, D.C., attorney Tom Goldstein, founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court. "The provision he cites about having a financial interest has always required something more direct," said Goldstein, who noted that he spoke to Fox's Kelly before the Weiner interview. "For example, a justice will recuse if he or she or a spouse owns stock in a company in the case. The justices also have a rule that they will recuse if a child has a financial interest – for example, the child is a lawyer in a firm in the case and the firm’s profits are affected by the case. So, the financial interest has to be in the litigation (as opposed to a general issue) and has to be much more direct than is true for Ginni Thomas." Paul F. Campos, professor at the University of Colorado Law School, agreed with Weiner that Thomas ought to recuse himself. He argues that Virginia Thomas has a "strong interest in the precise outcome of the litigation." "If the standard for recusal is, 'Does it look really bad?' I think it looks really bad," Campos said. But even Campos acknowledges that ultimately it "depends on the interpretation of direct financial interest. It's not a completely clear-cut case." Asked for backup for Weiner's claim that the law is clear, and that Justice Thomas must recuse himself, Dave Arnold, a spokesman for Weiner, pointed us toward comments made by several law experts who argued Thomas ought to recuse himself. One of them, Monroe H. Freedman, a Hofstra Law School professor specializing in legal ethics, told the New York Times that Justice Thomas ''should not be sitting on a case or reviewing a statute that his wife has lobbied for. If the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that creates a perception problem.'' Another was Steven Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University School of Law, who noted in a Chicago Tribune op-ed that Virginia Thomas founded Liberty Central, "an organization with strong ties to the tea party movement and whose Web site has demanded the repeal of 'ObamaCare,' which it has characterized as 'tyranny,'" "That alone will lead many observers to wonder whether Justice Thomas can maintain the appearance of impartiality when constitutional challenges reach his court," Lubet wrote. We called Lubet and asked whether the law was "clear" that Justice Thomas should recuse himself. "It's not," Lubet said. "First, I think it is not correct to say that he has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding." Having a wife who works for an advocacy group is not the same as having a financial interest in the outcome, he said. "If his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that's a much closer issue," Lubet said. "I wouldn't say it's clear, though. That's a matter of judgment." And ultimately, Lubet and other legal scholars said, it is Justice Thomas who will determine whether he ought to recuse himself. "Unfortunately, only Justice Thomas gets to vote on that question," Lubet said. "It's a one-man decision." Trevor Burrus, a legal associate at the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said Weiner's argument assumes Virginia Thomas would profit from the law being declared unconstitutional. "In fact," Burrrus stated, "there is a better case to be made that upholding the law would give his wife more 'business' in the future when as-applied challenges are brought against Obamacare." Our aim here is not to settle a dispute between legal scholars about the application of federal ethics laws. But Weiner said that "under the clear letter of the law, (Justice Clarence Thomas) must recuse himself." A legitimate legal argument can be mounted for that position. But that's all it would be, an argument. It is by no means "clear" under the letter of law that Justice Thomas must recuse himself. In fact, there is a great deal of disagreement among legal experts we spoke to that Virginia Thomas' previous jobs meet the definition of "financial interest" or whether it's enough to establish that Justice Thomas' "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." Weiner's statement suggests the letter of the law is clear cut in backing his position, and it is not. Even those who support Weiner's position allow that it boils down to a matter of interpretation. And so we rate Weiner's statement Half True.	None	Anthony Weiner	None	None	None	2011-03-07T18:34:22	2011-03-02	['None']

pomt-05093	President Obama's health care law is "a government takeover of healthcare."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/01/george-allen/george-allen-calls-health-care-law-government-take/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen has been a relentless critic of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, calling it "a government takeover of health care." He used that phrase in a radio commercial that ran just before his victory in the June 12 Republican Primary, during a June 15 speech in Washington to the Faith and Freedom Coalition and in a June 16 speech at the GOP state convention in Richmond. In each instance, he criticized his Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, for supporting the health care law and being an ally of the president. The Weekly Standard, in a June 25 article, wrote that Allen’s stump speech "always includes a dig at Obamacare -- which Allen describes as a ’government takeover of health care.’" We asked Allen’s campaign for the rationale behind the candidate’s "takeover" claim but did not receive an explanation. But the refrain has been used by Republicans and debunked by fact-checkers. Since Allen is using the claim regularly, we decided to review it again. There’s no question the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expands government regulation of health care. The law mandates that most Americans have health care insurance or pay a tax penalty. The U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld that provision on June 28 in a 5-4 opinion. The law prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on a person’s pre-existing health conditions and from imposing lifetime caps on an individual’s benefits. It increases eligibility for Medicaid, although the high court struck down the federal government’s ability to withhold funds from states that refuse to take part in the expansion. The act provides credits for people who can’t afford to purchase insurance. But the law does not create a "government takeover" of health care. Here’s why: *The government will not seize control of hospitals and other privately-run health care businesses. Doctors will not become government employees, as they are in Britain. *The law continues to rely on the private sector to provide health insurance for consumers. In fact, its coverage mandate will expand the number of people who buy private insurance policies. The act sets up exchanges where private companies will compete to insure people who don’t have policies. *Employer-based coverage through private insurance companies will continue. *The law does not contain a "public option" allowing the government to compete for business with private insurers. *It does not create a single-payer system, like in Canada, where medical payments are funded by a single insurance pool controlled by the government. PolitiFact has ruled past claims that the law is a government takeover as either False or Pants on Fire. In 2010, PolitiFact’s national team named the takeover claim the "Lie of the Year," saying it conjured images of socialized medical care. The Associated Press has also said the law "does not add up to a government takeover." The Washington Post Fact Checker column said the "government takeover" label is "simply not true." And FactCheck.org has said that the law will not lead to "government-run" health care. Drew Altman, president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation, came to the same conclusion in an August 2011 column entitled "Are we headed for a government takeover of Health Care?" Altman wrote that actuarial figures released that month from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show that the state and federal government share of health care spending was 45 percent in 2010 -- the year the law was signed. By 2020, that is expected to rise to 49 percent. "In other words, government’s share of national health spending, while unquestionably large, is not growing much at all, and even in 10 years it will be less than half of our country’s total health spending," Altman wrote. "Measured by the government’s share of health care spending, there is no sign of a government takeover of the health care system." The report, Altman said, demonstrated the nation’s health care system has been and will remain "a mixed public-private one." Our ruling Allen says that the health care reform law is a "government takeover of health care." Yes, the law increases regulation. But it greatly relies on the private sector to provide health care. Hospitals will not be taken over by the government, doctors will not become federal employees. The act relies on private insurers to compete and provide health care coverage to an expanded customer base. Employer-based coverage through private companies continues. The "government takeover of health care" is a potent political charge that does not hold up under examination. We rate Allen’s claim False.

pomt-10212	Palin "fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/chain-email/however-loyalty-was-the-overriding-issue/	A chain e-mail making the rounds claims to offer an insider's look at Sarah Palin during her days as mayor of Wasilla. The copy of the e-mail we've received is genuine. It was written by Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, a homemaker and longtime observer of Wasilla municipal government. Kilkenny makes numerous factual claims in her e-mail. ( Read it for yourself here. ) Here, we are checking her statement that Palin "fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her, she told the press." There is no doubt that Palin fired the top cop of Wasilla in early 1997, a few months after taking office. Multiple news reports and a federal lawsuit confirm this. The Anchorage Daily News reported that Palin delivered letters to Police Chief Irl Stambaugh and City Librarian Mary Ellen Emmons on Jan. 30, 1997, saying their employment with the city would end. The reports said Palin took the action because she felt the two did not fully support the changes that she wanted to make as the newly elected mayor. Both Stambaugh and Emmons had publicly supported Palin's political opponent, incumbent mayor John Stein, in the 1996 mayoral campaign, the reports noted. The day after notifying them of their dismissals, however, Palin changed her mind about the city librarian and allowed her to stay. She did not change her mind about Stambaugh, though. He decided to sue the city in federal court for wrongful termination. Palin wrote a memo to Stambaugh and his attorney on Feb. 7, 1997, outlining in greater specificity the reasons she fired Stambaugh. The memo, stamped "confidential," is part of the case file from the lawsuit, portions of which the Seattle Times posted online after Palin was named the Republican vice presidential nominee. Palin reiterates in the memo that she did not feel like she had Stambaugh's "full support" after working with him for 3 months. She outlined a number of instances in which he either disagreed with her or was reluctant to implement her directions. According to Palin's memo, Stambaugh refused to search his budget for areas to be cut. He also was reluctant to provide her with weekly memos on "positive things" that were happening in his department. He failed to tell her about a meeting that she had been expected to attend. He spoke with a "disrespectful and condescending" tone at staff meetings. "When I met you in private," Palin wrote, "instead of engaging in interactive conversation with me, you gave me short, uncommunicative answers and then you would sit there and stare at me in silence with a very stern look, like you were trying to intimidate me." Stambaugh's lawsuit was not successful, because the court found Palin had the right to terminate Stambaugh for any reason she wished. The e-mail says Palin "fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her, she told the press." Not all of Wasilla's press coverage from that time (particularly the archives of Wasilla's newspapaper The Frontiersman ) is available online, so we can't say for sure that Palin did or did not say that. Palin's memo from the lawsuit is convincing evidence that she felt Stambaugh tried to intimidate her. The main reason Palin fired Stambaugh appears to be for issues of loyalty and support, as outlined in her memo, but it also specifically mentions intimidation. We find the statement that Palin fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he 'intimidated' her to be Mostly True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-09-09T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['None']
pomt-14039	Says Donald Trump "has the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president."	false	/texas/statements/2016/may/27/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrectly-says-donald-trump-has-second-/	A dozen days before suspending his presidential candidacy, Sen. Ted Cruz charged Donald Trump with being the second-most disliked candidate for president, implying that only Hillary Clinton was worse off. The Texan's claim emerged in an online ad, "War Room," which was posted as Cruz scrambled unsuccessfully to best Trump in Kentucky’s April 2016 Republican presidential primary. The shadowy video purports to show the actress portraying Clinton huddling with nervous advisers who say first that Trump has considerable weaknesses. "He has the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president," an adviser says. Next, another pretend aide asks who has the highest (or worst) disapproval rating--and all eyes fall away. Of late, Trump and Clinton appear to be poised for a November showdown in the general election, representing the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. It’s also so that fresh polls including an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken in mid-May 2016 suggest each hopeful has high unfavorability ratings--giving the two unwelcome common ground. Regardless, we checked Cruz’s poll claim in part because whenever candidates tout polls, there’s a risk of obfuscation and oversimplification. For instance, this April we rated False Trump’s claim that his favorability numbers were higher than Ronald Reagan’s at the same time in 1980. Also in April, we rated Mostly False Cruz’s claim that "poll after poll" showed him beating Clinton one-on-one. So for recent history’s sake, we decided to see if Cruz was right pre-departure about Trump having the second-highest disapproval ratings among all presidential hopefuls. Cruz’s data In response to our query, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed data from a national poll released Feb. 18, 2016, by respected pollster Quinnipiac University, naming Clinton and Trump the least-favored candidates, respectively. The questionnaire asked 1,342 registered voters intended to represent the national electorate between February 10 and 15, 2016, whether their opinions of 11 candidates and politicians were favorable, unfavorable,or if they lacked the information to judge. Fifty-eight percent registered as "unfavorable" to Clinton, 57 percent said as much for Trump. Then again, the poll’s 2.7 percentage point margin of error means that Clinton’s lead on Trump for unfavorability was too close to call. We looked into other voter polls, finding -- in contrast to Cruz’s claim -- Trump uniformly viewed as the least liked candidate, counting Clinton and others still vying at the time of the respective polls. But first we heard back from Tim Malloy, assistant director of Quinnipiac Polls, who said in a phone interview that it’s "apples and oranges" to mix up polls that gauge voter impressions of candidates with those that check on whether they approve or disapprove of someone’s job performance. Favorability, Malloy said, rates people’s overall impression of candidates, including their character and personality. "It’s pretty much, ‘Do you like the person?’" he said. Approval ratings tie to how well people think someone has done a job. For example, Malloy said, at the end of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s years in that office, Giuliani had low favorability and high approval. People didn’t much like him, Malloy said, yet they thought he did a good job as mayor. Other data Now let’s turn to what other polls showed per the frontrunners’ favorable/unfavorable ratings at the time Cruz was still a candidate. Up to the debut of Cruz’s ad, the political poll aggregator RealClearPolitics had posted 59 polls rating Trump’s favorability, starting from a Quinnipiac poll taken in May 2015, weeks before he announced his candidacy. It had posted more than 200 polls rating Clinton’s favorability, starting from a Rasmussen poll taken in November 2012. As of May 25, 2016, the website’s aggregation of polls gave Clinton a net 56.3 percent unfavorable rating; Trump had a net 58 percent unfavorable rating. But that didn’t nail down the two candidates’ scores at the time Cruz aired his ad. For our part, we pulled the relevant results from 21 polls rating candidate favorability and listed by RealClearPolitics between the Feb. 18, 2016 publication of the Quinnipiac poll shared by the Cruz campaign and the April 21, 2016, debut of Cruz’s ad, also folding in the poll immediately before the Feb. 18 poll. Some of the 22 polls contacted registered voters while others surveyed likely voters. In each one, Trump had the highest disapproval ratings among candidates of either party; Clinton ran second to Trump in unfavorability in 18 polls. Presidential Candidates With Top Unfavorable Poll Ratings, February-April 2016 Poll Conducted (2016) Number polled Highest unfavorable rating Second-highest unfavorable rating Public Policy Polling Feb 2 - 3 1,236 Trump - 63 percent Bush - 54 percent Quinnipiac Feb 10 - 15 1,342 Clinton - 58 percent Trump - 57 percent Associated Press Feb 11 - 15 1,033 Trump - 58 percent Clinton - 51 percent NBC/WSJ Feb 14 - 16 800 Trump - 59 percent Clinton - 50 percent The Economist/YouGov Feb 24 - 27 2,000 Trump - 59 percent Bush - 57 percent CNN/ORC Feb 24 - 27 920 Trump - 60 percent Clinton - 55 percent Gallup Feb 26 - March 3 Trump - 63 percent Clinton - 53 percent WaPo/ABC March 3-6 1,000 Trump - 67 percent Clinton - 52 percent The Economist/YouGov March 10 - 12 2,000 Trump - 61 percent Clinton - 54 percent Monmouth University March 17-20 1,008 Trump - 60 percent Clinton - 51 percent CNN/ORC March 17-20 925 Trump - 67 percent Clinton - 56 percent CBS/NYT March 17-20 1,058 Trump - 57 percent Clinton - 52 percent Quinnipiac March 19-22 1,451 Trump - 61 percent Clinton - 56 percent Bloomberg March 19-22 1,000 Trump - 68 percent Clinton - 53 percent Fox News March 20 - 22 1,016 Trump - 65 percent Clinton - 58 percent Public Policy Polling March 24 - 26 1,083 Trump - 63 percent Clinton - 55 percent The Economist/YouGov March 26-29 2,000 Trump - 62 percent Clinton - 54 percent The Atlantic/PRRI March 30 - April 3 2,033 Trump - 70 percent Clinton - 54 percent AP/GfK March 31 - April 4 1,076 Trump - 69 percent Cruz - 59 percent The Economist/YouGov April 8 - 11 2,000 Trump - 63 percent Clinton - 56 percent NBC/WSJ April 10 - 14 1,000 Trump - 65 percent Clinton - 56 percent George Washington U. April 17-20 1,000 Trump - 65 percent Clinton - 56 percent SOURCE: RealClearPolitics The numbers show Trump all but once ranking No. 1 in unfavorable ratings. After Cruz suspended his campaign, we reached out to share this pattern and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Before bowing out for president, Cruz said Trump had the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone bidding for president. Not quite. A February 2016 poll showed Clinton with slightly worse ratings than Trump, who had the second-worst rating overall. But the unfavorability gap between Clinton and Trump also fell within the poll’s margin of error--and more than 20 other polls taken from February into April 2016 each showed Trump at No. 1 in disapproval.

pomt-05563	Sherrod Brown opposed blocking a new EPA emissions rule, "despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/05/josh-mandel/josh-mandels-campaign-says-sherrod-brown-balked-st/	Sometimes in politics, a string of independent facts and impressive words can be thrown together to reach a negative or menacing conclusion. One or more of the facts might even be true in a speculative context, even if they don’t add up when put together. There is an art to this, and it can be a beautiful thing. Such a claim crossed PolitiFact Ohio’s desk recently, and on its face it seemed plausible. The claim, from U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel, was in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement on March 27 that it was severely restricting greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Mandel, a Republican, is Ohio’s treasurer and hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. In a news release on March 29, Mandel’s campaign used the EPA announcement to say that "Senator Sherrod Brown voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio." The harm to Ohio was this, said Mandel’s communications director, Travis Considine, who issued the news release: "According to the Sierra Club, these cap-and-trade regulations will ultimately put an end to coal fired power plants. This policy change would have a particularly negative effect on Ohio energy rates, because coal accounts for 86 percent of Ohio's energy supply." It does sound bad, and being somewhat familiar with the ongoing battle over power plant regulation, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to learn more. We asked Considine for additional information, and asked Brown’s Senate office to respond. We also did some independent reporting. Mandel’s claim began to fall apart pretty quickly. Let’s start with some quick background. After years of disputes between the EPA, environmental groups, the utility industry and states, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that Congress gave the EPA the authority to determine whether greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and, if so, the responsibility to regulate it. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas produced when, among other things, power plants burn coal to create electricity. The ruling prompted all parties to get to work. The EPA started working on proposed regulations, while the coal industry, many in the utility industry, skeptics of global warming and some politicians started working on ways to curtail the EPA’s power. The fight was particularly germane to Ohio because coal is the state’s primary fuel source for power plants. The prospect of EPA regulation created difficult choices for Midwest Democrats, who generally were allied with environmentalists but also knew of potential negative economic effects on their states. Brown on Feb. 28, 2011, wrote to President Barack Obama to warn of "potential unintended consequences" of greenhouse gas regulations. He said that "industries, workers, and farmers are extremely concerned that burdensome permitting requirements have been triggered for greenhouse gas emissions." Five weeks later, as the EPA was still working on potential coal rules, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican in the Senate, sponsored an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the amendment got 50 votes, that was insufficient for passage under Senate rules. Brown voted against the amendment while Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman voted for it. But another vote came up that day, this one on an amendment sponsored by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow, with Brown as a cosponsor. It would have required the EPA to wait two years before implementing greenhouse gas limits. Stabenow and Brown also wanted the White House to provide more financial and technical assistance to power plants and factories to cushion any blow from new coal rules. This amendment failed too, getting only seven votes. Brown took criticism from the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which supported McConnell’s amendment and said that several competing amendments to delay, including the one by Stabenow and Brown, were merely "phony" alternatives to give a few Democrats political cover. Yet Brown was also criticized by a group of environmentalists, saying that by voting to delay greenhouse gas regulations, he was weakening the Clean Air Act. And so the EPA began regulating, issuing its first ever national standard on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants on March 27. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that new plants could release no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. This is a tough new standard, one that no commercially viable technology can currently handle, critics said. Power plants that use natural gas, however, can comply easily. The EPA maintained that coal still provides for half of this country’s electricity needs, that new technology could be available soon to allow future coal plants to comply, and that no existing plants, or those under construction, will be affected by the new rule. But Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator, told Environment & Energy Publishing (E&E) in an interview, "I think everyone who's being honest agrees that it effectively bans new coal-fired power plants." Or, as Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune told Bloomberg, the EPA rule "captures the end of an era." Yet Brune also noted what others have said as well: The domestic market was moving away from coal already. In fact, no new coal-fired power plants are being planned in the United States, a decision that predated the EPA’s announcement. The price and efficiency of natural gas, and its apparent abundance in recent shale finds, has made new coal-power plants a foolish investment. "We are not planning to build any coal-fired plants at the time," FirstEnergy spokesman Mark Durbin confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio. American Electric Power, a large Columbus-based company, has a coal-fired plant under construction in Arkansas, but the new EPA rule only affects plants that are more than a year away from getting their construction permits. Power usage is down in general because of the economy, but industry officials say that any new needs should be handled far more cost-effectively with natural gas. "We have nothing else planned in the way of coal-fire generation," AEP spkesman Pat Hemlepp told us. The EPA has no plans to issue carbon rules for existing plants, the agency’s director told reporters on a conference call after announcing the rule for new plants. If that changes, she said, it would be after extensive consultation with all parties, including utilities. So the new rule that Mandel complained about -- the one for which he criticized Brown and predicted economic harm for Ohioans -- will have no known effect in Ohio. Skeptics suggest that President Barack Obama’s administration could ramp up more regulations after the election. The coal industry and some Republicans point to other recent regulations that are not specifically related to greenhouse gases, such as an EPA rule in late 2011 limiting emissions of mercury and other poisonous metals. This rule prompted some utilities to announce they will shut down some of their older, less-efficient coal-burning units rather than spend money scrubbing mercury and arsenic. It took the EPA 20 years to issue the mercury rule, and the agency is giving companies at least three years to comply. With all of these coal restrictions, regardless of what’s being emitted and which rule it falls under, what will happen if natural gas proves to be less abundant than expected, or if its price rises dramatically? This is being asked by the coal industry and its supporters. "Volatile natural gas prices will, once again, expose millions of households to higher utility bills, threaten hundreds of thousands of workers with unemployment and weaken both the competitiveness of basic industries and the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid," warned Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association. . Portman, the Ohio Republican, emailed a statement to Bloomberg after the EPA released its new coal rule, saying, "The uncertainty caused by these regulations could result in the loss of thousands of Ohio jobs and will increase electricity rates for families during tough economic times, in return for less reliable power." That is possible. But no one is projecting that. The skepticism is speculative, and multi-billion-dollar corporations that have the most at stake are investing in natural gas. They were moving away from coal, regardless of its abundance, before the EPA’s newest announcement. We were curious as to why Mandel’s campaigned use the words "cap and trade." Cap and trade refers to a proposed system of emission limits and credits; if a company wanted to emit more carbon, it would have to buy excess credits from another company that had already reduced its emissions. This would set up a system that merges free-market ideas with government regulation. But Congress could never agree on those caps, so there is no cap-and-trade system. Considine, Mandel’s spokesman, acknowledged as much. That’s a minor point, but it is helpful to know since Mandel used the term. The bottom line here is that Mandel said: "Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio." It is true that Brown voted against an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. But the rest of the claim is inaccurate and invokes issues that don’t exist in reality. In fact, were it not for this shred of truth, we might have considered the claim for a ruling of Pants on Fire. First, Mandel invokes the fear of cap-and-trade, a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and does not exist. Second, "this new rule" means a new rule that will not affect Ohio. Mandel blasted Brown for something that has no known effect. Existing coal-fired power plants and those under construction aren’t covered by the rule, and no new plants are planned. Because it has no effect on anything occurring or planned, it cannot be burdensome. It’s fine to speculate; you can invest in coal stocks if you like. But speculate is what Mandel is doing. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-04-05T06:00:00	2012-03-29	['Ohio', 'United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency']
pomt-00706	"We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nation."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/apr/30/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-us-spending-health-care-double-nex/	As a world-renowned neurosurgeon who’s considering running for president, Dr. Ben Carson is familiar with, and critical of, the country’s medical system. Appearing in Manchester at the beginning of the month, Carson told attendees at a health-care forum organized by the National Cultural Diversity Awareness Council that the Affordable Care Act was either poorly thought out, or designed to control "every aspect" of people’s lives. "We have atrocious problems with access (and) horrible inefficiency problems," he said. Carson, a Republican, argued on behalf of health-savings accounts as a way to make people take responsibility for their own health care spending. Carson went on to say that the United States, at No. 1, doubles the health care spending of the No. 2 nation. "We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nation," he said during a 30-minute talk, which ranged from his own biography to entitlement and military spending. We thought that was worth looking into. Could the United States really be spending twice as much per person as nations with universal health care, such as those in Europe? According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) -- which monitors economic and social well-being factors in a wide-ranging group of 34 advanced industrialized countries around the world -- Americans spend more money on health care than any other nation, without much evidence that they’re getting the best value for their dollar. On health care, the OECD has found that the United States spends far and away more per capita and as a percentage of gross domestic product than any other country. The average spending for OECD nations is less than $3,500 per capita, according to 2013 OECD data. By comparison, the United States, at $8,745, is about 2.5 times the average. But Carson was referring to the "next closest nation," not the average nation. Working down from the United States, the "next closest nation" is Norway at $6,140 per capita. After that, it’s Switzerland at $6,080 per capita. Compared to those figures, the United States’ spending is about 1.4 times that of the "next closest nation." (By examining life expectancy, which is the most common at-a-glance health care metric, the U.S., with its 26th out of 36 ranking, lags significantly behind those other nations. Norway was ranked No. 10 and Switzerland was No. 1 .) Asked for a clarification, a spokesperson for Carson’s exploratory committee cited the OECD data and said that he misspoke. "His statement should have been, ‘We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nations.’ ‘Nations’ should be plural," the spokesperson wrote in an email. She said when averaging the health care cost of the other nations in the top 10, "the US more than doubles the average of those countries." She added: "The U.S. spends $8,745 per capita while those other 9 countries spend, on average, $3,484," and linked to this chart as proof. The nine other countries she cited and shown on the chart were Switzerland, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, Australia, UK, Japan and Italy. However, those are not numbers two through 10 in terms of per-capita spending. Switzerland, Germany and Canada are in the top 10, but the others range up to No. 19, Italy. The $3,484 number is the average for all 34 countries surveyed, including the United States. The real figure for average per capita spending in countries two through 10 is about $5,000. There are specific instances where Carson’s claim could be dead on. For instance, France, which is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the best in the world in terms of quality, and spent less than half of what the United States did per capita in the most recent OECD data from 2013. But Carson wasn’t speaking only about France, which officially comes in at No. 11 on the list. It’s worth noting, the other top 10 countries – except for the U.S. – all offer universal health care to their citizens. The U.S. has taken some steps in that direction, but Carson’s plan would go a different way. Our ruling Carson said: "We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nation." Carson’s numbers are off. Spending in the United States is about 1.4 times the next-highest nation, and it’s about 1.7 times the average of the nations that rank second through ninth in spending -- the group Carson’s spokeswoman said he had been intending to reference in his comment. That said, Carson has a point that spending in the U.S. is higher, and approaches double its peers, especially when looking at the average spending for the other OECD nations. On balance, we rate Carson’s claim Mostly False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-04-30T10:55:56	2015-04-06	['None']
pomt-11347	"There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/06/snapple/are-there-only-18-minutes-action-baseball-game/	With the new major league season under way, we thought we’d take a break from fact-checking trade wars and immigration disputes and turn our gaze toward greener pastures. Our subject: A self-styled "real fact" printed on the underside of a Snapple bottle cap. The drink company puts hundreds of bits of trivia on its bottle caps on a rotating basis. This bottle cap said, "There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game." (As it happens, Snapple just inked a partnership with Major League Baseball.) Is that right? See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Let’s acknowledge — ahem — right off the bat that not everyone agrees that this is an enlightening factoid. "I have seen such numbers attributed to various sports, including baseball, but I never delved further, as this seems a singularly stupid calculation, as if baseball in particular were a sport of more or less continuous action, like soccer or hockey or basketball," Major League Baseball’s official historian, John Thorn, told PolitiFact. That said, the statistic appears to come from a study published by the Wall Street Journal in 2013. The author and study designer, Steve Moyer, had a long career in baseball statistics before his death on March 1. Based on a sampling of three games that he painstakingly stopwatched and coded, Moyer found that, on average, "a baseball fan will see 17 minutes and 58 seconds of action over the course of a three-hour game. This is roughly the equivalent of a TED Talk, a Broadway intermission or the missing section of the Watergate tapes." That’s also more action than a similar Wall Street Journal study found for pro football in 2010 -- just 11 minutes. (Basketball, hockey and soccer don’t break down as easily into action and non-action segments.) Moyer counted two types of action that together totaled 17 minutes and 58 seconds: • Balls in play or runners advancing: five minutes, 47 seconds • Other action (such as pitches, foul balls and pickoffs): 12 minutes, 11 seconds In addition, Moyer broke down different types of inaction. One was the time between batters (33 minutes, 39 seconds). This included "knocking the weighted donut off the bat, announcing the batter, the walk-up song, cleaning the cleats," Moyer wrote. Another was the time between innings (42 minutes, 41 seconds). But easily the biggest chunk of dead time was time between pitches (one hour, 14 minutes, 49 seconds). This, Moyer explained, "includes the unstrapping and re-strapping the batting gloves, sleeve adjusting, helmet adjusting, practice swings, plus the pitcher doing whatever it is he does as well. … Sometimes the pitcher will walk around or pick up the rosin bag, sometimes more than one sign will be necessary, sometimes the batter calls time and the whole process starts over." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Because stopwatching an entire ballgame -- much less several of them -- is taxing, the experiment hasn’t been done very often, so it’s hard to know if the sample of games is skewed in some way. We found one additional study by Fox Sports that looked at a pair of major league games in 2010. Fox Sports found 14 minutes of action -- not precisely the same as what the Journal found, but an amount that was "in the ballpark," Grant Brisbee, who writes on baseball for the sports site SB Nation, told PolitiFact. (Yes, Grant, we got the pun.) We contacted Brisbee because he had taken his own look at a related question for SB Nation in 2017. Brisbee was trying to puzzle out the main reason why major league games have become so long in recent years. Time has become an increasing issue for baseball, a sport that is famously not run according to a clock. In recent years, major league games have run longer and longer. In 2017, the average length of games hit a full-season record of three hours, five minutes. Using data from baseball-reference.com, we plotted out the inexorably lengthening duration of the average major league game, from a little over two hours right after World War II to a little over three hours today. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com As a result, time has become a serious concern at Major League Baseball headquarters. For 2018, officials instituted several new rules that were designed to speed up the game, including a limit on the number of visits that managers, coaches or players can visit the mound every nine innings, and changes designed to speed up video reviews of umpires’ calls. Officials also kept in place rules that had been enacted in recent years, such as limits on when players can leave the batter’s box between pitches, and on how quickly pitchers have to get ready between innings. (A pitch clock -- now being used in some minor leagues -- was considered, but deferred.) So, back to Brisbee’s question: Why are major league games getting longer? To answer the question, he decided to stopwatch two games -- one from 1984 and one from 2014. Going into the project, Brisbee figured that commercials -- primarily between-inning time -- would account for the longer game time. As it turned out, he did find an increase, but it wasn’t dramatic. Instead, the culprit was the time between pitches, Brisbee found. He zeroed in on what he called "inaction pitches" -- balls, called strikes, or missed swinging strikes that didn’t result in the end of an at-bat or the advancement of a runner. Brisbee found that 146 inaction pitches were thrown in the 1984 game, with 144 such pitches in the 2014 game -- an almost identical amount. What wasn’t identical was the time those inaction pitches took up. In the 1984 game, inaction pitches accounted for 32 minutes and 47 seconds. In the 2014 game, they accounted for 57 minutes and 41 seconds. That’s nearly an 80 percent increase. "Pitchers don’t get rid of the ball like they used to," he wrote. "Hitters aren’t expecting them to get rid of the ball like they used to. It adds a couple minutes to every half-inning, which adds close to a half-hour." It’s worth noting that there is technically a rule to curb this — and there has been for more than a century. "Since 1901, baseball has mandated that a pitcher must deliver the ball to a batter within 20 seconds after receiving it from the catcher," Moyer noted in his study. But ask any baseball fan if they’ve ever seen that rule enforced and the answer will surely be no. Of course, long games can have their charms "My perspective is that something is always happening in baseball even when the action on the field has come to a stop," said Thorn, the historian. "Indeed it is the interstices between plays that to me are most valuable, as they permit conversation or reflection." Our ruling The Snapple cap said, "There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game." One credible study found just shy of 18 minutes of action, while another study was close, finding 14 minutes. That said, the number of stopwatched games is low due to the difficulty of the task -- only a half-dozen or so that we could find -- meaning that it’s hard to rule out a skewed statistical sample. So we’ll be cautious and rate the statement Mostly True. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com	None	Snapple	None	None	None	2018-04-06T10:55:30	2018-04-05	['None']

pomt-14485	"There isn’t a single (Texas) legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/feb/26/huey-rey-fischer/huey-rey-fischer-nails-lack-texas-legislators-unde/	One of seven Democratic hopefuls bidding to succeed state Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, made a claim about the not-so-youthful Texas Legislature that made us wonder. Huey Rey Fischer, 23, said in a Feb. 8, 2016, press release touting endorsements by University of Texas students: "The students are taking me to the Capitol! There isn’t a single legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas. This is our opportunity to change that." Are there no elected 20-somethings under the dome while Texans born in the ‘80s or ‘90s -- a dictionary definition of "millennials" -- comprise a quarter of the state’s voting population? Short answers: Texas indeed has no legislators under age 30 and, depending on how you define millennials, you could make a case for such Texans comprising close to a quarter of the electorate, though this element needs unpacking. Counting younger legislators To our request for Fischer’s factual backup, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, noted by email a Texas Legislative Reference Library chart indicating that as of the 2015 legislative session, no legislators were younger than 30 -- which was still so, per state records, after two empty House seats were filled that year. Leighton Schubert, R-Brenham, was 32 on his election to represent the 13th district, and the winner of special election to represent the 123rd district, Diego Bernal, D-San Antonio, was 38. But that shutout of anyone under 30 also was unusual, according to library charts breaking down legislative demographics from 1995 on. The charts show at least one House member under age 30 at the start of each biennial regular session through 2013 -- and twice, in 2003 and 2007, the House had five members younger than 30. Millennials So, do millennials comprise about a quarter of the state’s electorate, meaning residents eligible to vote? Heinrich told us Fischer’s conclusion was based on dividing a projection of the number of 18- to 29-year-old Texas residents in 2014 -- 4,718,725 -- by the 18,915,297 people who made up the state’s voting-age population as of the November 2014 governor’s election, according to the Texas Secretary of State, the state’s chief elections officer. That math works. But Fischer might not have taken the best route to estimating millenials among us. Heinrich told us Fischer’s count of Texas adults under 30 came to her from Nick Dauster of the Department of State Health Services, who said in a 2015 email answering Heinrich’s query that agency staff drew from data compiled by the Texas State Data Center to reach a 2014 projected population of 4,718,275 Texans aged 18-29, presuming 2000-2010 migration rates. Other analysts For our part, we asked Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, about estimating the share of eligible-to-vote Texans aged 18-to-29. By email, Potter said the candidate’s cited estimate of Texans aged 18 to 29 accurately tracked center data. But, Potter said, U.S. Census Bureau 2014 population estimates released in June 2015 are considered more accurate. The bureau estimate suggests there were 4,715,612 people aged 18 to 29 in Texas in 2014 -- about 2,600 down from Fischer’s cited projection. Potter also wrote: "Another factor to consider with this statement is the definition of electorate. If electorate means eligible to vote, consideration of citizenship and felony status should probably figure into the picture." His point: Some share of the voting-age population consists of residents not eligible to vote. We asked the Secretary of State’s office about this aspect. Spokeswoman Alicia Pierce confirmed by email that its voting-age population figures posted for November 2014 included people "not eligible to vote such as non-citizens and those convicted of a felony who have not fully discharged their sentence." She added: "If electorate means all those who are eligible to vote, we do not have a firm number." There’s at least one other way to estimate young voters. We took Pierce up on her offer to break out the share of registered Texas voters under 30. As of Feb. 20, 2016, according to the provided breakdown, 2,725,526 Texas voters aged 18 through 29 were registered to vote, making up about 19 percent of the state’s nearly 14.3 million registered voters. Fischer comments Fischer, provided what we’d heard from Potter and Pierce, said by email he used the voting-age population to build his estimate of millennials in the state’s electorate because he didn’t identify a better statistic. He cautioned too that "electorate" takes in everyone qualified to vote, not just registered voters. "As an aside," Fischer wrote, "it is important to note that representatives are still called to represent felons, undocumented immigrants, non-citizen permanent residents, and others who may not be eligible to vote for a myriad of reasons." Our ruling Fischer said: "There isn’t a single (Texas) legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas." The Texas House and Senate each lacks legislators under age 30. But getting a fix on millenials in the Texas electorate can be slippery. Relying on an estimate of residents old enough to vote, as Fischer did, folds in people not eligible to vote--including non-citizens. On the other hand, nearly 20 percent of registered voters are millenials. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-07562	"A third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion, because one in three pregnancies end in abortion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/31/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-one-every-three-pregnancies-end/	In a March 29, 2011, interview with WEZS Radio in Laconia, N.H., former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. -- a possible 2012 presidential candidate -- discussed a possible link between the financial predicament of Social Security and abortion. Santorum, a strong opponent of abortion during his time in the Senate, argued that abortion has so depleted the ranks of younger Americans that the costs of Social Security benefits are having to be shouldered by fewer working-age Americans. "The Social Security system in my opinion is a flawed design, period," Santorum said in response to a question from a caller. "But having said that, the design would work a lot better if we had stable demographic trends. The reason Social Security is in big trouble is we don’t have enough workers to support the retirees. Well, a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion, because one in three pregnancies end in abortion." Several readers asked us to check Santorum's claim about the number of abortions. To do this, we delved into statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We chose 2003 as our representative year, since it was the most recent year for which we were able to obtain all of the relevant data. We set out to determine the number of known pregnancies in 2003. We say "known" because some pregnancies end due to natural causes at a very early stage, often before the woman even realizes she is pregnant. CDC only offers statistics for fetal deaths beginning at a fetal age of 20 weeks, so that’s the parameter we’ll use in our calculations. To calculate the number of known pregnancies, we added together three figures: the number of live births, the number of fetal deaths (these include natural miscarriages and stillbirths), and the number of abortions. Here’s the data for 2003: Live births: 4,090,007 Fetal deaths: 25,653 Abortions: 1,250,000 Total known pregnancies: 5,365,660 So abortions account for 23.2 percent of all known pregnancies. That’s less than a quarter of all pregnancies, rather than the one-third Santorum said. The Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, has come up with a number very close to what PolitiFact found, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The institute found that 22.4 percent of pregnancies resulted in an abortion in 2008. (The institute did not factor fetal deaths into its calculation.) But Santorum isn’t just off-base about the number of abortions. He also makes a flawed assumption about the impact of abortions on U.S. population trends, Wind said. "It is simply wrong" to assume that every abortion reduces the U.S. population by one person, she said, since many women obtain abortions to postpone childbearing -- not to prevent it altogether. A 2005 Guttmacher study of more than 1,200 women who had undergone an abortion found that a little under half cited the desire not to have additional children as a reason for having their abortion. This means that a substantial minority -- and possibly as many as 53 percent -- expected to have children after the abortion. This pattern was particularly strong among younger women in the study (less than a quarter of those 19 or younger said they were done with childbearing) and among those who had no children at the time of the abortion (only 3 percent said they were done with childbearing). We provided Santorum's office with our calculations and asked for a response. A spokeswoman did not counter our findings, but offered a brief statement that said "the prolife community has been astounded at the increasing percentages in the pregnancies that result in abortion." The statement also made additional claims about abortion rates among certain demographic groups, but they did not address the wording that Santorum had used in the radio interview. So we find Santorum is significantly overstating the frequency of abortions when he claims that "one in three pregnancies end in abortion" -- it’s actually in the 22 percent to 23 percent range. That's less than one in four. And the effect on population would be even lower if women who had abortions had children later in life. We can't know exactly how that would affect the numbers, but it would send the estimate even lower. We rate Santorum's statement False. UPDATE, April 1, 2011: After we published this item, a reader pointed out that the statement we quoted from Santorum’s office was incorrect. While a spokeswoman had told us that "the prolife community has been astounded at the increasing percentages in the pregnancies that result in abortion," the reader pointed us to statistics from the Guttmacher Institute that show the rate of abortions declining over time. From a 1981 peak of 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, the rate has fallen, gradually but steadily, to 19.6 in 2008 -- a decline of about one-third. According to Census Bureau data, the raw number of abortions has also fallen consistently, from a peak of 1,609,000 in 1990 to 1,242,000 in 2006.

pomt-06460	"Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/19/mark-miller/nearly-14000-wisconsinites-have-lost-their-job-gov/	In September 2011, Gov. Scott Walker responded to disappointing employment numbers by calling lawmakers back to Madison for the second special session on jobs in the nine months since he took office. The Sept. 28, 2011 announcement came after the Department of Workforce Development reported Sept. 15, 2011 that the state lost 800 jobs in August. That was on top of a loss of 10,800 jobs reported for the month before. Promising a bipartisan effort, Walker urged lawmakers to pass some 30 bills by November. But opponents said the session on jobs was little more than political posturing. State Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) joined the criticism, issuing a Sept. 28, 2011 news release that said: "Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January. In that time we’ve seen precious little action from Republicans to put people back to work." We’ve been tracking progress toward Walker’s promise of 250,000 new jobs in his four-year term, and remembered lots of upbeat numbers early on. (You can find the latest update on the Walk-O-Meter here). Have 14,000 people really lost their jobs? When asked for backup, Miller aide Michael Browne referred us to the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on employment. Browne said Miller was not available for an interview on the subject. The bureau’s data shows that 239,916 Wisconsin residents were without a job in August, 2011, compared with 225,983 in January, when Walker took office. The difference: 13,933. Browne said that was the number of people who have lost work since Walker took office. But is that what the number means? We asked Andrew Feldman, director of BadgerStat, a nonpartisan nonprofit that provides online performance measures of Wisconsin to citizens and policy makers, for his take. "Sen. Miller is right that the number of unemployed people in Wisconsin has increased by about 14,000 people since Governor Walker took office," he said. "What we can't say for sure is what portion of those roughly 14,000 people became unemployed because they lost their jobs." Confused? Welcome to the world of counting jobs and the unemployed. The bureau defines "unemployed" as people who are out of work but looking for a job. (They’re counted). But some people are out of work and have given up looking. (They’re not counted.) And then there are folks who are out of work, gave up looking, but have now decided that they want to look for work again. (They are counted.) "Both factors are likely at play here in Wisconsin," Feldman said. "Some people have lost jobs during 2011 while others re-entered the labor market and started looking for work again." So, Miller would be off by ascribing the entire increase to folks losing jobs. We asked the feds what their numbers mean. They also said Miller is off in his interpretation "BLS unemployment data are not gathered from the number of unemployment claims," said agency spokeswoman Stacey Standish."BLS uses a monthly household survey to calculate labor force data. The unemployed are those that respond that they do not have a job, would like a job, are actively looking for a job, and are available to work." Standish said the figure means there were 13,933 more people unemployed -- by their measure -- in August compared to beginning of the year. Let’s return to that jobs promise by Walker. It covers the other side of the coin from unemployment, and offers some perspective on how the numbers can be used -- or misused. The most recent state report said that in August the state lost 800 jobs. However, there has been an overall increase of 29,600 jobs since Walker took office. That leaves 220,400 jobs remaining for Walker to reach his goal. That is, the net number is what gets measured, not individual increases or decreases. For instance, the August report says total private sector employment was down 800 jobs. The construction industry was down 3,000 jobs and the information sector was down 1,100 jobs for that month. Yet there were 800 jobs added in educational and health services and 2,000 in leisure and hospitality. For that month, the number of lost jobs outnumbered the number of jobs gained by 800. In other words: it wasn’t 800 people who lost their job. It might have been more or less than that. Consider what would happen if you applied the same approach Miller is using on the unemployment side of the ledger to the jobs side of it. State reports say there has been an increase in state employment for six separate months. If you added those months together, the total is 41,200 jobs. No one is claiming that many people found jobs. The difference -- the net -- is a better reflection of where the state is at. That sum, right now, is plus-29,600. Experts and others who analyze the monthly data emphasize the numbers are estimates based on surveys, and useful as yardsticks of employment conditions. But they are simply estimates, not a measure of what happened to individual employees. Our conclusion Miller says 14,000 state residents lost their job since Walker took office, citing federal numbers as evidence. But those who gather the numbers say they can’t be used in the manner Miller is using them. (It’s similar to an earlier fact-check, where Republicans were comparing the state job-growth numbers to the national ones.) Miller has the right number for the increase of unemployed people. But it’s impossible to know how many lost their jobs this year vs. those who lost their jobs earlier and are now starting to look again. We rate the statement False.

pomt-02964	Common Core "is not from the federal government," they "do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/24/sondy-pope/how-much-federal-government-involved-common-core-s/	In June 2010, Wisconsin became one of the first states to adopt Common Core, a set of national education standards for English and math. Over time, nearly every state jumped aboard. Not much controversy. But more recently, Common Core has come under attack from conservatives around the country. U.S. Senate Republicans, for example, tried in April 2013 to kill federal funding for the program, calling it an interference with local control of public schools. In Wisconsin, GOP state lawmakers set hearings to review the standards; the next is Oct. 30, 2013. At the first hearing, on Oct. 3, 2013, state schools superintendent Tony Evers -- the official who decided Wisconsin would adopt Common Core -- told a reporter that the pushback in Madison and elsewhere "is all about what's going on in Washington. It's all about controlling the message and the next (presidential) election." The same day, state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains) took a break from the hearing to defend Common Core on "The Devil's Advocates" talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison. Asked whether Common Core means schools are forced to teach children based on "federalized standards," Pope said, "absolutely not." "This is not from the federal government. This is not ‘ObamaCore.,’" she said. "This came straight from the (National) Governors Association, of which (Gov. Scott Walker) is a member, and the state school chiefs -- the superintendents -- association, absolutely separate from anything that the federal government was doing. "They do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all." Is Pope right that Common Core didn’t come from the federal government and that federal officials don’t have their fingerprints on it? Common Core and its origins Adopted by 45 states, the Common Core State Standards came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. In Wisconsin, the standards will be aligned with a new standardized test that will roll out in 2014. Common Core’s website explicitly states that the federal government was not involved in developing the standards. And there is other evidence to support that. As PolitiFact Florida has noted, the Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create the Common Core State Standards, developed them with the help of teachers, parents, and experts, and unveiled them in 2010. So, Pope is accurate on the first part of her claim, that Common Core did not come from the federal government. Federal involvement PolitiFact Florida also addressed the second part of Pope’s claim -- that federal officials "do not have their fingerprints" on Common Core. Our colleagues found that, although Common Core is voluntary for states to adopt, the federal government has had a role in encouraging them to adopt the standards. To get grants from Race to the Top -- Obama’s signature education program -- or waivers from the mandates of No Child Left Behind -- an education reform law adopted under President George W. Bush -- states have to prove they have standards to prepare students for college and work. They don’t have to adopt the Common Core Standards, but that works as one way to qualify for grants or waivers. There was a rush by states to adopt Common Core by August 2010 because establishing standards won them points in the competition for a share of the billions in Race to the Top grants. Tom McCarthy, a spokesman for Pope, acknowledged "there really wasn’t a credible alternative to Common Core" at the time. So, the federal government didn’t force Common Core on the states, but it did create incentives for states to adopt the standards. Our rating Pope said: Common Core "is not from the federal government," they "do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all." Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, we give Pope a Mostly True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-04491	Says "tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/05/kurt-schrader/are-tax-revenues-lowest-theyve-been-world-war-ii/	Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., bills himself as a budget hawk, a persistent agitator for getting the nation’s debt under control. He also speaks frequently about the broken federal tax code. Those two concepts came together on Sept. 13 when Schrader wrote in an e-newsletter that Congress should go "big" this winter when devising a way to avoid the so-called "fiscal cliff," the spending cuts and tax increases that go into effect automatically early next year if Congress does nothing. Schrader has been preaching this for months. But in the newsletter he offered a new argument for re-working the tax code as part of the exercise. One big reason comprehensive tax reform is needed, he wrote is, "Tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II and need to increase through comprehensive tax reform." That’s quite an interesting and emphatic statement; exactly the kind that gets our attention at PolitiFact Oregon. The first part is especially worth a look - "Tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II" - because that claim and some variation of it will be heard often when Congress begins debating tax reform later this year. But what does he mean? To the average person, revenue usually means dollars. If that’s the case, Schrader could not be more wrong. How wrong? Try this. In 1945, federal revenue was $45.1 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. By 2010 OMB records show that number had exploded to $2.2 trillion because the nation’s economy grew at a record pace. But wait. Schrader’s spokesman, Cody Tucker, says that’s not the comparison the congressman is making. Tucker said the statement is based on calculations of revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Schrader’s claim compares revenues from federal income taxes, Social Security and assorted excise taxes, Tucker said, and uses the 2010 fiscal year as an endpoint because that’s the last year for actual data. None of that is spelled out - or even hinted - in the newsletter. Linking revenue to gross domestic product, which is the total value of all goods and services the country produces, is a standard and accepted way of comparing economic variables over time. It’s a common tool used by economists and budget wonks on Capitol Hill so one year can be accurately compared to other years. PolitiFact Oregon has no fear of wonky data. And we’re in luck here because this kind of baseline data is what economists are born to collect and collate, analyze and evaluate. Interest groups specializing in federal budget, including the conservative Heritage Foundation and non-partisan Tax Policy Center do it. Non-partisan outfits including the Congressional Budget Office do it. So does OMB, which provides a handy year-by-year summary of federal revenue as a percentage of GDP going back to 1930. In that year, the percentage was 4.2 percent. Schrader says in his comment that revenue is the lowest since the end of World War II. That would be 1945. And sure enough, the percentage that year had jumped to 20.4 percent, reflecting the cost of the war and the nation’s singular focus on winning no matter the cost. In 1950, federal receipts as a percentage of GDP amounted to 14.4 percent. During the subsequent six decades, the share typically hovered between 16 percent and 20 percent. By fiscal year 2010, it was 14.9 percent of GDP. All of those years are higher - or equal - to 2010. Schrader is correct on 2010 compared to 1945. And he’s correct about the years in between. But the reader shouldn’t have to call his office or OMB or some economist for an explanation. He doesn’t specify that he’s referring to revenue as a percentage of GDP. He’s not explicit about when the period starts (1945?) and when it ends (2010?). That’s important because OMB projections say revenue will jump to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2012 and 17.9 percent in 2013. Both of those are higher and thus dent Schrader’s argument. He also fails to point out another important caveat - that absolute levels of federal tax revenues collected in many of the most recent years have been at or near record levels even though the percentage remains low. That’s because the overall economy has grown, too. All of this muddles the message and leaves out important context. And to find the real result Schrader asks readers to do far too much work. For that reason, we rate this claim: Half True.	None	Kurt Schrader	None	None	None	2012-10-05T16:22:42	2012-09-13	['None']
pomt-06056	"President Obama has raised taxes 19 times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-raised-taxes-19-/	In a Jan. 5, 2012, Los Angeles Times article, Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, accused President Barack Obama of repeatedly raising taxes. "President Obama has raised taxes 19 times," she said, "stunting our economic growth and leading us further down the path toward a European-style entitlement society." A reader asked us to check whether Obama has really raised taxes 19 times. We began by requesting the list of 19 tax increases from the Romney campaign. They quickly complied. Because the definition of "tax" can be subject to some disagreement, we asked tax experts for guidance on what constitutes a tax and what does not. Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, offered a brief rule of thumb. "Taxes have the primary purpose of raising revenue for general government," he said. "Fees have the primary purpose of raising revenue for a specific benefit to the payer. Penalties have the purpose of imposing criminal sanction, and any revenue generation is incidental." Henchman added that removing a tax exemption -- even if its critics deride it as a loophole, even if it benefits one company -- counts as a tax increase as long as the purpose is revenue generation. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, offered broadly similar definitions. He called a tax increase "anything that increases what most normal people would call a tax. A ‘rate increase’ is a tax. Changes in other rules that cause people whose behavior doesn’t change to pay more tax are also tax increases. The behavior point is key, as some rule changes may lead people to change behavior, sacrificing income and thereby paying the same amount or even less in taxes. Those rule changes should be called tax increases." Aaron went on to say that things get more difficult once you start looking at fees that can reasonably be characterized as user charges. "I wouldn’t call an increase in a freeway toll a tax increase, but it can get muddy," Aaron said. "The tunnels on the roads away from Logan Airport in Boston charge the cabbie two fees, a tunnel charge that every driver has to pay and an extra charge levied only on cabs and intended, I am sure, to hit travelers who are, in significant proportion, out-of-staters. The first part of that charge is a user fee; the second, I would call a tax." Aaron added that "lots of regulations or rules result in people having to pay more money, but I wouldn’t call them taxes. The rule that drivers must carry auto insurance forces drivers to buy insurance that they might not otherwise want -- I wouldn’t call that a tax. A rule that food producers must take steps to make sure that their products are free of impurities or germs forces them to pay money, but is not a tax. More generally, the government requires people to do all manner of things that cost them money or inconvenience that should not be called taxes unless every law requiring some form of behavior is a tax, which would deprive the word of any clear meaning." We’ll list the 19 provisions in four groupings that reflect how much consensus there seems to be from our reporting. Items that are clearly taxes, and that are already in effect • Increasing the federal excise tax on tobacco. Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. • A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. This tax is narrowly targeted at tanning bed users, but it is still a tax. This took effect July 1, 2010. • Increasing corporate taxes by making it more difficult for businesses to engage in activities that reduce their tax liability. This appears to refer to the closing of a half-dozen existing exemptions and credits relevant only to large international corporations. (We wrote about this recently.) While this is a provision targeted narrowly at big conglomerates -- and while it’s popular as a way to keep deep-pocketed countries from sheltering excessive amounts of income -- our experts said it does count as a tax increase. Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010. • Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs, based on each company’s share of the total market. While some industry-specific levies are intended to help foot the bill for regulatory processes, this one is more of a revenue raiser for the more general goals of the health care overhaul. It took effect on Jan. 1, 2011. Items that are clearly taxes, but which are not yet in effect Listed in chronological order of date they will take effect: • Increasing the hospital insurance portion of the payroll tax from 2.9 percent to 3.8 percent for couples earning more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for single filers. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Applying the 3.8 percent hospital insurance tax to investment income for couples earning more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for single filers, for the first time. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. This is a narrowly targeted tax, but still a tax (and will likely be reflected in consumer prices once it begins). Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Raise the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. People who would have qualified for the deduction this year would pay more. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Annual fee levied on health insurance providers, based on each company’s share of the total market. Same logic as the levy on branded drug companies cited above. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. While the Obama camp says this provision is intended in part to stop abuse of the system, our experts consider it a tax because it increases taxable income. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013 • Eliminating the corporate deduction for prescription expenses for retirees. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, certain employers were not only "qualified to receive a subsidy equal to 28 percent of covered prescription drug costs for their retirees," but the employer also was entitled to an income tax deduction for the subsidy. The idea behind providing both a subsidy and a tax deduction was to reduce taxpayer costs for the Medicare drug plan by encouraging companies pay their retirees’ costs, but the way it was structured was criticized by some as double-dipping. No matter the justification, our experts agreed it was still a tax hike. It takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Increasing taxes on health insurance companies by limiting the amount of compensation paid to certain employees that they can deduct from their taxes. According to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, this will be effective for compensation paid in taxable years "beginning after 2012, with respect to services performed after 2009." Once again, this is narrowly targeted at health care company executives -- not a popular group -- but it’s still a tax. • A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided "Cadillac" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. Items about which there is no consensus over whether they’re taxes • Reduce the number of medical products taxpayers can purchase using funds they put aside in health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. The definition of which items qualify and don’t qualify for flex spending plans seems to us to be more like the kind of decision made by regulators than lawmakers responsible for writing the tax code. • A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance and for employers to offer it to their workers. This one is a doozy, because the answer is crucial to the court case that challenges the entire health care law. Because the courts will ultimately decide whether the federal government is levying a tax on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it -- or whether the government is simply using the tax code to enforce a criminal penalty, as some critics of the health care law say -- we won’t take a side on this question. Items where there is a strong argument that they are not taxes • Exclusion of unprocessed fuels from the existing cellulosic biofuel producer credit. This provision -- which is already in effect -- was included in the health care bill even though it has nothing to do with health care. Though its inclusion as an unrelated item suggests that revenue-raising is the primary intention, it was actually intended to fix a legislative oversight. According to the House Rules Committee, then controlled by the Democrats, Congress in 2008 "enacted a $1.01 per gallon tax credit for the production of biofuel from cellulosic feedstocks in order to encourage development of new production capacity for biofuels not derived from food source materials. Congress is aware that some taxpayers are seeking to claim the cellulosic biofuel tax credit for unprocessed fuels. … The provision (in the health care bill) would limit eligibility for the tax credit to processed fuels." Beyond the question of whether it simply corrects an error, Aaron argues that this provision is not a tax, since "there’s no logic requiring that unprocessed fuels qualify for tax credit. If this is a tax increase, then one should, presumably, treat as a tax the fact that fountain pens are not eligible for a tax credit, as they could have been, but weren’t included in this tax credit." (The change has already taken effect.) • The health care law’s "medical loss ratio" provision. Insurance companies will be required to spend either 80 percent (in the individual- and small-group market) or 85 percent (in the large-group market) of the money they receive from premiums on medical care and health care quality improvement, rather than on administrative costs. The provision took effect in 2011. The intention behind this provision is to shape how insurers spend premium dollars, making it more quality regulation than a revenue-raising tax. • A $50,000 penalty per non-profit hospital if they fail to meet new "community needs assessment." This falls into the same category as the previous item -- a provision intended to regulate insurers’ practices rather than generate revenue. • Increased penalty for purchasing disallowed products with health savings account, to 20 percent. This is a penalty for a violation, not a tax. It’s worth pointing out that a number of these provisions are quite narrowly targeted, and some are likely popular among the public, such as those aimed at health-care executive compensation and tax-shelter strategies by billion-dollar multinational corporations. By contrast, as we have noted, the most expansive of Obama’s tax policies went the other direction, reducing taxes for 95 percent of working families. And a final note: The president doesn’t have the authority to raise taxes on his own. He can only do so with the consent of Congress, which is what happened in each of these cases. Our ruling Of the 19 provisions Romney is citing, we conclude that 13 may be reasonably defined as taxes (though of those, only four are already in effect). Of the remaining six provisions Romney cites, we find two that are subject to disagreement and four that are probably not taxes at all. So, more than two-thirds of the 19 provisions Romney cited are pretty clearly taxes, but many of them are narrowly targeted at groups from tanning-bed users to health company CEOs. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-11T10:41:46	2012-01-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-09281	Gov. Lawton Chiles said "if I were to become ... become speaker of the House it would be (his) worst nightmare."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/27/daniel-webster/daniel-webster-worst-nightmare/	Longtime state lawmaker Daniel Webster became the latest Republican to enter the race for Congress in Florida's 8th District on April 22, joining an already crowded field looking to oust incumbent Orlando Democrat Alan Grayson. In his announcement, Webster replayed a personal narrative that he believes can rally conservatives to his campaign: Found politics through his church. Fought for less government and low taxes. Built Florida's Republican dynasty. The first GOP speaker in 122 years. Webster, an air conditionioning contractor and a Georgia Tech graduate, shared a story from the 1996 election to help drive the point home. Republicans back then were potentially poised to take control of the Florida House, and Webster, then the minority leader, was in line to be speaker. "During the '96 election, Democrat Gov. Lawton Chiles said if I were to become -- me, he was speaking to me -- 'If he were to become speaker of the House it would be my worst nightmare,' '' Webster said. "He was right." So often candidates enter political races telling personal stories. In this case, we wanted to see if Webster's story about Chiles jibes with the historical record. On the historic 1996 election, Webster is on solid ground. Republicans that year took control of the Florida House for the first time since 1875 when "carpetbagger" Malachi Martin held the speaker's gavel. Republicans won a 61-59 majority in the House in 1996, making Webster speaker. Republicans also held a 23-17 edge in the state Senate, making Florida the first southern state since Reconstruction with a Republican-dominated Legislature. But what about Chiles? Though Chiles was never quoted in a newspaper saying exactly what Webster remembers, Chiles did use the phrase "worst nightmare" during the 1996 election, according to a search of newspaper accounts from the time. The first reference comes at the tail-end of a briefs column in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Oct. 19, 1996. An item about Jeb Bush campaigning for Republicans ended: "Already facing a GOP-controlled Senate, Chiles has called the possibility of a Republican-led House his 'worst nightmare.' " A similar line appeared the next day in the Lakeland Ledger: "With a GOP-controlled Senate, Chiles has called the possibility of a Republican-led House his 'worst nightmare.' " The Orlando Sentinel published a full quote from Chiles on Oct. 21. "I'll go out and help those people who are going to help me after the November elections," Chiles said. "My worst nightmare is for the Democrats to lose control of the House." The quote, and the snippets from the Herald-Tribune and Ledger, aren't necessarily talking about Webster, rather Republicans in general. Oct. 25, in the St. Petersburg Times -- "Chiles said losing control of the House would lead to his 'worst nightmare' - a Republican-dominated legislature." The worst nightmare line continued to appear in news articles now and again, always in reference to the GOP-controlled House and not Webster specifically, until April 12, 1998, when a Herald-Tribune article about a feud between Chiles and Webster included this line: "But Webster, R-Orlando, is living up to the description Chiles once gave him: 'My worst nightmare.' '' Alan Judd, who authored the 1998 story and now works for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, said he couldn't recall if Chiles' statement was directed specifically at Webster or at the GOP House in general. But he thought Webster's statement at the campaign rally essentially reflected Chiles' thinking at the time. Back to Webster's statement. He said Chiles called Webster his "worst nightmare." Every published reference except one said the comment was about the GOP takeover of the Florida House in 1996 and not Webster specifically. In our minds, that's just a hair different, and warrants a rating of Mostly True.	None	Daniel Webster	None	None	None	2010-04-27T16:13:11	2010-04-22	['Lawton_Chiles']
pomt-05948	"Before this day is out, 18 more veterans will have taken their own lives. That is the daily average, it is intolerable, and it has to stop."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/26/rush-holt/rush-holt-says-18-veterans-commit-suicide-daily/	If the number of U.S. troops killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars isn’t startling enough, there’s another military statistic that has a New Jersey congressman outraged. "Before this day is out, 18 more veterans will have taken their own lives," Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th) said in a December press release. "That is the daily average, it is intolerable, and it has to stop." That would mean 126 veterans every week or 6,570 every year, across the nation. As shocking as that might seem, Holt’s statistic is accurate, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The statistic was confirmed in a Dec. 15, 2007 email exchange between Dr. Ira R. Katz, deputy chief officer of Mental Health Services at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Dr. Michael J. Kussman, then the under secretary for health at the Veterans Health Administration, which is part of the VA. The statistic was cited in a CBS News investigation that revealed 6,200 veterans committed suicide in 2005. When Kussman, a retired Army brigaider general, asked Katz in an email if reports by a media organization about the statistic were accurate, Katz responded: "There are about 18 suicides per day among America’s 25 million veterans. This follows from CDC (Centers for Disease Control) findings that 20% of suicides are among veterans. It is supported by the CBS numbers. VA’s own data demonstrates 4-5 suicides per day among those who receive care from us." Holt spokesman Thomas Seay referred us to a U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit opinion from May 10, 2011 that cites the same statistic from Katz. The opinion criticized the VA’s handling and processing of claims and benefits for veterans in a lawsuit brought by two nonprofit veterans groups against the VA, several of its officials and the federal government. The VA said in an emailed statement that the actual numbers of veteran suicides isn’t known, but considers the statistic of an average of 18 per day its best estimate. Limited data is an issue, Seay said. "Some efforts are underway to improve data collection, particularly as relates to the effectiveness of specific interventions: for example, the Vet2Vet program run out of UMDNJ in Piscataway is working hard to measure the impact of its counseling services," Seay said in an email. " Even so, better national data would help to guide better policy." Suicide factors for veterans are similar to those for nonveterans, said Jeremy Willinger, director of communications and marketing for the Mental Health Association of New York City. "In the general population, suicide risk factors include male gender, older age, diminished support (e.g. homelessness or unmarried status), availability of firearms, and co-occurring physical and mental conditions," Willinger said in an email. "This profile describes a large portion of the veteran population. "Nearly 50 percent of military suicides in 2010 occurred at the hands of privately-owned weapons," Willinger added. Bob Handy, chairman of California-based Veterans United For Truth, one of the suit’s plaintiffs, said 18 veteran suicides a day is accurate but believes the number might be low "because that’s veterans involved with the Veterans Administration." "When we filed our lawsuit on June 23, 2007 until the end of last year there were 29,000 veterans who had killed themselves," said Handy, a Korea and Vietnam veteran. "If a veteran’s family or the veteran himself felt like he or she was thinking of taking his own life pick up the telephone and call 9-1-1 or the appropriate medical people and not necessarily wait for the VA to call them back," he added. Our ruling In announcing Congressional approval of $40 million that he sought to support suicide prevention programs for the military, Holt in a December press release said an average of 18 veterans commit suicide daily. The VA said that figure is the best estimate it has.

pomt-05481	Gas prices have doubled because "Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska. He gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra, which then went bankrupt. And he blocked the Keystone pipeline. So we will all pay more at the pump."	false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/19/american-energy-alliance/did-obama-policies-alaska-solyndra-and-keystone-co/	Gas prices are fueling a drag race of political ads on Florida television. In one lane, it’s spiking gas prices under President Barack Obama. In the other, it’s "Big Oil’s" support for Mitt Romney. We’ve fact-checked several claims from these ads. But for this fact-check, we’re returning to an ad put out by the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy arm of the Institute for Energy Research, which is connected to the oil industry. "Since Obama became president, gas prices have nearly doubled," the ad says. "Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska. He gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra, which then went bankrupt. And he blocked the Keystone pipeline. So we will all pay more at the pump. "Obama's energy secretary said we need to, quote, 'boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.’ That's $9 a gallon. … Tell Obama, we can’t afford his failing energy policies." We’ve fact-checked whether Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska (Half True -- he opposed it in some parts), whether he gave millions of dollars to Solyndra (a federal program for alternative energy did), and whether Energy Secretary Steven Chu said gas prices should be at European levels (yes, but it was before he joined the administration). The ad is right that gas prices have doubled (more than doubled, in fact) since Obama took office in 2009. The average price for gasoline was $1.90 in January 2009; now it's $3.98, according to the Energy Information Administration. Here, we wanted to explore the ad’s larger point, that Obama’s policies on Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone are contributing to those higher gas prices. Energy exploration in Alaska The ad’s first claim is that Obama "opposed exploring for energy in Alaska." We found in a previous fact-check that while Obama opposes exploration in some parts of Alaska, his administration has approved drilling in other parts. Specifically, Obama has opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a large nature preserve (roughly the size of South Carolina) managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge is a protected area for wildlife including caribou, polar bears and gray wolves. But the Obama administration recently approved a plan for Shell Oil to drill in the Chukchi Sea, off the northwest coast of Alaska, giving the green light to Shell’s contingency plans for cleaning up any spills. The company called that a "major milestone" and said it hopes to drill up to three wells there this summer. The company also has plans for two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska’s northern coast. The administration approved Shell’s disaster response plan for that area in March. But if Obama had given a green light to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, would gas prices be lower today? Not according to the evidence we reviewed. A 2008 study done by the independent Energy Information Administration for the late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, found that it would take 10 years to actually produce oil from the area. And that’s only if there were no protracted legal battles, environmental challenge or delays in getting government permits. So even if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the day he was inaugurated, there’s no way oil in the ground there would have made it to gas pumps in 2012. Solyndra Heard of Solyndra? It was a solar panel manufacturer that won government loan guarantees but then went belly up. We looked into Solyndra when we fact-checked an earlier political ad that said Obama showered special favors on his political friends. The particular charge of cronyism got a Mostly False from the Truth-O-Meter. Solyndra's loan application predated the Obama administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal. We did find that the administration tried to hurry the process, but the evidence pointed to the Obama team wanting to brag about green jobs efforts, not to enrich political cronies. Many private investors also lost money on the Solyndra deal. Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 to build and sell a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that were cheaper and worked better than traditional flat panels. Designed for rooftops, the panels were intended to generate electricity to power buildings like warehouses and retail stores. (Read more details about Solyndra’s rise and fall here.) Solyndra walked away from $529 million in federal loans, according to the most recent numbers from the U.S. Department of Energy. But Solyndra was an energy company that focused on generating electricity for buildings -- not gasoline for cars. We searched for any connection between Solyndra and gas prices or even just cars and came up empty. The Keystone XL pipeline The ad says Obama blocked the Keystone pipeline. Obama did block the Keystone XL, an addition to an existing pipeline so that oil sands (also known as tar sands or bituminous sands) could be moved from Canada to refineries near Houston, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico. Because the pipeline crosses the U.S. border, the State Department must sign off. Back in November, the State Department said it would delay a decision while environmental concerns about the pipeline were addressed. Back then, the pipeline was set to cross over drinking water sources in Nebraska, and people were asking TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline project, for an alternate route. The company has since said it would work with officials to shift the route. But environmentalists have still said the pipeline shouldn’t be built at all, because oil sands are harder to clean up when spilled and cost more to turn into gasoline. Then Congress put new deadlines into play, passing a law that said the Obama administration had to make a decision on the pipeline by February. Obama said that wasn’t enough time for a thorough environmental review and rejected the pipeline. The ad again suggests the delay of the pipeline is somehow responsible for today’s high gas prices. Since the pipeline was only proposed in 2008 with a then-projected opening of 2013, it’s hard to see how gas prices in 2012 would be lower. (PolitiFact Ohio also looked in detail the question of whether Keystone approval would cause gas prices to drop in the near term; they ruled that claim False.) Whether Keystone will reduce gas prices in the future is a contested point that we won’t settle in this fact-check. TransCanada’s analyst said it would bring down gas prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, according to Forbes. But environmentalists have seized on arguments that the pipeline could drive gas prices up, by giving Canadian oil an outlet to world markets through the Gulf of Mexico and bypassing U.S. customers. (The Christian Science Monitor explored these issues in some detail.) Greg Laskoski, a senior petroleum analyst with GasBuddy.com, said Keystone had the closest connection to gas prices, but even that connection was far from simple and more oriented toward future prices. Lower-priced Canadian oil could be of some benefit to refineries in the United States, but that assumes it stays in the United States and isn’t sold to foreign countries. "It’s not as simplistic as some of these sound bites make it out to be," he said. None of the above We contacted the American Energy Alliance to ask them about the connection between these issues and today’s gas prices. Spokesperson Benjamin Cole said that Obama’s overall policies are hostile to the domestic oil and gas industry, and that markets have reacted with increased prices. (We should note that’s a more subtle point than is made in the 30-second ad.) Not everyone sees it that way, though. Obama’s energy policies have been "surprisingly constructive," said Michael Levi, an expert on energy with the Council for Foreign Relations, in a March op-ed for ForeignPolicy.com. In an article titled "The Driller in Chief," Levi argued that Obama’s regulations are aimed at "dumb and preventable accidents" that would "do far more to set back U.S. oil and gas development than some smart minimum standards set out at the federal level." Getting back to today’s pump prices, the experts we spoke with were dubious about the impact of any of the above issues -- drilling in Alaska, Solyndra, the Keystone pipeline -- on today’s gas prices. Gas prices reflect the cost of oil on world markets and tend to reflect long-term trends, expectations for economic growth and geopolitical concerns. One example: Rising tensions with Iran, a major oil exporter. "Looking at this year, what’s affected prices are the issues with Iran," said Jessica Brady, a spokesperson for the travel organization AAA, which monitors gas prices. What about drilling in Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone? "Really, none of those three issues have had an impact on the gas prices we’ve been paying," she said. Laskoski of GasBuddy.com said a president’s power over gas prices comes mostly from reducing regulations for domestic exploration and refining, as well as discouraging speculation in the oil market. But even those powers are somewhat limited. "Those are things that can be done that can bring reductions (in prices)," Laskoski said. "All of those things combined might help lower gas prices, but I don’t know how you can quantify it." Our ruling The American Energy Alliance connects today’s higher gas prices to a grab bag of Obama’s energy policies. We can’t see how the failing of Solyndra -- a solar panel company that focused on powering commercial buildings -- has any connection with today’s gas prices. On Alaska, if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (which, to be clear, he opposes), actual production would still be at least six years away, and that’s a best-case scenario. The Keystone pipeline, meanwhile, is more directly related to gas prices, but even that project would have more impact on future gas prices, not today’s higher prices. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14060	"One in three American women will have had an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/23/naral-pro-choice-america/flawed-naral-virginia-claim-1-3-women-will-have-ab/	NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia says abortions may be more common than you think. "One in three American women will have had an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45," the group says on its website. Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for the group, said the figure comes from a 2011 study by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to birth control and abortions. Guttmacher’s research often is cited by people on both sides of the abortion issue. The goal of Guttmacher’s study was to update its 1992 estimate that 43 percent of U.S. women would have at least one abortion by the time they turn 45. Abortion rates had declined since 1992, and researchers wondered whether that meant that the percentage of women who would have an abortion at some point in their lives also had dropped. We should note that the lifetime incidence estimate is different from the overall abortion rate in the U.S., which measures how many women underwent the procedure during a given year. A woman who has had two abortions, for example, would be counted in the abortion rate twice. But she would be counted only once in computing the lifetime incidence of abortions. Guttmacher updated its estimate through a complicated process. It surveyed nearly 9,500 women in 2008 using formulas that took into account their ages and whether they had undergone a first abortion to come up with its lifetime incidence estimate. Guttmacher concluded "the cumulative first-abortion rate increases with age, and women aged 40 and older had a rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women." "Put differently, an estimated 30.1% of women aged 15–44 in 2008 will have an abortion by age 45 if exposed to prevailing abortion rates throughout their reproductive lives," the report said. That’s close to the one-in-three incidence, or 33 percent, NARAL cites. But there’s a caveat. Guttmacher said its estimate stands as long as "prevailing abortion rates" continue. The abortion rate, however, has not held steady. According to Guttmacher, it fell from 19.4 per 1,000 women in 2008 - when the lifetime incidence estimate was made - to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women in 2011, the latest figures available. This raises the question - as our fellow fact checkers at PolitiFact Texas and The Washington Post have noted - of whether Guttmacher’s estimate based on 2008 data remains relevant. The answer is, no one knows. Rachel Jones, co-author of the Guttmacher report, told us in an email that it’s possible - but far from certain - that the percentage of women expected to have an abortion before age 45 would go down with the abortion rate. Jones said Guttmacher plans to take a another look at the lifetime incidence of abortions. "We will not have an updated estimate for several years," she said. Our ruling NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia says "one in three American women will have had an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45." That’s roughly the estimate the Guttmacher Institute made five years ago based on 2008 data. Guttmacher said its estimate would stay solid as long the nation’s abortion rate in 2008 remained constant. The abortion rate has dropped, however, and that draws into question whether the percentage of women who will undergo the procedure at least once also has gone down. The answer is unknown; research has not been updated. Although there’s a basis for NARAL’s claim, the statistic it cites as fact actually is an estimate that might be outdated. So we rate NARAL’s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/752ad6c8-a416-4962-97f6-af84e29b7ecc	None	NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia	None	None	None	2016-05-23T00:00:00	2016-05-16	['United_States']

pomt-03289	"This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/02/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-year-best-start-private-sector-j/	During a July 30, 2013, visit to an Amazon.com facility in Chattanooga, Tenn., President Barack Obama gave another in a series of speeches on the economy. At one point, Obama said, "This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999." We decided to check his math. We looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for private-sector employment to measure the change between December and the following June of every year since 1999. (June was the most recent month for which data was available when Obama gave his speech.) Here’s the summary: Year (endpoint) Change in private-sector jobs, December-June 2013 +1,234,000 2012 +1,146,000 2011 +1,209,000 2010 +344,000 2009 -3,876,000 2008 -861,000 2007 +688,000 2006 +1,109,000 2005 +1,211,000 2004 +1,111,000 2003 -366,000 2002 -531,000 2001 -773,000 2000 +953,000 1999 +1,296,000 As the chart shows, the total for 2013 is indeed the highest since 1999. However, we’ll take this opportunity to note a caveat that’s often overlooked in the discussion of employment statistics: The figures released by the BLS actually represent the midpoint in a range. BLS obtains these numbers through a survey of businesses and government agencies, and as with any survey, there’s a margin of sampling error. BLS told us that for private-sector employment figures, the standard margin of error for a six-month comparison of this sort is 106,370 jobs on either side. This means, for instance, that if the reported change in jobs is 1,000,000, the actual change is assumed to be somewhere within the range of 893,630 to 1,106,370 jobs. This point may seem esoteric, but it’s relevant for the comparison Obama’s making because several other years since 1999 have produced job increases very close to the gain of 1,234,000 during the first six months of 2013. In the three years noted in italics in the chart -- 2012, 2011 and 2005 -- the gain in private-sector jobs fell shy of the 2013 amount by fewer than 106,370. Such cases are analogous to an election poll with a margin of error of 3 percentage points that shows one candidate two points ahead of the other. Such races are deemed too close to call. So too, technically speaking, is the contest for which six-month period created the biggest gain in private-sector jobs -- 2013, 2012, 2011 or 2005. Of course, three of these four years came on Obama’s watch. One -- 2005 -- came under President George W. Bush. Our ruling Obama said, "This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999." The official statistics show that more jobs were created in the first six months of 2013 than in any equivalent period going back to 1999, but it’s worth noting that three other years came very close to the amount gained in 2013 -- so close that they were within the survey’s margin of error. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-08-02T09:25:24	2013-07-30	['None']
pomt-01312	"Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren’t needed."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-attacks-rick-scotts-rape-crisis-cent/	In the homestretch, Charlie Crist is pushing hard for the women’s vote in his battle against Gov. Rick Scott. Crist has vowed to protect abortion rights and fight for equal pay for women for months. Scott has attacked Crist for taking money from strip club owners. Now a TV ad attacks Scott’s record on funding rape crisis centers. "No one saw it coming. With the stroke of a pen, Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren't needed. But they’ve helped over a million Florida women who’ve been sexually assaulted get care, counseling and legal help. These centers were a place for women who have nowhere else to turn. And Rick Scott turned his back on every single one of them." (Technically the Florida Democratic Party released the ad, but the Crist campaign has promoted it.) The ad leaves viewers with the impression that Scott completely rejected funding for rape crisis centers, a serious attack against the governor. Did Scott veto funding for 30 rape crisis centers and say that the centers weren’t needed? Scott’s veto The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Additionally, some money comes from the Attorney General’s Office, and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money. In the fine print, the ad cites a TV report from April 2012. In 2012, Scott vetoed $1.5 million of additional money for the rape crisis centers. The 30 centers still received $1.4 million from the Trust Fund and $500,000 from the attorney general. The Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, which lobbies on behalf of the centers, issued a statement criticizing the veto, "especially when the need for increased funding is so clear, waiting lists for core services are growing, and programs can’t meet the needs of those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence." Scott’s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew much scrutiny -- especially in left-leaning websites. The TV ad says "Scott said the centers weren’t needed" but that’s not actually a reference to a direct quote by Scott. We found no statement by Scott to suggest he thought the centers were unnecessary -- only that he thought the new funding wasn’t necessary. The Crist campaign points to a statement by Scott’s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright, who told the Huffington Post, "This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs. There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren’t already being met." Scott, while attending an event for Crime Victims Rights Week, said he thought the centers were adequately funded, not that they were unnecessary. "We have increased funding for domestic violence. We have money that goes into rape crisis centers already," Scott said, according to a column in the Palm Beach Post. "So it was additional money that was already funded." Scott later recommended an increase in funding There’s more to the story, though. Advocates for the rape crisis centers met with state staff after the veto, and the next year Scott recommended additional money. "There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget," said Jennifer Dritt, director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violent, who spoke with PolitiFact Florida in September. "We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013." Scott highlighted his funding boost for rape crisis centers in a 2013 press release, which included praise by Dritt: "This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida’s citizens, and we’re grateful for his commitment," Dritt said. The increase in money allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services, Dritt told PolitiFact Florida. Under Scott, the $2.5 million remained in the budget for a second year in a row in 2014. Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials in September, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide under Crist and Scott: Legislative session Money from state AG (usually from general revenue) Other general revenue Trust Fund Total 2007-Crist $400,000 0 $1.5 million $1.9 million 2008-Crist $400,000 0 $2 million $2.4 million 2009-Crist $250,000 0 $2 million $2.25 million 2010-Crist $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2011-Scott $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2012-Scott $500,000 0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature $1.4 million $1.9 million 2013-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million 2014-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million Our ruling A TV ad on behalf of Crist said "Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren’t needed." The ad omits that Scott vetoed an increase in funding for the centers in 2012. He never said the centers weren’t needed -- he said that particular extra $1.5 million wasn’t needed. The ad omits that in 2013 he supported a $2.5 million increase, which also remained in the budget in 2014. The ad overall is misleading because it fails to make it clear that funding for rape crisis centers increased under Scott's watch. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01670	Documents released by Edward Snowden reveal that American, British and Israeli intelligence agencies worked together to create the Islamic State.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/19/blog-posting/edward-snowden-leaked-nsa-documents-show-us-israel/	Edward Snowden’s 2013 leak of classified NSA documents is perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists -- it has intrigue, still-unreleased documents, and the NSA as "Big Brother." So it’s no surprise to see Snowden’s name attached to the increasingly popular idea that America and Israel created ISIS. On July 16, Bahrain’s Gulf Daily News reported that "Edward Snowden has revealed that the British and American intelligence and the Mossad (Israel’s intelligence agency) worked together to create the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)." This operation, they said, was codenamed "Hornet’s Nest." And as recently as Aug. 18, the Palestinian Authority insisted that the Islamic State is a Zionist plot by the United States and Israel. The United States, though, has been bombing the Islamic State in Iraq for more than a week; not quite ally behavior. It would have been easy to dismiss this theory off-hand as another hoax emerging from the general lack of information about the Islamic State -- like the allegations that President Barack Obama released Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in 2009, which we rated False. But we wanted to trace this conspiracy theory to its source to see whether or not it has legs. The taxonomy of a hoax In their refutation of the Hornet’s Nest story, Time points out that as early as June, Iranian sources have been accusing America of creating the Islamic State. On June 18, the Iranian Fars News Agency quoted Iran’s top commander, Hassan Firouzabadi, blaming the Islamic State on the West. "The (Islamic State) is a move by Israel and the U.S. to create a safe margin for the Zionists against the resistance forces in the region," Firouzabadi said. The U.S. and Israel, he continued, are reacting to "the recent victories of President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria" and "in Iraq." Time -- along with major American news sources, Al Jazeera, Daily News Egypt, the UN, and several other Middle Eastern countries -- say that the Islamic State is an offshoot of al-Qaida. In fact, we wrote last week about how al-Qaida rejected the Islamic State in part because of ideological differences and disputes over authority. That’s not to say America is completely blameless when it comes to the Islamic State -- the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the weapons deals it struck to try to bring down Assad may have all played a part in ISIS’s rise. But there’s no evidence of an American, British and Israeli plot to create ISIS. Yes, this is a conspiracy theory The only lucid defense of the idea that Western intelligence agencies created the Islamic State intentionally comes from the Center for Research on Globalization (CRG), a Canadian website that bills itself as an alternative news source, but has advanced specious conspiracy theories on topics like 9/11, vaccines and global warming. Kurt Nimmo, writing for the CRG through InfoWars, had four points defending the plausibility of the idea that America and Israel helped create the Islamic State. First, he claims that Baghdadi was radicalized at a U.S. military detention facility from 2005 to 2009. Baghdadi may have been radicalized by his earlier detainment by the United States and his subsequent detainment by the Iraqi government, but the Defense Department says Baghdadi was not a U.S. prisoner during the period that Nimmo mentions. Second, Nimmo quotes a Jordanian official claiming that "the U.S., Turkey and Jordan were running a training base for the Syrian rebels in the Jordanian town of Safawi." But that’s a mischaracterization -- the article Nimmo links to clarifies that the fighters "became members of the ISIS after their training," meaning they weren’t trained expressly to be members of the Islamic State. Third, Nimmo quotes an article depicting Baghdadi as the latest in a decades-long CIA program of successful mind control, including Rev. Jim Jones, the founder and leader of Peoples Temple. That article actually acknowledges that there’s no record that Baghdadi was "held and treated by a secret CIA mind-control unit at Camp Bucca from 2004 until 2009," but argues that, obviously, those records would have been destroyed. That counts as a conspiracy theory in our book. Fourth and finally, Nimmo quotes an Islamic State member who claims that all current al-Qaida affiliates "work for the CIA," with no evidence besides his word. So where does Snowden come in? If there were documents revealing Operation Hornet’s Nest, they’d probably be in Snowden’s NSA cache -- but they aren’t. Two weeks ago, blogger Alan Kurtz went in-depth on the genesis of the Snowden-Islamic State hoax, tracing it to a July 6 post in Arabic on the German domain shababek.de. From there, the claim spread across Middle Eastern papers, including the Fars News Authority and the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and eventually made it across the Atlantic to the CRG and InfoWars. Most of these articles referenced other articles that didn’t name sources, but the IRNA, in response to Time’s critique, pointed toward a story in The Intercept, a startup by journalist Glenn Greenwald. Greenwald’s First Look Media is one of three holders of Snowden’s NSA files, along with The Guardian and Washington Post writer Barton Gellman. But, Kurtz points out, there’s no mention of Operation Hornet’s Nest on The Intercept. Greenwald himself tweeted that he’s "never heard him (Snowden) say any such thing, nor have I ever heard any credible source quoting him saying anything like that." WikiLeaks and Snowden’s ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner also tweeted refutations of the hoax -- for us, the final nails in the coffin. Our ruling Middle Eastern publications have been circulating a rumor that Snowden’s NSA leak reveals "Operation Hornet’s Nest," an American, British and Israeli plot to create the Islamic State to destabilize the Middle East. This isn’t the first time Iranian publications have mischaracterized the Islamic State as an American creation, but it is the first time Snowden’s name has been attached. Sources with access to Snowden’s documents have directly refuted the hoax. The Islamic State started as an al-Qaida offshoot, and there’s no reason to believe otherwise.

pomt-08962	"I never called for a partition" of Iraq.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/21/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-he-never-called-partition-iraq/	With fresh questions being raised about how to configure Iraq's government, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about a proposal that he advocated in 2007. "You once advocated for a three-way partition of Iraq because you were not confident that Iraq's government was capable of having a strong central government," ABC This Week host Jake Tapper said to Biden during a July 18, 2010, interview. Tapper then played a video of Biden speaking from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, in which Biden said, "The most basic premise of President Bush's approach, that the Iraqi people will rally behind a strong central government headed by Maliki, in fact, will look out for their interests equitably, is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It will not happen in anybody's lifetime here, including the pages." Asked Tapper: "Is it possible that you were right back then that it is just impossible to have a centralized government?" Biden responded by taking issue with the word "partition" -- which was often used to describe Biden's plan at the time -- saying it was never about breaking Iraq into three separate countries. "I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition," Biden said. "I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions." "It was to allow them more autonomy," Biden said, "...And so what's happening here is, there is an election that's taken place. And what happened-- there's 325 plus members of what they call their core, their parliament. And no one party won more than 91 seats. The two major parties, one won 89 and one won 91 seats. That's Maliki and Allawi, Iraqiya and the State of Law, they call them. "They're in negotiations right now to figure out how to allocate the power within that government. In other words, share power. And it is about just that. And it's underway. And it's going to happen. There will be a central government with control of its foreign policy, with control of the military. But you will see that there are going to be significant amounts of autonomy in each of the areas that exist in these provinces. That's what their constitution calls for." Check the headlines in 2007, and it's clear that the word "partition" or "soft partition" was often used to describe Biden's proposal, which called for boundaries to be drawn for the country's Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. And so we decided to check his claim that he never called for a partition. Biden's strategy was first outlined in an op-ed piece for the New York Times on May 1, 2006, which Biden co-wrote with Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations: "The idea, as in Bosnia, is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it, giving each ethno-religious group — Kurd, Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab — room to run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in charge of common interests." The plan, they wrote would be to "establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection." "Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing," Biden wrote. "But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq." In 2007, Biden and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, successfully shepherded a nonbinding, "sense of the Senate" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions with a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23. The resolution called for the U.S. to "actively support a political settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions." And last, we point you to the fuller comments Biden made from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, when Biden said the idea that the Iraqi people would rally behind a strong central government was "fundamentally and fatally flawed." As an alternative, Biden said, "You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. You separate the parties. You give them breathing room. Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility. "Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for. I can't guarantee that my strategy will work, but I can guarantee that the road the president (Bush) has us on leads to nowhere with no end in sight." Biden addressed the "partition" issue head-on in an Oct. 3, 2007 op-ed co-written with Gelb for the Washington Post: "Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue." So is it fair to call Biden's plan a call to "partition" Iraq? Certainly Biden advocated carving out three semi-autonomous regions. In that sense, we could see why many characterized Biden's proposal as a "soft partition." But the word "partition" carries heavy political implications, namely the creation of three separate nations. And that was never Biden's plan. He consistently upheld the idea of one Iraq with a central government, albeit a more modest one responsible for such things as defense, foreign affairs and sharing oil revenues. That's an important distinction. We rate his claim True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-07-21T11:51:18	2010-07-18	['Iraq']
pomt-03918	"You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Wisconsin Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on," but "you can bring a gun up there."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/24/peter-barca/wisconsin-assembly-allows-audience-bring-guns-not-/	Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca was railing against Assembly Republicans during an interview on Feb. 19, 2013. "Step by step by step, they're dismantling people's involvement in their democracy. And I think it's wrong," the Kenosha Democrat told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board. Then Barca made a startling claim about rules in the Assembly gallery, where the general public can watch the Assembly in action. "You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the gallery to take notes of what's going on. That's outrageous," he charged. "But, yet you can bring a gun up there. It doesn't even equate. You can exercise your Second Amendment rights, but not your First Amendment rights." So, citizens who want to observe their elected representatives at the state Capitol can bring a firearm into the Assembly gallery -- but not an iPad or a pencil and paper? Was Barca going ballistic? Let's lock and load the Truth-O-Meter. New rules In January 2013, about a month before Barca made his claim, he and GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos announced they had agreed on new operating procedures for the Legislature's lower chamber. Most any bipartisan agreement would be news, given that Republicans control the Assembly and Senate and hold the governor’s office. In an effort to avoid all-night sessions, the two Assembly leaders said they would meet before each Assembly session to set time limits on debate for each bill. And they'd use a time clock for each speech. But separate from the bipartisan deal, the Republican majority in the Assembly adopted stricter rules on members of the public in the Assembly's overhead viewing galleries. No recording devices, signs or hats would be allowed, the Journal Sentinel reported. And remaining in place from the 2011-2012 legislative session was a provision allowing people with a valid permit to carry concealed weapons in the Assembly gallery. (The Senate, by the way, prohibits guns -- as well as laptops, still photography and video or audio recordings -- in its gallery.) The Assembly’s new prohibitions on recording devices were decried by Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit group dedicated to open government. He noted in an opinion article that the Open Meetings Law passed by the Legislature in 1977 directs all state and local governmental bodies in Wisconsin to "make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting," so long as this does not cause disruption. How common are these various restrictions in public galleries in legislative chambers? Angela Andrews of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us she was not aware of any state legislative body that prohibits pencils and paper, and not aware of any that prohibits audio and video recording devices. Fewer than 10 state capitol buildings allow guns, she said. Barca’s claim So, it’s clear Barca is correct in saying guns are allowed in the audience gallery of the Assembly; no change has been made since that rule took effect in the previous legislative session. But what about the other two parts of his claim? Check two portions of the Legislative Reference Bureau’s summary of Assembly Resolution 4, the new rules adopted by the GOP majority in January 2013: "No individual may do any of the following in the visitor galleries: lean over or put any object over the balcony; use a laptop or other computer device; stand except for prayer or pledge of allegiance or as otherwise permitted by the presiding officer; use recording devices of any kind; use cell phones or pagers …." The laptop or computer device part pretty clearly prohibits the iPad, Apple’s mobile computing device, in the Assembly gallery. "No individual in the visitor galleries may use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor." That’s an explicit ban on devices, but there’s no reference to jotting notes. Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us that Barca’s key point in making his claim was that "there is a lengthy list of items and behaviors – many of them not remotely disruptive – that are banned in the gallery or were discussed in meetings and in the floor speeches as being disruptive, while a visitor can bring a weapon into the gallery with no repercussions." Kit Beyer, spokeswoman for GOP speaker Vos, told us of the new rules: "Nowhere does it say that an observer in the gallery cannot have a piece of paper or a pencil." Aiming for clarity on the pencil and paper question, we checked with experts. Madison attorney Christa Westerberg, vice president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said it’s not clear that the new rules would prohibit a pencil and paper in the gallery for taking notes. Chris Ahmuty, the non-lawyer executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said he has concerns about the new gallery rules but doesn’t think they prohibit a pencil and paper. But Madison media lawyer Robert Dreps had a different take. He said it’s possible to construe a pencil as a recording device. More importantly, nobody but the Assembly can say what its rules actually mean. "Because it’s a legislative rule, it means, ultimately, what the Legislature says it means," Dreps said. Our rating Barca claimed: "You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on," but "you can bring a gun up there." He is right that the Assembly audience gallery allows guns and not iPads, but it’s debatable at best whether he’s right that Assembly rules prohibit a pencil and paper.

pomt-00487	"America’s hard-working agricultural producers … have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/09/sonny-perdue/retaliatory-tariffs-take-heavy-toll-farmers/	As President Donald Trump’s trade war wages on, we decided to check in on the most affected sectors. U.S. Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue said farmers, who will receive $12 billion in aid, were particularly affected by the dispute. "America’s hard-working agricultural producers have been treated unfairly by China’s illegal trading practices and have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs," Perdue said in a USDA press release on July 26. We’ll leave aside the question of whether the retaliatory tariffs are any more illegal than the initial U.S. tariffs on imports. But we were interested in the second half of his claim: Have agricultural producers taken a disproportionate hit? The Agriculture Department pointed out that 37 percent of U.S. exports facing retaliatory tariffs are agricultural exports. Those are the tariffs as of July 31, 2018 coming from China, the European Union, India, Turkey, Mexico and Canada. That’s disproportionate to the total goods the United State exports: about 10 percent are agricultural goods, according to the USDA’s 2017 data. It’s hard to measure the exact numbers, though. That’s because tariffs are listed individually by the governments that issue them (in this case, not the United States), and because the United States doesn’t keep close tabs on exports. USDA calculated the 37 percent figure using official import customs data from the retaliating partner through a private third party, Global Trade Atlas. "Export data is notoriously bad," Laura Baughman, president of the Trade Partnership, told us in July. "It’s inaccurate because people don’t necessarily report it very carefully, since you are not assessing tariffs on exports." However, the agricultural industry is on average much more dependent on world markets than other industries, according to David Laborde, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. Exports comprise 10 percent of total GDP in the United States, whereas they comprise about 20 percent of GDP in the American agricultural sector. That fraction is even higher for crops like cotton (76 percent is exported), soybeans (50 percent) and wheat (46 percent), according to USDA. About 16 to 17 percent of exports to China are agricultural goods, so any conflict with China (like the ongoing one) takes a heavy toll on agriculture, Laborde said. He calculated that 86.8 percent of agricultural exports to China are impacted by retaliatory tariffs while 36.9 percent of the non-agricultural exports are covered. Farmers face two additional aggravators: their products are easily replaceable and they’re an easy political target. One ton of U.S. soybeans is a nearly perfect substitute to one ton of Brazilian soybeans, Laborde pointed out. But high-tech medical equipment (another type of products exported to China) is difficult to substitute, so Chinese consumers are more willing to endure the tariff. And from a political economy point of view, Laborde said it made sense for China to maintain pressure on farmers in particular, as a core constituency for the Trump administration. Our ruling Perdue said, "America’s hard-working agricultural producers … have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs." It’s difficult to measure the impact of tariffs on the economy and particularly hard to measure the impact of retaliatory tariffs on exports. That said, the economy sets up agricultural producers to bear the brunt of tariffs. Exports are doubly important for the agricultural sector’s GDP as for the country’s GDP. USDA calculated that 37 percent of exports facing tariffs are agricultural goods, whereas agricultural goods comprise 10 percent of total exports. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-03520	On oil drilling off Virginia's coast.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/03/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffre-flip-flops-offshore-oil-drilling/	Republicans, who have long called for oil drilling off Virginia’s coast, were not thrilled late last month when Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe joined their cause. "Terry McAuliffe, once again, stuck his finger in the wind to be sure he says whatever voters want to hear," said Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. "In 2009, when he was running in a liberal Democratic primary, he was absolutely against offshore drilling. Now, in 2013, McAuliffe realized that even Democrats are for offshore drilling and he can’t wait to jump on the bandwagon." The Republican Party of Virginia issued a news release accusing McAuliffe of doing "an about face." So we rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to see if McAuliffe’s position on offshore oil drilling has changed. The issue has become a perennial debate in Virginia. Supporters say drilling would enhance the state economy and help the U.S. become energy independent; opponents say it poses environmental risk and that credible information about the offshore supply of oil does not exist. At the start of the decade, Virginia was part of an Interior Department lease plan for offshore oil and gas development, but the leases were deferred until after 2017 in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In 2009, prior to the spill, McAuliffe made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. During a debate that May, he said offshore drilling should be done only for natural gas, not for crude oil. He said his position was identical to two other Democrats: then-Gov. Tim Kaine and Brian Moran, one of his opponents in the primary. "I've been consistent from the start of this campaign," McAuliffe said. "There was bipartisan legislation passed, signed by Governor Kaine, promoted by Governor Kaine, that says no oil drilling, no oil drilling and limited exploration for oil and natural gas off the state’s coast." The next day, McAuliffe stated in an online interview with The Washington Post, "I do not support drilling for oil off our coast." Now, let’s move forward. Kaine, during a successful 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate, changed his position on offshore drilling. In May 2013, he joined U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in introducing a bill that would allow oil and gas exploration off the state’s coast. McAuliffe said through a spokesman that he supported the legislation. "Terry has learned more about offshore drilling from experts in Virginia," spokesman Josh Schwerin told The Washington Post. "He thinks that because of technological progress we can now do it in a responsible fashion." We asked Schwerin three times to expound on his comment, but did not get a response. McAuliffe has clearly shifted on offshore oil drilling. We rate it a Full Flop.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2013-06-03T06:00:00	2013-05-22	['None']

On Oct. 3, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tweeted, "#WV has the highest overdose rate per capita of any state in our nation. That’s why I made sure the SUPPORT for Patients & Communities Act included a set aside for states like WV. This language more than tripled the amount of funding coming to our state for this coming year." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Here, we’ll focus on whether West Virginia "has the highest overdose rate per capita of any state in our nation." We turned to an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was collected and analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The data is from 2016. Manchin’s tweet wasn’t specific about whether he was referring to opioid overdoses specifically or overdoses generally. The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis includes data for both, so we looked at both categories. On both lists, West Virginia has the unhappy distinction of ranking No. 1. Here’s a chart showing the data for opioid overdoses specifically. The data looks at the number of overdoses per 100,000 population, which is an equivalent measure to per capita. The opioid overdose rate in West Virginia easily outpaces the second-ranking state, New Hampshire. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com As for overdoses overall, West Virginia finishes first, with Ohio ranking second. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Manchin said that West Virginia "has the highest overdose rate per capita of any state in our nation." Official government data shows that West Virginia ranks first per capita in both opioid overdoses specifically and in overdoses more generally. We rate the statement True.

pomt-08270	It’s hard to get people in Portland to vote yes on ballot measures, especially when there’s opposition.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/10/friends-voter-owned-elections/portlands-voter-owned-elections-failed-because-vot/	In 2005, the Portland City Council approved a campaign finance program to give candidates public money to run for office. It was supposed to get big money out of politics and let candidates focus on talking to voters, not raising campaign cash. It was considered very progressive and very Portland, and city commissioners said they would put the issue to voters in 2010. Last week, those voters rejected it by a slim margin. Heather Stuart, spokeswoman for the "Yes on 26-108" campaign, issued a statement the day after the election, expressing disappointment over the results. She said the other side had distorted the financial cost of the program, and she said that the campaign had suffered from the bad economy. Stuart also wrote this: "Historical data shows that it is always more difficult to get a ‘yes’ vote, especially in the face of organized opposition." The reporters at PolitiFact Oregon have been in the game long enough to know that, indeed, voters statewide tend to say no when the proposal on the ballot is confusing, is controversial or costs money. But Stuart’s implication that statewide skepticism played a role in sinking a campaign-funding measure solely in Portland is suspect. Portland isn't like the rest of Oregon. Portland, which exists mostly in Multnomah County -- with teeny bits in Washington and Clackamas counties -- likes to say yes. We have backup from Pat McCormick, a veteran of ballot measure battles, most recently on the losing side over tax-raising Measures 66 and 67. He was hard-pressed to think of a spending plan that Portland didn't like. "You have to do quite a bit to get to a 'no' on a money measure in this city," he said. Want more evidence? Let’s take a stroll through the votes of Multnomah County. (We’ll use this because elections usually are conducted by counties, and Portland is the most dominant city in Multnomah County. Where appropriate, we’ll cite Portland-only measures.) November 2010: County voters approved four of six statewide ballots measures, and five of seven county measures. County voters even approved the unpopular TriMet levy that failed because of opposition in Washington and Clackamas counties. And, finally, Portland voters weren’t afraid to embrace a property tax levy for new fire trucks and other emergency equipment. January 2010: Voters approved two statewide tax measures -- 66 and 67 -- by more than 70 percent. November 2008: County voters approved all three property tax levies on the ballot. They were for the Oregon Zoo, Portland Community College and children’s programs. November 2007: Voted yes on a statewide land-use rewrite, yes on a statewide tobacco tax that went down elsewhere; and yes to a city measure tweaking medical benefits for retired police and firefighters. May 2007: Of four wonky city measures on the ballot, voters said yes to all but one. (They opted to keep the city’s commission-style of government.) November 2006: County voters renewed a local levy to continue library services and to give Metro more money for fish and wildlife protection. Portland voters also approved a schools levy and a measure to reform the police and fire disability and retirement fund. (But people on the outer edges of the city and county, who tend to be more tight-fisted, said no to levies for Mt. Hood Community College, Reynolds School District and David Douglas School District.) February 2004: Voters issued a rare no on Ballot Measure 30, which would have enacted a temporary tax surcharge and other changes to avoid budget cuts. January 2003: But the year before, Multnomah was one of just five counties in Oregon to say yes to Ballot Measure 28, which again would have increased taxes temporarily to plug the budget. November 2002: Voters approved funding for children’s programs, parks and the county library. (Again, Portland voters in the Parkrose and Reynolds school districts said no to operating levies for those schools.) And so on. Readers, you get the picture. Stuart said money is key here, as well as the strength of opposition. And she’s right when saying that money measures, historically, have had some money behind them to send the message to voters. In this case, however, the "organized opposition" cited by Stuart spent one-fifth of what supporters did. Supporters spent $311,200, while the main opposition group spent $66,100. It was more than organized opposition or the bad economy or a general dislike of spending measures that defeated Voter Owned Elections, McCormick said. Voters really don’t like it when politicians go ahead and spend taxpayer money "and then come back and ask after the fact, ‘Was it OK that I spent your money on this?’" Which is what happened here. So the statement contains some element of truth -- but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Portland, as a city, is not one that says no a lot. We rate this claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05972	"Tennessee’s grocery tax is one of the highest in the nation."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/24/tennessee-democratic-party/democrats-say-tennessee-consumers-pay-among-nation/	The Tennessee Democratic Partyis backing an effort by its party leaders in the state House of Representatives to reduce the sales tax on food. Now Gov. Bill Haslam has introduced his own proposal to cut the tax. To show public support for the proposal, the party has an online petition on its website. The introduction says: "House Leader Craig Fitzhugh and Democrats are fighting for tax relief for working and middle class families by proposing a cut to Tennessee's unbearable grocery tax. Tennessee's grocery tax is one of the highest in the nation, and, especially in hard times, the grocery tax punishes families that are struggling to put food on the table." Fitzhugh, leader of the Democratic minority in the House, introduced a bill in the 2011 legislative session to cut the state sales tax on food from the current 5.5 percent to 4.5 percent. That bill got nowhere. In November, after state revenue had begun to improve, Democratic leaders announced a renewed push to cut the food tax. Fitzhugh introduced a new bill that would require the sales tax on food to be reduced by one-half the amount of money that officials certify as "surplus state revenue" (sales tax collected above the budgeted estimates). Given Tennessee’s heavy reliance on sales taxes to pay for public services -- the state does not have a general state income tax -- Democrats faced an uphill battle winning approval of a sales tax reduction on food. Republican leaders jumped on the proposal as unrealistic. But that changed Jan. 10, 2012, when Gov. Bill Haslam unveiled his own legislative agenda for the year, including a bill to lower the state sales tax on grocery by two-tenths of a point, to 5.3 percent, next year. He set a goal of cutting it to 5 percent in three years. With the governor’s backing, some reduction in the sales tax on food is likely. Their claim made us curious: Is it true that the Volunteer State’s grocery tax is one of the highest in the nation? Answering that question is a little complicated because sales taxes themselves are complicated. States tax different products at different rates and some don't put a tax on food. Also, sales tax rates can vary within a state because counties or cities can add their own taxes. Overall, sales tax rates paid by consumers in Tennessee are among the highest in the nation, according to groups that keep trackof the states. The groups also show that Tennessee is one of 15 states that either levy a state sales tax on food purchased in grocery stores or permit local governments to levy local sales taxes on food. Although the state portion of the sales tax is lower on qualified food purchases than on other purchases -- 5.5 percent versus 7 percent -- when combined with local sales taxes, Tennesseans still pay among the highest combined sales taxes on food in the nation. In most states, there are both state and local sales taxes levied on the purchase price of items and services. Local sales taxes vary widely by jurisdiction. In Tennessee, the state levies a 7 percent sales tax and most local governments are allowed to add between 1.5 and 2.75 percent on top of the state rate, for a maximum combined rate of 9.75 percent -- the amount paid by the customer, who rarely distinguishes between the state and local shares of the tax. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax research group that favors broad tax bases and low tax rates, estimates that the average local sales tax rate in Tennessee is 2.43 percent. The group ranks Tennessee’s combined state and local average sales tax of 9.43 percent as the highest among all the states. (Some cities or counties in other states have higher combined sales tax burdens within their jurisdictions but not statewide). However, the state has a different rate for some food purchases. Tennessee imposes a reduced state sales tax rate of 5.5 percent on qualified unprepared food purchased in grocery stores, as opposed to the full state sales tax rate of 7 percent. If you were just comparing state sales taxes on food, Tennessee’s 5.5 percent state sales tax rate on food would be fourth-highest in the nation, behind Mississippi’s 7 percent, Kansas’ 6.3 percent and Idaho’s 6 percent. Another wrinkle: Two of those states -- Kansas and Idaho -- provide food tax rebates to their lower-income residents. But from the consumer’s standpoint, the analysis doesn’t end there. Grocery shoppers don’t just pay the state sales tax; they also pay local sales taxes. In Tennessee, the combined rate ranges from 7 percent (the state’s 5.5 percent plus the lowest local rate of 1.5 percent) up to 8.25 percent (the state’s 5.5 plus the highest local tax rate of 2.75). Local tax rates vary widely by state. But given that the highest combined sales taxes paid by Tennnesseans on food is 8.25 percent, it appears that -- on a statewide basis -- Tennesseans do pay the highest or second highest taxes on food. Using the Tax Foundation’s list of the five states with highest combined sales tax rates (the list cited above in which Tennessee ranks as the highest in the nation), three of the Top 5 don’t tax food at all. The fifth highest, Oklahoma, has the slightly higher combined rate than Tennessee (8.66 percent) but it provides tax rebates for lower income families. Yet another wrinkle: States that do tax food have varying definitions of which foods are taxed. Prepared food purchased in restaurants is almost always taxable. And some food purchased in grocery stores is fully taxable, as are most non-food grocery items. Our ruling So, the national numbers back the Democrats' claim. Although the state provides a tax discount for qualified food purchases, Tennesseans still pay among the highest sales taxes on groceries. We rate the statement True.

pomt-13688	"The DNC hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule (primary) debates against (Bernie) Sanders," and the Clinton campaign is continuing this "ploy" against Donald Trump.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/31/paul-manafort/trump-campaign-chief-dnc-leak-proves-clinton-campa/	The day after Hillary Clinton wrapped up the Democratic nomination for president, Republican rival Donald Trump was already accusing her of "rigging" the presidential debates to coincide with NFL games in the fall. "As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!" Trump tweeted. Trump doubled down on his charge Sunday, telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that he "got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous" (which the NFL denies). Campaign chairman Paul Manafort echoed the complaint on NBC’s Meet the Press. "The DNC hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against (Bernie) Sanders, which have the least possible viewing audience. Mr. Trump’s saying, Look we want the maximum viewing audience," Manafort said. "We're not going to fall ploy to the Hillary Clinton ploy that she did against Bernie Sanders of trying to have the lowest viewing audience. We want the biggest." It is well-established that the Democrats held fewer primary debates on nights with a lighter audience and with more popular programming. However, Manafort’s statement overplays what’s in the DNC emails and ignores how presidential primary and general election debates are actually set. There is no evidence in leaked DNC emails that the Clinton campaign lobbied for weekend dates or fewer debates in her primary fight against Sanders. There is also no evidence that the Clinton campaign had any hand in the setting the debates between Trump and Clinton. A bipartisan commission released the chosen dates 11 months before Clinton and Trump secured the party’s nomination. Debating the Democratic debates We asked the Trump campaign for specific emails released by WikiLeaks that prove Manafort’s point about the Clinton campaign colluding to minimize debate viewership, but we didn’t hear back. Our own search turned up no smoking emails. The party announced it would host six debates in May 2015, and released in August dates for the first four square-offs — three of which fell on weekends. Many criticized the DNC for the paucity and poor timing of these debates, and experts we spoke with agreed that the schedule benefitted Clinton. Not only, however, do zero emails in the WikiLeaks DNC archive involve anything about the scheduling of these planned debates. There is also no proof of the Clinton campaign having any say over the dates. In most exchanges, DNC staffers are discussing logistics (i.e. asking MSNBC if anchor Chris Matthews would be willing to meet with donors and requesting expense invoices) or media coverage and backlash. Overall, there’s no evidence of intent to harm Sanders with the debates or collusion between the Clinton camp and the DNC, said Kathleen Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book Presidential Debates: The Challenge of Creating an Informed Electorate. Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan, commended the DNC for adding three more debates after a series of primary wins for Sanders in early 2016. He said the changed philosophy may be the best evidence that the DNC was listening to Democratic voters. A scuttled Fox debate Manafort may have been alluding to a few email threads that detail negotiations over a fourth Fox News debate in California that ultimately didn’t happen. While some backs-and-forth indicate a lack of enthusiasm, they do not show the DNC or the Clinton actively trying to schedule the debate to hurt Sanders. Former DNC chair Wasserman Schultz wasn’t thrilled about the idea at first, but her objection seemed to be Fox News hosting, not the idea of an extra debate in general. "Boy, they (Fox News) are laying it on thick," she wrote May 13. "The RNC would never do an MSNBC debate for the same reason that we shouldn't do this one." Negotiations nonetheless continued as the Clinton campaign and DNC seemed to be at odds with the Sanders campaign over whether the debate would be sanctioned by the party (which would give the DNC more control). Fox eventually sent invites to both camps with the DNC’s blessing, and Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs emailed the DNC May 18 notifying them that Sanders had accepted the invite. "Lol," responded DNC communications director Luis Miranda. Wasserman Schultz told her staffers that the Clinton declined to "take the bait" May 19, and the Clinton campaign declined Fox’s invite a few days later, squashing the possibility of a fourth debate. Wasserman Schultz addressed the criticism lobbed at her for the debates specifically in an May 18 email, pushing back on the notion she "put them on weekends so people wouldn’t see them" and arguing that the DNC worked with the networks and campaigns on the dates. "Debates were a success! And when he (Sanders) wanted more, she went to bat with the Clinton campaign and got more debates," Wasserman Schultz wrote. General confusion, not collusion Manafort’s second charge that Clinton had something to do with putting two general election debates on nights with football games is less credible. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a bipartisan organization that works independently of the campaigns. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker pointed out, the commission released its schedule in September 2015, long before Trump and Clinton became party nominees and long before the NFL released its schedule in April 2016. "The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debate. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result," the commission said in a statement. The Trump campaign’s charges are "absolutely baseless," said Alan Schroeder, a professor at Northeastern University who wrote Presidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV. "There is no rigging, and nothing different about this year's schedule from previous cycles," Schroeder told us. Kall of the University of Michigan said the commission does not consult the campaigns during the planning process. "They don’t talk to any of the campaigns. They come up with a schedule that works with the hosts and they also have to juggle religious holidays." Given that there are 256 NFL games from early September to December, Kall said, it would be near impossible to schedule a debate that wasn’t on a weekend or holiday and didn’t coincide with a game. Plus, it’s happened before, Jamieson reminded us. Take, for example, the last debate of the 2012 presidential election. It occurred Oct. 22, the same night as a Detroit Lions game against the Chicago Bears. It still pulled in 59.2 million viewers. Trump and Clinton’s sparring will likely draw even bigger audiences considering Trump’s ability to command press and public attention and Clinton’s decades-long tenure in the political limelight. Even with the NFL conflicts, Kall told us he expects at least 70 million if not 100 million viewers. In other words, Trump will probably get his maximum viewing audience. Our ruling Manafort said, "The DNC hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against Sanders" and the Clinton campaign is continuing this "ploy" against Trump. Experts agree the Democratic primary debate schedule was more advantageous to Clinton than Sanders, but there is no evidence in the DNC emails that show Clinton conspired to make this happen. As for the notion that Clinton rigged the presidential debate schedule ahead of the general election, experts told us it’s pretty absurd. The commission that plans the debates released its schedule six months before the NFL released theirs, and almost a year before Clinton and Trump became the Democratic and Republican nominees. We rate Manafort’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d3d7132-4bb2-4d4e-bb0a-96b66d4f2b0d	None	Paul Manafort	None	None	None	2016-07-31T18:36:27	2016-07-31	['Bill_Clinton', 'Democratic_National_Committee', 'Donald_Trump']

pomt-08535	"Exit polls indicate that Democrats get over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections."	true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/04/mark-hinkle/mark-hinkle-chairman-libertarian-party-says-exit-p/	Urging gay voters to give his party's candidates consideration, the chairman of the nation's Libertarian Party says that like battered spouses who repeatedly return to their aggressors, gay voters keep handing their votes to Democrats who abuse them. In a Sept. 23 press release, Chairman Mark Hinkle also says: "Exit polls indicate that Democrats get over 70 percent of" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) "votes in federal elections. Those voters must really love the Democrats' rhetoric, because they certainly aren't seeing action." Hinkle goes on to note that both the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy and a federal act defining marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman remain in place despite Democrats holding majorities in Congress. Gays tilt Democratic more than 70 percent of the time in U.S. elections? We sought more information. Wes Benedict, a Texan serving as the national party's executive director, responded with a Web link to a Nov. 26, 2008 article on exit polling of gay voters in the 2008 elections posted by the Williams Institute, a think tank at the University of California at Los Angeles that describes itself as advancing "sexual orientation law and public policy through rigorous, independent research and scholarship." The article, published in Bay Windows, which calls itself New England's largest GLBT newspaper, says gay voters leaned heavily to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama that November. The article says a review of more than 80,000 votes cast in 56 heavily gay precincts over 11 cities in five states and the District of Columbia found 79 percent of the voters casting ballots for Obama, 19 percent for Republican John McCain and 1.5 percent for other candidates. Separately, the article says, exit polling conducted on behalf of five TV networks and the Associated Press shows that among voters who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 70 percent voted for Obama, 27 percent for McCain and 3 percent for others--results we confirmed from a 2008 online post by CNN that also suggests 53 percent of non-gay voters favored Obama, 45 percent McCain. The article says that in 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry drew 77 percent of the LGB vote (a result we confirmed on CNN.com) and in 2000 Democrat Al Gore carried 70 percent of the LGB vote and in 1996 Bill Clinton, the Democratic president, carried 71 percent of the LGB vote. Next, we reached Patrick Egan, a New York University assistant professor of politics and public policy who has studied gay voting patterns. Egan said in an e-mail that gay voters "lean Democratic in federal elections largely because the Democratic Party has taken more pro-gay stances on a variety of gay rights issues." He said another reason gay voters tend to be pro-Democratic is that "gay people are more likely than the general population to be raised in liberal families. If we assume that the trait of homosexuality is more or less randomly distributed throughout the population, this means that gay people are more likely to come out," or declare their sexual orientation, "in families that are more tolerant. This tolerance affects gay people's views on everything, including party affiliation." Egan said he couldn't speak directly to the Libertarian Party's appeal to gay voters, but he would quibble with anyone blaming Democrats for stalled gay-favored legislation. "The blame for why few advances for gay rights have been achieved in this Congress has to be laid squarely on the Republican Party, not the Democrats," Egan writes. "Republicans have voted en masse against every proposed change in favor of gay rights, and in most cases have blocked movement on this legislation. (One way to think about this: if every Democratic member of Congress had instead been a Libertarian in this session, we still would have had the same standstill outcome.)" Perhaps, but we're not testing which party would best advance an agenda in this article. We rate the Libertarian Party's 70-percent-plus statement as True. This article has been updated to correct the year that Sen. John Kerry was the presidential nominee.

pomt-14263	Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance would have "opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times" if it hadn’t been overturned.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/08/dan-forest/nc-lt-gov-dan-forest-says-new-state-law-hb2-preven/	Conservative North Carolina lawmakers called a special legislative session in late March to overturn an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Charlotte that would’ve gone into effect April 1. They ended up adding a lot more to the bill. But the original motivation was to prevent Charlotte, or any other local government, from allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with in public accommodations – such places as government facilities, hotels, restaurants and movie theaters. That and some of the bill’s other provisions have led to national criticism, from late-night talk show jokes to a canceled Bruce Springsteen concert and the loss of 400 jobs in Charlotte after PayPal pulled out in protest. Republicans have shot back, saying the bill was a common sense solution to safety and privacy concerns. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a key supporter of the new law, commonly known as HB2, went a bit further than most. He tweeted a picture from PayPal’s website that showed a bathroom door in the background, with a sign designating the room for men. "This would be illegal under (the) Charlotte ordinance," Forest tweeted. He then doubled down, posting a screenshot of part of Charlotte’s now-defunct ordinance. "Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times when it removed exception for bath & locker rooms," Forest tweeted. It sounds odd. Charlotte officials say it’s completely untrue. Forest and his team, though, are sticking by their claims. Who is right? The answer isn’t relevant to Charlotte bathroom users anymore because the ordinance has been shot down, but it is relevant to the ongoing political fight over why Republicans felt compelled to overturn the ordinance. Private bathrooms First, let’s take a look at the claim that PayPal’s own gender-specific bathroom sign "would be illegal" in Charlotte if the city’s ordinance had been allowed to stand. It wouldn’t. Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance specifically said that "this section does not apply to a private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public." A PayPal corporate office is a private establishment. So no, it would not have been illegal for PayPal to have male and female restrooms in its own offices. By the same logic, Forest's statement that "(the) Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times" is demonstrably false. The anti-discrimination law would have applied only to public accommodations. Those include places like government buildings, restaurants and hotels. Specifically, Charlotte’s proposed ordinance said the "full and equal enjoyment" of such places must not "be refused, withheld from, or denied any person because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or national origin." Previously, that ordinance only included race, color, religion and national origin. The city had also banned sex-based discrimination, but in a separate section that specifically exempted bathrooms and other such facilities. That section was stricken in the new ordinance, which Forest also cited in favor of his argument. Public bathrooms Forest was wrong about private bathrooms, but what about public bathrooms? Would the Charlotte law have opened them to "all genders at all times?" Here, the question gets a little more complex since Charlotte did eliminate the existing ordinance that had singled out bathrooms and locker rooms for exemptions. In February, Rep. Dan Bishop – the Mecklenburg County Republican who ultimately sponsored HB2 – sent out an email with claims similar to the ones Forest is making now. City officials replied in a memo that such claims were "incorrect" and "counter to common sense." City Attorney Robert Hagemann said the right to have separate bathrooms is implied in society and doesn’t need a local ordinance to confirm it. He added that no other city or state with similar anti-discrimination rules has argued that anyone could go into any bathroom, and that Charlotte officials never wanted to argue that, either. Forest’s press secretary Jamey Falkenbury said the argument for an implied right might be true for some places, but Charlotte would’ve been different because it specifically removed that right from its laws. "When a legislative body removes an exception, they are indicating to the courts they do not want the former exception implied," he said. "Hypothetically, if a man who identifies as a man in Charlotte was tried for trespassing for being in a women's bathroom, you better believe that any criminal defense attorney worth their salt would raise this as a defense." But Hagemann said there would be wide-reaching consequences if Forest, Bishop and others were right that an all-inclusive protection for sex-based discrimination meant all bathrooms were opened to everyone. "I understand that a similar argument was used by Phyllis Schlafly and other opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment back in the late 1970s," he wrote in an email. "... And if their reasoning is correct, every employer covered by Title VII, including the State of North Carolina, could not provide separate restrooms for their employees since Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex in the workplace." Our ruling Forest, a vocal opponent of Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, said it would have "opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times." That is wrong. The ordinance would not have applied to private clubs or businesses – including PayPal, despite Forest’s claims to the contrary. The ordinance would have applied only to public accommodations. And while there’s disagreement on what might have happened with bathrooms in public accommodations, precedent is on Charlotte’s side. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03896	"Since January 2010, New Jersey has added 103,000 new private sector jobs. The last two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- have been the best two years of private sector job growth since 1999."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-private-sector-jobs-growing-ne/	When it comes to private-sector jobs, New Jersey’s numbers are just getting better and better, according to Gov. Chris Christie. Job growth in New Jersey was just one of the topics Christie highlighted Tuesday when he presented a $32.9 billion budget for fiscal year 2013-2014 to the state Legislature. "Since January 2010, New Jersey has added 103,000 new private sector jobs," Christie said. "The last two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- have been the best two years of private sector job growth since 1999." Is the state finally seeing some sustained job growth since the official end of the recession more than three years ago? We determined that the governor’s numbers are generally correct, but his timeframe is off slightly. Let’s look at official jobs numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total number of private-sector jobs in New Jersey in February 2010 – the first full month the governor was in office – was 3,197,600. The number in December 2012 was 3,300,800. That’s a net gain of 103,200 jobs. If we measure from January 2010 to December 2012, the net gain is 97,600 private-sector jobs. "While the Governor may have slipped in saying we grew 103,200 private sector jobs since January 2010, he has always otherwise cited the state’s job growth since February 2010, his first full month in office," spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail. "Aside from being the Governor’s first full month in office, February 2010 also is an important point in time because it marks the low point for private sector employment during the recession." Now let’s look at private-sector job growth during the past two years, since Christie said it’s the best it’s been since 1999. If 2011 and 2012 gains are combined, the total number of private-sector jobs added in New Jersey is 79,500 jobs (33,400 in 2011 and 46,100 in 2012), according to data from the BLS and Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. The combined total confirms that the two years are the best for private-sector job growth in New Jersey since 1999, when the state added 99,500 private-sector jobs. Overall the news is upbeat, Seneca told us. "This represents a strong and highly encouraging trend," Seneca said in an e-mail. "There is still a distance to go to recover all the private sector jobs lost during the recession (248,000 jobs were lost from the state’s previous peak level in January 2008 to the trough level reached in February 2010)." Seneca also noted that the nation’s private-sector job gains are quite a bit higher, but that has to do, in part, with "strong job growth in several of the energy producing states," he said. The liberal New Jersey Policy Perspective noted Friday that the state still has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. "New Jersey is still mired in the basement with the 4th highest unemployment rate in the nation. Worse, we’re one of only two states that saw its rate increase from 2011 (from 9.4 to 9.5)," NPP president Gordon MacInnes said in a statement after the BLS on Friday released the 2012 annual average unemployment rates for each state. "This should pour ice water on New Jersey’s leaders. The problem is not tax rates - the problem is jobs." Our ruling Christie said during his budget address Tuesday that, "Since January 2010, New Jersey has added 103,000 new private sector jobs. The last two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- have been the best two years of private sector job growth since 1999." The governor is right that New Jersey has gained 103,000 new private-sector jobs since 2010, but that’s counting from February 2010, his first full month in office. He cited job growth from January 2010. Christie also is correct that 2011 and 2012 represent the best two years of private-sector job growth since 1999, according to BLS data and calculations from a Rutgers University economist.

pomt-09736	U.S. taxpayers paid $71,500 per job created by the stimulus bill.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/19/lou-dobbs/Dobbs-claims-stimulus-jobs-cost-big-bucks/	The Obama administration recently announced its latest tally for jobs created by the economic stimulus bill, which caught the attention television host Lou Dobbs. "The White House today unveiled the first hard data on how many jobs the stimulus package has actually created," Dobbs reported on his CNN show Oct. 15, 2009. "The number according to the government -- you may want to write this down -- 30,383. That is the total number of jobs created by companies that received just over $2 billion in stimulus money. That works out to a cost of $71,500 of taxpayer money for each job apparently created." Dobbs' estimate sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the claim. But before we do that, a little stimulus 101. Shortly after he was sworn into Office, Congress passed a $787 billion bill meant to boost the economy, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The package included about $499 billion for new road projects, school construction and alternative energy projects, among other things -- all programs meant to create jobs. The remaining $288 goes to tax relief. On Oct. 15, the White House released the latest information on how that money is being spent. Dobbs is right that the administration estimates about 30,383 jobs have been created so far, and he's also right that about $2.172 billion of the total $499 in recovery dollars has been paid out for projects such as road construction. (All told, about $16 billion has been awarded, but not spent, on federal contracts so far.) We talked to Kevin Burke, senior producer for Lou Dobbs Tonight, about the math. Turns out Dobbs simply divided the amount paid -- about $2.2 billion -- by 30,383 jobs. That comes out to be approximately $71,500. (Burke explained that they did not use the $16 billion committed to projects because they only wanted to account for money that had actually been spent. Dividing $16 billion by 30,383 actually produces a much higher number - $526,610 to be exact). There is a caveat, however, which means that Dobbs's estimate may not show the entire picture. The job numbers reported by the administration are for positions created directly through federal contracts and do not account the broader impact as the money ripples through the economy. For example, the report reflects the number of workers hired to do a road construction project, but it does not take into account the workers hired or retained by an asphalt company supplying materials for the project. Those auxiliary effects of the stimulus are harder to quantify, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal economic think tank, but they have an impact because each extra dollar helps the economy. "People say, 'Paying people who are unemployed [in the stimulus bill] - how does that create jobs?'" he said. "It does, because without that money they might otherwise cut back on what they are consuming. That money does support the local grocery story, the mechanic, clothing stores." In economist-speak, the ripple effect Horney is talking about is officially known as the multiplier effect. It's a hallmark of Keynesian economics, which supports a government intervention in the market, and is an ongoing source of debate within the profession, said Donald Marron, president of Marron Economics and a visiting professor at Georgetown University. If you believe more jobs are created through the multiplier effect, than presumably Dobbs's cost per job estimate would be lower, he explained. If you're like Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, who thinks the multiplier effect is an "economic fallacy" because any jobs created require the government to borrow money out of the economy in the first place, Dobbs's estimate may be closer to the mark. Nevertheless, the economists we spoke with said his estimate likely left out some important details. For example, some of the money is presumably being used to produce more goods and services, not just jobs, said Harry Holzer, an economist with the Urban Institute and Georgetown University. "I think it's misleading because it ignores the indirect effects on the economy, it ignores the value of goods produced," Holzer said. So Dobbs is relying on the administration's estimate and he accurately reports the numbers. But his number is fuzzy for two reasons. First, the number of jobs created or saved by the stimulus may be higher than just the 30,383 created directly by the stimulus package because of the multiplier effect (although we recognize that economists disagree about that principle). But secondly, the math may be overly simple. Just because the government has handed out $2.2 billion in stimulus funding doesn't mean every penny has been used to create jobs. It could be used to purchase materials such as asphalt and concrete. So, while he's in the ballpark, it's a somewhat incomplete picture. We rate his claim Half True.

"People in both parties are upset by the fact that 80 percent of the American people haven’t gotten a pay raise since the crash," Clinton said. The December 2007 recession destroyed Arizona’s housing market, also drying up construction jobs. Hillary Clinton made a similar statement in a campaign advertisement in February, noting that Americans haven’t had a "raise in 15 years." PolitiFact found an increase in weekly earnings between January 2000 and January 2015, but median household income dropped between January 1999 and January 2014. Household income is a more complete measure of income growth, since it may include Social Security or income from investments. PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly True. But what about wages from the recession to now? We decided to look into Bill Clinton’s claim. Same salary Bill Clinton’s spokesman, Angel Urena, provided us with multiple studies done by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute on the issue. We reached out to the D.C. think tank directly, which analyzes the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau. "The statement is largely correct. Real, inflation-adjusted wages were stagnant for the bottom 80 percent of the wage distribution between 2007 and 2014," said Economic Policy Institute spokesman Dan Crawford. Real wages did increase 1.7 percent in 2015, but Crawford noted that was because of a one-time dip in inflation. Wage inequality still increased across the board in 2015. Other experts generally agreed with Bill Clinton’s claim. Bill Lester, an economic development professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed the Economic Policy Institute’s income data from 1973 to 2012. From 2008 to 2012, wages for the bottom 80 percent either declined or did not change at all. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, "80 percent of the American people haven’t gotten a pay raise since the crash." The former president is accurate. While there were modest increases in real wages and median weekly earnings in 2015, they come with asterisks. Inflation’s one-time decline in 2015 is an outlier. And, weekly wages leaves out other sources of income. Some households rely on sources outside of wages and salaries as part of their income. We rate Bill Clinton’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-13232	"When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/19/colorado-citizens-accountable-government/group-says-colorado-senate-candidate-voted-use-tax/	A conservative group continues to use a two-year-old debunked claim that Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate Rachel Zenzinger once voted to use taxpayer money to take a trip China. PolitiFact Colorado in July rated a similar mailer claim, by the group Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, Pants On Fire. On Oct. 19, Zenzinger said, "Enough!" She filed a complaint with the Jefferson County District Attorney’s Office accusing the group of violating Colorado election laws by circulating a mailer containing a "false statement designed to affect the vote" in the election for state Senate District 19, which includes Denver suburbs Arvada and Westminster. A conviction of the misdemeanor offense carries a potential county jail sentence as well as a fine. Zenzinger’s complaint focuses on a flier mailed to voters on Oct. 14 by the group. The mailer states: "When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China. She wanted taxpayers to pay the bill for her airfare, lodging, transportation and food." The mailer clearly gives the impression that not only did Zenzinger vote to take a taxpayer-funded trip, but she went on the trip to China, too. In a mailer photograph, the group inserted a traditional Vietnamese bamboo hat on Zenzinger’s head with a Chinese rooftop in the background. "This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly," Zenzinger told Denver7 and PolitiFact. "The reason I'm filing the complaint is that I believe that they actually have crossed the line to where this is criminal. It's not even a stretching of the truth. It's just not the truth, and it's being used to influence voters." "That needs to stop," she added. We reached out to Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government but hadn’t received a reply. On July 5, PolitiFact and its partner Denver7 checked the facts of an earlier mailer from Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government that said, "While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China." PolitiFact rated the mailer Pants on Fire, its worst rating reserved for ridiculous statements. There are key problems with these attacks. While on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China. No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn’t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 TV ad called "China Girl" that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat. In April 2013, Zenzinger was a newly appointed Arvada City Councilwoman who took part in a motion regarding a sister city agreement with the Chinese city of Jinzhou. The council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Jinzhou to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo. Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group’s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes. The motion made no mention of funding for the trip, according to the minutes. Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip. The mayor said "since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it," according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded. Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3. Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, no taxpayer money would be used. "Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified ... that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation," according to the minutes. Her motion passed 5-2. Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found. Our ruling In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, "When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China." As of a council member, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. But not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China, but she never even went to China. The attack is a brazen, repeated distortion of the facts.

pomt-07459	The Republican budget plan "says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/18/barack-obama/president-obama-says-republican-medicare-plan-woul/	In his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama quickly went on the offensive against the Republican deficit-cutting budget proposal championed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a plan that passed the House in a partisan vote two days later. Obama was particularly critical of Ryan's controversial proposal to dramatically overhaul Medicare. While Medicare benefits would remain as they are now for people 55 and older, when those younger than 55 reach retirement, the traditional Medicare system would be replaced with "premium support" payments that would subsidize the purchase of private insurance plans. "It’s a vision that says America can’t afford to keep the promise we’ve made to care for our seniors," Obama said. "It says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today. It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher. And if that voucher isn’t worth enough to buy insurance, tough luck – you’re on your own. Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it." This $6,400 figure has become a White House talking point and is sure to be repeated often as the 2012 campaign heats up, so we thought we'd better take a look. We'll begin by explaining how Obama arrived at the number. It's based on an analysis of the Ryan plan by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that those who get premium support payments in 10 years will end up paying substantially more for their health care than if Medicare is left as is. According to the CBO analysis (see page 20 -25), under the Ryan plan, the $8,000 premium support voucher in 2022 would cover 39 percent of the cost of the average private plan for a 65-year-old. Which means the plan actually costs about $20,500 and that beneficiaries would be on the hook for about $12,500 of the cost. The CBO also presented estimates for an "alternative fiscal scenario" –- which incorporates "several changes to then-current law that were widely expected to occur or that would modify some provisions of law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period." Under this scenario, the typical beneficiary who enrolled in traditional Medicare would pay about 30 percent of the cost of the average private plan in 2022, or about $6,150. In other words, the increased amount the 65-year-old would have to pay would be about $6,400. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the CBO data, came up with the same numbers as Obama. So did the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Republicans don't contest that's what the CBO numbers are. But Obama left out an important fact, said Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for the Republicans on the Committee on the Budget: "Elsewhere in the letter, CBO makes clear that the comparison is making unrealistic assumptions in order to construct a future for Medicare under the status quo –- a future in which Medicare goes bankrupt, seniors suffer from reduced access to care, and the nation enters a debt crisis." Indeed, the CBO clearly states that both of its scenarios, by keeping benefits largely as they are, would create "pressures over the long term that would make them difficult to sustain." Without Medicare reform, the CBO warned "the government’s debt would skyrocket to levels unprecedented in the United States." That would result in either rising tax rates or "surging federal debt." And that, in turn, might lead lawmakers to reduce Medicare benefits. Said Spruiell: "Comparing our plan to save Medicare to an unsustainable status quo means comparing a real plan to a false reality. The president’s comparison is not valid, because he ripped the CBO number out of context and omitted the director’s clear warnings about the unsustainability of the status quo." Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, said the CBO also does not take into account the behavioral changes that Ryan's plan would likely encourage. Right now, she said, all the pressure is on the providers. But under the Ryan plan, more of the burden shifts to the consumers. If it is set up as it is for federal employees, there would be a wide range of plans, at a wide range of costs. And people will be able to shop around and change every year, Wilensky said. "This gets people looking and being involved in a way that they haven't been," she said. Consumers will be highly motivated to migrate to cheaper plans, she said, and there will be more competition among providers. The CBO often gets it wrong when it comes to predicting behavioral change, Wilensky said. For example, she said, the Medicare part D prescription drug program has proven to cost about 40 percent less than government projections. The CBO did not predict the market competition caused by people using private drug plans, she said. "So be cautious of the CBO numbers," she warned. So where does that leave us with Obama's claim that the Republican plan "says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today"? That number is based on a CBO analysis of the Republican plan. Republicans rightly point out that the CBO warned that unless major reforms are made to the Medicare program, it could lead to skyrocketing public debt, which might ultimately lead to pressure on legislators to reduce Medicare benefits. In his speech, Obama used the lower of two CBO estimates of costs, one based on some anticipated changes in Medicare. And he did not argue for the status quo on Medicare. "We will change the way we pay for health care -– not by the procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to prevent injuries and improve results," Obama said. "And we will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while protecting access to the services that seniors need. "We believe the reforms we’ve proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that," Obama said. "But if we’re wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this approach will give the independent commission the authority to make additional savings by further improving Medicare." Whether that approach will succeed is a matter of political debate. Obama has accurately portrayed the consequences of the Republican plan, at least according to the CBO analysis. It's a long-term projection -- which always carries a degree of uncertainty, and some, like Wilensky, argue that the CBO fails to adequately account for the behavioral changes the plan would encourage, which might drive costs substantially lower. (We should note that some Democrats believe the CBO has consistently underestimated health care cost-saving initiatives contained in the controversial health reform law passed last year.) But the bottom line is that under the Republican plan, those who reach 65 in 10 years would pay more out of pocket for private health care. That's the idea, to reduce the cost of the Medicare program to the government. Republicans argue it the most responsible way to make the program fiscally sustainable. Obama argues that cost is too high and that savings can be achieved in other ways. Again, that's a matter of political debate. The CBO compared the Republican plan to the status quo and to a somewhat modified Medicare. The CBO says either scenario would cause crushing debt, and would likely encourage legislators to cut Medicare benefits in the future. Obama too, is proposing reform. Obama's figure is close to what the CBO estimated in one scenario -- the least costly one -- that the Republican plan would cost consumers in 10 years compared to what seniors pay today. As a result, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-04-18T15:59:54	2011-04-13	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-10808	"It doesn't make sense to me to send $1-billion a day out of our country. We can be energy independent and should be."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/02/mitt-romney/difficult-to-go-it-alone-on-energy/	On Sept. 19, 2007, Republican candidate Mitt Romney delivered the standard Republican stump speech decrying big government and advocating lower taxes. He criticized members of his own party for spending too much and said the United States is too dependent on foreign oil. "It doesn't make sense to me to send $1-billion a day out of our country," Romney said. "We can be energy independent and should be." Everyone agrees with Romney that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is not a good thing. But that's where the accuracy of his comment ends, experts say. If Romney had said we "should" be energy independent he might be able to get away with it. But he chooses to be more emphatic, saying we "can" be. At the moment, that's not so. American presidents have been promising to make the United States more fuel-independent for decades, says Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. When Richard Nixon made that pledge during the Arab oil embargo in 1973, Rodgers says the United States relied on foreign oil for 35 percent of its daily consumption. Now, 34 years later, the United States gets more than 60 percent of its energy from foreign oil supplies. Electricity needs are not the issue. A combination of hydroelectricity, nuclear power and coal makes the United States relatively self-sufficient on electricity consumption. But our massive transportation sector consumes vast quantities of oil, and much of it comes from outside our borders. Imports have risen in the United States for the simple reason that with population growth our consumption has risen while our domestic production has dropped. For example, Alaska production is half what it was in the 1980s when the giant Prudhoe Bay field was at its peak. Given available resources and existing technology, Romney's statement about becoming energy independent is little more than a pipe-dream, experts say. "It's possible, just not likely," says David Rothkopf, president of Washington, D.C.-based consultancy Gartner Rothkopf LLC and a leading expert on energy issues. "It's not realistic. His heart is in the right place but I think he needs to look at the facts." (Rothkopf was a former deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade policy in the Clinton administration.) Rothkopf and others say that while the nation could conceivably achieve energy independence in the long term, it's just not realistic in the near term. For the United States to achieve energy independence would take massive investment in a range of options, from new conservation technology, next-generation biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, as well as aggressively seeking fossil fuel resources in the United States. Most of the newer technologies are not yet commercially viable, though they do hold great potential. The real focus, experts say, needs to be on energy security, not independence, i.e., ensuring that we get our energy from a sufficiently diverse number of countries and different technologies, to reduce our vulnerability to political shocks and natural causes like hurricanes and climate change. Experts call this "energy interdependence." T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Oklahoma oil tycoon, offered this solution in an interview in September 2007 with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review : "You can't become energy independent. That's out of the question because you're importing 60 percent of the oil that you use every day. ... If everybody in the United States started riding a bicycle, it'll work."

pomt-07730	Says Wendy’s founder "Dave Thomas left the state literally on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/02/jay-hottinger/did-wendys-founder-dave-thomas-really-flee-ohios-e/	Opponents of Ohio's estate tax say it hurts the state by driving away wealthy residents. State Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leader of the drive to repeal the tax in the General Assembly, said a "shockingly high number" of Ohioans leave because of the tax. But, the Newark Republican acknowledged on the "Sound of Ideas" on WCPN 90.3 FM there is no actual number to cite. "When an individual decides to leave my home community in Licking County, believe it or not, they don't take out a press release," he said. "They don't send it to the news media and say, 'We're leaving the state of Ohio because we want to preserve our assets for our heirs." He pointed to individuals instead, naming the founder of Wendy's restaurants as one example. "Dave Thomas left the state literally on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax," Hottinger said. PolitiFact Ohio was stirred. We imagined a dramatic dash for the border in a souped-up medical van. Wanting to know more, we called Hottinger's office for details. When they didn't get back to us, we searched on our own. We found a less dramatic story. Thomas died in 2002, after a decade-long battle with liver cancer, at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He had lived there since 1982, when he moved to Florida after retiring as CEO of Wendy’s at age 49. Prior to that, he had lived in Ohio for 20 years. If his primary goal at that time of his move was to limit the tax exposure his estate would have after his death, he must have been pleasantly surprised to discover that he also gained the year-round ability to play golf (which he loved) and to cruise on his 90-foot yacht, the I. Lorraine (named for his wife), which he was able to dock behind his home. A generous philanthropist, particularly in the interests of children's welfare, medicine and education, Thomas supported (and established) a number of organizations and causes in Florida, as he continued to do in Ohio and elsewhere. He said his greatest regret was not finishing high school, and in 1993 he hired a tutor and passed the G.E.D. exam. Coconut Creek High School in Fort Lauderdale made him part of its senior class, and awarded his high school diploma. He and his wife were king and queen of the senior prom, and Thomas was voted "Most Likely to Succeed." Legal residency is not something that can be established by deathbed conversion. Nor is it determined solely by physical presence. The point is that Thomas, an adoptee who was born in New Jersey and moved constantly as a boy, spending significant periods in Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana, was no mere Florida visitor or latecomer. Though he still had Ohio homes at Buckeye Lake and in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington, he registered to vote in Florida, not as an absentee in Ohio, in 1988. There’s also evidence that Thomas (who was survived by his wife, five children and 16 grandchildren) knew a thing or two about taxes, making us doubt that he would have left tax and estate planning to the eleventh hour. Gov. Bob Taft credited his support for getting passage of a $500 adoption credit on Ohio income taxes in 1999, and President Clinton gave him credit in 1996 for a federal law giving parents a one-time tax credit of $5,000 when they adopt a child. There are other reasons to be skeptical of the claim about Thomas. In examining claims about estate taxes elsewhere, PolitiFact Rhode Island found research reporting that estate taxes have little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another. The National Tax Journal in 2006 published "State ‘Death’ Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?," whose authors found no evidence that the elderly were responding to changes in estate taxes. Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, told PolitiFact he hasn’t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move. And if all this wasn’t enough, there’s another key fact to consider. Hottinger’s claim was that Thomas fled the state "literally on his death bed, to avoid estate tax." That clearly isn’t the case, unless he lingered 20 years before passing. And at that, it would have been three years too soon. Until 2005 (three years after Thomas’ death), Florida also had an estate tax. Hottinger’s statement isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worthy of flame broiling. That’s why we rate it Pants On Fire. Comment on this item.	None	Jay Hottinger	None	None	None	2011-03-02T11:15:00	2011-02-09	['None']

pomt-12694	Says President Donald Trump's travel ban could ban Somalis "from getting relief (from famine) through coming to the United States."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/13/keith-ellison/ellison-says-travel-ban-will-hurt-somalis-fleeing-/	The second in command at the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., called President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban inhumane and cruel, and particularly hurtful to an immigrant community he knows well. "In Minneapolis, we are proud of our Somalia-American community," Ellison said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March 7. "Somalia is going through a drought and a famine. They could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States because of this ban." Under Trump’s latest executive order, refugee processing for people from six nations including Somalia is on hold for four months. The order caps the total number of refugees at 50,000 for the year, a cut of about half from what the Obama administration had planned. No new immigration visas will be issued for three months. So Ellison is right that Somalis can be banned from entering the country. But discussion of drought and famine is misplaced. Somalis can't apply for refugee status because of famine, said Mark Hetfield, president of the refugee assistance organization HIAS. "Before the ban, there was no U.S. immigration or refugee program which assists victims of humanitarian disasters like famine, so the ban itself will not hinder U.S. relief efforts," Hetfield said. "The refugee program is only for individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group -- not a well founded fear of famine." Kathleen Newland, a senior specialist on refugee issues at the Migration Policy Institute, agreed. Trump's travel ban does not affect a famine response. "The U.S. response to famine in any location would not be to move people to the United States, but to help them where they are," Newland said. "I can’t see how the travel ban would affect relief efforts in and around Somalia." The head of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees Filippo Grandi criticized the travel ban in general terms. "We are concerned that this decision, though temporary, may compound the anguish for those it affects," Grandi said the day the latest executive order was signed. About 15,000 Somalis live in refugee camps in Kenya. Paul Spiegel, a researcher at the Center for Refugee and Disaster Response at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said both war and drought have swelled the numbers at refugee camps. "Some of these refugees could be resettled to the United States and other countries," Spiegel said. "Although a rather small amount compared to the number of people affected by the famine, every life counts." Ellison’s spokesman Brett Morrow also noted that the United Nations estimates that about 6 million Somalis need food aid. The freeze on visa and refugee processing blocks people from getting out, which puts additional strain on already stretched humanitarian efforts. Our ruling Ellison said that people threatened by famine in Somalia could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States due to Trump administration visa and refugee restrictions. The problem with this claim is that the famine has little to no bearing on Somali refugee status. Somalis can't apply for refugee status because of famine or drought, experts say. Ellison's statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04861	Art Robinson says "Social Security should be ended through attrition."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/10/peter-defazio/does-art-robinson-want-end-social-security-through/	Republican Art Robinson got a hefty boost from out-of-state GOP interests when he challenged U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., for the state’s 4th Congressional District in 2010. The two men are in a rematch this fall. DeFazio’s campaign recently issued a press release, accusing the chemist from Cave Junction of trying to moderate what DeFazio considers extremist views on public schools, nuclear waste and Social Security. "Despite his attempt to recast himself as Social Security’s great defender in 2012, Art Robinson has repeatedly called Social Security a ‘Ponzi Scheme’ including as recently as December 2011," states the DeFazio release. "And he has said in speeches and interviews that programs like Social Security and Medicare should be ended by attrition." The press release accompanies an online ad that likens Robinson to Mr. Rogers, but not in a kindly, cardigan-sporting way. "It’s a nutty day in his neighborhood," the voiceover sings as the camera hovers over a diorama of streets and houses. "And here he said Social Security should be ended through attrition," the voiceover continues. These phrases show up on screen: "These entitlement programs need to be ended …" and "... they have to be ended by attrition." Robinson is heard speaking these words in the ad. The words "Social Security Ended" appear on screen later in the ad. So what gives? Does Robinson want to end Social Security? By attrition? Is he backpedaling? Does he want to freak out frail senior citizens? We’re only sort of kidding on that last question because that’s what the DeFazio campaign is saying with its press release and ad. Most people know Social Security as the federal program that workers and their employers pay into over the course of the employee’s work life; the person then gets monthly stipends based on age of retirement and pay. The program also pays for people with disabilities and survivors of retirees. (Both Social Security and Medicare face long-term financial challenges and lawmakers have been urged to fix problems with both programs so there will be enough money for future recipients.) Robinson, not surprisingly, argues that DeFazio is wrong to say -- and to say only -- that he would end programs such as Social Security. "I have consistently called for increases in Social Security payments," Robinson writes in his new book, "Common Sense in 2012." "I have pointed out that Social Security payments have lagged badly behind price increases. They must be increased to catch up. The federal budget must be balanced, but not by short-changing seniors for benefits they have paid for and counted on." He sounds very senior-friendly there. DeFazio’s people contend this is a prime example of Robinson backtracking from previous statements -- to end Social Security -- that were not as senior-friendly. Let’s take a breath and go back to the original interview on which the web ad is based in part. Luckily we didn’t have to hunt too long because it’s posted on the "Who is Art Robinson?" website paid for by DeFazio. In the nearly 90-second long clip, Robinson says that we need to change the Social Security system because we’re digging ourselves into a hole: "We should change our ways so that we don't incur any further liabilities under entitlements. In other words, these entitlement programs need to be ended, but they can’t be ended by violating the contracts of the people who have already contracted with the government, they have to be ended by attrition. You have to stop taking on new people in the entitlements and let time pass and gradually by attrition cancel them." Even here, you can see that Robinson cares about the contract that government has with Social Security recipients; in other words, he doesn’t want to abandon them. Workers, after all, have paid into the system. A review of previous campaign statements shows that Robinson has consistently called for increasing payments to recipients and making sure the contract with recipients is honored. In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Robinson stood by the totality of his position on Social Security and said he hasn’t changed his views. He said he wrote what he did in his book because he was tired of DeFazio picking on only one part of his views -- the part most likely to alarm seniors. PolitiFact Oregon can sympathize, although the 2012 book is pretty heavy on wanting to save seniors and doesn’t mention the word attrition once. We’re not going to rule on whether ending Social Security by attrition is feasible or flawed. We’re not going to rule on whether Robinson is trying to have it both ways, by calling for an end to the current system while increasing payments to current recipients. Those are issues for voters. We will rule on the accuracy of DeFazio’s claim that Robinson wants to end Social Security "by attrition." Robinson has called for an end by attrition and continues to say we should end the current program by attrition, to be replaced by another system, whether it’s private or mixed with a public program. But we think it’s also important to point out that Robinson has consistently called upon the government to honor its obligations to Social Security recipients. We rate DeFazio’s statement Mostly True: Accurate but needs additional information.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2012-08-10T12:23:17	2012-07-30	['None']
pomt-14551	The United States has "the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/12/bernie-sanders/comparing-us-world-childhood-poverty-rates/	When asked during the Feb. 11 Democratic debate if there would be any limit on the size of government if he were elected president, Sen. Bernie Sanders quickly veered into a list of problems that, he believes, the United States faces. "Of course there will be a limit," he said, "but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living." For this item we will focus on his childhood poverty claim. In July, Sanders earned a Mostly False for making a similar claim, but in that instance he was more definitive, saying, "We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth." In this instance, he changed it to "almost any major country." Clearly many poor countries have a higher childhood poverty rate than the United States, which is why Sanders refers to "major" countries. In July, his campaign made it clear that when he talks about major countries, he is referring to members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries. At the time, Sanders was referring to a 2012 UNICEF report on childhood poverty in which the United States ranked No. 34 out of 35 countries with a childhood poverty rate of 23.1 percent. Only Romania, a non-OECD member, scored worse. We found a more recent UNICEF report from 2014 where the U.S. rate of childhood poverty was only exceeded by Israel, Mexico, Spain, and Greece, as well as that of non-OECD Latvia. (Romania was not included.) We also found a report done by the OECD itself from 2014, which used data from 2010, where the United States is listed as having less childhood poverty than Chile, Mexico, Turkey, Israel — all of which are OECD members — and Romania. The Sanders campaign referred us to a July 16, 2015, update of the OECD report. In ranks 38 countries for childhood income poverty using 2012 data. Six countries -- Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Mexico, Israel and Turkey -- are listed as having more childhood poverty. Turkey ranks the worst. Unfortunately, these reports are not necessarily comparable. For example, the 2012 UNICEF report and the OECD report defines impoverished children as those living in households below 50 percent of the median national income. The 2014 UNICEF report moved the poverty bar to 60 percent. But a bigger problem may be the way poverty is defined in these reports. When you base it on households earning less than a certain percentage of the national income, countries with higher levels of income inequality are also statistically more likely to have higher rates of poverty. In countries where income inequality is less, childhood poverty levels may appear lower. As we noted in July, that's why some commentators have criticized such methodology because it may miss the point of a measurement of poverty. One can be less well-off, the argument goes, without being poor, since being poor is defined instead by a lack of access to certain key goods, not by where one’s income falls relative to everyone else’s. As the 2012 UNICEF report acknowledged, poverty is a relative concept, and using an "absolute" poverty line -- a fixed income adjusted over time to inflation -- becomes less useful as incomes rise over time. Our ruling Sanders said the United States has "the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth." Unlike his July statement, Sanders isn't saying we're at the bottom, just that we're close to it. The reports we've seen aren't perfect, but they do suggest that childhood poverty is embarrassingly high for a country so rich. Comparing U.S. rates to the childhood poverty rates of other countries is perilous, however, because countries have so many different standards of living. In addition, the income inequality in the United States may be exaggerating our position. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02682	Nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity.	true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/07/eddie-lucio-jr/surveys-find-mcallen-region-most-obese-among-large/	Longtime state Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, highlighted two problems that come together in his district at the Southern Obesity Summit in Nashville, Tenn. Noting that Brownsville and McAllen are among the poorest cities in the U.S., Lucio said, "Because higher rates of poverty are associated with poorer health care outcomes, it should come as no surprise that McAllen is also one of the most obese areas of the country," according to his prepared remarks for the opening session Nov. 17, 2013. "Nearly 40 percent of my constituents there suffer," he said. Lucio cited via email an April 12, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story which said the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission region was "the fattest metro area in the United States" in 2012 based on a Gallup poll. He emailed us a link to the Gallup report released April 11, 2013, which drew on the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, an annual effort to analyze factors including social, financial and physical conditions of U.S. adults. Gallup used Hidalgo County as the boundary for the McAllen metropolitan statistical area. Only the southeastern part of Hidalgo County is in Lucio’s District 27, according to the Texas Legislative Council’s map, but we did not find a more precise breakdown of obesity statistics. By phone, Gallup-Healthways research director Dan Witters told us that the index uses information gathered nationwide in English and Spanish phone interviews. The survey reached about 350,000 U.S. adults throughout 2012 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. Witters emailed us results for the nine largest Texas metropolitan statistical areas, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, where Gallup-Healthways was able to field 300 or more responses in 2012. Insufficient responses excluded Brownsville-Harlingen, which would have been ninth-largest out of the ten top MSAs. Of the nine regions, the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area had the highest share of obese residents: 38.5 percent. Austin-Round Rock was the skinniest, at 22.7 percent. Percentage of obese residents in nine of the 10 largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Gallup-Healthways: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission -- 38.5% Beaumont-Port Arthur -- 32.5% San Antonio -- 31.4% Corpus Christi -- 31.2% Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington -- 26.7% El Paso -- 26.7% Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown -- 26.6% Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood -- 25.3% Austin-Round Rock -- 22.7% Nationally, Boulder, Colo., was Gallup-Healthways’ skinniest metropolitan statistical area with 12.5 percent obesity. The nationwide average was 26.2 percent. To calculate obesity, Witters said, Gallup-Healthways asked respondents for their height and weight, then calculated body-mass index, with a BMI of 30 or above considered obese. (To find yours, the National Institutes of Health say, "Multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Divide that answer by your height in inches. Divide that answer by your height in inches again." Or use an online calculator like these.) Witters said that In phone interviews, "men tend to say they’re taller, women say they’re a bit lighter" than they are. Gallup-Healthways did not modify its results to account for this, he said, but as a general rule of thumb adding 20 percent to 25 percent to BMI corrects for such self-reporting. Seeking another indicator of obesity in the McAllen region and elsewhere in Texas, we turned to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That agency defines the state’s metropolitan statistical areas differently than the federal government -- for example, splitting Dallas/Plano/Irving from Fort Worth/Arlington -- but like Gallup used Hidalgo County as the McAllen region. The McAllen area topped a 2012 list of large metro areas that spokeswoman Christine Mann gave us by phone. Percentage of obese residents in seven of the largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Department of State Health Services: McAllen-Edinburg-Pharr -- 44.7% El Paso MSA -- 34.1% Fort Worth-Arlington -- 31.8% San Antonio MSA -- 28.9% Houston-Baytown-Sugar Land -- 27% Dallas-Plano-Irving -- 26.5% Austin-Round Rock -- 26.3% Mann said the average for Texas in 2012 was 29.2 percent. Texas’ health services department collects its data in the annual Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey, and like Witters noted that people tend to underreport their health risk factors in phone interviews. The 2012 BRFSS was conducted throughout the year; the BMI portion had 8,530 respondents and a 95 percent confidence interval, Mann said. Our ruling Lucio said nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity. McAllen’s metropolitan statistical area in 2012 had 38.5 percent obesity among adults, according to the Gallup-Healthways study. A state survey that year suggested that nearly 45 percent of the region’s residents were obese. We rate Lucio’s statement as True.

pomt-03834	"DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-’80s."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/17/jeff-tittel/sierra-clubs-jeff-tittel-claims-dep-staffing-level/	Doing more with less doesn’t always have good results, according to the director of New Jersey’s Sierra Club. Jeff Tittel made that point in a March 2 opinion column on NJ.com, specifically referencing the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. "DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-’80s," Tittel wrote, questioning cuts in Gov. Chris Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget that impact various environmental funds and suggesting that low staffing means fewer people ensuring the state’s air is clean and people are protected from flooding. Is Tittel right that the state’s environmental arm is reducing staffing at great risk to New Jerseyans? Not quite. First, let’s review the number of people on staff at the DEP and how those levels have fluctuated through the years. Then we’ll compare current staffing with levels from the mid-1980s. Tittel claimed the DEP has 2,812 employees, but that figure is the staffing level proposed for the fiscal year 2014 budget, according to Larry Ragonese, DEP spokesman. Currently, the DEP has 2,734 employees, he said. So Tittel is off by 78 workers. It’s worth noting that Christie has the final say on the budget and must approve it by June 30. The new fiscal year starts on July 1. So how is DEP staffing now compared with the mid-1980s? We asked Ragonese for annual DEP staffing levels from 1970 to present, but since Tittel wasn’t more specific than "the mid-80s," we’ll look at years 1983 through 1987 and compare those with more recent years. 1983: 2,214 1984: 2,226 1985: 2,486 1986: 2,704 1987: 3,062 2010: 2,960 2011: 2,846 2012: 2,736 2013: 2,734 2014: 2,812* *proposed in FY2014 budget Source: New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Using the current staff figure of 2,734, Tittel is correct that the DEP’s employment levels are the lowest since 1986 -- the mid-1980s. But Tittel didn’t use that number. He said 2,812 employees. That means DEP staffing is the lowest it’s been since 2012 and now. So why is staffing a big concern for Tittel and the Sierra Club? "By having less staff and less hours you don’t have the people that are needed to do all that needs to be done," Tittel told us. "We’ve also added a lot more programs to the DEP to contend with -- the Highlands, the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, global warming and a few other programs. They’re stressed out in a lot of these areas because they have a lot on their plate and less people." Ragonese disagrees. While DEP staffing at one point topped 4,000 (in the early 1990s), the state’s environmental concerns have changed, requiring less staffing. The agency also has worked to become more streamlined and efficient in accordance with goals set by Christie and DEP Commissioner Bob Martin. "We’re taking care of the state’s air, water, land and natural resources but we have to run like a business, to make this place work better, to take steps away from being a horrible bureaucracy," Ragonese said. He added that DEP has improved water quality and air quality levels while reducing emissions and contaminants. Our ruling Tittel claimed in a recent op-ed column that the "DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-’80s." Tittel’s number is off a bit. The DEP has 2,734 employees this year but could increase that to 2,812, under Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget. As for the rest of Tittel’s claim, he’s right that the DEP’s staffing level is the lowest since the mid-1980s -- if he bases that off current staffing. But he used the proposed staffing figure of 2,812 employees, which means the DEP personnel roster is the lowest it's been in only the past couple of years. We rate Tittel's claim Half True.

pomt-12611	Says "Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/georgia-didnt-ban-muslim-culture-macedonian-websit/	A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed "Muslim culture." A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, "Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values." Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life." The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being "about keeping the American people safe." But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencer’s bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in driver’s licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. "This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us," Spencer told Atlanta’s WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped "Muslim culture" in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didn’t pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. "After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created," he said in a statement. "While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny." The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didn’t hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last year’s presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, "Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values." The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack. We rate the headline False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7d5870f1-b151-4df4-92f4-575cdb8cb199	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-04-02T08:45:02	2017-03-13	['Western_world', 'Islam', 'Georgia_(country)']
pomt-11205	"If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/patrick-morrisey/patrick-morrisey-cherry-picks-joe-manchins-votes-t/	Fresh off a primary victory in West Virginia’s U.S. Senate contest, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot at his opponent in the general election in a radio interview with Breitbart, saying Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump. Referring to Trump’s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, "If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote" in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, "Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump." Manchin’s support for Trump (or lack thereof) is likely to be a major campaign wedge for Morrisey, since Trump is more popular in West Virginia than any other state, according to state-by-state approval ratings released by Gallup in January 2018. Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn’t really right about Manchin’s position on Gorsuch. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Here, we’ll look at Manchin’s actions on the Gorsuch nominations; we looked at his positions on Obamacare in a separate fact-check. Bottom line: When it counted, Manchin voted with Republicans to advance Gorsuch’s nomination. The Gorsuch confirmation Morrisey’s camp pointed to three votes on April 6, 2017, during the back-and-forth over Gorsuch when Manchin voted with most Democrats. In two cases, Manchin voted in favor of efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to adjourn before voting on the Gorsuch nomination or to postpone it. (Both failed along party lines.) In the third vote, Manchin voted not to invoke the "nuclear option," which is a procedural move to lower the number of votes required to advance to a final vote from 60 to a simple majority. In this case, too, Manchin voted with all Democrats and against all Republicans. However, citing only these three votes paints a misleading picture of Manchin’s actions. In the most important votes for securing Gorsuch a floor vote, Manchin sided with Gorsuch and Republicans — and he’d telegraphed it. Before the final showdown began, Manchin on March 27, 2017, became the first Democratic senator to publicly break with others in his party and say he’d side with Republicans by committing to vote in favor of proceeding to Gorsuch’s nomination. By announcing his intention to support a vote for Gorsuch a full 10 days before the final action, he sent a signal to other Democrats who still might have been deciding on what to do. And Manchin stuck to his word: On April 6, Manchin was one of only four Democrats to vote to invoke cloture and proceed to a final vote on Gorsuch’s nomination. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully invoked the "nuclear option," the Senate once again voted on cloture, this time needing only a simple majority. Once again, Manchin voted to proceed to Gorsuch’s nomination on April 6, this time becoming one of only three Democrats to side with every Republican on the vote. Finally, on the actual vote on Gorsuch’s nomination on April 7, Manchin voted in favor, once again making him one of just three Democrats to back Gorsuch in the final vote. Senate specialist Gregory Koger of the University of Miami said Manchin has the better argument than Morrisey in this case. "Ordinarily I would place real weight on procedural votes, such as adjournment and on the nuclear option precedent," he said, "but I think there were extenuating circumstances, at least on the precedent vote, and the early public support for Gorsuch more than compensates for these procedural votes." Our ruling Morrisey said, "If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote." Manchin did side with Democrats on certain procedural votes during the showdown over Gorsuch. But he broadcast his support for a vote on Gorsuch early enough to persuade fence-sitters, and on the main votes, he broke ranks with his party, siding with Republicans to secure Gorsuch a vote and ultimately confirm him to the court.

pomt-05021	Because of the health care act, "The people who have health care and like it in this county are not going to be able to keep what they have."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/16/eric-cantor/cantor-says-under-health-care-law-people-who-their/	The day after President Barack Obama’s health care law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, was asked if he would concede defeat. "The president’s team won and you guys lost," said Peter King of Bloomberg News in a TV interview with the congressman. "Why not move on as the president suggests." Cantor vowed to continue his effort to repeal the law, complaining that it expands Washington’s control of health care and will be costly to the public. "Frankly, the people who have health care in this country and like it will not be able to keep what they have," Cantor said. Debate over how health care reform will affect medical insurance is huge in this year’s national elections. PolitiFact recently rated Half True an Obama claim that Americans who already have policies "will keep" their insurance." It rated False a statement by Republican Mitt Romney that up to 20 million covered Americans "will lose insurance that they like and want to keep." Is Cantor right that if you like it your health insurance, you will lose it? We checked. We asked Cantor’s office to back up the congressman’s claim. "It’s a fact that the new insurance regulations in Obamacare will change the type of health insurance plans people currently have," spokeswoman Megan Whittemore replied in an email. "Most employers are expected to modify coverage -- and some may even chose to drop employer-sponsored coverage altogether." Whittemore’s comments center on a quirk in the health care act, which in 2014 will require most people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 213 million nonelderly Americans have health insurance this year and 154 million of them -- 72 percent -- are covered through employer policies. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, the average insurance premium for a single employee last year was $5,429, with the company paying $4,508 and the worker contributing $921. The average cost for a family policy was $15,073, with the company picking up $10,944 and the worker paying $4,129. The law requires all companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care insurance to workers and families or pay a $2,000 fine per worker tax, not counting the first 30 employees. As a result, Whittemore said, many companies will find it "far more economical" to drop their health insurance plans and pay the penalty tax. Most workers, in such cases, would be left to find coverage on their own through private insurance exchanges that will be set up under the act. Whittemore pointed us to two studies on the issue. One is a report entitled "Broken Promise: Why Obamacare Will Force Americans to Lose the Health Care Coverage They Have and Like." It was prepared by the majority staff of the House Ways and Means Committee at the request of its chairman, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., a critic of the health care law. The majority staff sent questionnaires to all Fortune 100 companies. It concluded that the 71 companies that replied could save $28.6 billion in 2014 if they stopped offering health insurance and paid the tax. Whittemore also said a 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions "found that up to 65 million people could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance because of Obamacare’s employer mandate requirement." Deloitte did find that, in a worse case scenario, 65 million workers could lose their employer-based insurance by the end of the decade because of the health care law. That could happen if more than 25 percent of large corporations with over than 5,000 employees and more than 50 percent of smaller businesses stopped offering insurance. Keep in mind that 154 million Americans are insured by employers. Under this projection, 42 percent would lose their coverage. While that’s a big percentage, it does not even go half way to proving Cantor’s unbounded claim that, because of the health care act, the people who like their insurance "won’t be able to keep what they have." Deloitte offered eight scenarios that are rosier than the one Cantor’s office cited. If, for example, 5 percent of large corporations 10 percent of smaller businesses cancelled their health coverage, then 7.7 million once-insured workers would need to seek coverage on their own. And if Congress were to triple the $2,000 tax penalty on companies that don’t offer insurance, employer-based coverage would grow by 2.9 million people by the end of the decade. Let’s look at a few other studies about the health care law’s impact on employer-provided insurance: *The CBO estimated between 3 million and 5 million fewer non-elderly Americans will be covered by employers by the end of the decade. *The Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people with employer coverage. *The Lewin Group predicted a decline of 3 million people with work-based coverage. *The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary estimated 1 million fewer people will be covered by employers. *The Rand Corp. projected about 4 million more people will be insured by employers in 2016. There’s an important factor to keep in mind with these projections: Not all of the people falling out of employer coverage will be losing policies they like. The CBO estimates that 3 million people will spurn their employers’ offer of coverage and turn to another source, such as the insurance exchanges created under the health care act. In many cases, they will do so because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking in features they need. Vast numbers of workers will see their work-sponsored insurance change for reasons that are not connected to the health care act. It’s common for employers and their insurance companies to unilaterally change their plans. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each year from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that resulted in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third. Our ruling Cantor said that because of the health care law, "The people who have health care and like it in this country are not going to be able to keep what they have." His statement suggests that losing the health insurance you like is guaranteed by the law. Cantor’s office backs the claim by noting the law makes it cheaper for companies to drop health coverage for their employees and pay a penalty tax. His office cites the bleakest of nine scenarios in Deloitte studies, under which 42 percent of workers would lose their company insurance. The Cantor camp doesn’t mention that most of the other scenarios estimate a loss under 10 percent. We found five other studies that conclude the law will cause less than a 3 percent net loss of workers with company insurance. That group includes people expected to voluntarily give up their work policies because they prefer private plans that will become available under the health care act. Even before the coverage mandate has taken effect, the number of companies that switch their plans each year has been substantial. The health care law is expected to increase that rate modestly, not exponentially as Cantor says. We rate Cantor’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-02257	Says Rep. Michele Bachmann said President Barack Obama might be to blame for the Fort Hood shootings.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-michele-bachmann-said-we-have-z/	U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is clearly no fan of President Barack Obama. In recent weeks, like most weeks, she skewered his administration’s handling of the Benghazi attack, the IRS scrutiny of tea party groups and the health care law. A Facebook meme suggests she also took to the airwaves to sort of blame Obama for the shootings by an Iraq War veteran at Fort Hood, Texas, that resulted in four deaths and 16 injuries. "I’m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood (sic) shooting. I’m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn’t," Bachmann is quoted as saying on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show April 2, 2014. A reader asked us if this post, which he said he saw on Facebook, is real. It’s not. The first clue that something is fishy: The post refers to Fort Wood, not Fort Hood. The second: The screenshot that serves as the backdrop for the quote is from Bachmann’s June 2013 interview on Fox News’ Hannity when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January. Bachmann was not on Hannity’s show on April 2, 2014, the date attributed to the quote. She did appear on The O’Reilly Factor on April 3, but it was to talk about her questioning of a former CIA official over the Benghazi attacks. She didn’t say the quote in question there either. A Lexis Nexis review of recent transcripts shows she has not commented about the attacks on the army base beyond this tweet saying she was praying for the Fort Hood community. "Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and didn’t even appear on Hannity that day. It’s 100 percent fake," said her spokesman Dan Kotman. He pointed out that the same Facebook group where this meme was shared, the satirical Christians for Michele Bachmann, was also behind a widely shared and debunked post alleging Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English. Bachmann may not blame Obama for the shooting, but conservative blog Gateway Pundit did, writing, "The Obama administration is responsible for this mass shooting. They witnessed this before. They didn’t learn a thing. Gun free zones are death zones." The post was referenced by hosts of Fox & Friends on April 3. But that wasn’t Bachmann. We can’t find a trace of her saying, "I’m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood shooting. I’m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn’t." And she wasn’t on Hannity on the night the posts says she was. The post appears to be satire, but not everyone has taken it that way -- all you have to do is read the comments on the original photo. That's why we're stepping in. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-04-10T15:20:00	2014-04-02	['Michele_Bachmann', 'Fort_Hood_shooting', 'Barack_Obama']
