pomt-13039	There was "serious voter fraud" in Virginia.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/29/donald-trump/trumps-pants-fire-serious-voter-fraud-claim-virgin/	President-elect Donald Trump has peppered his Twitter account with a charge that the presidential election was marred by voter fraud in Virginia and two other states that he lost. "Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias," Trump said in a Nov. 27 tweet. It was the last in a series of 13 tweets in which Trump, without evidence, claimed "millions of people" across the nation voted illegally on Nov. 8, robbing him of a plurality of popular votes - even though he won the crucial majority of Electoral College votes. The latest returns show Democrat Hillary Clinton drew about 2.3 million more popular votes than Trump, a Republican. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into Trump’s claim that millions voted illegally and rated it Pants on Fire. We investigated Trump’s claim about Virginia, to see whether "serious voter fraud" occurred in the state. Clinton won Virginia, garnering 1.98 million votes compared with Trump’s 1.77 million, according to tallies posted by the Virginia Department of Elections. In other words, she got about 210,000 more votes than Trump. We emailed Trump’s campaign and his transition team to learn the basis of his fraud claim but did not get a response. As news of Trump’s comments swirled, the Virginia Department of Elections issued a prepared statement from Commissioner Edgardo Cortes batting down the president-elect’s statement. "The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded," Cortes said. "Virginia's election was well administered by our 133 professional local registrars, with help from hundreds of election officials and volunteers who worked to guarantee a good experience for eligible Virginia voters. The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted." Martin Mash, a policy adviser for the Department of Elections, told us in an email that the department has not received any specific allegations of vote fraud during the Nov. 8 election. Vote-fraud allegations would be forwarded to law-enforcement officials, he said. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, said in an email that his office has not received any reports of illegal voting in this election. We contacted John Fredericks, who was chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign. He said on Election Day that officials from from Trump’s campaign and the state GOP set up a call center in Richmond to take reports of voting irregularities. Although the center received hundreds of calls, nothing caused great concern, he said. Fredericks told us he is not aware of any "massive voter fraud on Election Day" beyond "many isolated incidents" of people voting without having proper identification who wanted provisional ballots. Fredericks added that flaws in the state’s election system allow avenues for illegitimate ballots and that there are "real examples of real potential voter fraud or the groundwork for voting fraud being laid." For example, Fredericks pointed to a well-publicized case from Harrisonburg where 18 to 20 people who died ended up on voter rolls. The FBI is probing that case of potential voter fraud. But it should be noted that that this irregularity was discovered in September - well in advance of Election Day. Another case being prosecuted in Alexandria involves what appears to be a relatively small number of fake voter registration applications, and it was also found before Election Day, the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an article this week. We also emailed the Republican Party of Virginia for its take on Trump’s "serious voter fraud" claim. GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said state Republicans are deferring to the incoming White House administration for a response to Trump’s claim. A final note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire and PolitiFact California also gave Pants on Fire ratings to Trump’s claim of serious voter fraud in those states. Our ruling Trump said there was "serious voter fraud in Virginia" during this presidential election. The top state election official in Virginia says the charge is "unfounded." The former chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign says he’s unaware of any "massive voter fraud on Election Day." There’s a burden on Trump to prove his sensational claim, and the president-elect offers no evidence. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84f77a8d-d9e2-4cb8-be2d-a26a237887b2	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-29T14:33:18	2016-11-27	['Virginia']
pomt-05372	Says that Rep. Betty Sutton "would rather riot with Occupy (Wall Street) than stand up for Ohio families."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/may/09/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-betty-sutton-supports-occupy-wall-street/	Republicans moved quickly to politicize what federal agents have described as a failed bomb plot cooked up by anarchists connected to the Occupy Cleveland organization. The group, an offshoot of last fall’s anti-Wall Street demonstrations in New York, is not under investigation, officials stressed May 1, 2012, when announcing the arrests of five suspects. But that did little to stop the GOP from buzzing about the movement’s support among Democrats. The most direct attack came May 2, 2012, from the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group is working to unseat Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat from Copley Township near Akron. Redistricting put her into battle this fall against fellow Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth. In an email, the NRCC blasted Sutton for not immediately denouncing the accused anarchists and noted that the congresswoman attended an Occupy rally last October in New York. The email, sent by NRCC Deputy Communications Director Andrea Bozek, accuses Sutton of missing votes to protest with Occupy Wall Street and being slow to criticize the "plot by Occupy members to blow up an Ohio bridge." Bozek then delivered the punchy email’s parting shot. "Sutton’s cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families." When it comes to Occupy, it’s no secret Sutton has been a supporter. But a rioter? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check that accusation. Bozek provided a link to a story that was published last October in The Plain Dealer and online at Cleveland.com. The story reported on Sutton’s travel to the Occupy rally in New York. Bozek also shared an NRCC video montage of Occupy protesters preaching communism and engaging in other unruly behavior. An oft-used image of a man defecating on a police car makes a cameo. The video targets another congressional Democrat, Steve Israel of New York. Asked if any of the clips came from the event Sutton attended, Bozek replied: "That video demonstrates the kind of behavior that defines this radical group. Multiple arrests, sexual assaults, attacks on police officers and … vandalism. Is that what Betty Sutton supports?" "The congresswoman does not ever condone or participate in riotous behavior," said Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo. The New York rally last fall is the only Occupy event Sutton has attended, DeAngelo told PolitiFact Ohio. We checked news reports from that day and found little to support the NRCC’s attack. Yes, there were violent outbursts -- an element necessary to meet nearly any modern definition of riot. The New York Times City Room blog reported that 23 people were arrested during the Oct. 5 protests, including one charged with second-degree riot -- a misdemeanor. According to New York penal code, rioting in the second degree occurs when someone in a group of at least four "engages in tumultuous and violent conduct," risking "public alarm." But we suspect the New York Times would have noted an Ohio congresswoman among the group had Sutton been involved. But the newspaper didn’t because Sutton wasn’t. DeAngelo offered a few photos of his boss at the rally. Sutton appears more dressed up than her fellow demonstrators, and her dark coat and purple blouse look no worse for the wear. Most coverage of the Oct. 5 protests indicated that violent behavior was the exception. That evening, on CNN’s broadcast of "Situation Room," reporter Susan Candiotti agreed with host Wolf Blitzer that the protests had been peaceful and that "there have been no confrontations." The NRCC is correct that Sutton missed votes to attend the rally last October. It is also accurate to say that Sutton did not send out a formal condemnation of the five bomb plot suspects, though, in fairness, neither did Renacci until after the NRCC attack. But the rhetorical flourish is where the NRCC’s claim departs from truthfulness. The NRCC email said that Sutton’s "cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families." Did Sutton stand with the Occupy Wall Street protesters in October? Yes. Did she engage in rioting? No. Was there even rioting at the rally Sutton attended? News coverage indicates violent behavior was the exception and that protests at the event were generally peaceful. Meanwhile, the material provided by the NRCC fails to support the notion that Sutton would support rioting. The NRCC claim is beyond False. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-03553	A law that mandates fingerprinting for gun purchasers is "a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/23/marylanders-prevent-gun-violence-education-fund/ad-maryland-group-says-fingerprinting-gun-purchase/	With the debate over gun control still simmering, a reader asked us to fact-check an ad on Baltimore TV stations that promotes tough laws on gun purchases. The ad, was put together by Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, a group headed by Vincent DeMarco, an adjunct assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (We have written previously about the Bloomberg School’s role in gun policy research.) The group, whose board is chock full of Maryland political leaders, supported the gun-control bill signed earlier this year by Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley. The group is now trying to shore up public support as the law faces expected legal challenges from the National Rifle Association and others. The ad focuses on fingerprint licensing laws. Under those laws, a potential gun purchaser must first obtain a license from law enforcement, which includes being fingerprinted, before being able to purchase a handgun. This is currently the law in Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Here’s the text of the ad, voiced by people identified on screen as a gun owner, a pastor and a mother: "Something had to be done, and here in Maryland we stood up and joined the governor and the Legislature to pass real solutions that reduce gun violence by getting weapons out of the hands of criminals, with a fingerprint licensing law that 68 percent of gun owners like me support, a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law. It will work for Maryland, and it could work for the entire country." We wondered if the fingerprint laws have "reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law"? By using the term "reduced," the ad is saying that gun crime was high before passage of these laws, and then dropped after they were enacted. But that’s not what the data shows. In fact, there's no data that shows the crimes declined, nor whether the fingerprint laws were the reason. We checked with Daniel W. Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which the group has cited as a source. Webster agreed that the text of the ad could have been phrased more carefully. "It would be more accurate to state that states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing have much lower rates of gun homicide than states that do not," Webster said. He presented the following data for age-adjusted firearm homicide rates per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2010 for both the U.S. overall and for the five states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing. The chart was compiled using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Firearm homicide rates, 1999-2010 Total Population Non-Hispanic Whites Blacks Large Central Metro Counties United States 3.99 1.48 16.05 6.8 Connecticut 2.25 0.60 10.07 3.0 Hawaii 0.77 0.59 NA NA Massachusetts 1.50 0.40 9.10 6.0 New Jersey 2.74 0.60 12.31 7.8 New York 2.84 0.70 9.49 4.5 All this data shows is that states with the fingerprint law have lower firearm homicide rates, not that the rate fell after enactment of the fingerprint law. "Most of the laws were passed many decades ago, and there have not been studies to estimate their impact on violent crime," Webster said. There is some backhanded support for the ad’s claim in the one state -- Missouri -- that did the reverse when it rescinded its licensing requirement for gun purchasers in 2007. Webster said that following the law’s repeal, gun homicide rates increased by 25 percent between 1999-2007 and 2008-2010. (The Missouri case is analyzed here and here.) There also another problem with the ad’s phrasing: It was imprecise in using the term "gun crimes." The supporting data Webster cited refers to firearm homicide rates, which is just one subset of gun crimes. The FBI tracks gun robberies and gun assaults in addition to gun homicides. At least two politicians, O’Malley and Maryland state Sen. Brian Frosh, have been quoted in news reports offering versions of the claim that are more accurate. So how did the ad’s narration get mangled? DeMarco, the group’s president, told PolitiFact that his group "ran the script of the ad by Prof. Webster before running it and he approved it as accurate." But Webster responded by telling us that he approved the following language: "In the five states where fingerprint licensing is currently required for handgun purchases, gun death rates are among the lowest in the nation. According to experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, cities in states with handgun purchaser licensing laws have much lower rates of within-state illegal gun trafficking than those without licensing. According to the Center, ‘research suggests that, once implemented, Maryland’s handgun purchaser licensing law will reduce gun trafficking, gun crime, and gun homicides and can serve as a national model for other states.’" Somewhere along the way, the more accurate language got lost in translation. Our ruling The ad said that mandating the fingerprinting of those seeking to purchase a gun is "a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law." But that’s not a correct description of the statistics. Firearm homicide rates are lower in the five states that have such laws, but experts told us there are no before-and-after comparisons in those states to show that gun-crime rates were "reduced" after fingerprinting laws took effect. In addition, the ad refers to "gun crimes," but the supporting data looks specifically at gun homicides, not robberies and assaults committed with guns. The differences in wording are subtle, but at PolitiFact, one of our core principles is that the words used to make political claims matter. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09387	"Our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/26/john-boehner/boehner-says-federal-debt-will-equal-gdp-two-years/	Ever since Barack Obama became president and began advocating such big-dollar federal programs as an economic stimulus and health care reform, Republicans have gained increasing political traction with warnings to voters about the growing national debt. On March 24, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register that was timed to coincide with a March 25 visit by Obama to Iowa City, Iowa. Obama visited Iowa City to tout the health care bill two days after signing it into law. Boehner's column -- titled, "Why Republicans will fight to repeal health care takeover" -- was a broadside against the newly signed bill, featuring a wide range of statistics. In it, he asserted that the health care bill "is a recipe for further fiscal disaster at a time when our national debt ($12.7 trillion today) is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy (about $15 trillion) in just two more years." That struck us as a huge amount, so we decided to take a closer look. First, we'll offer a reminder that the debt is different from a deficit. A deficit refers to the amount by which expenses exceed revenues in a single year. The debt -- which is what Boehner was referring to -- refers to the cumulative total of past deficits, minus any intervening surpluses. To sort out whether Boehner's numbers are right, we turned to the extensive historical tables in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal. According to these figures, which come from the Office of Management and Budget, the gross federal debt by the end of fiscal year 2010 is projected to be almost $13.8 trillion. That's actually a bit more than Boehner had suggested. Two years later -- by the end of fiscal year 2012 -- the debt is projected to rise to $16.3 trillion, also higher than Boehner had indicated. But Boehner is correct that, measured by the share of gross domestic product, gross federal debt will reach a significant milestone in two years. By 2012, gross federal debt is projected to be 100.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from 99.0 percent for fiscal year 2011. These numbers, we'll add, have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent. It's worth noting that there is an alternative measure of debt known as "public debt," which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Measured this way, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, but one measure "isn’t more 'right' than the other – they are just looking at different things," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group. "Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way." It's also worth noting that these numbers are only estimates. They could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we consider Boehner's statistics valid. While he underestimates the size of the projected debt in 2010 and 2012, his assertion that "our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years" is on target, according to the president's own Office of Management and Budget. So we rate his statement True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-03-26T10:24:21	2010-03-24	['None']
pomt-06226	"Last year we spent more than $40 billion on highways. And Lord knows we need that. But that's more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/05/frank-lautenberg/Lautenberg-says-federal-highway-spending-last-year/	Amtrak has always needed a money train. The nation’s rail system has been criticized by numerous lawmakers for always operating at a deficit and seeking financial boosts from Congress. But when compared with federal highway spending, Amtrak’s balance sheet doesn’t look so bad, according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), a major proponent of rail transportation. "Last year we spent more than $40 billion on highways. And Lord knows we need that. But that's more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history," Lautenberg said in an article on nola.com, the online home of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Can it be that after 40 years of operation the money spent on Amtrak didn’t even equal one year of federal highway spending? PolitiFact New Jersey found the claim is right on track. Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC confirmed that highway spending for Fiscal Year 2010 (Oct. 1, 2009 to Sept. 30, 2010) exceeded $40 billion. Highway spending generally increases a small amount each year for inflation, he said. By comparison, Caley Gray, Lautenberg’s communications director, said Congress has spent $37.9 billion on Amtrak from Fiscal Year 1971 to Fiscal Year 2011, according to Amtrak. That’s a bit more than Amtrak’s total, but it supports Lautenberg’s statement. "In the forty years of Amtrak’s existence, the Federal government has invested a total of $36 billion in the Amtrak system – a figure that represents both operating and capital funding," Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said in Amtrak’s General and Legislative Annual Report to Senate President Joseph Biden Jr. and House Speaker John Boehner. Amtrak’s Comprehensive Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 was included with the report dated Feb. 7. "Between 1971 and 2008, by contrast, the Federal government has invested more than $421 billion in aviation and over a trillion dollars in the nation’s highways." Rod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., suggested that Lautenberg wasn’t dismissing the need for highway funding, but pointing to other transportation needs for the nation. "His statement is accurate and I think his intent is to indicate that – certainly not to denigrate the highway system, but to note the world is in transition now, to move away to petroleum-based transportation to electrically based transportation." Diridon didn’t suggest people give up their vehicles, but said having an upgraded electric rail system can have many benefits: efficiency in moving people, less reliance on foreign oil and reduced environmental impact. Lautenberg touched on those points as well as increased ridership in a July 5 letter sent to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) supporting Amtrak’s $2.2 billion funding request for Fiscal Year 2012. Murray is chairman and Collins is a ranking member on the Appropriations Committee for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Lautenberg and 19 other U.S. senators signed the letter. Amtrak got $1.41 billion in assistance for its nearly $3.9 billion budget, said Clifford Cole, media relations manager for Amtrak Media Relations/Government Affairs in New York. Our ruling In an article about expanding rail routes and access in Louisiana, Lautenberg said Congress spent more than $40 billion on highways last year, more than has been spent on Amtrak in the national rail system’s 40-year history. The Federal Highway Administration confirmed the highway spending figure, as did Amtrak in a letter requesting $2.2 billion in federal assistance for its Fiscal Year 2012 budget. There’s nothing off the rails here. We rate this statement True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Frank Lautenberg	None	None	None	2011-12-05T07:30:00	2011-10-24	['Amtrak']

pomt-08631	Says Ron Johnson’s company got government loans and a grant to help expand his business	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/18/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-opponent-ron-johnsons-business-/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson is a big-time skeptic when it comes to government "picking winners and losers" through subsidies and aid programs. So when WKOW-TV in Madison reported Johnson’s manufacturing company, Pacur Inc., benefited from government loans and a federal grant, it was a natural line of attack for Democrats. Partisans love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning. Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, locked in a tough battle with Johnson, quickly launched a TV ad that portrays Johnson as a hypocrite on the issue. The ad splices together bits of TV news reports and newspaper headlines, which use a variety of terminology -- "government loan," "special aid," "government aid," and "federal grant" -- to describe the support Pacur received to add on to its plant and hire more workers. Creating more confusion, the ad twice shows Johnson telling an interviewer: "I have never lobbied for some special treatment or for a government -- government payment." As the ad winds down, it uses clip of a WKOW reporter saying: "Ron Johnson loves to say that government doesn’t create jobs, but in the case of his own business that doesn’t seem to be true." There are no words spoken by Feingold or a narrator other than the boilerplate at the end, where Feingold approves the message. There is no question the ad is misleading in its presentation. WKOW officials asked Feingold to take down the spot because it could be confused with a newscast and took statements out of context. The Feingold campaign refused. For instance, the ad creates the false impression Johnson is responding directly to revelations that his business got government help. The question he was answering was whether a Milwaukee-area company deserved tax credits touted by President Obama. But there is an important point about the ad to be settled here beyond its insinuation of hypocrisy. That question is whether Johnson in fact received government aid or subsidies. It’s a point Johnson disputes and in this item we will confine our review to that. So what did Pacur Inc. get, and who did the company get it from? No one disputes the transactions at the heart of the ad. In 1979, a company that months later would morph into Pacur got a $75,000 federal grant to build a rail line to the new plant. Johnson says he was not part of the company when the grant was approved, but helped get the firm off the ground months later. And in 1983 and 1985, Pacur received a total of $4 million in low-interest loans through a government program that offers help to businesses in the form of industrial revenue bonds. The savings from reduced-rate loans of that size would save the borrower hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the state Department of Commerce. Feingold’s senior campaign strategist John Kraus said the ad used a media report calling the aid "government loans" because the program is run by the government. It is true government administers the program: Both the City of Oshkosh and the state Department of Commerce had to decide if Pacur qualified for the loan and to sign off on how the loan would be used. And government issues the bonds. Each year, about 23 manufacturing firms get a loan, Commerce Department records from 2000 to the present show. During that time, some firms failed to qualify, or when money was tight in 2000, were rated too low to merit a loan, according to Zach Brandon, deputy secretary of the department. Johnson acknowledges the government’s role and benefits to his company. But he says it’s misleading to call what Pacur received "government loans" because the money ultimately comes from private funds -- not the government -- and the local municipality is not on the hook if the company were to default. We turned to two outside experts, who agreed on the use of private funds and that taxpayers are not at risk. "A loan is an actual transfer of funds," said Adrian Moore, an economist and vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based libertarian think tank. "Nobody took taxpayer funds and gave it to this guy." Moore, who has studied industrial revenue bonds extensively, says: "Essentially the government is loaning the industrial project its credit rating, not its money." But Moore and Verlane Endorf, an attorney and partner in the public finance group in the Minneapolis law firm of Dorsey & Whitney, said government nevertheless clearly subsidizes the program. That is, there is an interest rate subsidy, with a resulting loss of tax revenue to the federal treasury under the structure. Banks can offer the loans to companies at lower rates because of the federal role, Endorf said. "Government-subsidized loan is the right way to say it," Moore said. Federal reports by the Congressional Budget Office refer to industrial revenue bonds as a subsidy program. Over the years, the approach has faced criticism from the right (interference in free markets) and left (corporate welfare). The $75,000 grant is a bit easier to sort out. It came from the federal government and did not have to be repaid. But the March 1979 grant did not go to Pacur, rather to Pacur’s predecessor firm, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies, Inc. WISS changed its focus and name to Pacur Inc. in late August 1979, five months after the grant approval. It’s unclear when Johnson went to work for Pacur, but it was some time after mid-July 1979, based on pay stubs that show he was still working in Minnesota at that point. Johnson, who says he worked as Pacur’s accountant and co-founder, says he knew nothing of the grant to WISS. Both companies were headed by Pat Curler, Johnson’s brother-in-law and his initial boss at Pacur. Johnson is now the owner of the company. Let’s review the evidence. When it comes to describing Johnson’s company as getting "government aid," the Feingold ad is correct. Independent experts and the federal government itself label the industrial revenue bonds a government subsidy. So the message about Pacur getting government help is on target. But a prominent reference in the ad’s mish-mash of wording -- "government loan" -- is off. It may be from the mouth of a TV reporter, but the Feingold campaign chose it and is responsible for its use. The $75,000 grant is clearly government aid. And the rail line it helped create clearly has helped Pacur from its earliest days. But the grant apparently predated Johnson’s arrival in Oshkosh, and there is no evidence so far -- if more comes to light, we may revisit this ruling -- that Johnson was involved in it. Using Johnson’s out-of-context soundbite, as if he is responding to this point, makes the ad even more misleading. We rate the statement about government aid Half True.

This last budget we’ve increased it $200 million dollars more than the Governor put forth.” The Wisconsin Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance – sometimes referred to as the Joint Finance Committee or the Committee on Joint Finance – is a bipartisan, 16-member committee responsible for reviewing all bills introduced “for the appropriation of money, providing for revenue or relating to taxation.” In 2015, Olsen served as one of the Committee’s vice chairs.

pomt-09666	Under the cap-and-trade bill, homes would have to be retrofitted to meet energy and water efficiency standards before they could be sold.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/23/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-cap-and-trade-will-require-hom/	Here's one way to get our attention. Send us a chain e-mail with this subject line: "We don't make this up." The e-mail, which we have received in several forms over the past few months, has to do with a cap-and-trade bill making its way through Congress and how it would treat energy efficiency in existing homes. According to the e-mail, "Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Cap and Trade Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act. H.R. 2454, the 'Cap & Trade' bill passed by the House of Representatives." "A year from now you won't be able to sell your house," the e-mail goes on. "Yes, you read that right. The caveat is (there always is a caveat) that if you have enough money to make required major upgrades to your home, then you can sell it. But, if not, then forget it." Home sellers will require a government license to put their home on the market, according to the letter. The claim has gone viral on the Internet, and versions of it have been repeated by Republican lawmakers, including House Republican Leader John Boehner . Our friends over at FactCheck.org looked into Boehner's claim over the summer and found it to be false. We've explored many aspects of the bill, including how much it would cost and whether it would create or cut jobs . So here we will examine what the bill says about making existing homes more energy efficient. Here's how cap-and-trade would work. Under House legislation, the target of the chain e-mail's criticism, the government would be required to set an overall cap on carbon emissions in an effort to slow climate change. More specifically, the bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies would either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits -- also known as allowances -- to continue polluting. Initially, most allowances would be given out free. But eventually companies would have to buy those permits from the government. There's lots of language in the bill regarding building efficiency. Section 201, for instance, requires building energy codes for new homes to be 30 percent more efficient than current standards when the bill goes into law and 50 percent more efficient by 2016. States and local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new codes, but will receive government allowances to cover the cost of developing and adopting the improvements. And Section 202 of the bill would establish a program that would allow states to help homeowners finance energy-efficient home retrofits; the more energy a retrofit saves, the more money the homeowner would get from the government to subsidize the work. Finally, Section 204 would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a model program that states could voluntarily adopt to label new buildings for their energy performance. This "license," as the chain e-mail calls it, is only applicable to new construction and would be completely voluntary. In fact, that's a point the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the cap-and-trade bill, makes over and over in its summary of the legislation: "Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements," the document says. Lane Burt, a building efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has blogged about the issue, says the e-mail is false. "The anti-efficiency crowd have alleged that the [cap-and-trade] bill is going to require Americans trying to sell their homes to undergo some sort of energy inspection or meet some sort of green requirements -- 'or else,' " he wrote of the supposed requirement in the bill. "Of course, when I have heard and read this claim there isn't a provision cited, and for good reason -- it doesn't exist!" William Fay, executive director of the Building Energy Efficient Codes Network -- a coalition including The Alliance to Save Energy, Duke Energy Corp. and the National Association of State Energy Officials among other organizations -- called the e-mail an "urban myth." "The bill certainly does not require a retrofit, or an energy label for an existing home," Fay said. "It does not make them a condition of sale." This fact-check is clear-cut. There's nothing in the bill that would require homeowners to retrofit their homes to meet new efficiency standards or get a government "license" before putting their home on the market. Homeowners who do want to retrofit their homes can do so voluntarily and with the help of government funding. This chain e-mail gets a Pants on Fire!

pomt-08771	"Since February 2009, the private sector has lost millions of jobs while the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/24/john-boehner/minority-leader-john-boehner-relies-temporary-cens/	Rep. John Boehner, as House minority leader, is not bashful when it comes to criticizing the Obama administration and arguing that his Republican party offers a better way. Boehner seized that opportunity again during an appearance at the City Club of Cleveland. His targets were familiar ones: health care reform, the stimulus program, slow economic recovery and federal government running amok. "Since February 2009, the private sector has lost millions of jobs while the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers," the Ohio Republican said. Boehner's statement is a popular claim among Republicans when criticizing the White House and Democratic leadership in Congress. PolitiFact has checked out variations of the statement three times, including once involving Boehner. In each case we've arrived at similar conclusions, that while there's some truth to some of the statement, it glosses over important information. Careful readers will notice that previous PolitiFact stories cited somewhat different numbers than what follows below. That's because previous claims were made - and adjudicated by PolitiFact - based on the most up-to-date data for government, private-sector and census-specific hiring. But those numbers change each month, and PolitiFact uses current numbers unless a claim is based on a specific month's data. For example, a recent analysis of a hiring claim made by Rep. Steve LaTourette used May data because LaTourette based his claim on May numbers, which were fairly current at the time. Here we use new preliminary numbers available from July. First let's look at Boehner's contention that the private sector has lost millions of jobs. When we looked into the job figures previously, Boehner's office referred us to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, and said that they started the count from January 2009. By starting with that month's figure, all jobs lost in February 2009 and after would be included. In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to the BLS database of employment statistics. By the end of July 2010, BLS says, there were 107,737,000 private sector jobs. The July figure is a preliminary number that could be adjusted upward or downward as more data becomes available. But as it is now, that's a drop of 3.224 million jobs -- or as Boehner told the City Club, "millions of jobs." The biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 707,000 and 744,000 jobs disappeared. Job losses slowed down into last summer and fall. During the first five months of 2010, though, there were actually job gains. But what about the other part of Boehner's claim; that "the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers"? BLS data shows that there were 2,803,000 federal employees in January 2009. By the end of July this year, there were 3,017,000 federal workers, according to preliminary BLS figures. That's a gain of 214,000 federal jobs, or as Boehner put it, "hundreds of thousands of workers." But here’s the problem. Most of the growth of the federal workforce came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers. For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. Another 143,000 finished their jobs in July. What all this means is that from January 2009 through this July, there was a net increase of 191,000 new federal jobs. Exclude those workers hired for the census and total federal hiring comes to only 23,000. We think that's an important caveat to consider. The House minority leader is right on the money when he says millions of private sector jobs were lost. But his reliance on the temporary hiring of census workers to support the notion that the government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers shortchanges accuracy. That's why we rate this statement, just as we have previous similar claims, as Half True. Comment on this item.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-08-24T15:15:14	2010-08-24	['None']
pomt-01962	"Even when all other state agencies took cuts, Gov. [Nathan] Deal increased education spending every year."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/20/GaGOP/gop-overstating-deals-record-education/	Education has become a key battleground issue in Georgia’s race for governor. Republicans are touting what they see as Gov. Nathan Deal’s accomplishments. Democrats are hammering what they see as Deal’s shortcomings. State GOP leaders weighed in June 4 in a press release when they said this: "Even when all other state agencies took cuts, Gov. Nathan Deal increased education spending." Deal’s rival, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter, has kept up his attacks on the issue. "The single biggest failure of Georgia’s current leadership -- and the biggest drain on our economy -- is the dismantling of our education system," his campaign website says. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau ranks Georgia 40th in the nation in state revenue dedicated to education. It’s also a hot topic with voters and is the state’s single largest investment (54 percent of Deal’s proposed 2015 state budget was dedicated to education). That’s why the Truth-O-Meter has looked at claims about state education funding and continues to do so. In January, the governor received a Half True for stating that education funding had increased by more than $930 million during his administration. He was counting in that $930 million a $547 million increase that he was proposing but that lawmakers had not approved. His staff acknowledged the misstep. Now we’ll look at the state GOP’s claim, which we’ll tackle in two parts: 1). Did education spending increase every year during Deal’s administration, which began in January 2011? 2). At the same time, did all other state agencies see their budgets cut? A quick look at the numbers, which we obtained from state records and confirmed with the state’s budget chief, Teresa MacCartney, shows the answer to Question 1 is Yes. Fiscal year State education funds No. of students State spending per student 2012 $7,075,837,688 1,656,992 $4,270 2013 $7,326,807,956 1,679,589 $4,362 2014 $7,545,391,349 1,700,688 $4,436 2015 $7,944,481,675 1,700,688 $4,671 *2012, 2013, 2014 are from budgets that were amended at midyear. The 2015 budget year starts July 1 and ends June 30, 2015. That’s an increase of $868,643,987 -- or $402 per student. The biggest chunk -- about $399 million -- is effective for fiscal 2015, which begins July 1. (When the governor says that he’s added more than $930 million in funding for education, he’s now looking at pre-kindergarten through post-secondary, excluding capital education projects, MacCartney said. Collectively, that spending rose from $10,395,466,168 to $11,326,106,772, or 8.95 percent, she said.) To get the whole picture, though, there’s a couple of things to take into consideration. Enrollment growth, rising health care costs and pension expenses were the biggest drivers in the education budget increases. (Since 2012, public school enrollment grew by 43,696 students.) Secondly, school systems are still living with austerity cuts that began in 2003 and have persisted. As a result, many school systems have been forced to furlough teachers and staff, increase class sizes and compress their school years into fewer days. (About 80 percent of school districts were furloughing teachers in the 2013-2014 school year, many for five or more days, according to a 2013 survey by the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.) Deal is reducing the austerity cut to education for the first time for the coming school year to about $746 million after five years in which the cut topped $1 billion a year. On Question 2: We asked Ryan Mahoney, spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party, for evidence of the accuracy of the claim that all other state agencies had budget cuts each year in Deal’s tenure. He referred us to MacCartney. MacCartney confirmed what our research showed: It’s an overreach to say all other departments had budget cuts each year. "Most state agencies did receive cuts in their budgets," MacCartney said. "Of course, we had a few exceptions due to federal entitlement programs that we could not go below a federal MOE (memorandum of understanding or agreement)." She went on to explain that there were other reasons why some agencies’ budgets weren’t cut. For example, the state has a constitutional requirement to fund debt service and always funds its pensions. The state also required fewer cuts of the state Department of Corrections, MacCartney said. In our research, we found more than two dozen state agencies that saw budget increases in one or more years in Deal’s tenure, including the Department of Corrections, which saw its budget grow by $186 million. In summary, the state Republican Party is correct to say Deal increased spending for education every year since taking office. But it’s also important to know that while austerity cuts to schools are being reduced in the coming year by Deal, they still persist. It was a huge overreach to say that the state Department of Education was uniquely spared from budget cuts in Deal’s tenure. Other agencies also saw increases, so that part of the statement is incorrect. Overall, there is some truth to the statement, but it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate the GOP statement as Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Georgia	None	None	None	2014-06-20T00:00:00	2014-06-04	['None']
pomt-04984	"Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/22/robert-dimuccio/amica-insurance-president-robert-dimuccio-says-rho/	One of the late-night, end-of-session bills passed by the General Assembly in June would have required insurance companies to reach an agreement with auto body shops over the cost of a repair. Proponents, including the shops, characterized it as consumer-friendly legislation, contending that the shops are advocates for their customers. Opponents, including insurance companies, began a campaign to get Governor Chafee to veto the measure, which he ultimately did. Critics argued that the legislation would make insurance-related auto repairs even more expensive and drive up rates. Robert DiMuccio, chairman and president of Amica Insurance, made that pitch in a letter to policy holders, saying the legislation would allow "shops to set inflated prices for labor and repairs and use the threat of lawsuits to charge these exorbitant repair costs." He offered links to web pages showing which legislators voted in favor of the bill in the House and the Senate, and said it was another example of how, "over the past few years, the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island (ABARI) has pushed a legislative agenda that drives up the costs of auto body repair without consideration for the consumer." "As a result," he wrote, "Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation." We know Rhode Island ranks high on many scales of dubious distinction. So we wondered if DiMuccio was painting an accurate picture. It took us awhile to get to the bottom of it, but here’s what we found. When we called DiMuccio's office, an official at Amica said the data came from the Property Casualty Insurers (PCI) Association of America, a trade association of more than 1,000 insurance companies, which was running radio ads urging Chafee to veto the legislation. PCI spokesman Jeffrey Brewer told us its data came from Audatex, which provides software and other services to collision repair companies and automobile insurance claims processors. Those numbers are not publicly available but, after consulting with Audatex, he released them to us. When we analyzed the data, broken down by category in the report, here's what we saw. LABOR: This was, by far, typically the costliest part of a repair job, responsible for 41 percent of the average body shop repair bill. And Rhode Island, according to the study, was the second most expensive state for labor. Montana was the first. While the U.S. average labor cost was $953 per repair in 2010, the typical Rhode Island cost was 29 percent higher, or $1,233. Going to Connecticut would have saved you $66. Traveling to Massachusetts would have saved a hefty $361, which was $81 less than the U.S. average. ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER'S PARTS: In this category -- usually the second-most expensive part of the repair, accounting for 25 percent -- Rhode Island topped the list in costs. While the typical cost for this portion of the bill was $580, Rhode Islanders paid a whopping 49 percent more, or $866. Why the extra cost? It's not clear. But it's not location. In Alaska, the second most expensive state (shipping costs may be a factor), the average price for replacement parts was $61 less. Replacement parts cost $78 less in Connecticut and $281 less in Massachusetts. In South Carolina, they were less than half the price than in Rhode Island. OTHER PARTS: In this category, which includes parts not made by the car manufacturer, Rhode Island's ranking plummets to 27th, although the cost of these parts makes up only 13 percent of the average bill. OTHER COSTS (including towing and storage): Again, Rhode Island ranks in the middle of the pack at 26th, with costs 4 percent below the national average. These costs make up 22 percent of the average bill. OVERALL: The higher cost of labor and original parts makes Rhode Island auto body repair bills 23 percent more expensive than the national average. That made us the 5th most expensive in the nation, according to the 2010 Audatex data. New York ranks fourth and Connecticut ranks sixth. Massachusetts is a more-than-reasonable 43rd. But that's just one data source. Some auto body shops use a similar service run by Mitchell International, another automated tool for coordinating repair costs between auto body shops and insurance companies. Greg Horn, vice president for industry relations, sent us his company's numbers going back to 2006. Mitchell organizes its data in a different way so the results were slightly different. In their listing, Rhode Island ranked sixth in overall costs in 2010, not fifth. What was more interesting was the year-to-year trend. Rhode Island's ranking on the list of most-expensive states for accident-related car repairs has been going up steadily. We were 17th in 2006, 11th in 2007, 10th in 2008, 9th in 2009 and 6th in 2010. In 2011, based on data from their customers, Rhode Island was the second most costly state to have your car repaired after an accident. Breaking it down, we ranked 11th nationally on labor costs, ninth on the cost of parts and first in the cost of paint, which makes up nearly 12 percent of the average repair bill. PCI says the higher repair costs explain why Rhode Islanders pay the sixth highest collision insurance premium in the nation, although the numbers it's citing -- $356 versus $294 in the United States -- are from a 2008-09 database. When we asked the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island about that, spokeswoman Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, a lawyer, sent us an association publication showing that the average collision premium was about $356 around 2009, and a chart showing a decline since 2005. Petrarca-Karampetsos expressed concern that the data we had received from Audatex and Mitchell were not publicly available and "absolutely unverifiable." But rankings she provided from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners show Rhode Island 5th in 2006, 6th in 2007 and 5th in 2008, the most recent year available. The fact that the state was 5th in 2010 according to Audatex "indicates that Rhode Island has maintained the same rank for years!" she said in an e-mail. On a side issue, we also wonder whether car repairs in general -- non-accident-related repairs -- cost more in Rhode Island, even though insurance companies don't pay for them. One study suggests that those repairs have a very different cost profile here. CarMD, which collected data on the cost of 163,583 repairs done nationwide in 2011, found that the average cost of parts and labor in Rhode Island was $331, $3 below the national average. The range was $389 in Wyoming to $284 in Indiana. Our ruling Amica Insurance President Robert DiMuccio said, "Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation." From the context, it was clear he was talking about accident-related repairs, which is what insurance companies cover. Data from two national services that collect data show that Rhode Islanders typically pay far more than consumers in other states. According to the Audatex data, Rhode Island ranked fifth in 2010. According to Mitchell International, we've been steadily climbing in the rankings, at least since 2006, and have been in the top 10 since 2008. In 2011, we had peaked at second place. (As of July 15, 2012, we ranked fourth.) The auto body association says fifth- or sixth-place rankings are not new for Rhode Island, disputing Mitchell data suggesting a sharp increase in recent years. We'll steer clear of the debate over whether the General Assembly was wise to pass the law or whether Chafee was helping consumers when he vetoed it. But DiMuccio said our bills are currently among the highest now, and we're driven to rate it True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-00632	Democrat "Russ Feingold announced his Wisconsin Senate run today from…California."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/22/national-republican-senatorial-committee/did-russ-feingold-announce-his-us-senate-comback-c/	Republicans have had months to plan for Democrat Russ Feingold’s announcement that he would seek a rematch against U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who defeated him in 2010. The big word came May 14, 2015, when Feingold released a 90-second video saying he was in the race. Knowing that Feingold is teaching a course at Stanford University in California, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounced. Not long after Feingold tweeted his announcement, the NRSC issued this retort: "In what may be the oddest move of the campaign season thus far, Stanford Professor and failed 2010 candidate Russ Feingold announced his Wisconsin Senate run today from … California." The line of criticism was repeated throughout the day, including by conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes and on his Right Wisconsin website. More recently, it was picked up by Gov. Scott Walker, when he said Feingold "announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate while he was still in California." And the NRSC has continued to press the idea on its website, with a map that circles California ("where Feingold announced") and Wisconsin ("where he’s running.") So did Russ Feingold’s attempt at a Wisconsin comeback really begin in the Golden State? Prof. Feingold Since his 2010 defeat after 18 years in Washington, Feingold has taught classes at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., Marquette University in Milwaukee and twice at Stanford. He also held a temporary assignment for 18 months as the U.S. State Department envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. He left that post earlier this year. His current Stanford class is called "Implications of Post-1994 Conflicts in Great Lakes Region of Africa: an American Perspective." The course, offered to graduate and law school students, runs from March 30 to June 3, meeting from 4:15 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. on Wednesdays. We asked NRSC communications director Andrea Bozek for evidence to support the group’s claim that Feingold announced his new campaign from California. Her response: "If he was at class Wednesday night, how did he get back by 9:15 in the morning" on Thursday for an announcement? Asked if the group had proof that Feingold was in California at the time of the announcement, she responded: "I think the onus is on Sen. Feingold to prove that he was in the state when this video went out." The announcement Before we take a closer look at Feingold’s day, we should note that his campaign announcement video was made in the living room of the house he has owned for years in Middleton, Wis. That home -- and its garage door on which Feingold once painted campaign promises -- has factored prominently in his previous campaigns. During the 2010 campaign, WISN-AM radio talk show host Mark Belling claimed that Feingold faked an ad to make it appear that he was standing outside the house. We rated the claim Pants on Fire and Belling later backtracked. So what about Feingold’s whereabouts on May 14? A look at his Twitter and Facebook accounts provides solid evidence that he was in Wisconsin that day. An entry posted at 11:10 a.m. on Twitter includes a picture of Feingold sitting on a patio, talking on the phone. The message reads: "At home in Middleton. Excited to travel Wisconsin, meet with folks, and kick off our campaign. -RDF" The day goes on from there with pictures of visits to the Mocha Moment Coffee House in Janesville, and a stop for a beer at the Memorial Union Rathskeller at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Meanwhile, other tweets suggest Feingold has been back and forth while teaching the Stanford class. A March 21, 2015 tweet read: "At home today prepping for my class at Stanford. Took a break in beautiful Pheasant Branch Creek in Middleton." Bozek said Republicans would continue to emphasize Feingold’s out of state job and have assigned a "tracker" to follow Feingold when he is in California. On May 21, 2015, they posted and tweeted videos of Feingold walking to his class. "If you want to represent Wisconsin families you need to dedicate your time to listening to their concerns, rather than meeting with donors in California, " Bozek said. So how did Feingold teach his Stanford class and yet make it back to Wisconsin for the big day? His campaign said the answer was pretty simple: a red eye flight. Feingold took United Airlines flight 995 from San Francisco to Chicago. The flight left at about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday and arrived in Chicago at about 5:44 a.m. Thursday morning, said Russ for Wisconsin campaign manager Tom Russell. Feingold was picked up at the airport and back in the Badger State when his latest quest began, his campaign said. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Russ Feingold announced his campaign for Senate while in California. But tweets and other evidence shows he was in Wisconsin at the time. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14678	Says Marco Rubio "knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/gop-debate-cruz-says-he-voted-rubio-defense-spendi/	Sen. Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen. Marco Rubio’s attacks at the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina were "flat-out false." One attack pinpointed Cruz’s record on military spending. "The only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget for (Sen.) Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense," Rubio said. Cruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim. "The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion," Cruz said. "What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true." Rubio has criticized Cruz’s record on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections. But on his specific point about voting for Rubio’s amendment, Cruz is right. (We're not fact-checking whether Rubio "knows full well" about Cruz's vote.) Trying to counteract defense spending cuts over the past few years, Rubio put forth an amendment to increase military spending in March 2015. If passed, the amendment would have raised projected defense spending outlays through 2022 in Congress’ proposed budget. Cruz voted for the amendment. The measure failed 32-68. Cruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but it’s a little unclear exactly how much Rubio’s amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defense’s 2012 fiscal year request, which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion. The very same day, the Senate voted on a Paul amendment that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio both voted against the amendment, and it failed 4-96. Our ruling Cruz said Rubio "knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion." Cruz did indeed vote for a failed Rubio amendment that would have increased military spending after years of spending cuts. While the amendment didn’t specifically say spending would be increased to $697 billion, that figure was part of the discussion among the bill’s proponents. Cruz’s point is right on, so we rate his statement True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-01-15T11:22:01	2016-01-14	['Marco_Rubio']

pomt-00772	"In the early 1980s, Sen. Edward Kennedy secretly offered to help Soviet leaders counter the Reagan administration’s position on nuclear disarmament."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/apr/12/mackubin-thomas-owens/disputed-kgb-memo-sparks-mac-owens-claim-kennedy-t/	Forty-seven U.S. senators, all Republicans, ignited a strong reaction last month when they signed a letter that notified the "Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran" that any treaty with the U.S. on nuclear weapons would require Senate approval. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the letter’s signatories of diplomatic interference that treaded on more than two centuries of precedent. The Republicans’ letter, Kerry charged, was an attempt to pressure Iran’s leaders to negotiate with 535 members of Congress rather than with the administration. Other reaction, in support of the senators, came from some critics of the administration, including pundit Rush Limbaugh. On March 18, Newport’s Mackubin Thomas Owens joined Limbaugh in spotlighting a purported 1983 episode involving Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy and Republican President Ronald Reagan. "In the early 1980s, Sen. Edward Kennedy secretly offered to help Soviet leaders counter the Reagan administration’s position on nuclear disarmament," Owens wrote in a piece on the op-ed page of The Providence Journal. A former professor at the Naval War College, Owens directed legislative affairs for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons programs during the Reagan administration. Much of his op-ed article amounted to an effort to provide context on Congress’ role in foreign affairs and he did not take a side on the senators’ letter to Tehran. But like Limbaugh, Owens did latch onto the alleged episode involving Kennedy, arguing that it exemplifies the "rank hypocrisy" of Democrats accusing Republicans of undermining U.S. foreign policy. We wondered what Owens might know about any secret outreach to the Soviets made by Kennedy and we asked him for his sources. Owens cited a 2009 article in Forbes, which was based on a KGB memo about Kennedy. He forwarded us a copy of the memo. PunditFact, an arm of PolitiFact, recently examined the same memo while fact-checking a statement that Limbaugh made about the Kennedy matter. PunditFact found serious issues with the memo and labeled Limbaugh’s statement False. The KGB memo referring to Kennedy first emerged in the early 1990s and it was the basis of a news report published in the Times of London in 1992. Written by the head of the Soviet spy agency, Viktor Chebrikov, the 1983 memo was addressed to the Soviet Union’s top leader, Yuri Andropov, general secretary of of the Communist Party. Chebrikov discussed Kennedy’s purported views on Soviet-American relations and claimed Kennedy had a proposal to counter Reagan’s disarmament position. The spymaster based his memo on information provided by an intermediary, not by Kennedy himself. In the first sentence of the memo, Chebrikov signals that the information he is about to share in the letter comes from "a close friend and trusted confident" of Kennedy, who he says had visited Moscow on May 9 and May 10 of 1983. The memo identifies the intermediary as "J. Tunney," a reference to John Tunney, a private businessman and former Democratic U.S. senator who had been friends with Kennedy since law school. Tunney, Chebrikov wrote, had spoken to the Soviets on the senator’s behalf, sharing Kennedy’s perspectives on Reagan’s foreign policy and delivering "a message" for Andropov. At that time in 1983, Reagan’s plan to station medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe had concerned the leadership of the USSR. "Kennedy believes that, given the current state of affairs, and in the interest of peace, it would be prudent and timely to undertake the following steps to counter the militaristic politics of Reagan and his campaign to psychologically burden the American people," the memo says. The steps proposed by Kennedy, through Tunney, according to the memo, included an invitation for the senator to visit Moscow where he could "arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament." The memo says Andropov could then use these explanations during appearances on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the "peaceful intentions of the USSR." It also says that Kennedy wanted the Soviets to invite a Republican, possibly Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, to Moscow. As PolitiFact reported last month, Tunney told the The Times of London in 1992 that Chebrikov’s information was baloney, using an off-color term. Tunney emphatically repeated that denial last month in an interview with Politifact. "The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous," he said. "The memo is completely false." When PolitiFact asked archivists at the Reagan Library to search White House files on Kennedy, they were unable to find any episode involving the USSR in 1983. A search by the Senate Historical Office didn’t find anything either. According to PolitiFact, Stephen Cohen, a Princeton University political scientist with years of archival experience in Soviet era documents, said that many KGB documents were false and the papers cannot be taken at face value. In addition, a spokesman for Kennedy acknowledged in a 1992 exchange with a Boston Herald reporter that the senator had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing came of that outreach and "the rest of the memo is KGB fiction." Kennedy’s activities in Congress weren’t in lock-step with Reagan’s foreign policy. In 1982, for example, Kennedy and Hatfield proposed a resolution calling for both the U.S. and the Soviet Union to establish a freeze on the testing and production of nuclear weapons prior to negotiating reductions in armaments. Reagan rejected the proposal, asserting that an immediate freeze would put the U.S. at a disadvantage due to the Soviets’ "definite margin of superiority." He wanted reductions in armaments, to achieve parity, and then a freeze. Despite such public disagreements, the memoirs of Reagan’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman suggest that the administration appreciated the back-channel information conduit that Kennedy maintained with the Soviets. Kampelman’s memoirs say he welcomed Kennedy’s contact with the Soviets and in 1985 Reagan approved the arrangement. "I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency of official," Kampelman wrote. Our ruling Who’s to be believed? A couple of Washington politicos? The KGB? That’s a tough one. Owens’ statement rests on a 1983 KGB memo. The memo says a friend of Kennedy’s had made a verbal overture for the senator to meet with Andropov as part of an effort to counter the Reagan administration’s position on nuclear disarmament. The man who allegedly made the secret offering says the memo is completely false. Kennedy’s spokesman and Reagan’s disarmament negotiator have attested to the senator’s work behind the scenes with the Soviets, but neither says Kennedy worked secretly to undercut the President, as Owens claimed. So given Tunney’s denial, Kampelman’s memoir, and also questions about the reliability of KGB memos in general, we rate Owens’ claim, Mostly False.

pomt-04562	Bill Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor, "who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/26/national-rifle-association/nra-attacks-bill-nelson-voting-confirm-sonia-sotom/	The National Rifle Association wants Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson out of office. A flier mailed to some Floridians by the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action compares Nelson’s record on gun control with that of his Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. One of its points: "Bill Nelson voted to confirm Barack Obama's anti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court -- including Sonia Sotomayor who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms." For this fact-check, we wanted to confirm whether Nelson voted for Sotomayor and if she signed an opinion that said "Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms." The first part is easy for us: Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor, Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice, on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote. The second part -- that she signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms -- is a little harder to understand (at least, for those of us not trained in legalese). An NRA spokesman refused to elaborate on the ad’s claim for PolitiFact Florida, including which opinion is even at issue here. Still, given her short tenure and the scarcity of possible gun rulings, it didn’t take long to figure out. McDonald vs. Chicago It may not say it, but the ad is a reference to the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago, which dealt with handgun bans in Chicago and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. It picked up where a landmark (pre-Sotomayor) Supreme Court decision left off. In 2008, the court ruled in District of Columbia vs. Heller that the Second Amendment includes an individual right of gun ownership, overturning a D.C. ban on handguns. Heller dealt with federal law and left undetermined whether this interpretation of the Second Amendment applied to state and local government restrictions on guns. In McDonald, the court had to decide whether to "incorporate" the Second Amendment against the states. (Since the Civil War, the court has "incorporated," or extended, amendments within the Bill of Rights against state and local governments under the due process and equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment.) By a 5-4 majority, the court argued in McDonald that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a gun against the regulations of state and local governments. The New York Times called the case "an enormous symbolic victory for gun rights." This wasn’t the ruling Sotomayor wanted. She signed a 31-page dissenting opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer and co-signed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both Bill Clinton appointees. Breyer’s opinion argued that using guns for self-defense did not warrant federal constitutional protection. The Heller decision, Breyer wrote, was grounded in an ambiguous historical record that did not substantiate a private self-defense right against the states. The Second Amendment was enacted to protect militia-related rights, he said, and decisions on gun control should be determined by local governments and legislatures. Many news accounts of the ruling honed in on this line from the conclusion: "In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense." That mirrors the NRA’s claim about Sotomayor, said many experts we consulted. "This is an easy one," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. "The characterization of her opinion is accurate," said David Kopel, research director of the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct constitutional law professor at Denver University. "She joined an opinion that said Heller should be overruled." Advocates of gun control saw more nuance. "It was certainly not anti-gun," said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "The dissenting opinion did not pick a side in the gun debate." At issue was the more technical question about incorporating private armed self-defense as a "fundamental" right, he said. Was the right to keep a gun at home as central to U.S. citizenship as voting, freedom of speech and freedom religion that it deserved protection under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment? "That’s a different question than the question of whether the right exists or not," said Brian Van Houten, Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence managing attorney. "(The NRA) presented a very dramatic claim about Justice Sotomayor’s opinion in McDonald, but it doesn’t match the reality of what was said there." Others urged us to consider the alternative. If the opinion of Breyer and Sotomayor prevailed, states would have a lot more freedom to regulate gun ownership. "Effectively, (the NRA) may be correct in the sense that had the court ruled that the Second Amendment was not incorporated, it would have left the states free to legislate in any way they choose," said William Vizzard, California State University Sacramento criminal justice professor. We should expect litigation out of McDonald for years to come, he said. The important note to all of this, of course, is that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before her vote in McDonald. In the mailer, the NRA fails to provide this context, which in turn could confuse voters. Our ruling The NRA is correct in saying Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. And many experts see the group’s assertion that she signed an opinion "saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms" as fair. We heard lots of agreement from experts about this characterization, though two advocates of gun control said it is over-simplified. Gun-control supporters in particular told us the opinion she signed is not as "anti-gun" as the mailer would have readers believe. What's missing from this attack is the context that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before she signed the opinion in McDonald. That context slightly dulls the connection between Nelson and Sotomayor's position. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09996	Claims that former Sen. Tom Daschle said, "Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/03/chain-email/daschle-didnt-say-seniors-seniors-should-accept-ra/	Some chain e-mails remind us of a bad Three's Company episode. One roommate overhears something a little wrong and leaps to all sorts of misguided conclusions. Hijinks ensue. The latest chain e-mail sent to us from a reader puts some words into the mouth of former Sen. Tom Daschle that raised our eyebrows. Daschle, you may recall, was once President Barack Obama's choice to be secretary of health and human services. He stepped down from consideration amid revelations about tax problems, but some think his fingerprints can be seen in some of the health provisions in the economic stimulus package signed by the president in February. According to the e-mail (read the full text here ), Daschle was quoted in a Bloomberg story saying, "Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them." We thought that sounded a bit impolitic, and fairly callous, for a former senator to say, and so we decided to check it out. As with most e-mail claims, it starts with a grain of something. Bloomberg did run a story about health provisions in the stimulus package on Feb. 9, 2009, under the headline "Ruin Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan: Betsy McCaughey." It was a commentary piece written by Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York and an adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. McCaughey warned that the stimulus included several troublesome provisions identical to ideas outlined by Daschle in his 2008 book, Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis. Midway through the article, McCaughey includes this paragraph: "Daschle says health care reform 'will not be pain-free.' Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. That means the elderly will bear the brunt." We contacted McCaughey to see which parts of this were her words and which were Daschle's. The phrase that health care reform "will not be pain-free" is a direct quote from Daschle, she explained. She said the sentence beginning "Seniors should be more accepting" was her paraphrasing of an argument in Daschle's book in which he quotes David Mechanic, a health care policy expert at Rutgers University, saying, "more and more of what were once seen as social, behavioral, or normative aspects of every day life, or as a normal process of aging, are now framed in a medical context. ... Whether wrinkles, breasts, or buttocks, impotence or social anxieties, or inattention in school, they all have become grist for the medical mill." We think it's a stretch to summarize Daschle's position as saying that seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. Not treating wrinkles is one thing. Not treating, say, heart disease, is another. But that's fair enough for McCaughey to opine. This is labeled an opinion piece. The point is that these are McCaughey's words, not Daschle's. The last sentence, "That means the elderly will bear the brunt," was her conclusion, McCaughey said. McCaughey said she is a meticulous scholar and "I regret any misrepresentations made by others of my work or Mr. Daschle's views." Our efforts to reach Daschle for comment were not successful. In the chain e-mail, quote marks are shifted, clouding the issue of who is actually speaking, and the e-mail suggests that Daschle actually said that. The e-mail begins: "Apparently, seniors are expendable — treating us is not worth the expense (unless you're a congressman!). Then later: Tom Daschle was credited today by Bloomberg with the following statement. Bloomberg: "Daschle says health-care reform will not be pain free. Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them." The e-mail ends, urging, "Please use the power of the Internet to get this message out. Talk it up at the grassroots level. We have an election coming up in one year and nine months. We have the ability to address and reverse the dangerous direction the Obama administration and its allies have begun and in the interim, we can make their lives miserable. Let’s do it!" A few shifted quote marks make all the difference here. Instead of McCaughey's words, they become Daschle's. That kind of thing may have made for '70s sitcom gold, but here it just muddies the debate. We rule the claim in this e-mail False.

pomt-08231	"Re: (Marco) Rubio's support of earmark ban: In 2002 alone, he requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million."	true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/16/steven-schale/marco-rubio-wasnt-always-against-earmarks-florida/	A top Florida Democrat claims that the state's Republican U.S. Sen.-elect Marco Rubio is changing stories on budget earmarks. Rubio has become one of the leading advocates of a proposal from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., to seek a nonbinding ban on budget earmarks among Republicans in the chamber. "I think earmarks are bad for our country," Rubio said in an interview before Election Day. But Rubio didn't always think that way, says former Barack Obama Florida director Steven Schale. "I don't remember Rubio disagreeing with earmarks in the Florida Legislature," Schale posted on Twitter on Nov. 15, 2010, in reply to a story about Rubio supporting an earmark ban. In a separate post, Schale offered his evidence. "Re: (Marco) Rubio's support of earmark ban: In 2002 alone (a bad budget year in Florida), he requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million." In this case, we wanted to check Schale's math. Rubio served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000-2008, the last two years as House speaker. During his U.S. Senate campaign, Rubio was criticized by independent candidate Gov. Charlie Crist for requesting millions of dollars in pork projects, which Crist said he had to veto. We've rated two specific claims when it comes to Rubio and earmarks before -- we called a claim that he supported $800,000 to replace the turf at a field where he played flag football Half True and a claim that he tried to insert $1.5 milllion into the budget for a rowing institute Pants on Fire! Florida's version of the earmark was something called a Community Budget Issue Request -- a budget request legislators made for local projects. Legislators had to file their request ahead of the budget planning process and attach their name to every request. The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009, the year after Rubio left office. In 2002, Rubio's third year, the Florida House requested $1.5 billion in Community Budget Issue Requests, according to data kept by the state. To put that in perspective, the state budget that Gov. Jeb Bush signed that year totaled $50 billion, and legislators had been warned of a tight budget. (They actually were summoned back to Tallahassee to slash $1 billion from the budget in December 2001 to keep the state from going in the red.) Rubio's member budget requests for 2002 remain archived on a state website, which confirms Schale's statement. Rubio requested funding for 37 projects totalling $43,697,787. Here's the complete list. • $7.67 million, requested by Jackson Health System, to provide inpatient and outpatient health care services to people with HIV/AIDS, including medications, psycho-social counseling, education and case management. • $5 million, requested by Miami-Dade County, for an elevated, automated people-mover system connecting three elevated stations in front of the Miami International Airport passenger terminal with the planned Miami Intermodal Center. • $5 million, requested by Miami-Dade County Empowerment Trust, for a federally designated "empowerment zone" that targets county, state, and federal resources to stimulate economic development in distressed, low-income areas. • $2.25 million, requested by the city of Miami Springs, to eliminate recurring flood conditions through stormwater drainage improvements. • $2 million, requested by the Achievement & Rehabilitation Centers, Inc., for ARC Broward Inc., to provide intensive therapeutic & behavioral intervention for children aged 5-12 with severe autism or related disorders. • $1.5 million, requested by the South Florida Water Management District, for construction to permanently mitigate the recurring flood threat. • $1.5 million, requested by the city of West Miami, to reduce a wastewater collection system budget deficit. • $1.3 million, requested by the city of South Miami, to complete an upgrade to the city's stormwater drainage system to eliminate or reduce pollutants from the direct discharge of stormwater runoff and prevent local flooding. • $1.25 million, requested by the city of West Miami, for drainage improvements. • $1.2 million, requested by the city of South Miami, to provide high-quality municipal water and fire protection in the city. • $1.2 million by the city of Miami Springs, to relocate utilities to satisfy state DOT objectives at certain intersections. • $1.18 million, requested by Jackson Health System, for residential care for adjudicated substance abusing adolescents, including physician care, social work, nursing, psychology, medications and education. • $1 million, requested by the University of Miami School of Medicine for programs in spinal cord injury and brain research; to develop improved rehabilitation technologies; protect and prevent nervous system damage; and promote regeneration and recovery of function. • $1 million, requested by the city of Miami Springs, to eliminate infiltration in an existing wastewater treatment system. • Two separate $1 million community budget issues, both requested by Miami-Dade County, to provide hot evening and weekend meals to elderly residents of Miami-Dade County who are assessed as "high risk" or in danger of malnutrition. • $900,000, requested by the city of Miami Springs, to renovate an existing multi-purpose facility. • $787,059, requested by Public Health Trust of Miami for Jackson Health System, for short-term assessment and treatment of ajudicated minors for substance abuse, including medication, social work, education and physician care. • $750,000, requested by RFB&D of Miami for the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic Florida Unit, to meet the educational needs of Florida's print-disabled children and adults through taped and digital audio books. • $750,000, requested by the Department of Environmental Resource Management for the Miami-Dade County DERM, for the stormwater planning component for the C-4 Basin in north central Miami-Dade County. • $684,690, requested by Public Health Trust for Jackson Health System, for a medical foster care program for 88 children in state custody as an alternative to reducing institutional placements of children with chronic illnesses. • $675,000, requested by the Miami-Dade Homeless Trust, to provide post-crisis stabilization unit out-placement in transitional housing for chronic, mentally ill homeless persons recently discharged. • $600,000, requested by Miami Children's Hospital, to maintain and develop its pediatric trauma center. • $500,000, requested by Mayors Summit of the Americas, to create permanent offices in Florida for the Mayors Summit of the Americas, an organization of mayors of all the democratic countries of the hemisphere. • $500,000, requested by Children's Psychiatric Center in Miami, to provide at-risk children in kindergarten through third grade with individual mentoring. • $425,000, requested by the Florida Venture Foundation, to provide outreach, guidance, training, and technical support services to minority businesses in South Florida. • $400,000, requested by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, to facilitate services, trade and investment in Florida through a statewide database, website, out-bound and in-bound missions, one-on-one appointments and seminars. • $350,000, requested by One Nation Inc. of Miami, to help legal permanent residents become U.S. citizens free of charge, and also conduct monthly citizenship and voter registration drives in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. • $269,000, requested by the city of Coral Gables, for intersection improvements along U.S. 1. • $200,000, requested by the Children's Psychiatric Center of Miami, for an in-school program that provides therapeutic and behavioral support to the alternative education classrooms. • $200,000, requested by First Quality Home Care Inc. of Miami, for homebound insulin-dependent diabetics who are unable to self-administer their insulin due to a secondary diagnosis such as blindness. • $200,000, requested by the Achievement & Rehabilitation Centers, Inc., for ARC Broward Inc., to provide intensive specialized behavorial intervention in home and community-based settings; and specialized homebound speech, occupational and family therapies for children with severe autism and related disorders aged 3-18. • $175,000, requested by Curtiss Mansion Inc., to design the renovation of the historically important home of famed naval aviator and inventor Glen Curtiss. • $112,500, requested by the city of South Miami, for improvements to Dante Fascell Park, including drainage in parking lots and tennis courts, ADA-accessible playground equipment and picnic tables, resurfacing tennis and hardball courts, and replacing or repairing individual stations along the exercise path in the park. • $100,000, requested by Allapattah Wynwood Community and Development Center in Miami, for construction of a new child care facility in Miami's Allapattah Wynwood community to introduce early childhood intervention programs that serve 100 children from low/moderate income families. • $50,000, requested by the village of Virginia Gardens, to construct a 20-foot by 20-foot picnic shelter and concrete slab. • $25,000, requested by the city of West Miami, to provide resources to the city's police department to improve homeland security. (We made a link to Rubio's requests, which you can see here). It turns out Rubio requested more money in Community Budget Issue Requests than all but four members of the 120-member Florida House (Democrat Gary Siplin $65.1 million; Republican Mike Bennett $74.8 million; Republican Bev Kilmer $120.4 million; and Democrat Curtis Richardson $130.1 million). In 2001, Rubio actually requested even more money -- $101.2 million for 72 projects -- but Rubio did not make another Community Budget Issue Request after 2002, according to the state database. Not one in six years. But those aren't the years Schale referenced. Schale said Rubio requested 37 earmarks in 2002 worth $43 million -- which he says is at odds with Rubio's current support for an earmark ban.

pomt-13974	"Florida doesn't regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines. It doesn't require a permit to purchase a gun. It doesn't require any registration, whatsoever."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/13/hillary-clinton/clinton-mostly-right-about-florida-gun-laws/	Hillary Clinton and Democrats are talking about measures to restrict purchases of firearms in some instances after Sunday’s deadly attack at an Orlando nightclub. During an interview on CNN’s New Day, Clinton singled out Florida’s law needs to be changed. As of this writing, 49 people have been declared dead in the shooting rampage. Investigators say the attack was carried out by by 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a U.S. born citizen. "Florida doesn't regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines," Clinton said. "It doesn't require a permit to purchase a gun. It doesn't require any registration, whatsoever." Clinton made several claims about Florida’s law. We'll go through them one by one. Mateen used a .223-caliber assault rifle described as an AR type rifle and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the attacks. Both were purchased legally in recent days. Gun laws in Florida Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin led us to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence for evidence of this claim, which focuses on providing legal expertise in support of gun laws that reduce the number of gun-related deaths. The website makes the same assertion Clinton made on CNN: Florida doesn’t regulate assault rifles, .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines, nor does it require the registration of firearms. The definition of assault rifle varies, but it most often describes military-like rifles or semi-automatic rifles that may include detachable magazines. (The AR type weapon Mateen used certainly would qualify.) .50-caliber rifles can shoot from long distances with accuracy (they use wider ammunition) and large-capacity ammunition magazines allow the shooter to fire multiple rounds before having to reload. Mateen did not have a .50-caliber rifle. Clinton is correct that Florida places no additional regulations on owning those types of firearms or accessories. As far as registration, Florida law prohibits keeping a registry of legally bought firearms. "A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a law enforcement tool and can become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm and exercise their Second Amendment …" chapter 790.355 reads. Florida does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, but those records are sealed from the public. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research said that Clinton’s claim is "true on all fronts." Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University agreed that Clinton is correctly reciting specific parts of Florida gun law. But Kleck cautioned about singling out Florida. The state, he said, is "essentially identical to most other states with regard to these kinds of gun controls." Kleck said that only seven states including Washington D.C. ban some type of assault weapons, while the other 43 regulate them the same as other types of guns. He also said only two other states and Washington D.C. prohibit .50 caliber firearms and eight states ban large capacity magazines. "For good or ill, (Florida) is squarely in the American mainstream regarding the gun controls that Clinton mentions," Kleck said. "Consequently one cannot legitimately argue (or hint) that this mass shooting was especially likely to occur in Florida because it lacked these controls." Our ruling Clinton said that Florida’s gun laws don’t regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines or require a permit or registration to purchase a gun. There’s no denying that Clinton described Florida law correctly. But an expert cautions that Florida law isn’t all that different than many places across the country. With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac283bed-3a7e-4e3e-8f5d-167ef2ef7a3c	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-13T17:34:39	2016-06-13	['None']

pomt-12339	"Two million more people just dropped out of Obamacare. It is in a death spiral."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/14/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-ties-flawed-obamacare-data-death-spi/	President Donald Trump often says that the health insurance exchanges for buying individual coverage are collapsing under their own weight. Recent reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided him with another data point. "2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral," he tweeted June 13. We decided to look at that 2 million figure and see whether it adds weight to the argument that the Affordable Care Act exchanges are collapsing. What we found isn’t nearly as convincing as Trump made it sound. It’s become routine for people to leave the health insurance exchanges in the first months of the year, and is often a signal they found insurance through an employer. The number this year is higher, experts say, primarily because of a change in when the federal government collected the data. The government report The 2 million figure comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' snapshot of people who signed up for insurance on an exchange, by the Jan. 31, 2017, deadline, but have not paid the premium to keep the policy active. The report said that 10.3 million individuals had paid the premiums needed to have coverage in February. Compared to total signups of 12.2 million, that was a drop of 1.9 million people, or about 15 percent. First, that has happened in previous years. In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services examined who had paid through all of March and found that the number of enrollees fell from 11.7 million down to 10.2 million, a drop of 1.5 million or about 13 percent. In 2016, the number fell from 12.7 million down to 11.1 million, a drop of 1.6 million or again about 13 percent. (The 2015 enrollment deadline was different but the one for 2016 was the same as this year.) In 2015 and 2016, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services looked at people who paid their premium through the end of March. And for good reason. In nearly every state, people who buy coverage in the last two weeks of January are buying policies that don’t begin until March. That gives them more time to pay before the policy lapses. In 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services looked at who made payments through the end of February. That is a full month shorter than the year before and out of step with the March 1 start date for many policies. (Some news reports said the figure was as of March 15, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service looked at payments due only for February policies.) We asked why the federal agency changed its reporting timeline and were told it had to do with the release of a report on 2016 enrollment. We note that all the data for March was available at the time when this report was released. Why a change in method matters The impact of the change could be significant. The website ACASignups, a project of data activist Charles Gaba, tracks enrollment numbers across the country. Gaba reported that as of mid January, 11.7 million people had signed up. That would leave about 500,000 people who purchased policies that would not kick in until March. The federal government, in its report, assumed every one of them didn’t pay their premium and dropped coverage. But we don’t know that to be the case. The missing month could make another difference. In a time when the unemployment rate has fallen, more people might have found work. There are several reasons why people don’t follow through and pay their premiums. Some don’t have the cash, or they turn 65 and get on Medicare. However, Melinda Buntin, professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University, said employment is a major reason. "More than half, about 60 percent, of those who did drop coverage (after paying for at least one month) said they did so because they obtained employer-sponsored coverage," Buntin said. Based on a separate 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report, those who left due to a job outnumbered those who cited the high cost of premiums by a margin of more than four to one. That study also said that insurance companies leaving the exchanges contributed to people dropping coverage. That has been a growing problem in recent months, partly of Trump’s making. "Efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have exacerbated what was already a turbulent market," said Timothy Callaghan, a professor of health policy at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. "This has caused some insurers to raise their prices and others to exit the market entirely." Death spiral? Trump went on to say that people failing to pay their premiums is a sign of a death spiral. As we have written before, there certainly are problems with the health exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act. For instance, in Iowa, insurers have threatened to pull out of the exchanges in 94 of the state’s 99 counties. A death spiral is a specific term that described when healthy people leave the insurance market due to the cost. That leads to higher premiums for the people remaining in the insurance pools, who tend to be sicker, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle until the entire system fails. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in March that the individual insurance market, which relies on the exchanges, would "probably be stable in most areas under either current law," or the proposed American Health Care Act. Our ruling In a tweet, Trump linked 2 million people dropping coverage on the Obamacare exchanges to a "death spiral." The figure is plucked out of context. The pattern of people signing up and then dropping coverage has been steady over the past few years. One reason people do so, experts and government data say, is because they find coverage someplace else, most often by getting a job. The current government report behind Trump’s figure suggests the percentage of people letting their policies lapse has gone up, but this year, the government changed when it counted those lapsed policies. According to experts, that change created the appearance of a trend that might not exist. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05404	Says the oil industry subsidies that President Barack Obama is attacking don’t exist	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/04/bill-johnson/bill-johnson-says-subsidies-oil-companies-barack-o/	In addition to straining household budgets across the country, rising gas prices are causing America’s politicians to make statements that strain credibility. At an April 17 news conference at the U.S. Capitol with other with conservative members of Congress, freshman GOP Rep. Bill Johnson of Marietta responded to President Barack Obama’s attacks on federal subsidies for oil companies with an attack of his own. After observing that Obama did not take care of this issue when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, Johnson went further. "He didn’t do anything to try to stop those subsidies when he could have gotten it through," said Johnson. "That’s because they don’t exist. This is political rhetoric. It is what you would expect coming from the White House and this president in a campaign year like this." That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We sought more information on Johnson’s claim that the subsidies attacked by Obama and numerous groups don’t exist. His office supplied a statement, in which he said "a subsidy is a direct payment from the government to a company from the U.S. Treasury," which oil companies don’t receive. The tax code permits "all companies and individuals to deduct certain business expenses, and oil companies are no different in this regard," Johnson said. The same argument has been made by the American Petroleum Institute, as well as other GOP politicians. Their argument basically rests on two points. First, oil industry tax breaks are no different from those received by other businesses. Secondly, it’s incorrect to classify those tax breaks as subsidies. We’ll look at each one. Obama’s proposed FY 2013 budget called for removing a handful of "tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production," and estimated that doing so would yield more than $4 billion a year. Specifically, it called for repealing tax provisions for "expensing intangible drilling costs," a "deduction for tertiary injectants," an "exception to passive loss limitations for working interests in oil and natural gas properties, "a percentage depletion for oil and natural gas wells," and a "domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies." It also called for increasing "the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers to seven years." Those seem directly targeted to the oil and gas industry, and not applicable to other businesses. When Obama’s budget was released, the American Petroleum Institute’s president said those provisions unfairly targeted his industry and would diminish job creation. "Instead of advancing constructive pro-development policies, his budget plan calls for increased taxes on America’s oil and natural gas industry," API president Jack Gerard said Feb. 13. The nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry, and says the industry also benefits from an extra $5.5 billion worth of general business tax provisions that companies in other industries also claim. "The oil and gas industry often argues the tax breaks they take advantage of are available to every industry," the group’s vice president, Steve Ellis, said in an email. "But obviously other industries can’t realistically claim the Intangible Drilling Costs tax credit (created in 1918) or the Expensing of Tertiary Injectants tax credit or the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit for blending ethanol into fuel." The American Petroleum Institute likens its drilling cost tax credit to research and development tax deductions available to other industries, and says the costs of the tertiary injectants put into older reservoirs to help continue production "are expensed similar to materials and supplies because they are generally used up in the production process." As for the second point, Johnson and others say that a subsidy is a direct payment of money to a person or business by American taxpayers, and the term shouldn’t be applied to tax credits. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued that point in a December column in the conservative Washington Times, writing that oil companies receive "business deductions" rather than subsidies, and the two "are as different as apples and oranges." "The semantically accurate way to describe legislation that would eliminate the manufacturing deduction or curtail the foreign tax credit for oil and gas companies is straightforward: the imposition of tax discrimination, not the removal of federal subsidies," Hufbauer wrote. "Because most Americans agree that tax discrimination is bad policy - Uncle Sam shouldn’t be picking winners and losers through the tax code -- accurate language would diminish these proposals." Merriam Webster describes a subsidy as "a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public." Definition of the term "subsidy" became a focus of U.S. Senate debate in March, when legislators nixed Obama’s effort to end the disputed oil and gas industry tax breaks. Republicans argued the tax breaks weren’t subsidies. Democrats like Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown applied that term to the tax breaks under discussion. While use of the word "subsidy" to describe tax credits for the energy industry seems most popular among Democrats, plenty of Republicans have used that phrasing, too. When Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio claimed in January that federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Chevrolet Volt "to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold," his subsidy tally included tax breaks. When Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander delivered a February 15 speech to oppose federal tax breaks for wind power, he called them subsidies. A March 2012 Congressional Budget Office report on federal financial support for energy development and production also refers to energy tax preferences as "subsidies." Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says tax breaks are subsidies because they subsidize the bottom line of recipients. He says government subsidies encourage taxpayer behavior that might not otherwise occur. So where does that leave Johnson’s claim? Both Democrats and Republicans have widely applied the term "subsidy" to tax breaks. We think it’s semantic hair-splitting to argue the term is being improperly applied. While it may not involve the sending of a U.S. Treasury check to a company, a tax break has the same practical impact, allowing a company to hold onto money it might otherwise pay in taxes. Defenders of the oil industry tax breaks, like Hufbauer, may argue that "Uncle Sam shouldn’t be picking winners and losers through the tax code," but that practice is undeniably widespread. A federal tax deduction for mortgage interest subsidizes homeownership. A recently expired ethanol tax credit subsidized corn growers. And the tax breaks that Obama targeted for things like "drilling costs" and "tertiary injectants" specifically subsidize the oil industry. If they did not, why would the industry’s trade association vigorously protest their proposed elimination? We won’t address whether eliminating the oil industry tax breaks is good or bad policy. But the fact is those tax breaks do exist and they benefit the oil industry. But Johnson arguing they are not subsidies amounts to semantic gymnastics that ignores usage commonplace among his colleagues in Washington. On the Truth-O-Meter, Johnson’s claim rates False.

pomt-10926	Says Pete Gallego canceled a "planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jul/27/roland-gutierrez/roland-gutierrez-pete-gallego-canceled-Sandy-Hook-/	In a fundraising appeal, San Antonio state Rep. Roland Gutierrez portrayed fellow Democrat Pete Gallego of Alpine as a "career politician" whose "cozy relationship" with the National Rifle Association prompted him to scrap a meeting with the parents of Sandy Hook children. As a U.S. House member, we confirmed, Gallego fielded a donation from the NRA, which graded his record highly. But he also met with the parents concerned about gun issues though not at the originally scheduled time, interviews and photos show. Gutierrez and Gallego, who won a term in Congress after spending more than 20 years in the Texas House, appear to be the highest-profile hopefuls among eight contenders to serve out more than two years left in convicted felon Carlos Uresti’s term representing Texas Senate District 19, which sprawls southwest from San Antonio to the border and west past Alpine and Pecos. The election is July 31, 2018. Gutierrez declared in a July 18, 2018, campaign email blast that Gallego "in a moment of political cowardice, cancelled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims," referring to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six staff members dead. The Dec. 14, 2012, massacre occurred 20 days before Gallego began what proved to be one term representing Texas’ 23rd Congressional District. But a group of victims’ family members met with individual lawmakers in June 2013, about six months into Gallego’s term. So, did Gallego cancel his meeting with shooting victims’ families? Postponed by hours? A web link in Gutierrez’s email led us to a June 15, 2013, Huffington Post news article recapping efforts by victims’ families and friends to seek a change in law requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Federal law requires such checks for purchases from licensed gun dealers but not in private transactions including gun shows. The Post story indeed says Gallego canceled his meeting with Newtown Action Alliance, a group that describes itself as a "Newtown-based, national grassroots organization" whose mission is to "achieve the steady and continuous reduction of gun violence through legislative and cultural changes." Also, the story says, Gallego’s office did not immediately respond to the Post’s request for comment. But hold on: An update affixed at the end of the story quotes Erin Nikitchyuk, a mother whose son survived the rampage, saying that Gallego rescheduled and then held his meeting with the group, during which he was "conscientious" and "welcoming," Nikitchyuk was quoted saying. For our part, we asked Nikitchyuk about the described meeting through Facebook messages. She replied: "I absolutely remember meeting with him. In fact, his is the most memorable meeting I had." Nikitchyuk subsequently messaged us the group’s itinerary from its trip to Washington, D.C., June 12 and 13, 2013 and showing that family members initially expected to meet Gallego at 9:45 a.m. on Thursday, June 13. Nikitchyuk also connected us with another Alliance member, Kari Hulgaard, who posted to Facebook photos of Gallego in the Alliance-coordinated meeting: Photos courtesy of Kari Hulgaard’s Facebook page (album titled "2013 June Newtown Action Alliance") Hulgaard posted the photos on Facebook June 14, 2013 and made the photos viewable to anyone after we made our inquiries. By text, she told us she wasn’t sure if the meeting took place that day or simply later than the originally scheduled 9:45 a.m. June 13. Hulgaard wrote: "Our group was able to spend a generous amount of time with Gallego. He was most endearing and helpful in gaining perspective about how politics work in Texas when it comes to gun violence and gun laws." Nikitchyuk separately told us that among the meeting attendees were "the brother of one teacher who lost her life and at least one survivor sibling." Gallego, asked for his account, said by phone that the meeting singled out by Gutierrez wasn’t canceled; it was slightly postponed, he said. Gallego said he ultimately met with "eight to 10" members of the Alliance for "an hour, hour and a half," he estimated. Gallego on changes to gun laws So, did Gallego commit, after meeting family members, to supporting universal gun-purchase background checks? He did not, according to the Post story, which quotes Nikitchyuk saying, "we clearly do not have his vote on supporting background checks at this time." In 2018, she told us by phone that alliance members asked Gallego "where he stands." According to Nikitchyuk, Gallego responded, "Do you want to know where I stand or how I’ll vote? Because they’re not necessarily the same thing." He went on to tell the Alliance they "would need to change the hearts and minds of his constituents," Nikitchyuk said. By phone, Gallego said he didn’t remember saying he wouldn’t support a bill mandating universal background checks, but did recall talking to the group about restoring a federal assault weapons ban. Nonetheless, Gallego said by text that he now believes "if you’re buying a weapon--whether at a store or at a gun show or through most private transactions, you should pass a background check." We alerted Colin Strother, a political consultant to Gutierrez, of the indications that Gallego met with the alliance members; Strother stood by Gutierrez’s claim that Gallego had canceled such a meeting. By phone, Strother also noted that Gallego in Congress had an A-level rating from the National Rifle Association, which donated $1,000 to Gallego’s congressional campaign in 2014, federal filings show. Strother also told us Gutierrez supports universal background checks and a federal ban on assault weapons. Our ruling Gutierrez said Gallego as a U.S. House member "canceled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims." This claim proved factually incomplete. Interviews and photographs demonstrate that Gallego postponed yet held the meeting at issue. The gathering took place a few hours or possibly a day after it was originally penciled in.

pomt-10560	"The last six polls, including this week's Time magazine, show that I beat John McCain by six or seven points."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/11/barack-obama/polls-show-obama-beating-mccain/	Sen. Barack Obama regularly makes the argument that he will be a stronger general election candidate than his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton. In a speech at a campaign rally on Feb. 10, 2008, he continued to expound on that theme, this time citing poll numbers. "The last six polls, including this week's Time magazine, show that I beat John McCain by six or seven points," Obama declared at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va. At the time of of his speech, several polls indeed showed Obama beating McCain by a six-point or more margin. The Time magazine poll showed him beating McCain by seven points, 48 to 41. An Associated Press/Ipsos showed him winning by six points, 48 to 42. A CNN poll showed him winning by eight points, 52 to 44. But those are three polls, not six. (For a neat summary of recent Obama-McCain polling, check out this link from RealClearPolitics.com; we accessed it on Feb. 11, 2008.) We weren't able to find three other recent polls showing similar results. It's possible that Obama has access to private polls we haven't seen. We asked the campaign for a response but didn't hear back. So we will deduct a small amount on the Truth-O-Meter for his citing of "the last six polls," but Obama's larger point is correct. Polls show he is winning against McCain, while Clinton either loses to McCain or beats him by a smaller margin. So we award this statement a Mostly True.

pomt-02260	Before "our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/10/joe-scarborough/how-rare-it-we-had-three-presidents-re-elected-con/	On Thursday’s Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough dropped a bit of presidential trivia that we hadn’t heard before. During a discussion about the inability of recent American presidents to accomplish major political achievements, Scarborough said that before "our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s, to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected." The first part of Scarborough’s statement is true -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all won consecutive presidential terms -- but we wondered just how rare the feat is. Very rare, it turns out. In fact, it’s only happened once before -- from 1800-24, when Thomas Jefferson, James Madision and James Monroe were each elected to consecutive terms. (They were the third, fourth and fifth presidents.) We’ve only come close one other time, but deaths and resignations interrupted that: • President Harry Truman served more than seven years in office, having finished President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fourth term and having been elected on his own once, in 1948 (1945-52). • President Dwight Eisenhower served two full terms (1953-60). • President John F. Kennedy was assassinated during his first term. President Lyndon B. Johnson completed Kennedy’s term and was elected to his own four-year term in 1964 (1961-68). • President Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968 and re-elected in 1972 before resigning in 1974 (1969-74). Our ruling Scarborough said that before "our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected." He’s right. The last -- and only -- presidents before Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama to be re-elected back-to-back were Jefferson, Madison and Monroe in the early 1800s. We rate Scarborough’s claim True.

pomt-06834	Central Falls "schools are overfunded by state money by as much as $8 million."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/07/daniel-mckee/cumberland-mayor-mckee-says-rhode-island-giving-ce/	The financially-troubled city of Central Falls filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on Aug. 1, 2011, after receiver Robert Flanders Jr. was unable to get enough concessions from past and current employees. Flanders took the action because of the city’s dire financial problems, driven in part by a grossly underfunded pension plan for police officers and firefighters. According to the filing, unless major changes are made, the city will have a deficit of $5.6 million by June 30, 2012. Central Falls is the first municipality in Rhode Island history to file for bankruptcy. In reacting to the development, Daniel McKee, mayor of bordering Cumberland, suggested in a radio interview that the tiny city's financial problems might be solved by shifting money the state is spending on Central Falls schools into the municipal budget. "Just on the state funding formula alone, you know that the schools are overfunded by state money by as much as $8 million," he told WPRO talk show host Dan Yorke. "In terms of the student base and the student count, the new school funding formula details somewhere in the vicinity of about $8 million more than they need to operate the schools." McKee went on to say that "just basic math says if they're four to five million under in the municipal side and eight million over on the school side, I know if that was in Cumberland, if I added the two together, I'd be running a plus $3 million. I think there are dollars on the table that, on a long term, hopefully the people who are going to make the decisions there are going to figure that out." So does Central Falls really have $8 million allocated to schools that it could use to cover the shortfall in its municipal budget? First, a little background on the unique nature of the Central Falls school system. In 1991, following years of financial difficulties in the city, the state took over operation and financing of the city’s school system. A board of trustees appointed by the Rhode Island Board of Regents now oversees the system. Rhode Island taxpayers pay almost the entire cost of running the schools -- a total of $42.9 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30. (The city pays only to maintain the school buildings.) All other Rhode Island school systems are financed through a combination of local tax revenue and state and federal aid. Now, back to McKee. We asked the mayor where he got his $8-million estimate. He sent us to a web page from the state Department of Education, dated June 10, 2010, outlining year-by-year changes in the amount of money the state was planning to give the various school systems. The web site referred to overfunding for Central Falls schools. To understand what the numbers mean, some explanation, courtesy of department spokesman Elliot Krieger. Up until the mid-1990s, Rhode Island had a formula to determine how much state money to send to school districts. But the General Assembly froze the aid formula in the 1994-1995 fiscal year, opting instead to simply increase the amount each year in various ways that didn't necessarily reflect important elements such as student enrollment or poverty levels. It eliminated the formula altogether three years later. After that, the increases varied year to year. A year ago, the General Assembly passed a new funding formula that takes into account several factors, including enrollment, student need and local taxing capacity. Under the new formula, some school districts get a lot more money, and some a lot less. Applying the new funding formula immediately would have been a huge shock to the system, at least for the communities that -- according to the formula -- had been getting far more state money than they deserved. So, under the plan, the overfunded communities would get their allotment cut, in steps, over 10 years. Underfunded communities would see their aid levels rise over 7 years. According to the latest calculation from the Department of Education, the Central Falls school system is actually overfunded this fiscal year by about $14.3 million. The $42.9 million it received during the last fiscal year will be reduced by $1.4 million per year over the next decade, an amount that the state will adjust as enrollment and the city's demographics change. That means this year the city is getting nearly $13 million more for its school system than the state says it should need -- $5 million more than McKee’s estimate. McKee said that when he cited the $8-million figure, he was trying to avoid exaggerating the potential for savings. But there is another problem with McKee’s statement and his underlying point. Just because the state says a community SHOULD be able to run its school system on the level of funding calculated by the state doesn't mean that it CAN. Some expenses, such as teacher salaries, can remain locked in by contract for a few years. McKee argues that things are different now that Central Falls is in bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy judge, at the recommendation of the state-appointed receiver, can make unilateral changes in just about everything, including contracts, and quickly bring expenses into line. The result, he contends, would be immediate savings in the school budget that can be transferred to the municipal side of the ledger to solve the city's short-term fiscal problems. "You've already got enough money internally inside of that community right now to operate without pestering the taxpayers of the state of Rhode Island," he said. Finally, and fundamentally, it's not at all clear that the "excess" money can be tapped by the bankruptcy court. According to Krieger, the education spokesman, those funds are in the state general fund and not earmarked for Central Falls itself. "Basic math," as McKee puts it, may not apply here. We'll have to wait and see. But that issue goes beyond the scope of the statement that we're checking. In the end, while he was right about the overfunding, the dollar amount he cited was off by so much, we rate his statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-00035	Says a manufacturing operation in his hometown that made gunstock for Remington rifles "closed down, we lost those jobs and it's been devastating for my little town."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/05/josh-hawley/checking-josh-hawley-whether-gunstock-company-his-/	In the Oct. 25 debate between Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Sen. Claire McCaskill, an audience member asked about businesses and jobs moving out of the country. Hawley, who is vying for McCaskill’s Senate seat, sought to explain how that issue was personal to him. "The rural town that I grew up in — Lexington, Missouri, it's not too far from here — we used to have a manufacturing operation in that town, made the gunstock for Remington rifles, I believe it was," he said. "And that plant closed down, we lost those jobs and it's been devastating for my little town." We wanted to know more about Hawley’s story. Was it true that a gunstock manufacturing operation closed, taking away jobs? A brief history Gunstock manufacturer S&K Industries, a gunstock manufacturing company founded by Roy Stout in 1961. In 1986, S&K picked up Remington Arms as a client. The family business had three locations in Lexington, said Penny Grosso, executive director of the Lexington Chamber of Cmmerce. Remington went on to buy two of them, said city administrator Joe Aull. (We confirmed one facility’s purchase happened in September 2009, according to a 2010 air pollution permit with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.) We wondered how the sale might have led to a facility closure or lost jobs. Finding the answer was more complicated than we thought. Multiple calls to Remington Arms Company’s national press office were not returned. Former S&K president Thomas Stout could not be reached. The Hawley campaign did not respond. After checking past records and speaking with a longtime plant worker, Aull said S&K never shut down its facilities before the sale. The third site, at 8th and Main streets, was not part of the Remington sale. We found another 2010 air pollution permit for S&K to operate a "new wood trophy parts and plaque painting process" on that location. That permit noted S&K previously housed a gunstock manufacturing facility there. But, "the operation was shut down in December 2008" and the original permit eventually expired. It should be noted that from 2008 to the sale, S&K was still selling gunstocks, per many posts on an online forum for gun owners, suggesting the other locations were still in operation. As a postscript: Lexington’s Remington Arms almost closed down, but in 2017 received a $1.6 million state grant for upgrades to its plant in return for promising that the company would employ at least 80 people and stay in town for another five years. Our ruling Hawley said that the gunstock manufacturing plant in his hometown of Lexington "closed down." Of the three S&K Industries locations in Lexington, one site shut down for gunstock manufacturing, but the rest continued operations and were purchased by Remington Arms without much hassle. So technically, Hawley is right, but it was just one facility, not an entire business. His statement overstates the effect, making it seem like the manufacturing business left town or was shuttered.

pomt-10618	"So that 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy. That's why I voted against it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/hillary-clinton/no-it-was-a-boon-to-renewable-fuel-industry/	Hillary Clinton may want some of the comments she made in Vegas to stay in Vegas. During a televised MSNBC debate, the New York senator, who voted against the Energy Policy Act of 2005, called the law a "Dick Cheney lobbyist energy bill" that gave enormous tax breaks to the oil and gas industry. As president, Clinton said she would invest $50-billion in clean, renewable energy. "So that 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy," said Clinton. "That's why I voted against it. That's why I'm standing for the proposition — let's take away the giveaways that were given to gas and oil, put them to work on solar and wind and geothermal and biofuels and all of the rest that we need for a new energy future." Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who voted for the bill in 2005, had a different view. "Well, the reason I voted for it was because it was the single largest investment in clean energy — solar, wind, biodiesel — that we had ever seen," Obama said. While the Energy Policy Act of 2005 did give the oil and gas industry tax breaks and incentives to boost production, the law also mandated 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels to be blended into gasoline by 2012 — the largest such mandate ever enacted and one widely credited with sparking an ethanol plant construction boom across the Midwest. The law also funneled hundreds of millions of dollars toward biomass research and the production of biofuels derived from the leaves, stems and stalks of a plant rather than corn kernels used to make ethanol. "It obviously wasn't (a step backward)," said Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association. "It created a meaningful market for renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel." Clinton's comments are particularly interesting given that she returned to Washington from the campaign trail last month to vote for the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The 2007 energy law raises fuel economy standards for the first time in 32 years and requires production of billions of gallons more ethanol and biofuel. But Senate Democrats, facing a veto threat from the White House and opposition from oil-state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, did not succeed in rolling back oil and gas industry tax breaks to pay for $21.5-billion in incentives for alternative energies such as solar and wind. Obama voted for the bill, too. Rolling back tax breaks for the oil and gas industry in this Congress, and with this administration, is as likely as winning big in Vegas. Clinton's best chance will come if and when she moves into the Oval Office. And despite being right when it comes to the 2005 Energy Policy Act's treatment of the oil and gas industry, we find her assessment of its impact on renewable energy False.

pomt-13157	"Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families."	true	/texas/statements/2016/oct/28/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-calling-more-foster-parents-says-state/	News reports show a persistent crisis at Texas’ Child Protective Services, where investigators missed a key deadline to meet with thousands of at-risk kids and dozens of children are sleeping in state offices due to a foster parent shortage. For his part, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick -- who has not been an adoptive or foster parent, according to spokesman Keith Elkins -- called on the state’s "many faith-based communities" in advance of November’s National Adoption Month to "help identify homes open to children in need of foster care." "Thousands of children in Texas’ foster care system need your help," Patrick said in an Oct. 17, 2016, press release. "They need safe and loving homes, and many are looking for a forever home." Patrick went on: "Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families and are working with me to inspire a statewide movement to answer this calling. I hope you and your family will consider doing the same." Have elected officials been providing foster care to needy children? A reader asked us to check. To our inquiry, Elkins gave us the names of five Republican elected officials who had each videotaped a testimonial about her or his "adoption/foster experience." We watched one video, uploaded to YouTube Oct. 14, 2016, that shows state Sen. Konni Burton, R-Colleyville, talking about her adoption of two girls. "My husband and I are adoptive parents," she says in the video. "They were fostered by wonderful, loving families who opened their homes to care for them before joining our forever family." Elkins said the video rotation began Oct. 10, 2016 and others would roll out each Monday for several weeks. Next, we looked for independent confirmation that the officials identified by Patrick’s office — several legislators and a statewide elected leader — had fostered or adopted children. In each instance, we found, the official had adopted one child or more. It looked to us like two of the officials provided foster care before adopting. What we found: Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick adopted her daughter Catherine, according to a January 2015 profile in SHALE Oil & Gas Business magazine. In a March 2014 video in which she talked about the experience, Craddick, a single mother, said her daughter was 2 years old and that Craddick became an adoptive parent during her 2012 campaign. State Sen. Konni Burton of Colleyville years ago adopted two daughters, who were both adults as of October 2016, from the Gladney Center for Adoption in Fort Worth, according to an October 2016 YouTube video in which Burton speaks about the experience. She has not been a foster mother, Burton told us by text. Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels, was described as the adoptive parent of four children in a May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story. She hasn’t been a foster parent, Krista Heiden in Campbell’s office told us. State Rep. James Frank of Wichita Falls, has adopted two boys, Eli and Isaiah, in 2016, per an Oct. 5, 2016, post on Frank’s Facebook page. He was a foster parent, an aide to the representative, Jim Johnson, said by phone. Rep. John Lujan of San Antonio, is the adoptive father of three sons, including one he and his wife adopted in 2012 after years of foster care and two other children who they adopted in 2015 after about a year of foster care. Lujan told us by phone that in spring 2016, he served as a foster parent to three other children. Wondering if other state officials had provided foster care or adopted children, we queried the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. In reply, spokesman Patrick Crimmins said by email that due to privacy concerns, the agency could not discuss such details. For years, CPS has struggled to find homes for approximately 29,000 children needing foster care, according to an Oct. 7, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story. Also, as of October 2016, 6,388 children in Texas foster care were eligible for adoption, DFPS spokesman John Lennan told us by phone. To be a foster or adoptive parent, Texans must attend an informational meeting and meet basic requirements, such as being at least 21 years old, agree to a home study, and allow for a criminal background check. More information has been posted by the state-created Texas Adoption Resource Exchange. According to the website, foster families are offered monthly reimbursements to help pay for each foster child’s clothing, food and transportation, paid from a combination of local, state, and federal funds. The site states that foster parents must inform caseworkers, who visit with the child at least once a month, about changes at home or school. Foster parents also must "make efforts as team members with children’s caseworkers toward reunifying children with their birth families," it reads. Our ruling Patrick, calling for help finding families able to provide foster care, said: "Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families." Five Republican elected officials singled out by Patrick’s office have all adopted at least one child. Two also provided foster care, leaving plenty of opportunities for other elected leaders to consider such a commitment. We rate this statement True.

pomt-14513	Says Missouri families’ "earning power is about $5,000 less today than it was at the turn of the century."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/feb/19/todd-richardson/rep-todd-richardson-mostly-accurate-assessment-ear/	Ranked 47th in the nation by Business Insider, Missouri’s seemingly stagnant economy has been a talking point for politicians across the state in recent months. Speaker of the House Todd Richardson recently weighed in on the discussion, specifically addressing the income and earning power of Missourians. On "This Week in Missouri Politics," Richardson said, "Missouri families earn $5,000 less, their earning power is about 5,000 less today, than it was at the turn of the century." Has the typical Missouri household lost that much ground since 2000? Shifts in median household income We were directed by Richardson’s office to the U.S. Census Bureau’s statistics on median household income. When adjusted for inflation, the median Missouri family brought home $56,360 in 2014, down more than $5,000 from the median family income of $61,995 in 2000. Those numbers support Richardson’s statement. But the median income number jumps around a fair bit from year to year. If Richardson had chosen just slightly different starting and end points, the result could create a different impression. For example, in 1998, the median household income in Missouri was $58,355. And in 2013, Missouri’s median household income was $47,601 – significantly lower than the statistic for 2014. But Saku Aura, associate professor of Public Economics at the University of Missouri, said even with those ups and downs, the overall trend is not debatable. "Missouri’s economy has undoubtedly had very little to no positive growth in the last 15 years or so," Aura said. Aura gave us a couple of reasons for the swings in median income. The Census Bureau sample is small and the margin of error can be over $3,000. And he also noted that family size has been edging down. "If there are less people in each family, it would make sense that perhaps there is less money being earned." Another way to measure income is to look at the average per person. By that yardstick, personal income has increased over the past 15 years. But big gains by a relative few earners at the high end pull up the average in ways that don’t reflect the typical person’s experience. "It’s a trend we’ve seen across the country almost since the ‘70s," Aura said. "Most economic growth comes for the highest quartile, not the middle class or poorer families." Our ruling Richardson largely got his numbers right when he said that Missouri’s families’ "earning power is less today than it was at the start of the century." While his exact numbers could be off, the general trend holds up. The typical household is making less. We rate Richardson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11247	"All the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying — (that I supported) Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood — PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, ‘False, False, False, False.’ "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/02/evan-jenkins/did-evan-jenkins-correctly-cite-past-politifact-ru/	It’s not every day that PolitiFact fact-checks are wielded as rhetorical weapons in U.S. Senate debates, but that’s exactly what happened in a May 1 debate that pitted three Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in West Virginia. During the hotly contested campaign, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has regularly attacked one of his rivals, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, for a history of deviating from conservative orthodoxy. As we’ve previously noted, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. During the debate, Morrisey said, referring to Jenkins: "I wasn’t the one recruited by the liberal establishment because of his very questionable record. Once again, Obamacare support, cap and trade support, donating to Joe Manchin, holding a fundraiser at his house. That’s not the West Virginia values we need to drain the swamp in Washington." To rebut this attack, Jenkins pointed to a prior PolitiFact fact check. "Unfortunately, Patrick Morrisey continues to spew his lies and misrepresentations," Jenkins said. "We had PolitiFact, and all the things Patrick is saying — supporting Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood — PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, ‘False, False, False, False.’" Did Jenkins cite our research correctly? He did, up to a point. Recapping our earlier fact-check The congressman was referring to an article in which we checked a Morrisey statement that Jenkins "has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases." Here’s the rundown of the three issues Jenkins cited: • Support for Hillary Clinton. The Morrisey campaign had cited Jenkins’ attendance at a July 27, 2007, economic policy town hall Clinton hosted at West Virginia State University. But that’s not the same as a vote -- especially since Jenkins attended a similar event for President George W. Bush in 2004, when he was a Democrat. Morrisey’s campaign also told us they believed Jenkins had voted for Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary in 2008 because he had stated he didn’t support Obama but still voted. But Jenkins could have skipped voting for president on that ballot -- as his campaign says he did. All told, there’s no solid proof of Jenkins having voted for Clinton. • Support for cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade legislation sets limits on emissions and then lets companies trade emission reduction credits. Carbon-emitting fuels like coals are at a disadvantage under such a system, making such laws unpopular in coal-heavy West Virginia. Morrisey’s campaign said that in 1997, Jenkins sponsored HB 2476, a bill to create an emissions banking and trading program to incentivize better air quality. But Patrick McGinley and James Van Nostrand, two environmental law experts at West Virginia University familiar with the law, disagreed with that interpretation. They said the 1997 bill lacks a cap on emissions, the critical feature of cap-and-trade legislation. • Support for Planned Parenthood. Jenkins has cast repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood due to its provision of abortion services, including the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," "Defund Planned Parenthood Act" and the "Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act." For our prior fact-check, the Morrisey campaign cited a 2006 Project Vote Smart survey on abortion in which Jenkins did not offer an opinion prohibiting public funding of abortions and to organizations that advocate or perform abortions. However, the Project Vote Smart website itself said that a lack of response did not indicate opposition to a policy. Jenkins did not respond to the most recent survey. New wrinkles, and new attacks So our previous fact-check provides significant support for Jenkins’ claim. But there are some important holes to mention. • New evidence. Morrisey’s campaign provided one new piece of evidence for the Planned Parenthood assertion that didn’t exist when we wrote our first fact-check. They noted that Jenkins voted for an omnibus spending bill on March 22, 2018. The bill doesn’t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood. However, it keeps the longstanding status quo, under which the federal government pays for non-abortion-related services provided by Planned Parenthood through Medicaid and other programs. (We rated a similar claim from North Carolina Half True.) • Jenkins’ language was too loose. Jenkins saying that PolitiFact had debunked "all the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying." In reality, three of the four specific items Morrisey cited in the preceding remark were ones the PolitiFact fact-check didn’t address. (The one we previously did fact-check was Jenkins’ support for cap-and-trade.) The remaining three claims we hadn’t yet checked were Jenkins’ "Obamacare support ... donating to Joe Manchin, (and) holding a fundraiser at his house" for Manchin. On these three issues, Morrisey has a point. In 2011, Jenkins sponsored and voted for a bill to bring an Affordable Care Act health care exchange to West Virginia. Meanwhile, Jenkins donated $1,000 to Manchin’s bid for governor on April 17, 2007, and another $1,000 on March 27, 2008. Finally, Jenkins hosted a fundraiser for Manchin at his home on March 27, 2008, that raised over $6,000. Our ruling Jenkins said, "All the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying — (that I supported) Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood — PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, ‘False, False, False, False.’ " Jenkins correctly cited PolitiFact’s conclusions on the three specific topics he himself mentioned. However, Jenkins’ statement came as a rebuttal to a remark by Morrisey that cited three separate examples of Jenkins’ alleged support for Democrats or liberal issues. In reality, PolitiFact had not fact-checked those three topics at the time of the debate, and now that we have looked into them, we find support for Morrisey’s position, not Jenkins’. Voters tuning into the race for the first time could easily get the wrong impression about the accuracy of the attacks. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02121	"Last year the (Medicaid Fraud Control Unit) in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!"	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/may/11/thomas-garrett-jr/sen-tom-garrett-says-medicaid-fraud-unit-virginia-/	State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. says Medicaid is bloated with fraud in Virginia and across the nation. In an op-ed published by three newspapers last month, Garrett cited an eye-popping amount of money recovered by Virginia’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit as an argument against expanding the state’s Medicaid program to up to 400,000 additional residents. The fraud unit, known as MFCU, operates out of the state attorney general’s office. Garrett, a Republican, worked in the unit for a few years before being elected Louisa County commonwealth’s attorney in 2007. "Last year, the MFCU in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!" Garrett wrote. "How can expanding this be a good idea?" We took a look at Garrett’s $200 million claim and came across nearly identically written statements made earlier this year by two other Republicans opposed to Medicaid expansion: Dels. Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights and Tim Hugo of Fairfax County. Each of the three lawmakers cited the $200 million recovery figure in a paragraph discussing the damage Medicaid fraud inflicts on Virginia’s budget. Paul Allen, Garrett’s legislative assistant, said the senator made a mistake -- he understated the amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. MFCU actually recouped about $1 billion during the budget year that ended in mid-2013, according to a report by the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Allen added that "$200 million is the average year’s recovery amount." MFCU, in its latest annual report, said it recovered $1.01 billion during the budget year that ended June 30, 2013. The report shows that between 2009 and 2013, the unit recouped an average of $223.8 million a year. But the figures, to be fully understood, require a lot more explanation than Garrett, Cox or Hugo provided. The $1 billion-plus recovery last year was an anomaly that accounts for more than half of the total $1.9 billion total MFCU has recouped since the unit was created in 1982. Only fractions of the recovery stemmed from fraud in Virginia and were returned to state coffers. Almost all of last year’s recovery came from a national case MFCU prosecuted against Abbott Laboratories for misbranding one of its drugs, Depakote, as treatments for schizophrenia and aggression in elderly dementia patients. Depakote never has been proven effective for those uses. Abbott, which pled guilty, was ordered to pay a total of $1.5 billion to the federal government and states. The Virginia Attorney General’s office explained in its 2011-2012 annual report that the state’s fraud unit was approached in 2007 with allegations that Abbott had illegally marketed the drug, which was provided to people on Medicare and Medicaid. "Although neither the whistleblowers nor the defendant in this case were located in Virginia, the whistleblowers came to Virginia because the MFCU has a national reputation for successfully investigating major national cases," the Virginia attorney general’s office said in a May 7, 2012, news release announcing the settlement. The release broke down the $1.5 billion settlement. Abbott paid the U.S. government a $500 million criminal fine. It also paid civil penalties of $270 million to the federal Medicaid program and $291 million to Medicare and other U.S. health programs. Another $239 million was distributed to state Medicaid programs and Abbott paid an additional $198.5 million in criminal asset forfeiture penalties. Of those asset forfeitures, Virginia received $115 million because MFCU led the investigation. The unit partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western Office of Virginia on the four-year probe, which the attorney general’s office says entailed 40,000 man hours of investigation and sifting through 1 million records. Virginia Medicaid’s share of the settlement portion going to states was $4.2 million. That’s the total amount of fraud Abbott inflicted on Virginia’s program, according to Michael Kelly, spokesman for state Attorney General Mark Herring’s office. Outside of the Abbott case, Virginia’s MFCU recovered $11 million during last year, according to Kelly. Now, let’s get back to Garrett. His legislative assistant said the $200 million Garrett cited is the average yearly amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. Including the Abbott settlement, MFCU has averaged recouping about $223.8 million annually during the last five budget years. If Abbott is not included, the five-year 2009-2013 annual average drops to $23.8 million. "The federal government frequently lets Virginia’s MFCU take the lead on large, multi-state cases," Kelly emailed us. "This is important to note because it means that not all the money that is ordered recovered thanks to a Virginia case came out of Virginia’s Medicaid budget, nor is it necessarily coming back to Virginia’s budget." By far, the two next biggest years for MFCU were 2007 and 2008 when the unit recovered a total of $648.8 million. Virtually all of the sum was attributable to a national case the unit prosecuted against pharmaceutical maker Purdue Frederick Company. The company pled guilty to misbranding OxyContin as less addictive than other pain medications when no medical research supported the claim. The recoveries from the Purdue and and the Abbott cases come to more than 85 percent of the $1.9 billion MFCU has recouped in its 30-year history. The unit also prosecutes allegations of malfeasance by health care providers, such as double billing, charging for services not rendered and embezzlement. The Department of Medical Assistance Service, the state agency that oversees the state’s Medicaid program, handles cases of fraud by Medicaid recipients. In the 2013 fiscal year, the agency identified $3.4 million in "overpayments" to Medicaid beneficiaries, but not all of it was due to malfeasance, according to Christina Nuckols, a spokeswoman for Virginia Health Secretary Bill Hazel. "Overpayments can occur for other reasons (than fraud), and sometimes they are the result of mistakes," she emailed. Our ruling Garrett, in arguing against Medicaid expansion in Virginia, wrote that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit last year "in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!" Garrett’s aide says the senator understated the recovery, which was actually $1 billion. The figures are correct. But Garrett’s claim that MFCU collected $200 million "in Virginia alone" easily can be read as a statement about the amount of fraud that occurred in the Old Dominion. He doesn’t mention that almost all the money MFCU recovered last year came from a national fraud case it prosecuted against Abbott Labs. The amount of Medicaid fraud Abbott committed in Virginia was $4.2 million. Outside of the Abbott case, MFCU recovered $11 million last year. So Garrett’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that create a different impression about the level of fraud in Virginia’s Medicaid system. It’s hard to imagine Garrett wasn’t clued in on the details of MFCU’s work. After all, the senator was a lawyer for the unit between 2005 and 2007. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08190	"We (Democrats) have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/26/armond-budish/rep-armond-budish-touts-democrat-efforts-jobs-educ/	Ohio House Speaker Armond Budish will relinquish his title in January as a result of the Nov. 2 election, when Democrats lost a dozen seats and control of the chamber. But he’s not giving up his optimism or his view that Democrats contributed to Ohio job growth and to strengthening the public education system since taking control of the House in 2008. Recently picked by his colleagues to lead the minority Democratic caucus in the new year, Budish, of Beachwood, pledged to stay the party’s course. "We have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools and we will stand together to protect those priorities," Budish said Nov. 17 in a news release that announced his election as minority leader. The statement grabbed Politifact Ohio’s attention because Republicans defeated Democrats by arguing that Statehouse Democrats failed to create jobs and improve schools. So, is Budish revising history or did shouting by Republicans drown out Democratic success? PolitiFact Ohio thought we should take a look. We started with Budish, who sent us a list of items that he says supports his claim. The list includes: House Democrats created and expanded tax credit programs that encourage job creation. Ohio’s unemployment rate decreased six consecutive months. House Democrats led the fight to renew Ohio’s Third Frontier Program, which sells bonds and invests the money in high-tech innovation. House Democrats increased school funding by 5.5 percent using a combination of state and federal funds and reformed the school funding formula. House Democrats limited college tuition increases to 3.5 percent for the current two years. There’s more on Budish’s list. We reviewed these items because they represent the heart of his economic and educational claims. So, from the top: Tax credits The two-year budget passed in summer 2009 indeed bears the imprint of Gov. Ted Strickland and the Democratic House. In it are several tax credits; some new ones and the expansion of existing ones like the job creation tax credit. Both parties generally agree that the goal of such budget items is to foster job growth in Ohio, but, tracking jobs tied to tax credits is not an exact science and takes time. The motion picture tax credit is one Budish cites. It makes a total of $30 million in tax breaks available during the current budget to companies that make movies and commercials in the state. Budish said this tax credit "already created $25 million economic activity and 3,000 new jobs in Ohio." Ohio Department of Development data shows that film companies which have applied for the tax credits have spent $17.9 million here so far under the program. And other projects are in the pipeline. But claiming this tax credit has created 3,000 jobs is a bit of movie magic. The state tracks the number of people employed by the production company during shooting – including extras and the crew — but these are not permanent jobs. "Unstoppable," the movie about a runaway train starring Denzel Washington, for instance, hired 1,361 people over 54 days in Ohio in 2009, the bulk of them extras. They earned $135,000 in wages, according to state data. People employed on all completed projects have earned a total $2.4 million in wages. These figures are only estimates because a formal audit of the projects has not been completed, says Department of Development spokeswoman Katie Sabatino. But she underscores that people have been put to work as a result of the credit. Budish and Democrats also created the New Markets Investment Tax Credit program, which offers tax credits of up to $10 million a year for insurance and financial companies for purchasing and holding securities issued by low-income community organizations. But its effectiveness can’t be judged - the program’s only been available for a month. Budish also boasts that House Democrats supported continuation of the state Technology Investment Tax Credit program, which gives a break to taxpayers who invest in Ohio-based technology companies. But Ohioans are unlikely to know for sure how many jobs were created directly through the program because the Department of Development doesn’t tally this figure. It instead tracks investments data. Shrinking unemployment rate Ohio’s overall economic picture has improved, albeit painfully slow. The unemployment rate in the Buckeye State dropped six months in a row from a high of 11 percent in March to 10 percent in September, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it’s unrealistic to credit any single party for the slow economic uptick – or conversely, blame it for the decline — especially a legislative body with one budget in its short tenure. Led the Third Frontier campaign Democrats loudly championed the Third Frontier program, launched under the Republican administration of Gov. Bob Taft. But a lot of state leaders and institutions, including big-city newspapers, the state chamber of commerce and unions got behind the program and share credit for the program’s success at the ballot box last May. Boosted education money and reworked funding formula Ohio lawmakers actually cut state aid to schools by about $32 million in the last budget. It was federal money – including stimulus funding dollars — that boosted school funding to 5.5 percent in the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011. But Budish is careful to share the acclaim with federal government, a point some Democrats failed to make during the midterm election. Whether Democrats reformed how schools are funded is the subject of great debate. Budish is referring to Gov. Ted Strickland’s evidence-based school-funding model, approved by the legislature last year as part of the state budget. The formula ties school money to specific things the model sets aside as important to the quality of education, such as the size of classes and the number of counselors and administrators. But there’s no guarantee the state will have the money to fully fund the model, so the old formula will be in place. College tuition The last state budget did freeze college tuition costs, a move engineered by the Strickland and the House Democrats. So let’s check the tally. To evaluate Budish’s original claim — "We have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools" – we’ve looked at each of these five supporting items which Budish provided. And with all but the last one, there were additional critical details you needed to know to have a full understanding of the context, especially Budish’s assertion about tax credits. On that score, PolitiFact Ohio rates his overall statement Half True.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2010-11-26T06:00:00	2010-11-17	['None']

pomt-09738	"Only 20 percent of Americans admit to being Republicans anymore."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/16/democratic-national-committee/democrats-claim-only-20-percent-americans-call-the/	In a recent round of partisan fighting, Democrats made a claim that piqued our curiosity: that only 20 percent of Americans identify themselves as Republicans. The comment grew out of the partisan food fight that followed President Barack Obama's surprise win of the Nobel Peace prize. Republicans criticized Obama, claiming he had accomplished little in his first nine months to deserve the award. Democrats swung back, attacking Republicans for being divisive and unpatriotic in their attacks on the president. In a particularly heated statement, Democratic National Committee communications director Brad Woodhouse compared the Republican response to Obama's win with the responses of terrorist organizations. "The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the terrorists — the Taliban and Hamas this morning — in criticizing the president for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Republicans cheered when America failed to land the Olympics and now they are criticizing the president of the United States for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize — an award he did not seek but that is nonetheless an honor in which every American can take great pride — unless of course you are the Republican Party," Woodhouse said. He continued, "The 2009 version of the Republican Party has no boundaries, has no shame and has proved that they will put politics above patriotism at every turn. It’s no wonder only 20 percent of Americans admit to being Republicans anymore — it’s an embarrassing label to claim." The number surprised us, so we decided to look into Woodhouse's claim that only 20 percent of Americans identify themselves as Republican. The accuracy of Woodhouse's remark depends on how broadly you define someone's party affiliation. Pollsters typically ask people to identify their party, but results depend on whether you also include people who say they "lean" to one of the parties, or whether you restrict the label to include just registered voters who are likely to vote. Recent polls indicate he was right for broad surveys that were not limited to likely voters. According to a recent Associated Press-GfK poll, 21 percent of adults identified themselves as Republicans, while 33 percent said they were Democrats. An early October CBS poll found basically the same numbers, and an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll taken in September found Republican identification at 18 percent. A check of Pollster.com, a Web site that aggregates recent polls and averages the results, reveals that, overall, about 22.5 percent of adults identify themselves as Republicans, while 33.7 percent identify themselves as Democrats, if you average recent polls. Note that these averages are a little squishy because each poll has a different margin of error, but they give a good estimate of where the country stands. While these numbers may seem low, consider that they typically only include strong and moderate supporters of either party. "Leaners" — those who consider themselves independent but usually lean toward a particular party — are not included. Also, when screened to include just registered voters who are likely to vote in the next election, the share of people identifying with a party increases: 33 percent identify with Republicans and 39 percent identify with Democrats, according to the Pollster.com average. So among the population that is politically active, a higher percentage of people identify with a party. To put the numbers into more context, we talked to Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. She confirmed that lately the self-identified Republican number has hovered in the 20 percent range. Indeed, the Pollster.com chart shows that since the November 2008 election, the Republican number declined from about 28 percent to 22.5 percent. So Woodhouse is in the ballpark if you rely on a universe where all adults either identify with a party or are considered independent. But other methods used by pollsters boost the Republican percentage because they screen for voters who are registered and likely to vote, or include more voters who are "leaners." So we find his claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2009-10-16T16:33:35	2009-10-09	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-11199	Says Cecile Richards recently said there’s room in "her movement" for people who personally believe abortion is wrong.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/may/15/andrew-white/andrew-white-cecile-richards-abortion-wrong-room-/	Houston investor Andrew White says he’ll protect abortion rights if elected governor despite personally believing abortion to be wrong. During the debate for the Democratic nomination to Texas governor, White declared that a national abortion rights leader, Cecile Richards, said there’s room for people like him in "her movement." We wondered about that. Richards, the Texan who has stepped down as president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, doesn’t support White’s candidacy. She told us by email that she backs the February 2018 endorsement of Lupe Valdez for governor by Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. White and Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff, are vying in the May 22, 2018, Democratic runoff for the opportunity to challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. White cites Richards White made his claim citing Richards, whose mother, Ann, served as governor from 1991 through 1994, during the May 11, 2018 Democratic governor’s debate in Austin. At the debate, White initially said that as governor, he’d veto anti-abortion legislation and approve legislation reversing abortion restrictions put in place by Republicans who’ve held majorities in both chambers of the Texas Legislature. Moderator Gromer Jeffers followed up: "Wendy Davis, the 2014 (Democratic) nominee for governor, told her social media followers not to trust you. She didn’t trust you on this issue. Aimee Cunningham also doesn’t trust you on this issue. You’ve read her piece in TribTalk. How do you respond to that?" WHITE: "Do you know, do you know who trusts me on this issue?" JEFFERS: "Tell me." WHITE: "Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood, recently came out and said there is room in her movement for people with this perspective. And do you know who they are? They are people like Joe Biden and Tim Kaine. So this issue is, in my opinion, not really an issue. Again, my personal opinions are not what’s important in this election and I have made that clear this entire time. So I would listen to Cecile, and I think that her leadership in this process is worth listening to." Before White announced his candidacy, Davis in a November 2017 Facebook post called White an "anti-choice man asking for our support as the Democratic choice for governor." Cunningham, a community activist and Democratic donor, said in the Feb. 28, 2018, TribTalk commentary mentioned by Jeffers that White earlier told her he’d support "anti-choice" legislation--a position he disputed taking. White has said he personally believes life begins at conception yet he recognizes that abortion is legal. "My personal beliefs are my personal beliefs. This would pertain to my wife and my children, the beliefs I would grow my children to believe in," White said after announcing his candidacy. "But as it relates to other people in America, we live in a free country and we're ruled by law and that rule of law is set by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has already determined that law. And I don't see them overturning themselves any time soon." White offers backup We asked White to tell us when Richards, who’s been touring behind her memoir of activism, made the statement touted in the debate. By email, White pointed us to Richards’ comments while talking up her book, "Making Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out and Finding the Courage to Lead," on the April 17, 2018, edition of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe." On the program, Joe Scarborough asked Richards: "What can someone who’s pro-life learn from this book? Because, I mean, obviously there are a lot of pro-life women out there running as well and what message in here is universal?" Richards replied: "I think the universal message is that women can’t wait until it’s their turn. I really do think that’s true. We now see women in the United States Senate, 23 women, in record numbers, but still we’re debating over basic health care issues for women. Also, I think a lot of this book too is really, Joe, about the fact that you can be pro-life and you can also understand that that isn’t something necessarily that government should be deciding for every woman in America. And that’s overwhelmingly where people are." Richards: Yes, but When we reached out to Richards about White’s reference to her statement, Richards said: "Abortion is a deeply personal issue. I have known and worked with many people, including politicians, who believe that abortion is not a decision they would make -- and they also respect the important right of women to make their own decisions about their pregnancy. Vice President Biden and Senator Kaine, regardless of their personal views, have been consistent in their strong support for women's health and rights. That is not the case for Mr. White." Following up, we asked how Richards determined that White hasn’t consistently supported women’s health and rights. Lauren Peterson, Richards’ co-author, said by email that Richards relied on "accounts of people on the ground in Texas, including Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, who have raised concerns when it comes to his consistency on reproductive rights, and women's ability to trust that he would support their access to health care as governor." We shared Richards’ responses with White, who said by email that Richards’ comment on MSNBC "could have come straight from my campaign website. Since day one, I’ve stated my personal views on this matter, while making my support for Roe v. Wade clear. I’m glad to know that Cecile accepts the position that Joe Biden, Tim Kaine and I hold." Our ruling White said that Richards said there’s room in "her movement" for people who personally believe abortion is wrong. White accurately echoed what Richards told MSNBC -- that a person can be pro-life and also understand that government shouldn’t make abortion decisions for all women. But White left out that Richards doesn’t think White has consistently showed strong support for women’s health and rights. That's vital clarification. We rate this debate statement Mostly True.

pomt-04954	Twenty two years ago, when he was running for governor, Bill Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes in the U.S. House.	true	/florida/statements/2012/jul/26/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-missed-56-percent-his/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, says he’s hardly the only politician to miss a bunch of votes while running for office. In fact, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson -- had a year about two decades ago when he missed more than any other member of Congress, says Mack. Mack has taken a beating in the press for missing votes while running statewide including on hot topics such as repealing part of "Obamacare" and on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan. Mack campaign manager Jeff Cohen fired back at Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith in a July 24 letter: "What you didn’t mention is that when Bill Nelson was in Congress and running statewide for governor in 1990, he had the absolute worst voting record of anyone in Congress. He missed a whopping 56 percent of his votes." We previously fact-checked a claim from Mack's Republican primary opponent, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, that Mack missed "almost half" of his votes in Congress this year. We ruled that claim Mostly False because Mack didn't miss quite that many votes. We’ll leave it to voters to decide the relevance of Nelson’s voting record from 22 years ago. Here, we wanted to see if the Mack campaign was accurate in its attack. Missed votes by Mack and Nelson in 2012 and full career Before we travel back in time to 1990, let’s look at more recent data: the number of missed votes this year so far. GovTrack.us shows quarterly missed votes for members using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate -- and during a quarter the numbers can continuously change as more votes are taken. We will cite the numbers so far this year as of July 25 -- a day after the Mack campaign letter: Nelson missed 1 vote out of 182, or less than 1 percent. Mack missed 145 out of 502 votes, or about 29 percent. GovTrack.us also shows historical data between January 2001 and late July 2012. That shows that Nelson missed 2 percent of recorded votes while Mack, starting when he joined the Senate in 2005, missed 6 percent. Nelson’s missed votes in 1990 In 1990, Nelson was in the U.S. House of Representatives and faced an uphill battle in a Democratic primary for governor against Lawton Chiles, who ultimately won. We turned to Congressional Quarterly for our research on missed votes. CQ shows that in 1990 Nelson voted 44 percent of the time, which means he missed 56 percent of the votes. A CQ ranking showed that placed him dead last that year. Nelson’s office sent us a 1990 Associated Press article in which Nelson explained that on important missed votes he went on record about how he would have voted. Now let’s return to 2012. We were unable to get an answer from Mack’s campaign or office if he issued statements explaining how he would have voted when he was absent. Campaign spokesman David James responded in an email: "A missed vote for Connie is a missed vote -- according to you. Same standard for Nelson, irrelevant of statements." Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14. One final note about Nelson’s voting record: In addition to 1990, CQ shows that he only dipped below 88 percent voting participation one other year. In 1985 he voted 73 percent of the time -- the year he was training for a January 1986 shuttle flight. Our ruling Mack’s campaign manager said that in 1990, when Nelson was running for governor, he missed 56 percent of his votes -- the worst record in Congress. CQ data confirms that 22 years ago, Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes, placing him last in voter participation. It is worth noting, however, that Nelson went on record with his position on some votes rather than simply skipping the vote. We rate this claim True.

pomt-11630	Says Donald Trump's use of the term "fake news" to undermine journalism "seems (to have) inspired dictators and authoritarians."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/22/jeff-flake/donald-trumps-fake-news-epithet-emboldens-despots-/	Hours before President Donald Trump revealed the recipients of his "fake news awards," one Republican lawmaker took to the Senate floor to deliver a stern warning about the perils of undermining journalism. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., cautioned that Trump’s anti-press rhetoric, such as calling the New York Times, CNN and ABC News an "enemy of the American people," serves to embolden repressive governments around the world. "Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press," Flake said, "but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible." Flake then ticked off several examples where foreign leaders deployed the phrase "fake news" to foster distrust of the media. Based on our review of the evidence, it’s reasonable to conclude that Trump’s disparagement of the media has been replicated abroad. Invoking ‘fake news’ to deny atrocities, human rights abuses An aide to Flake said the senator had referred to a Politico article that identified more than 15 instances where foreign leaders invoked the phrase "fake news." Here’s a sample: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in February invoked "fake news" to dismiss an Amnesty International report that up to 13,000 prisoners had been executed in one of his military prisons, saying the allegations were a reminder that "we are living in a fake news era." A security official in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in December used the term "fake news" to deny the very existence of the Rohingya people, a persecuted Muslim minority who are being ethnically cleansed, according to the United Nations. "There is no such thing as Rohingya," the Myanmar official said. "It is fake news." Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in July said it was "fake news" that a constitutional crisis was playing out in Venezuela against a backdrop of widespread protests, human rights abuses and long-standing economic privation. "The media spreads lots of false versions, lots of lies. This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?" he told Russian broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government considers a Kremlin propaganda outlet. An op-ed with the headline "Trump is right, fake news is the enemy, something China has known for years" ran in May in the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in China, which is perennially a leading jailer of journalists. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in October said he had been "demonized" through "fake news" coverage of his brutal drug war, which has seen an unprecedented scale of extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch. At a joint press appearance in Manila in November, with Trump laughing at his side, Duterte called journalists "spies." Trump’s rebranding of ‘fake news’ There’s reason to think Trump inspired these responses. He has helped to popularize the phrase "fake news," while shifting its meaning. According to CNN, Trump has used the word "fake" more than 400 times since his inauguration, including "fake news" and its variants. Overall, use of the phrase "fake news" across all forms of media increased 365 percent from November 2016 to November 2017, according to the Collins Dictionary, which named "fake news" its 2017 word of the year. At PolitiFact, we have used the term "fake news" to refer to fabricated content masquerading as a portrayal of actual events, naming it our 2016 Lie of the Year after made-up stories dominated social media during the presidential election. Trump, however, uses "fake news" to dismiss coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, or as a criticism against entire news organizations. He’s also taken credit for rebranding the term "fake news" to apply to fact-based journalism, calling it "one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with." The epithet’s authoritarian appeal Experts said it’s easy to see why Trump’s use of the term "fake news" appeals to authoritarian leaders. Authoritarian governments are typified by highly centralized power and the predominance of the state over individual rights. "Every authoritarian needs to spread his own version of reality, and will invest time and resources to discredit anyone else's," said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University. "Many of them are corrupt, and if an investigation threatens to compromise their authority, or charges of wrongdoing come down, they need the public to believe only what they say." Ben-Ghiat said Trump’s consistent efforts to attack the press as purveyors of bias and lies against him, and incite hostility toward individual news outlets and journalists, can be seen as part of a larger campaign against sectors of society that value evidence and investigation. "When Trump says ‘I am the only one who matters’ it is not just self-glorification, but a message about whose version of the facts should count in America," she said. "How can foreign rulers not feel empowered by this?" A First Amendment advocate we spoke to drew parallels between Trump’s use of the term "fake news" and George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, in which an authoritarian state inverts language to mean the opposite of its literal definition. "It is a characteristic of authoritarian leaders, whether Communist or Nazi, to appropriate ordinary words and declare them to mean the opposite," Bruce Johnson, a Seattle-based media lawyer, told PolitiFact. "Repressive regimes hold power by depriving their population of independent thinking and making the masses believe lies." It’s worth noting we found no mentions of "fake news" from foreign leaders before 2016. Increased risk to journalists The rise of the "fake news" epithet coincided with one of the most dangerous years for journalists. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists found 262 journalists were jailed for their work, a historic high for the second year in a row. In 21 cases, journalists were jailed under "false news" statutes, more than double the number in 2016, and in more countries, said Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at Committee to Protect Journalists. "It’s created an environment where it’s more permissive for governments to jail journalists on false news charges," she said. "They certainly don't think they're going to face many repercussions or condemnation from the United States when you have the president making those comments on a regular basis." Human rights activists say the growing disregard for facts has been making their job harder, too. "Political leaders around the world have begun to deploy the label ‘fake news’ as a smear on fact-finding by journalists, human rights organizations, perhaps even prosecutors," wrote Iain Levine of Human Rights Watch. "In doing so, they seek to break the link between evidence and culpability, making it more difficult to ensure those accountable pay for their misdeeds." Our ruling Flake said that Trump's use of the term "fake news" to undermine journalism seems to have "inspired dictators and authoritarians." Trump popularized the phrase "fake news" over the past two years as a way to dismiss news coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, even when the reporting is accurate. There are more than a dozen recent instances where foreign leaders, including dictators and authoritarians, have similarly invoked "fake news" to dismiss allegations against them, including widespread extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. We found no mentions of "fake news" from foreign leaders before 2016. Expanded use of the epithet has also emboldened authoritarian governments to jail more journalists under "false news" statutes, experts said. Flake has solid examples from around the world to back up his statement, and there’s strong correlation here given the timeline. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10092	"Fidel (Castro) has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/29/john-mccain/fidel-castro-no-fan-of-mccain-/	Florida is a swing state, and in Florida, Cuban-Americans are a swing constituency. By and large, Cuban-Americans don’t like Fidel Castro. And Castro, it seems, doesn’t much like Sen. John McCain. So it comes as little surprise that McCain would wear Castro’s disdain like a badge of honor in an interview with a Spanish-language radio station in Miami on Oct. 29, 2008. "I notice in the past couple of days that Fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me," McCain said. "My feelings are hurt." How’s this for unkind words? In an Oct. 11, 2008, commentary published in Cuban state newspapers, and translated by Granma Internacional, Castro says McCain "cultivates his reputation as a belligerent man" and "was one of the worst students in his class at West Point." "He has confessed that he knows nothing about Mathematics, and presumably far less about complicated economic sciences," Castro states. "There is no doubt that his rival surpasses him in intelligence and serenity." Castro doesn’t seem to think much of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin either, and he warns that due to McCain’s age "his health is not at all secure." "I mention this information to indicate the eventual possibility — if anything should happen in terms of the candidate’s health, given that he is elected — of the rifle lady, the inexperienced former governor of Alaska, becoming president of the United States," Castro states. "It is obvious that she knows nothing about anything." While Castro stops short of supporting either candidate, he seems to pay Obama the most backhanded of compliments, saying, "It’s a miracle that the Democratic candidate has not met the same fate as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and others who dreamed of justice and equality in recent decades." Earlier this summer, we took a look at an e-mail from the Republican Party of Florida (which claimed it was a joke) that carried the headline, "Fidel Castro endorses Obama," and included a doctored image of Castro holding a poster of Obama. Above Castro were the words, "I love this guy!" We ruled that one Pants on Fire . A link in the e-mail went to another Castro commentary published in a Communist newspaper on May 26, 2008. In it, Castro says Obama is "doubtless, from the social and human points of view, the most progressive candidate to the U.S. presidency." Castro also praises Obama’s "great intelligence, his debating skills and work ethic." But it amounts to lesser-of-two-evils praise, at best. For example, Castro later calls the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain "an act of genocide." Stated Castro: "Presidential candidate Obama’s speech may be formulated as follows: hunger for the nation, remittances as charitable handouts and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it." Castro also clearly understood that any praise for Obama would provide fodder for his opponents. "I feel no resentment towards him (Obama), for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity," Castro said then. "Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor. I have therefore no reservations about criticizing him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly." But back to McCain’s statement. That Castro had "unkind things to say" about McCain is clear. Our issue is whether Castro "made his preferences known in the campaign." Castro stops short of endorsing one candidate or the other. But we think the tone of Castro’s statements leaves little doubt he prefers Obama. For whatever that’s worth. We rule McCain’s statement True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-29T00:00:00	2008-10-29	['None']
pomt-10964	"Let’s talk about the facts and where we are today. There are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents" due to the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy.	true	/california/statements/2018/jul/19/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-claim-nearly-2600-children-remained-/	California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris has condemned President Donald Trump on numerous occasions. Recently, she called out Trump for not standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not long ago, she denounced his administration’s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. But Harris, who has been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, has saved some of her sharpest criticism for Trump’s policy that separated thousands of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border this spring. "Every single day these families are separated, another child goes to sleep terrified because they don’t know where their parents are," Harris wrote in a recent Facebook post. "All because of a policy used to punish immigrants fleeing violence. This is not reflective of a civil society." In a different post, she wrote that "these children are in prison." This week, Harris and two other Democratic senators introduced the Reunite Act during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. The bill would require the immediate reunification of families along with access to legal counsel and child advocates for those who have been separated. She said the legislation is necessary to reunify the many children still separated. "Let’s talk about the facts and where we are today: There are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents," Harris said on July 17. The separations stem from Trump’s "zero-tolerance" policy calling for the prosecution of all immigrants who illegally crossed into the United States at the southwest border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially announced the policy April 6 as a deterrent to illegal immigration. Trump signed an executive order to end family separations on June 20 after a backlash against that part of his policy. We wanted to know, weeks after the Trump administration ended that policy, did Harris get her numbers right on how many children remain separated? We set out on a fact check. In this June 1, 2018, file photo, children hold signs during a demonstration against the Trump administration's family separation policy in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices in Miramar, Fla. Wilfredo Lee / AP Photo Our research When asked for evidence, Harris’ spokesman pointed to testimony in a July 13 court filing from Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Meekins testified that 2,551 separated children ages five and up remained in the agency’s custody. Politico reported it was the first time the Trump administration had specified the exact number of separated children. It added the "health department earlier had estimated only that ‘under 3,000 children’ were separated from their parents." One week ago, HHS reported it had reunited 57 of 103 children under the age of five with their parents. Adding those remaining young children, 46 as of last week, with the 2,551 children ages five and up, fits with Harris’ statement that "nearly 2,600" children remained separated as of mid-July. The Trump administration said late last week it would speed up the reunification process. But it’s not clear whether that’s resulted in a major change this week. An HHS spokeswoman on July 19 said she could not immediately provide a current figure for the total number of children that remain separated. A press release on the agency’s website says HHS and other federal agencies are "working rapidly" to reunify eligible children with their parents under the orders of a U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw of San Diego. HHS is facing a July 26 court-ordered deadline to reunify all the children. Not all children will be reunified In a family reunification report issued this week, HHS said the 2,551 figure "represents the total possible 5-and-up cohort of minors who could be subject to the court order. Based on past experience, it is likely to include a significant number of minors who are not eligible for reunification under the court’s order. Not all of the 2,551 minors in HHS care will necessarily be reunified, because some adults claiming parentage may not actually be the parents or may be unfit or a danger to the children." Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed there "are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents," speaking on July 17. A Trump administration official testified four days earlier that 2,551 children ages 5 and up remained separated. That figure along with the 46 youngest children that the administration said remained separated as of mid July equates to "nearly 2,600." A spokeswoman for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department could not provide a current total this week for the number of remaining separated children. Still, Harris appears to have accurately described the total based on the publicly available information at the time of her statement. We rate her claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. UPDATE: After we published on July 19, 2018, and two days after Harris' statement, the Trump administration updated its figures, saying 364 of 2,551 children age five and older had been reunified with their parents, according to news reports. Our rating, which is based on the information available at the time a speaker makes their claim, remains the same: True.

pomt-00293	"Kavanaugh accuser’s husband breaks his silence, exposes ‘sick issue’ his wife has."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/26/blog-posting/no-christine-blasey-fords-husband-did-not-expose-h/	Comments made by Christine Blasey Ford’s husband have been distorted in a headline to falsely claim he revealed a "sick issue" about her. Christine Blasey Ford has accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Kavanaugh denies the allegations. "Kavanaugh accuser’s husband breaks his silence, exposes ‘sick issue’ his wife has," said the headline on a Sept. 25 story posted on a website operating under the banner "Virginia Press." Its URL is virginiapress31.site. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "According to Russell Ford, his wife Christine has long had issues with not getting ‘the attention or respect she felt she deserved.’ She’s certainly getting a lot of attention now, which calls into question the validity of her claims that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her during a drunken high school party 36-years-ago. Were Christine Ford’s unbelievable accusations rooted in her incessant need for attention all along?" said the Virginia Press story. The story accurately quotes Russell Ford’s comments to the Washington Post about his wife not getting the attention or respect she felt she deserved. However, the Virginia Press site misrepresents what he said to paint it in a negative light. Russell Ford did not make those comments in efforts to expose a "sick issue." That’s a conclusion the website makes. Russell Ford’s comments in the Washington Post story are in the context of how they met and built a relationship. Christine Blasey Ford grew up on the east coast and now lives in California, where she is a professor. "She didn’t always get along with her parents because of differing political views," Russell Ford told the Washington Post. "It was a very male-dominated environment. Everyone was interested in what’s going on with the men, and the women are sidelined, and she didn’t get the attention or respect she felt she deserved. That’s why she was in California, to get away from the D.C. scene." The post also claims that Christine Blasey Ford has been berated by online student reviews. Bloggers made those claims based on reviews for another professor. The Virginia Press website features several elements associated with websites promoting false information. There’s no indication who’s behind the website, where it’s based or who are its authors. Stories have fields for comments but the website does not identify how to contact its operators. It’s headline claiming that, "Kavanaugh accuser’s husband breaks his silence, exposes ‘sick issue’ his wife has" distorts what he said to create a false narrative. We rate the headline False.

pomt-08558	Rep. Paul Hodes, D-N.H., "voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/29/american-crossroads/ants-stimulus-office-space-politicians-ad-attacks-/	In the New Hampshire U.S. Senate race, pork is the theme of dueling ads. Paul Hodes, the Democratic candidate and member of the U.S. House of Representatives, started the ball rolling with footage of himself at a hot dog eating contest, promising he would be a senator "who gets rid of the pork." The group American Crossroads fired back. American Crossroads is a conservative, Republican-backed political advocacy group that's launched ads against Democrats around the country. Some are calling the group a "SuperPAC" (PAC stands for political action committee) because of its fund-raising prowess and national reach. The ad against Hodes features a hot dog cart and carnival music. Here's what the ad says: "In New Hampshire, Congressman Hodes claims, 'You deserve a senator who's a real fiscal conservative... and who gets rid of the pork.' But Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians. Billions wasted and unemployment still higher. No wonder the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'" We wanted to check whether the stimulus had "$1.9 million to study ants" in Africa and "$39 million for office upgardes for politicians." Both projects are on a list of stimulus projects put together by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that American Crossroads pointed us to. The list included "100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues." Let's start with the ants. Several candidates have been facing this line of attack over their votes in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon looked at the charge made against Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon's Democratic incumbent. We checked Hodes' voting record and found that he did indeed vote for the stimulus bill. But the stimulus didn't release money for ant research directly, and you won't find a "study of ants" in the bill's text. Instead, the federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009. The foundation is an independent federal agency devoted to the progress of science. It distributed the stimulus money using the same peer-review process that it normally uses to decide which scientific research deserves funding. Here, it's best to quote from PolitiFact Oregon's report: "As it turns out, one scientist's study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project's leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed. "'I think it's legitimate,' he said. 'There's no reason why people shouldn't challenge this and question what we're doing.' "What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense. "Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. 'You can't monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,' he said. 'Without them, we wouldn't have a functioning ecosystem.' (Taxa are groups of organisms.) "It's also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher's last count." Now, what about the other claim, that the stimulus spent "$39 million for office upgrades for politicians"? The basis for this claim is a project in to renovate the Kansas State Capitol, a historic structure that dates to the late 1800s. A major renovation has been going on since 2000 to improve the building's wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning. And yes, the legislators also wanted more office space and upgraded meeting rooms, according to a 2009 Associated Press report. Hence "office upgrades for politicians." The overall project is expected to cost upwards of $285 million. The $39 million from the stimulus bill is not direct funding. Instead, it comes from a special bond program, Build America Bonds, created by the stimulus to help local governments save money on building projects. "As a result of this federal subsidy payment, state and local governments will have lower net borrowing costs and be able to reach more sources of borrowing than with more traditional tax-exempt or tax credit bonds," said a statement on the U.S. Treasury Department website. Last summer, state officials decided to use the program to pay for the project, and $39 million is the amount that the federal bond program subsidizes. A Kansas official said that it would save the state about $500,000 in debt service costs. "There's not stimulus money that's directly going to the renovation," said Amy Jordan Wooden, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Mark Parkinson. "It gives us a lower interest rate than we could get on the market." Finally, a small bonus fact-check: We were curious about the ad's statement that "the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'" The newspaper's conservative editorial page did indeed say that about an attack ad Hodes launched against his opponent, former attorney general Kelly Ayotte. Our friends at Factcheck.org debunked Hodes' attack on Ayotte, finding he was inaccurate when he suggested she had hidden e-mails that were relevant to a state investigation of an alleged Ponzi scheme. In July, the Union Leader lashed him for "blatantly false attacks against his leading rival." For our ruling, we're looking at the ad's statement that " Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians." It's true that Hodes voted for the bill, but at the time he had no way of knowing that those particular projects would be funded. It is a stretch to say that he voted for "$1.9 million to study ants in Africa," because he voted to add $3 billion in funding for the National Science Foundation. Its explanation of "$39 million for office upgrades for politicians" also leaves out significant details. It's a bond program, not a direct subsidy, and the money supports a large historical renovation, not simply "office upgrades for politicians." So we rate the ad's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04480	"All legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speaker's office."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/08/jim-kyle/all-legislative-mail-approved-by-Senate-speaker/	When Sen. Tim Barnes recently came under attack from Republicans for spending $15,517 in taxpayer money on printed direct mail fliers to constituents during an election year, Senate Minority Leader Jim Kyle rose to his fellow Democrat's defense. The criticism of Barnes, D-Clarksville, came from Jordan Young, Senate Republican Caucus executive director, and was reported by the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle. Young acknowledged that Barnes complied with legislative rules in his mailings, but said "that doesn't make it right." Barnes, opposed by Republican Mark Green in the Nov. 6 election, is effectively using taxpayer money to build up his name recognition and that is not fair, said Young, when "our candidate has to pay for it himself." Barnes told the newspaper that his use of the legislature's "postage and printing" account is "perfectly ethical . . . common practice and a vital and needed way to communicate with constituents." Kyle, the Senate's top Democrat, went further in deeming the Republican attack "unfounded criticism." "All legislative mail – from the content to the timing – is approved by the speaker’s office, therefore if they have an argument, they have to take it up with Speaker (Ron) Ramsey, who the last time I looked was a Republican," Kyle said in the Leaf-Chronicle article. "And I guarantee he reads every one of those word for word. Envisioning Lt. Gov. Ramsey, the Senate speaker, sitting down with a pile of legislator mail to read and edit was rather difficult for us. So we have taken a look at how things work with the sometimes controversial taxpayer funding of "constituent communications" through the "postage and printing accounts." Connie Ridley, director of the Office of Legislative Administration, oversees the process in accordance with policies adopted by the Joint Legislative Services Committee. Under the system, each state senator is annually allocated $6,832 -- each representative $2,016 – for his or her account. There's a specific list of what the money can be used to purchase – Tennessee or American flags for presentation to constituents and "fax machine toner cartridges" are OK, for example, but not a website. As for mail to constituents, Ridley says there are basically two categories. First, there is what might be called regular mail – the daily flow of letters, postcards and the like to and from legislators, their constituents, other government officials and various parties interested in legislation. Basically, a legislator need only put his or her outgoing mail in a box outside a Legislative Plaza office and it is sent out with the postage paid by the state and charged to the legislator's account. The envelopes and typing paper can also be billed to the account. "We do not read a legislator's mail," says Ridley. Ergo, Kyle is off base in describing "all legislative mail" as subject to approval of the speaker's office. A second class of mail, however, may be subject to approval by the Senate speaker in the case of senators, or the House speaker in the case of representatives. This is "bulk mail," defined by policy as 200 or more pieces of the same printed material, according to Ridley. Even with "bulk mail," approval is not required if the legislator or his staff takes care of reproducing the letter and stuffing the envelopes, Ridley said. But if the mailing is printed – either by the State Printing Office or a private printer – then approval is mandatory for payment of the printing and postage costs. In effect, this gets the slick, hard-paper mailers with photographs and different colors that are also typically used in political campaign direct mail advertising. For state-paid mailings, however, the rules prohibit any political messaging and this is where the approval of content comes in. Officially, the rules require the speakers' approval of bulk mail that includes a printing expense. Actually, however, the speakers have delegated the approval process to key staffers, according to Adam Kleinheider, spokesman for Ramsey, and Kara Owen, spokeswoman for Harwell. In Ramsey's case, he has delegated to Russell Humphrey, chief clerk of the Senate; while Harwell has delegated review responsibility jointly to Scott Gilmer, House chief of staff, and Owen. As a practical matter, much of the reviewing is done by Ridley, who works with the speakers' designated point persons to check content for anything that could be seen as a political pitch – using the word "vote," for example. Ridley recalls a recent case in which a legislator wrote that he would "welcome the support" of constituents. Thinking that could be interpreted as a solicitation for campaign contributions, Ridley had that edited out. The mailings are supposed to be means of communicating information. Typically, they will list legislation passed by the General Assembly and the individual legislator's role in passage – or defeat, as the case may be. And some lawmakers send out questionnaires to constituents asking their views on issues. The Barnes' mailers criticized by Republicans are typical. One, mailed in June, carried the headline, "Working for You" and listed legislative actions the senator supported. The other, mailed in September, carried the headline, "Fighting For Us. Delivering For Our Community" and also reported on legislative doings. There's a timing aspect that comes into play for printed bulk mailings. The rules prohibit such mailings for 30 days prior to an election – either a primary or general election. This, of course, doesn't involve much approval – either the mailing is sent before the pre-election blackout period or is not. Even during the blackout, legislators can continue with regular mailings. If they do their own reproduction in their office and stuff the envelopes with a letter requiring no special printing, that's fine, said Ridley. The state mail service is on notice to report to the Office of Legislative Administration any "bulk" mailing of over 200 pieces, Ridley said. If she receives such a notice, Ridley said it would trigger an inquiry to the legislator and perhaps a reminder about the rules – but no penalties. Should any legislator use the mail for political purposes, he or she could face after-the-fact fallout, perhaps starting with complaints from the legislator's political opponent. After being educated on the procedures for constituent communication at taxpayer expense, we asked Kyle about his comments. The senator said he was not aware of some of the details, even though he is a member of the Joint Legislative Services Committee, and acknowledged making a mistake in suggesting the speaker individually reviews "all legislative mail." "I retract that," he said. Kyle noted that he has printing of his mailers done in Memphis and mailed in Memphis, then bills the state through his account. That printing triggers the requirement of approval. Kyle certainly has had no problem in getting approval, having sent 17 separate bills to Ridley's office this year, spending a total of $40,001 from his account. That used up the surplus accumulated in his account from previous years – the rules allow lawmakers to carry over unspent funds year after year – and then some. His account is actually $6,022 in the red, awaiting infusion of his next year's $6,832 allowance to cover the shortfall. Our ruling The Democratic leader pointed out that, with Republicans in control of the Legislature, they in general benefit more from the constituent communications accounts than do members of the minority party. And he correctly noted in comments to the Leaf-Chronicle that Barnes followed all the rules. But by going on to declare that all legislative mail requires approval of the speaker, Kyle erred. We rule this statement as False.	None	Jim Kyle	None	None	None	2012-10-08T05:00:00	2012-09-29	['None']

pomt-13846	The United States is "the oldest democracy" in the world.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-us-oldest-democracy-world-he-righ/	When Democratic lawmakers staged a sit-in on the House floor calling for legislative action on gun control, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was unamused. Clearly frustrated at the behavior, Ryan called the sit-in a political stunt and adjourned the House for recess for the Fourth of July holiday. Once back in Wisconsin, Ryan appeared June 26, 2016 on Mike Gousha’s "Upfront" show on WISN TV. Gousha asked about the House Democrats, noting they said they felt like they weren’t being heard. "We heard them plenty," Ryan said. "You did hear them," Gousha said. "And your reaction was you’re worried about the decorum in the House. They’re talking about maybe doing more of this sort of thing when you return from recess on July 5. Are you going to handle it the same way?" "No, we’re not going to handle it the same way," Ryan said. "What would you do differently?," Gousha asked. "Well, we’re working on that," Ryan said. "We will not take this. We will not tolerate this. This is the oldest deliberative body in the world. We are the oldest democracy. And we have rules of decorum so that we can peacefully settle our issues and actually have democracy." Having just celebrated our nation’s independence from England, we thought the time was right to take a look at whether the United States is "the oldest democracy" in the world. U.S. founding documents The Greeks first coined the term democracy to describe self rule. The term derives from the Greek word "demos," meaning people. The city states of Ancient Greece, most notably Athens, ruled themselves. Many historians also consider the Roman Republic a type of democracy. But both of those empires have long since fallen and, of course, are no longer in the running to be "the oldest democracy." The United States declared its independence from England on July 4, 1776. After a brief period governed by the Articles of Confederation, the founding fathers drafted a new, governing document establishing our government as it operates today. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788. PolitiFact National checked a claim on the Constitution in 2011 when former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican, said the United States has "the longest surviving constitution." Defining a constitution as a single governing document, the claim was rated Mostly True. The U.S. constitution is the oldest single governing document, though other countries are governed by multiple documents older than our constitution. The Massachusetts state constitution is older, ratified in 1780, and served as a model for the authors of the U.S. Constitution. Ryan’s team sent us to that factcheck as backup for his statement that the U.S. is "the oldest democracy." "That founding document established our democracy," said Ian Martorana, Ryan’s press secretary. "It stands to reason that if America has the oldest constitution (that founded the democracy in question), then America also has the oldest democracy." With that in mind, we turned to the history books. Democracy vs. republic The founding fathers feared direct democracy, which involves people deciding directly on policy initiatives and regarded it as an ill-advised form of government. They feared tyranny of the majority as much as that of a king. Instead, they created what is typically referred to as a representative democracy or republic -- the people elect leaders who make decisions on their behalf with a system that protected minority rights. Over the years, the differences between democracies -- both representative and direct -- and republics have been hotly debated by political scholars. For our purposes, we will broadly consider a democratic state to be one in which power is vested in the people who rule themselves or are governed by those who they elect. No matter the rhetoric, the United States has been governed by representatives elected by the people since it began. And few, if any, disagree that it marked a new approach. Sean Wilentz, professor of American History at Princeton, said when this type of government emerged in the United States the monarchists and aristocrats of the old world in Europe hated it. "It was radical and revolutionary," he said. "It was the opposite of the formal rule of the rich and well-born." Voting rights Today, we consider democratic states to be ones with universal suffrage. That is, voting rights that are extended to all citizens without restrictions based on gender, race, religion or wealth. Voting eligibility is established through a combination of the U.S. Constitution and state laws. Nearly all citizens over age 18 can vote with some exceptions, such as people in prison on felony charges. The constitution, as originally written, did not establish who would be able to vote. So, states determined for themselves who could cast ballots. In the late 1700s, the only people who were able to vote for government officials were white, male property owners. Over time, more and more groups were granted the right to vote. The 15th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1879, granted African American men the right to vote. The amendment declared the "right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Due to the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other barriers, the right would not be fully realized until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. Similarly, women were barred from voting until the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920. New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to allow all women citizens to vote in 1893. Some scholars argue that the restricted electorate made the United States undemocratic at its founding. The problems with voting enfranchisement in the United States were also issues in other early democracies. Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard said the United States truly started to become democratic when the country began to be ruled by more of the population. "There is something misleading about making claims that a country which permitted only adult white men to vote was a democracy," he said. "It’s hard to argue that we were a democracy while slavery existed or while African Americans were denied the franchise." No one could reasonably argue that the United States was democratic for all of its people from the beginning, but neither were other nations across the globe. Indeed, the writers of the U.S. constitution included a process for the citizens themselves to amend it over time. So, a democracy starting elsewhere in the world today would look different than the United States did when it began, but so does today's United States. And, whatever the debates of today, Wilentz noted that "people called it democracy" in the United States from the very beginning, and considered it a government led by the citizens rather than a ruler or ruling class. World comparison When it comes to textbooks, a typical narrative on democracy includes the examples from ancient times, then skips ahead to the United States and other European examples. Elements of democracy were introduced in other countries and localities prior to 1776. For example, San Marino, a small enclave surrounded by Italy and founded in the fourth century, claims to be the first republic. Its political system -- a parliamentary republic -- was established in a series of six books that date back to the late 1500s. But it isn't a nation and it hasn’t always been independent, coming under the authority of others. While England has a monarch as head of state, it has gradually evolved to function like a parliamentary republic. The Magna Carta of the 13th Century started to lay the groundwork for British parliament, but the Americans of 1776 clearly stated their view that the king was a despot aiming to establish an "absolute Tyranny over these states." And he did attempt to crush them with his armed forces. Our rating Ryan said the United States is "the oldest democracy." Our democracy is imperfect and always evolving, but that’s the nature of democracy. The changes, for better or worse, reflect the will of the people. While the United States is not the first to include elements of democracy, it is the oldest existing nation with a constitutional government in which the people elect their own government and representatives. We rate the claim True. (Editor's note: This item was posted, briefly, on July 1 with a rating of Mostly True. Our work as a judging panel continued past that point, so it was temporarily take down and now is re-posted with a final rating of True). https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3108d84-0318-4f6d-a9ed-7d68e4c765db	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-07-11T05:00:00	2016-06-26	['United_States']
pomt-04690	"Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-democratic-presidents-top-republ/	Are Democratic presidents better than Republican presidents at job creation? Former President Bill Clinton said so -- forcefully -- in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. "Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24," Clinton said. "In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)." In the packed convention hall, it was one of the night’s biggest applause lines. In 2010, we checked a similar claim from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said that Democratic presidents "have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs." After crunching the numbers back to President Harry Truman, we found that jobs did indeed grow faster under Democratic presidents when adjusted for a president’s years served in office. So we rated the claim True. Clinton’s claim at the convention was worded differently, so we quickly re-crunched the numbers based on his specifications. Let’s cut to the chase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are the net increases in private-sector employment under each president, chronologically by party: Republicans Richard Nixon: Increase of 7.1 million jobs Gerald Ford: Increase of 1.3 million jobs Ronald Reagan: Increase of 14.7 million jobs George H.W. Bush: Increase of 1.5 million jobs George W. Bush: Decline of 646,000 jobs Total: Increase of 23.9 million jobs under Republican presidents Democrats John F. Kennedy: Increase of 2.7 million jobs Lyndon B. Johnson: Increase of 9.5 million jobs Jimmy Carter: Increase of 9.0 million jobs Bill Clinton: Increase of 20.8 million jobs Barack Obama: Increase of 332,000 jobs Total: Increase of 42.3 million jobs. So Clinton is right. But we’ll bring up a few points worth noting. This does not include government jobs The combination of private-sector jobs and public-sector jobs is a broader measurement of job creation than private-sector alone. But excluding government jobs would presumably hurt Democrats more than Republicans, given the two parties’ historical stances toward the role of government. The fact that Democrats finished so far ahead despite taking government jobs off the table makes it a more impressive accomplishment. The Democrats didn’t benefit from population growth For our previous story, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless calculated that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, also making the Democratic accomplishment more impressive. Presidents deserves less credit for the good times and less blame for the bad times It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes. Since we published our previous story, we have changed our policy: We now factor into our ratings whether the politician or party deserves credit or blame for the statistical trend being analyzed. In this item, though, we will not factor in credit or blame, because both parties have had presidents serve during the time we looked at, meaning that both parties would have benefited and suffered in roughly equal proportions. It’s unclear how much this finding says about our political and economic systems Job creation for each president depended to a certain extent on timing, external factors and luck. And as Yale political scientist David Mayhew pointed out for our previous story, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt. Our ruling Clinton’s figures check out, and they also mirror the broader results we came up with two years ago. Partisans are free to interpret these findings as they wish, but on the numbers, Clinton’s right. We rate his claim True.

pomt-13268	"Just like Hillary Clinton," Russ Feingold had a "run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. the Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/14/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-mostly-misses-tying-wisconsin-us-sen/	As they try to help Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson keep his U.S. Senate seat, GOP groups and Johnson himself are striving to tie Democrat Russ Feingold to his party’s presidential nominee. They’re hitting on two controversial issues buffeting Hillary Clinton -- the Clinton Foundation and State Department emails. One such attack is made in a digital ad dubbed "Feingold Foundation," released Sept. 12, 2016 by the Wisconsin Republican Party. The ad uses loaded language in making a somewhat convoluted claim. Let’s take a look. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9962fa26-c63a-4fcd-a9c9-2010b28c7281 The ad The ad, which is essentially a web page, starts with this in red capital letters: "End the Hillary-Feingold corruption." The main text says: "Just like Hillary Clinton, Senator Feingold has had his own run in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. The Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate. "After months of lawsuits related to Hillary’s emails, the State Department is now withholding Senator Feingold’s emails from public release until after the November election. Help end the Hillary-Feingold corruption by demanding Senator Feingold’s emails be released immediately." So, the claim is that "just like Clinton," Feingold had a "run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund" -- the "Feingold Foundation" -- while "plotting" to run for the Senate seat he lost to Johnson in 2010. Then there’s the reference to State Department emails. Let’s look at this in two parts. ‘Personal slush fund’ The "personal slush fund" allegation, refers to Progressives United -- a political action committee Feingold founded after he lost his try for a fourth term in the Senate. In June 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice revealed that the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC. For instance, Feingold's longtime chief of staff was paid $317,823 by the PAC and a related nonprofit from February 2011 until July 2013, when she left to take a job joining Feingold at the U.S. State Department. And Feingold received $77,000 from the two groups. Moreover, $42,609 was spent to buy hundreds of copies of a book he authored (though Feingold did not receive royalties for those books). The Wisconsin GOP acknowledged to us that it is referring to the PAC as the "Feingold Foundation" and that there isn’t such a foundation. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation, an international health and development charity, has been controversial for very different reasons. Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, claimed that 80 percent of the foundation’s money goes to overhead, PolitiFact National’s rating was False. But the figure was only 10 to 20 percent. The Clinton Foundation has been criticized more for potential conflicts of interest, not its spending. It has accepted millions in foreign donations, including from countries with business in front of the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Donors were able to get access to Clinton. For example, Clinton had been reluctant to grant a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain after he made requests through official channels. But a short-notice meeting was granted to the prince, whose government gave more than $50,000 to the Clintons’ charity, after a longtime Clinton aide who helped create the foundation interceded. ‘Plotting another run’ As for the ad’s allegation that Feingold was operating a personal slush fund while "plotting" his 2016 run for the Senate, the state GOP told us that Feingold is "just like Hillary Clinton" in that there are questions surrounding his time at the State Department. But once again, the circumstances involving Feingold and Clinton are quite different. The party alleges that Feingold violated federal law by engaging in political activities as a federal employee -- that is, planning his Senate run while he worked as a special envoy for the African Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A conservative website says the State Department has agreed to its requests to provide emails Feingold exchanged with top Senate Democrats and two of his former aides, although it’s not known whether the release will come before the Nov. 8, 2016 election. Feingold has denied any wrongdoing. In contrast, Clinton has faced much more than partisan allegations over her State Department emails. It has been well established that Clinton exclusively used a private email address while serving as secretary of state. Because she didn’t use the government system, the department didn’t have her emails on hand when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see them. So in 2014, Clinton’s lawyers combed through the private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said were about personal matters. Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim incorrect. There was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, but her email setup exposed her to hacking. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP says that "just like" Clinton, Feingold had a "run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. the Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate." There is no Feingold Foundation. The "personal slush fund" reference is to a political action committee established by Feingold that spent significant sums that benefited Feingold -- for salaries and consulting fees to Feingold and his former aides, and to buy copies of a book he wrote. But the Clinton Foundation got into controversy not over its spending, but for potential conflicts of interest, given that it accepted donations from foreign countries that had business before Clinton as secretary of state. And while Clinton clearly broke State Department rules by setting up a private email system, nothing has been established beyond allegations that Feingold did anything improper with emails during his employment by the State Department. For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-02213	"When you get a commercial pilot’s license, you learn to communicate in English no matter where you are in the world."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/22/don-balfour/lawmakers-pilot-claim-travels-safe/	There are many languages spoken in Georgia, y’all, but one state lawmaker put together a bill earlier this year that would require all official state business be conducted in English. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Don Balfour, a Republican from Gwinnett County, offered an explanation for the legislation that prompted us to do some fact-checking. "When you get a commercial pilot’s license, you learn to communicate in English no matter where you are in the world -- because it is a practical necessity for everyone in the air to be able to communicate in a common language," Balfour said in a glossy, four-page newsletter the lawmaker sent to his constituents. Is this true? State law already makes English the official language of Georgia, though the code permits government agencies to issue forms in other languages. Balfour’s bill, Senate Resolution 1031, did not pass this year. It was sent to the Senate’s Rules Committee, but it never got a vote by the entire Senate. Critics recoiled at some aspects of the bill, such as requiring a driver’s license exam be done in English. The test is currently available in 11 languages. In response to some fatal accidents where the lack of proficiency of English appeared to be a factor, one major international organization of air traffic controllers and pilots created guidelines for them to speak English to communicate in the sky. In 2008, the International Civil Aviation Organization determined that pilots, air traffic controllers and aeronautical station operators involved in international operations should be able to speak and understand English at a specific proficiency. The ICAO, which works with the United Nations through a special agreement, serves 191 countries. It was formed in the 1940s. The list of countries includes traditional foes of industrialized nations such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela. North Korea is not on the list, although there’s not much worldwide commerce with that nation. North Korea reportedly does most of its trade with China. A handful of newer nations are not on the list. The ICAO tests can be administered by companies or organizations within various countries that adhere to the ICAO’s regulations, and they are designed specifically for aviation. In the United States, the federal government requires commercial pilots to read, speak, write and understand English. "You do have to know English," said Sarah Dunn, a senior communications and public affairs associate of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Dunn, too, cited the ICAO’s rules. NATCA represents over 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and other safety-related professionals. She noted that some pilots’ English is better than others. Nonetheless, as Balfour said, commercial pilots across nearly the entire world are required to speak some English. Since there are a few countries not on the list, we believe there is a little context that needs to be understood. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01218	"The actions I’m taking" are "the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half-century."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/21/barack-obama/are-barack-obamas-immigration-moves-kinds-actions-/	On Nov. 20, 2014, President Barack Obama announced a landmark executive action on immigration. The policy change would primarily affect more than 4 million immigrants who have lived illegally in the United States for more than five years but who have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. The program will open for applications in the spring. In addition, Obama announced that he would expand by about 300,000 the number of people able to benefit from an existing order from 2012. That order deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants who had initially entered the United States as children. Obama took these actions despite longstanding concerns from critics that they were of questionable legality. Obama sought to preempt these criticisms in his speech from the White House. "The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century," Obama said. There is a robust debate under way about whether any president has the power under the Constitution to take the kind of action Obama just announced. We won’t referee that debate. Here, we’ll look at whether there is as much historical precedent as Obama claims and whether the examples are comparable. Did each president over the past 50 years take executive action on immigration? The answer appears to be yes. The White House and its allies have circulated a paper from the American Immigration Council titled, "Executive Grants of Temporary Immigration Relief, 1956-Present." The council is pro-immigration -- its motto is, "honoring our immigrant past; shaping our immigrant future" -- but experts we checked with didn’t quarrel with the raw data the council assembled in the paper. In a multi-page table, the council cited 39 examples since 1956 in which a president "granted temporary immigration relief to one or more groups in need of assistance." Every president since (and including) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, took at least one such action. Readers can skim the full list here. In a prior fact check, we addressed one of the more prominent examples -- in 1990, when President George H. W. Bush forestalled deportations for about 1.5 million illegal immigrants through executive action. It was a consequence of a 1986 immigration overhaul that granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants. Bush’s action was designed to prevent families from being split up based on differences in legal status. When Congress failed to change the law, Bush did it on his own in 1990. Another prominent example: President Ronald Reagan legalized the status of some unauthorized children after passage of the 1986 law. This affected an estimated 100,000 families. Obama’s claim is "true in the sense that presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action," said Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And Obama could have actually used a longer time frame, said Mae Ngai, a Columbia University professor of history and Asian-American studies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, adjusted the legal status of Europeans in the 1930s, she said. Are the past examples equivalent to what Obama is doing? The answer to this question is somewhat murkier. In general, experts said each case shares similarities in legal grounding but also had differences in scope and substance. Here are some of the differences: • Size. At between 4 million and 5 million potential beneficiaries, Obama’s is easily the biggest such action ever taken by a president, at least in raw numbers. Actions with a potential six-figure reach included reprieves for Cubans in the 1960s, Southeast Asians in the 1970s and Nicaraguans in the 1980s. But most were much smaller. Even the second-largest legalization -- the Bush action -- may have affected far fewer than the 1.5 million figure that is usually attached to it, writes Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally favors tighter immigration policies. He has written that the number taking advantage may have been as small as 140,000. However, it’s worth noting that -- if you take the 1.5 million figure from George H.W. Bush’s action at face value -- both that action and Obama’s affected the same proportion of the undocumented population, about 40 percent. • Scope. Many of the past presidential actions were targeted at specific populations that were experiencing humanitarian or political crises in their home country. For instance, immigration orders affected 15,000 Ethiopians in the late 1970s and early 1980s; 2,227 Persian Gulf evacuees in the 1990s; and 10,000 Liberians under President George W. Bush. "The list reads like a study guide of post-war foreign crises," Krikorian writes. Obama’s, by contrast, targets broad classes of people of any nationality. Broader, less country-specific actions are not unprecedented -- the Reagan and George H.W. Bush actions were roughly similar in design. But numerically, they account for a distinct minority of the 39 examples in the American Immigration Council’s report. • What undocumented immigrants could receive. Krikorian notes that Obama has not just deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants but gone a step further, allowing them to receive work permits and other related benefits, such as Social Security numbers. Obama’s 2012 action, for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, did the same. There is at least one precedent for this: the George H.W. Bush action in 1990, which included the possibility of receiving work permits. Some of the other previous actions may have as well, but experts said allowing work permits are the exception rather than the rule. • What was Congress’ role? Critics argue that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas the Reagan and Bush orders were largely undertaken to fix "loose ends," as Krikorian characterizes them, from a specific immigration law. The American Immigration Council cites several examples in which legislation was pending at the time the presidents took their action, including parole for orphans (under Eisenhower), Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro (presidents Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson) and deferred action for battered immigrants (President Clinton). Still, there’s broad agreement that the degree of tension between Congress and the president was unusually large under Obama. Our ruling Obama said, "the actions I’m taking" are "the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half-century." He has a point that every president since Eisenhower, Republican and Democratic alike, has taken executive action on immigration. However, Obama’s action can be viewed as more sweeping than any of those taken earlier. The clearest parallel is Bush’s action in 1990: The percentage of the undocumented population potentially affected was similar, both actions were structured without regard to a specific nationality, and beneficiaries could qualify for a work permit. Still, most of the actions taken by prior presidents were more limited in size, scope and benefits than the one in 1990. So, even if you accept that the 1990 action is a pretty close precedent, that’s a much more limited claim than the one Obama made. In other words, it’s an exaggeration to say that Obama’s actions are "the kinds of actions taken" by every single president of the past half century. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-12867	Says former President Barack Obama "took similar action against Cuban refugees" as President Donald Trump did in his executive order.	false	/florida/statements/2017/jan/31/mario-diaz-balart/trumps-immigration-ban-comparable-obamas-cuba-rule/	President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry of people from seven countries prompted a wave of protests from immigration activists and Democrats in South Florida. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Cuban-American Republican whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade, defended Trump’s ban by comparing it with an action President Barack Obama took on Cuban refugees in his final days in office. "I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees; especially since President Obama’s action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons," Diaz-Balart wrote in a statement to the press Jan. 30. Obama’s rule change was about the "wet foot dry foot policy," which Diaz-Balart criticized at the time as a "concession to the Castro regime." Was Diaz-Balart accurate when he said Trump’s action was similar to Obama’s? In a word, no. Trump’s order, which singled out immigrants from seven countries and refugees from everywhere, was far more broad than Obama’s administrative rule change to put Cubans on more equal footing with arrivals from other countries. Trump’s order and Obama’s rule change Trump’s Jan. 27 order states: "I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order." Administration officials said that the order applied to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- countries identified by the Obama administration as terrorist hotbeds. "In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles," Trump’s order stated. Trump also put processing of all refugees -- which would include Cubans -- on hold for three months and suspended the vetting of Syrian refugees indefinitely, "until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest." Obama’s rule change, which came through a Department of Homeland Security regulation, applied to one group of people: Cubans. Obama’s Jan. 12 announcement ended the so-called "wet foot-dry foot" policy that had allowed Cubans without visas who reached U.S. shores (typically Florida) to gain automatic entry to the United States to ask for political asylum. Under the policy, those caught at sea, however, were sent back to Cuba. The policy was started in 1995 under President Bill Clinton in an effort to end the rafter crisis and had a major impact in shaping immigrant-rich Miami-Dade County. Obama also eliminated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program that allowed doctors to apply for parole at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The "wet foot-dry foot" policy, along with the Cuban Adjustment Act -- which remains on the books -- permitted those who reached dry land in the United States to get permanent residency and green cards after living in the U.S. for a year and a day. "With this change, we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws," Obama said. The rule change, announced in the final days of his presidency, followed his announcement in 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba. Obama’s rule change did not cut off immigration from Cuba. A Department of Homeland Security official told the Miami Herald that an immigration lottery allowed at least 20,000 Cubans to emigrate to the United States legally each year would remain in effect. Also a program that allows legal residents in the United States to apply for Cuban relatives to join them was expected to continue. We interviewed several experts on immigration who said Diaz-Balart’s comparison was misleading because of the different scope of the directives. While Obama eliminated special treatment for Cubans, Trump’s order singled out specific nationalities of immigrants for additional restrictions. "President Obama decided that applying the same generally applicable standards for all nationalities should apply to Cuban noncitizens," said University of California Davis School of Law immigration law professor Kevin Johnson. "In contrast, President Trump singled out citizens of seven nations for special treatment more harsh than that generally applicable to all other noncitizens." University of Miami immigration law professor Kunal Parker also said that Diaz-Balart’s comparison is invalid. "President Trump's order singles out certain countries for special treatment and specifically bans Syrian refugees from entering the United States," he said. "Nationals of the seven targeted countries are henceforth going to be treated differently from immigrants and nonimmigrants from all other countries." Ted Henken, a Latin American studies professor at Baruch College, said that Trump’s order reintroduces preferential treatment since it established a loophole for religious minorities. Trump’s order states that when refugee admissions resume, that the federal government will "prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality." (The order doesn’t specifically identify religions but the clause about religious minorities has been interpreted to refer to Christians who are minorities in Muslim countries.) Obama’s rule change was about how to process people arriving from one country -- Cuba -- and wasn’t related to vetting them for security threats. Trump’s order specifically states that it is an order "protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States." Diaz-Balart’s spokeswoman Katrina Valdes told PolitiFact Florida in an email that the point of his statement was not to compare Trump’s order and Obama’s rule change "but to highlight the hypocrisy" of those who disagreed with Trump’s order but supported Obama’s rule change. "President Obama, without warning, introduced chaos into the system for Cuban refugees," he said in a statement to PolitiFact Florida. "Where was the outrage as they were waiting at the border, having traveled for miles in horrible conditions, to have the door slammed in their faces? Obama ended the special parole for the Cuban Adjustment Act and eradicated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. He didn't just more strongly vet them, and he didn't put on the brakes for the programs for three months. He ended them." Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that Obama "took similar action against Cuban refugees" as Trump did in his executive order. Experts said that Diaz-Balart is comparing two very different actions. Obama’s rule change ended "wet foot-dry foot" -- a policy that provided special treatment to Cubans who arrived on U.S. shores without a visa. Obama didn’t entirely halt immigration for Cubans; his rule change meant that they had to apply just like people from other countries. Trump’s order is far more broad and temporarily suspended entry for people from seven specific countries, as well as refugees from everywhere.

pomt-03793	"Our debt now is about $140,000 per household."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/27/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-national-debt-breaks-down-140/	You might not realize this but you, as American taxpayers, are deeply in debt, maybe even more deeply than your indebtedness on your mortgage. That’s one way, at least, to look at the size of the government debt that some economists say could hinder the economy for years. Rob Portman, the Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, shares that view, and on the floor on the Senate on March 21 said, "I’m worried about where we’re headed. Our debt now is about $140,000 per household." Portman was speaking in support of a Republican budget proposal, and his comments had a political flavor. We’re not here to weigh the merits of Republican or Democratic budget proposals, especially since the Senate and House budgets as passed are little more than political wish lists. But we wondered if Portman was right about the size of the debt when measured in household terms. This required some simple math. The current gross debt -- the total of long-term obligations by the federal government -- was $16.750 trillion the day Portman spoke, according to the Treasury Department’s debt-to-the-penny website. The United States had 121,084,000 households in 2012, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, with whom we checked by phone and Internet. Divide the total debt by the number of households and you get $138,334, which is less than 1.2 percent off from Portman’s figure of $140,000. You can examine this other ways, using other Census Bureau data; it can differ depending on which census surveys and methodologies you examine. You can even factor in different debt figures, using the debt on the day Portman spoke or the debt on the last day of 2012. Yet none of that makes much of a difference. To bring this up to date in 2013, you can even use an estimate for the number of households there will be this year, and weigh it against the amount of debt subject to the limit set by Congress, since that limit is expected to be hit within months. That’s what Portman’s office did. Doing so, the household average exceeds $140,000 figure by $786. In other words, the senator was on or near the mark in all these cases. If this represented the non-mortgage debt on every household, your credit limit, too, might be under duress. And Portman would be correct. This is a hypothetical way of expressing the debt, of course, because neither party proposes paying it off equally among households. As we and our PolitiFact partners have noted before, tax rates and payments vary depending on incomes, deductions and other factors. There is no universal sum -- $140,000 or some other figure -- that each of our households actually owes. Furthermore, a portion of this overall debt -- $4.85 trillion, to be precise -- represents obligations that one federal agency or account owes to another, and much of that money is available through agency transfers, ordinary operations and everyday tax transactions, at least for now. Growing federal obligations to retirees could create a demand for more borrowing in the future, but the situation is not dire this very moment and Congress could act before it gets that way. This is why a number of economists, and the Congressional Budget Office, tend to focus on the other portion of debt -- the roughly $11.9.trillion borrowed by the government and held by creditors such as investors and foreign governments. If you used only that portion of the debt, the household average would fall considerably. Where does that leave Portman’s claim? He spoke of "our debt." While not a precise term, it’s another way of stating overall or gross debt. A number of economists have told PolitiFact that they worry more about the portion of debt held by the public, and less about the borrowing between intragovernmental accounts. But they have also said that when describing the national debt, it can be reasonable to express it in terms of the gross debt. Portman was using an average to illustrate a point, not to say that each of us needs to take out a second mortgage. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-00802	A school uniform policy helps with "school safety, helps with truancy."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/02/janet-adkins/school-uniforms-improve-school-safety-and-truancy-/	More Florida school districts may soon have millions of reasons to start requiring students to wear uniforms, thanks to a bill that just passed the House. Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, sponsored a bill that would give districts $10 per child to adopt standard attire policies in kindergarten through eighth grade. The state would set aside $10 million in all from the general revenue fund. Similar provisions have been amended to a school bill in the Senate, although without the cash incentive. Adkins said that school uniforms help create a positive learning environment, because it removes distractions. She cited testimony from officials from five Florida school districts that raved about their uniform policies. "They were all saying the same thing, and that is when they implemented a school uniform policy in their schools, the climate, the culture at their schools improved," Adkins said. "It's an issue of school safety, helps with school truancy." The House passed the bill 102-8 on March 27, but we were curious whether requiring students to dress the same really did improve school safety and truancy records. Turns out the research is anything but uniform. Dressing up stats Adkins’ bill would not make uniforms mandatory in any district, although there are already five counties that do have at least a district-wide K-8 standard student attire policy, according to a House analysis. Those five are Alachua, Bay, Madison, Osceola and Polk counties. Otherwise the decision to require uniforms filters down to varying degrees at the local level, even school by school. Whether or not the practice makes students safer or fosters better attendance really comes down to what study you read. A 1996 study of Long Beach, Calif., schools found a marked decrease in fights, sexual violence and weapons possession two years after adopting school uniforms. A different take on the issue from 2007 using national data found average assaults had actually gone up by an average of 14 incidents in violent schools that required standard attire. One researcher we spoke with said that a big part of uniform policies is the perception they make schools safer. Jafeth Sanchez, a research assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said surveys she gave students at three middle schools showed the kids felt like uniforms curbed violence, although that feeling dropped in the second year students were asked. (Adkins’ office directed us to this study as proof of her statement, but said she used a couple of others, as well.) Those results could be because the students got used to wearing uniforms. Or, it could be because the initial answers weren’t honest, but Sanchez thought that was unlikely. "Generally, students do respond honestly to such things – particularly considering that the majority indicated they didn’t like wearing uniforms, even though they actually agreed or strongly agreed with their various benefits," she said. Other experts we interviewed said there was a kind of "halo effect" in which students and teachers felt things had improved, even if they hadn’t. Research into attendance is another matter, and often the two subjects aren’t studied at the same time. A Youngstown State University study from 2006 looked at Ohio secondary schools and found attendance and graduation rates clearly went up. University of Houston researchers checked into attendance in 2010 and found the difference was slight. "Specifically attendance rates in middle and high schools increased by approximately ½ to 1 day per year. There was no impact on elementary attendance," according to Scott Imberman, who worked on the University of Houston research and now teaches economics at Michigan State. He added it is difficult to measure discipline stats along with uniform implementation because discipline standards may have changed along with the dress code. And some argue school uniforms are an all-around boondoggle. David Brunsma, a sociology professor at Virginia Tech, has studied the issue and wrote a 2004 book called The School Uniform Movement and What It Tells Us about American Education: A Symbolic Crusade. His research from national samples found no significant effects on behavior, absenteeism or student attitudes. "This is classic," he told PolitiFact Florida via email. "However, it is based on misinformation, common (non)sense, and, of course, pressure from the children’s clothier industry." Our ruling Adkins said school uniforms improve school safety and truancy. There are some studies that say there are changes for the better and worse for both school violence and attendance statistics once uniforms are adopted, but there’s hardly a consensus. Even if there is improvement, research suggests the positives are slight -- not exactly the evidence Adkins says overwhelmingly supports the benefits of these policies. Some experts think the actual impact on students is negligible or even negative. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-05090	"No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/02/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-no-one-should-eat-m/	Are Rhode Island's lakes and rivers so contaminated from air pollution that originates from out of state that it's unsafe to eat more than one serving per month of fish caught here? That's what Sheldon Whitehouse said on June 19, 2012, when he urged his colleagues in the U.S. Senate to approve new standards for mercury contamination caused by air pollution emitted from coal-burning power plants in states to our west. After contending that lives would be saved, heart attacks would be prevented and emergency-room visits would be reduced if the new restrictions were finally put in place, Whitehouse turned to fishing to describe some of the intangible problems caused by the airborne mercury that lands in Rhode Island. Whitehouse displayed an image of a Norman Rockwell painting, "Catching the Big One," from the Aug. 3, 1929, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. It shows a boy and his grandfather fishing. "That image in Rhode Island is shadowed by the fact that this small child would not be allowed to eat any freshwater fish that he caught with his grandfather because of this mercury pollution that has been bombarded in on us by these power plants that did not clean up their act," the senator said. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, he said, "No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month. So if the grandfather caught two fish, he could eat one [in] a month, but he shouldn't eat the other because of the health effects of the mercury that has piled up in the bodies of the fish." No children should be eating local freshwater fish and no adult should eat more than one serving per month? We wondered if the pollution was really that bad. So, perched at our computer, we checked the Health Department's website, where we found the latest test results for 31 bodies of fresh water. The chart says, as Whitehouse said, that nobody should be eating fish caught in Yawgoog Pond or Wincheck Pond, both in Hopkinton, or in the Quidnick Reservoir, in Coventry. It also says fish other than trout in Meadow Brook Pond in Richmond shouldn't be eaten. (Trout are an exception because they are raised by the state on a mercury-free diet.) It also says that none of the freshwater fish caught in the state should be eaten by women who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or by children under age 7. And what about everybody else? In 12 of the 31 areas (13 if you count trout from Meadow Brook Pond), the Health Department says it's safe for adults and children over 6 to eat the fish in unlimited amounts, according to the chart. There's no once-a-month restriction. In 13 other areas, the consumption should be limited to once per week for most adults and older children. Only in 3 of the 31 areas does the state say that mercury pollution makes it unsafe to eat more than one fish meal a month: Watchaug Pond, in Charlestown, and Tucker and Yawgoo Ponds in South Kingstown. The same day we called Whitehouse's office asking for the source of his information, spokesman Seth Larson called back to say that the senator's staff was using the same source we found. "It turns out we made an error in preparing the senator's remarks," he said, promising a quick correction. The next day, on the floor of the Senate, Whitehouse said that he erred in his statement. "I would suggest Rhode Islanders consult the Health Department's website where the agency lists fish advisories by pond and by river and that way Rhode Islanders can make an informed decision for themselves and their families as to where and when our fish are safe to eat for mercury contamination," he said. That's easier said than done because the Health Department data are outdated and confusing, so consumers may end up more perplexed than before. Its mercury testing wasn't done systematically because of a lack of funding. Most rivers, lakes and ponds have not been tested at all. The results on the waters that were tested are from 1996 to 2000. No testing has been done since then because, again, the department hasn't had the money. And the data posted online sometimes contradict what Health Department official Robert Vanderslice says the department has been recommending. For example, in the waters listed as being safe (where everyone except for small children, pregnant women and nursing women "can consume any amount safely"), the website doesn't make it clear that the findings don't apply at all to largemouth and smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie or eel. Those species eat other fish and tend to concentrate mercury in their bodies, Vanderslice explained. That eliminates most of the fish people would want to eat. "You cannot predict from one pond to the next" how much mercury will be in fish because the amount can vary from pond to pond, and from time to time, he said. "If you sample one pond, you know about that one pond at that time for the species you sampled." "What our data show is that when you're freshwater fishing in Rhode Island, you don't know what the levels are," said Vanderslice. "The best way you're assured to being safe is to limit how much fish you eat, vary where you fish and change the type of fish you eat." That's not very reassuring to adults who may have repeatedly eaten fish from the dozen areas listed as safe by the Health Department. Whitehouse, in his followup Senate speech, said the larger point remains: "Mercury contamination is a continuing public health problem in Rhode Island and one that we can do very little about without EPA standing up for us and defending us. Because in these other states it is a great deal for them to be about to poison our state's waters but get cheaper power in their states because they don't force their utilities to put scrubbers on and to keep themselves operating at appropriate levels of pollution control." Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said that "No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month." Whitehouse made that absolute statement based on a Health Department web page indicating that his statement wasn't true for 25 of the 31 freshwater bodies. Not only can older children and most adults eat fish caught there more than once a month, in at least a dozen areas they can eat it as often as they'd like, it said. Whitehouse acknowledged misstating the posted test results. But fish from those limited areas haven't been tested in more than a decade, a lapse in public health monitoring we find disturbing. And the data are, at times, so at odds with what the Health Department says it is recommending, any conclusion drawn from them should be accompanied by a hefty dose of skepticism. Mercury pollution poses a signIficant public health problem and clearly consumers should be wary about eating freshwater fish caught in state waters. That's a large kernel of truth in Whitehouse's statement. But because much of the published data contradict his broad assertion, we rate it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-01029	"It will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/28/stuart-varney/will-aca-cost-50000-enrollee/	You know you’re inside the Beltway when a report from the Congressional Budget Office triggers a fusillade of tweets and punditry from partisans spanning the political spectrum. The CBO’s latest prediction on the budget and the economy devotes an entire appendix to the human and fiscal impacts of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Fox News host and business analyst Stuart Varney helped viewers make sense of some of the hefty numbers from the CBO. Talking with America’s Newsroom host Bill Hemmer, Varney explained that even though the deficit is expected to reach its lowest point of the Obama presidency, it will soon rise again. "The major reason for this is Obamacare," Varney said. "New figures suggest that Obamacare will be much more expensive than we thought. It will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years." Varney’s claim about $50,000 per enrollee caught our eye because we’ve seen it all over the Internet and we wanted to see how accurate it might turn out to be. We reached out to Varney and did not hear back. But the original source, at least the earliest we could find, is an article in the British Daily Mail. Here’s how that article begins: It will cost the federal government – taxpayers, that is – $50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the Obamacare law, the Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday. The number comes from figures buried in a 15-page section of the nonpartisan organization's new ten-year budget outlook. The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion – or $50,000 per head. The basic math is correct. Divide $1.35 trillion by 27 million people and you get $50,000. But health policy analyst Joe Antos at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, told PunditFact that the number is meaningless. "You can’t divide a 10-year spending number by the average number of people who are newly insured," Antos said. "That’s not the way it works." We heard the same comment from Christine Eibner, a RAND health care economist."It is analytically problematic to compare a single-year estimate of the change in the uninsured population to a 10-year projection of the costs," Eibner said. Economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California-San Diego called the original calculations "a bit of a mess." Antos said the CBO would never do such an analysis itself because the "two numbers don’t relate to each other." One is a running total over a decade and the other is a snapshot of the number of people who gained insurance in a single year, over and above what the CBO would expect without the Affordable Care Act. "Just because you can divide one number by another, it doesn't mean anything," Antos said. "Good arithmetic doesn't count when it’s based on bad logic. Obamacare is expensive and inefficient, but this doesn’t prove that." Donald Marron is director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute and former acting head of the CBO. Marron pointed out another issue with the calculation in the Daily Mail. The flows of people in and out of insurance coverage are complicated. While millions of people might sign up through the Affordable Care Act exchanges, millions are expected to fall away from getting coverage through their employers or on the individual market. The 27 million used by the newspaper article was a net figure. "The number of people helped will be something like 40 million," Marron said. "That includes the exchanges and Medicaid and CHIP (children’s health insurance). These are the people newly helped by the coverage." Marron also noted that you would want a way to factor in the years that these people are helped, but regardless, spreading the costs across 40 million people would drive down the cost for each individual covered. Our ruling Varney said that it will cost taxpayers $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years. This seems to come directly from an article in the Daily Mail. None of the health care experts we reached, regardless of their economic philosophies or thoughts about the health care law, found any merit in the math that produced this figure. It’s most glaring defect is that it compares a 10-year cumulative total to a single-year snapshot of the number of people who gained insurance. Any analysis that accounted for the years of coverage people gained would yield a dollar figure considerably less than the $50,000 cited by Varney. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07554	"From 1960, the year I was born, until the time I became Governor in 2003, the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. … we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/01/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-he-brought-minnesota-state-spend/	In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, Tim Pawlenty describes himself as a fiscal conservative with a record of reining in government spending. The evidence: Reduced state spending growth during the eight years he was governor of Minnesota, he said. "From 1960, the year I was born, until the time I became Governor in 2003, the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent," Pawlenty writes. "We brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year." It’s a statistic that he repeats several times in his book, so we decided to check it out. Pawlenty was elected governor in 2002, taking office in January 2003. In Minnesota, the budgets follow fiscal years that begin in July. So the first budget Pawlenty could have put his stamp on was the 2004 budget that went into effect on July 1, 2003. We found spending numbers dating back to 1960, and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. We arrived at 21.09 percent, so that’s in line with what Pawlenty said. We then turned to the second part of Pawlenty’s statement, that "we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year." First, note that he’s comparing two-year increments with one-year increments, which would make the difference seem more dramatic. Still, we examined year-over-year change from 2004 to 2011. (Again, Pawlenty left office on Jan. 3, 2011, but the fiscal year started six months before that.) We averaged the year-to-year changes in the budget for those years and arrived at an average increase of 1.64 percent, very close to what Pawlenty said. If you took the two-year average, it would be a bit higher, at 3.53 percent. Yet those numbers don’t tell the whole story. As Pawlenty was leaving office, state budget agency released forecasts showing spending increasing 27 percent over the next two years -- before the incoming governor, Democrat Mark Dayton, made any changes to the budget at all. The budget analysts said the state had used several mechanisms to reduce state spending. That included using $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate delays shifts in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion. The budget numbers led DFLers -- that’s members of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, equivalent to Democrats in other states -- to blame Pawlenty for using one-time fixes and ignoring structural imbalances. Pawlenty supporters acknowledged the anticipated spending increase but blamed it on DFLers for refusing to embrace Pawlenty’s ideas for long-term solutions. Pawlenty’s statement was that from 1960 to 2003, "the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. … we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year." The numbers are accurate, though Pawlenty is comparing two-year increases to one-year increases. More significantly, spending forecasts increased dramatically as Pawlenty was leaving office, when short-term budget fixes like the federal stimulus and spending delays for K-12 education expired. Given that increase, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2011-04-01T11:37:53	2011-01-11	['Minnesota']

pomt-00677	Wisconsin's non-discrimination law "doesn't protect members of the trans-gender community."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/08/jason-rae/no-gender-identity-protection-wisconsin-anti-discr/	On June 6, 2015, delegates attending the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s annual convention will elect a chairman to succeed Mike Tate, who is stepping down after six years. The youngest of the five candidates is 28-year-old Jason Rae of Milwaukee -- who, at 17, was the youngest person ever elected to the Democratic National Committee. In an interview on April 21, 2015, Wisconsin Eye host Steve Walters asked Rae, who is gay, if it is a victory for the Democratic Party that "Wisconsin and the nation have made so much progress" on same-sex issues. "I don’t think it’s a problem -- I think it’s a real step forward -- but there's a lot of work yet to be done when you look at LGBT issues," said Rae, referring to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. "You know, we were one of the first states that actually had a non-discrimination ordinance statewide, but it only protected members of the gay and lesbian community; it doesn't protect members of the ‘trans’ community." We wondered: Under Wisconsin law, gay, lesbian and bisexual people are protected from discrimination, but not people who are transgender? Transgender explained Transgender, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, is a broad term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. A transgender man, for example, refers to a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man. Transsexual, according to the center, is an "older term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth who seeks to transition from male to female or female to male. Many do not prefer this term because it is thought to sound overly clinical." The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not attempt to count the number of Americans who identify themselves as transgender. An estimate made in 2011, by an expert in LGBT demography at UCLA Law School, put the figure at nearly 700,000, or 0.3 percent of the population. The laws We’ll start our analysis by noting that we have rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. He said Wisconsin, in 1982, became the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. That article noted that the law leaves out transgender people. The District of Columbia and 18 states -- including Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa -- have laws that "clearly prohibit discrimination against transgender people," according to the American Civil Liberties Union. By comparison, a map produced by the National Center for Transgender Equality says Wisconsin is among states with laws that protect against discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation but don’t have clear protections for gender identity. We consulted four experts: Larry DuPuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin; Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm; Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program; and attorney Gordon Leech, who heads the civil rights and liberties section of the State Bar of Wisconsin. Here was the consensus: 1. Wisconsin statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation in three areas -- employment, housing and public accommodation -- do not expressly include transgender people. (According to Leech, Milwaukee and Madison include gender identity in ordinances that prohibit discrimination in all three areas. Milwaukee County and Dane County include gender identity in housing and employment discrimination ordinances; and Appleton includes gender identity in its fair housing ordinance.) 2. That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it’s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status. 3. Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation. 4. To date, there has not been a published decision by a state judge in Wisconsin stating that transgender people are covered by those anti-discrimination laws. Our rating Rae said Wisconsin's non-discrimination law "doesn't protect members of the transgender community." It’s unclear whether a transgender person could pursue in state court a discrimination case using laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation. What is clear is Wisconsin laws do not expressly prohibit discrimination based on a person’s status as transgender. We rate Rae’s statement True.

pomt-02885	Says Chris Christie "vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/10/hilary-rosen/chris-christie-vetoed-planned-parenthood-funding-5/	Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen isn’t buying all the talk about newly re-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie being a moderate Republican. In a roundtable discussion on CNN’s State of the Union, Rosen painted Christie as out of touch when it comes to women’s reproductive issues. "Women consistently bring Democrats over the top in these purple states," Rosen said during the Nov. 10 show. "When you look at Chris Christie and you try and take that forward, you’ve got an anti-choice candidate who has vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship." With four budgets under his belt, did Christie really veto money for Planned Parenthood five times? Rosen tweeted us a story from LifeNews.com, which opposes abortions, and a (Newark) Star-Ledger newspaper editorial that referenced five vetoes. We looked into it ourselves and found Christie has used his executive power several times to deny funding for family planning clinics, including but not exclusively limited to Planned Parenthood. As a result of the cuts at least six clinics have closed, including two affiliated with Planned Parenthood, our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey found. The vetoes have been a real sore spot between the governor and the Democrat-led Legislature since Christie took office. So how many were there exactly? It depends on how you count them. We compiled a timeline using clips from the Star-Ledger and interviews with Planned Parenthood representatives. We could not reach a Christie spokesperson by our deadline. In March 2010, Christie proposed his first budget recommendations amid a $10 billion shortfall with across-the-board cuts, including an $820 million cut for schools. This budget, which outlined Christie’s priorities but still needed approval from the Democratic legislators, also included the elimination of $7.5 million for "family planning services." Legislators then responded by passing a bill to add that funding back in the budget. But Christie struck back. On June 23, 2010, Christie vetoed SB 2139, which aimed to restore $7.5 million in grants for the state’s 58 women’s health and family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. In his veto letter, Christie cited the state’s budget bind and the existence of other clinics that could perform these services. "Reproductive health services will continue to be available in each of New Jersey’s 21 counties, including Planned Parenthood clinics, local health department clinics, free standing clinics and hospital-based clinics," he wrote. "Nearly 95,000 women will still receive care through these family planning sites." The Legislature tried again the next year. Again Christie said no. Christie vetoed $7.5 million for the family planning centers in the 2011-12 state budget. Same story in 2012. The Legislature passed a supplemental bill, AB 788, to restore the money for family planning centers, but Christie vetoed it. Lastly, on June 29, 2013, Christie vetoed a measure, SB 2825, from Democrats that again tried to restore the $7.5 million for family planning services. That's four clear vetoes, plus the original cut. Additionally, in 2011 and again in 2013, Christie vetoed proposals to expand the state's Medicaid program to cover family planning services for people who earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Services would have included things such as birth control and cervical exams but not abortion, according to the Star-Ledger. The Medicaid expansion would not have directly provided money for Planned Parenthood, but it "would have provided a new revenue stream to allow Planned Parenthood health centers to see additional patients and offer additional services, said Ed Remsen, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. So that could be two additional vetoes, depending on how you count it. Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, pointed out that Christie has maintained funding for other health services and that he defeated a female candidate who made this an issue, suggesting that Rosen’s theory about women not liking Christie rings hollow. Our ruling Rosen said Christie "vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship." Rosen is largely correct, though different people might come to a different figure. We rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Hilary Rosen	None	None	None	2013-11-10T17:15:53	2013-11-10	['Chris_Christie']
pomt-11042	Says Sherrod Brown in 1978 "voted for stricter removal standards (for voter registration) and then enforced them as Secretary of State."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/jun/29/ohio-republican-party/ohio-gop-miscasts-sherrod-browns-longstanding-poli/	U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown criticized a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Ohio’s procedure to purge infrequent voters from the registration rolls. "Ohio should be working to make voting easier, not harder," Brown, a Democrat, tweeted June 11. "Instead, today’s decision empowers Ohio to further strip away the right to vote for thousands of Ohioans, threatening the integrity of our state’s election process." The Ohio Republican Party called Brown a hypocrite because of a law he voted for that called for removing inactive voters. "Here's a real fact you need to know: @ohdems were for this legal process of removing inactive voters before they were against it. As a State Rep in 1978, @SherrodBrown voted for stricter removal standards and then enforced them as Secretary of State! #Hypocrites," the Ohio GOP tweeted June 12. Brown faces a re-election challenge from U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. We found that Brown did vote for the law cited by the Ohio GOP, but the tweet miscasts Brown’s longstanding policy on voter registration and takes the 1978 vote out of context. Laws voted on by Brown in the Legislature In 1977, Democrats, including Brown, passed Senate Bill 125, which set rules for voter registration statewide. At the time, many counties had no registration requirements. This bill specifically eliminated "failure to vote as a reason for the cancellation of registration." That same year, Republicans got a constitutional amendment on the ballot that ended same-day registration and also stated if a person failed to vote at least once in four years, then the person must re-register. Voters passed the amendment. The next year, the state took up the topic of voter registration again in HB 1209. The bill stated that each year, voter registrations would be canceled if the person hadn’t voted at least once in four years.The bill directed officials to send notices to voters stating their registration had been cancelled and a form to re-register. Brown voted in favor of this bill. Two years later, the Legislature passed HB 1062, which said elections officials must send out a notice 30 days prior to cancellation. Again, Brown voted in favor of this bill. We didn’t find any evidence from 40 years ago explaining Brown’s rationale at the time for voting for these bills. Republicans argue now that if Brown objected to purging voters he could have voted against the bills, but these bills were not establishing a new policy -- they were implementing what voters approved in the constitutional amendment. Brown couldn’t undo the constitutional amendment, but he could vote for bills that added requirements to notify voters. "Brown voted for two bills to protect the rights of voters at risk of being purged," Brown spokesman Preston Maddock said. We didn’t want to just take the Brown campaign’s word for it, so we asked some long-time experts of Ohio politics about the backdrop of the 1978 bill that Brown supported. Bob Taft, who was a Republican in the General Assembly at the time, said the Democrats had to defer to the will of the voters as reflected in the amendment to the Constitution. "They controlled the Legislature, so they nibbled around the edges of the amendment to provide for notice," Taft said. Taft later defeated Brown to become Ohio's secretary of state office and went on to serve as governor. Two retired long-time journalists in Ohio told us that the idea of purging voters from the rolls in the 1970s wasn’t the controversial idea that it is today. "This whole thing about when we should cleanse voter rolls of people who haven’t voted only become an issue in this hyperpartisan age we live in now," said Mike Curtin, a former reporter and an associate publisher of the Columbus Dispatch who later became a Democratic state house member. Brown as secretary of state The Ohio GOP said that Brown enforced the stricter removal standards when he served as secretary of state from 1982 to 1991. Maddock said that Brown had to follow state law. But he did have the power to try to grow the voter rolls, so he circulated voter registration forms just about everywhere, which included convincing McDonald’s to print voter registration forms on tray liners. Brown convinced other businesses, including banks, utilities and a telephone company, to mail out the registration forms. The state also distributed registration forms at welfare offices, lottery outlets and homeless shelters, in addition to public schools and government offices. "If government can find you to make you pay taxes, if government can find you to draft you under the Selective Service System, then government can work a little harder to find you to register to vote," Brown said in 1988. The Washington Post wrote in 1985 that Ohio’s registration activity was "probably the most intensive and wide-ranging in the nation." The Republicans said that Brown enforced removal standards as secretary of state. He would have been obligated to follow the law, but he did warn voters about it. In 1990, Brown cautioned that having an outdated voter registration form would prohibit a voter from casting a ballot. "Ohioans who have not voted for more than four years have had their registration canceled, because the Ohio Constitution requires it," he said in 1990, according to the Richwood Gazette. Two months later Brown lost re-election. Brown in Congress and the Senate In 1992, Brown was elected to Congress. The next year, he was one of dozens of co-sponsors of the National Voter Registration Act,which included provisions to make it harder for states to purge voters. Taft, Ohio’s secretary of state at the time, revised the state’s removal policy to comply with the NVRA. He created a six-year process for removals. If voters skip one federal election, they are sent a notice by a county board of elections. If the voter doesn’t respond and doesn’t vote over the next four years, their name is purged from the roll. In comparison, under the 1978 law, it only took four years. Also the 1978 law only notified voters after they had been removed while the current process sends a notice to voters before they are removed. Our ruling Ohio Republicans said in 1978, Brown "voted for stricter removal standards (for voter registration) and then enforced them as Secretary of State." Brown did vote for a bill in 1978 that removed voters after four years, which is more strict that the six-year process upheld this year by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the GOP’s tweet ignores the context of that 1978 bill and what led to it. The bill implemented a policy approved by voters in a Constitutional amendment. Brown couldn’t undo the amendment. The Ohio GOP also ignores Brown’s full record on voter registration. In 1977, Brown voted for a bill that eliminated "failure to vote as a reason for the cancellation of registration." The Republicans also omit Brown’s efforts to increase the voter registration rolls while he was Secretary of State. During that time, he warned voters that they could have their registrations cancelled for not voting. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04422	Says opponent Tammy Baldwin ‘has had not one positive ad’ in the campaign for U.S. Senate.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/15/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-baldwin-has-not-run-any-positive-ads/	Former Gov. Tommy Thompson won the bruising Republican primary for U.S. Senate. And the general election race against Democrat Tammy Baldwin has featured plenty of punches from both sides. Thompson was asked about negative advertising during an Oct. 5, 2012, appearance at a Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker Luncheon. He expressed disappointment, and said the tone didn’t reflect his personality. "I’m very sad about the negative ads," Thompson said. "I’m a positive guy. I’m optimistic." He noted that when he successfully challenged Democrat Gov. Anthony Earl in 1986, the two "ran a fantastic election, we ran an election all over the state and that always was positive." And then Thompson turned the blame on his opponent. "Congresswoman Baldwin has had not one positive ad. Not one.... Not one positive ad. Why? Because she hasn’t done anything." A few days after the statement, the Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert wrote about a report by Kantar Media CMAG, a D.C. firm that tracks political ads, that found in the 30 days that ended Oct. 2, 2012, 92% of the ads aired in the race were "negative." What’s more, the report showed that in the weeks after the primary, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 17, 2012, Baldwin and her allies outspent Thompson and his allies almost 3-to-1 on broadcast television. Complaining and finger-pointing about the tone of the race is nothing new in politics. But Thompson made a very specific claim about Baldwin, and suggested she is to blame for the negativity. Is he on the money? To be sure, the battle for the U.S. Senate seat was bitter long before the general election, but only on the Republican side. Thompson topped three opponents in the August primary, while Baldwin faced no opponent, though she has been on television since early summer. That split nature of the race creates a bit of a problem when it comes to evaluating Thompson’s claim. Was Thompson talking about the entirety of the campaign or was he referring to the head-to-head battle with Baldwin? From the context of the specific question, about how negative ads had erased Thompson’s lead in the polls, it’s reasonable to believe Thompson was speaking about ads in the general election race. And he referred to the general election campaign that he waged against former Gov. Earl. But that’s not what he said -- Thompson said all of Baldwin’s ads had been negative. We asked his campaign to provide backup for his statement and was told they would get back to us but didn’t. So, let’s start with the primary season. That’s when Baldwin was able to play Rock-Paper-Engines. Those were the titles of her TV ads. A June 17, 2012, ad, "Paper", discussed Baldwin’s efforts to sanction China for breaking trade rules and hurting the U.S. paper industry. The "Rock,"ad, which began running July 9, was biographical in nature. On July 30, 2012, "Engines"began, claiming Baldwin "led the fight" to force the Coast Guard to buy engines from American manufacturers. None of those ads mentioned Thompson or the other Republican contenders. That tone changed after the Aug. 14, 2012, primary, starting the following week with an ad called "Choice." In it, Baldwin talks about three tax-cut votes of her own, and then turns her sights on Thompson, calling him "the guy who’s gotten rich working for D.C. lobbyists" and saying he "wants to give a $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class." She followed up a few days later with another ad criticizing Thompson for refusing to release his tax returns. In an early September ad, Baldwin attacked Thompson’s record as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ad said Thompson "cut a sweetheart deal with drug companies making it illegal for them to negotiate lower prescription drug prices." So, since the primary, the ads have been negative. The same can be said of Thompson’s ads. Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted Thompson vowed numerous times that he would run a positive campaign. He argued Thompson was the first to go negative against Baldwin, even before the primary and cited a July ad, "Repeal"showing Thompson on a Harley. In it, Thompson pledges to be the "51st vote" to repeal "Obamacare." Baldwin’s face appears briefly superimposed on the road, with the note she supports the federal health care law. (There is no question about that. She voted for it and has even suggested going further.) As with the Baldwin side, the negative lines become much clearer after the primary. In other ads, Thompson has said Baldwin supports a massive tax increase, describes her as "too extreme for Wisconsin," and says she’s more liberal than Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama. Groups on both sides of the race have also ran negative ads, contributing to the all-negative sense about the race. Our rating At the Press Club event, Thompson said Baldwin had not aired "one positive ad" in the campaign. That is certainly true for the general election, and it’s reasonable to assume that’s what he was referring to. But a longer view of the campaign, extending before the primary, provides a very different picture. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03214	"Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/25/steve-goreham/global-warming-skeptic-says-global-surface-tempera/	Sometimes it's the contradictions that drive PolitiFact to check a statement. In a commentary published Aug. 5, 2013, in The Providence Journal, Steve Goreham, executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, was critical of the science behind the warnings that Earth is getting hotter due to pollution. His first paragraph made this assertion: "Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years." Yet three days earlier, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record. All 10 have occurred since 1998. Who's right here? We decided to check Goreham's factoid. We contacted him to ask where he got his numbers and how his claim stacked up with NOAA's. "The short answer is that both are correct," he said in an email. "Temperatures have been flat for the last 16 years and 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record." We weren't sure how they could both be correct, so we again asked Goreham what he was using for data. We didn't hear back immediately, so we started looking on our own. Our first stop was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database. Those data show that over the past 16 years -- 1997 through 2012 -- 15 have been the warmest on record. The readings go back to 1880. But how did the temperatures change during that period? In 2012, the global temperature was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit higher over land than it was in 1997. Over land and water, the difference was 0.11 degrees. That's not flat. But temperatures naturally fluctuate so much from year to year, It's misleading to just compare two points in time. Goreham is talking about the overall trend, which climate experts use to see long-term changes over time. To find a trend, you have to do a more sophisticated calculation, preferably over a much longer period than 16 years. But 16 years is the period Goreham chose -- and what many other global warming skeptics have focused on -- so we'll stick with that for now. The trend line shows that the annual global temperatures listed by NOAA rose by 0.141 degrees during that stretch. To put this in perspective, when you're only dealing with a 16-year period, a lot depends on when you want to start looking. If you shift the timeframe back by just one year, beginning with 1996, the increase more than doubles, to 0.351 degrees. When we heard back from Goreham after asking about the NOAA database, he said we would "probably" see flat temperatures beginning in 1997. He also suggested we look beginning in 2001 to 2012 and said the temperature trend in that period would be flat. In fact, it was a bit negative. But that's not the 16 years he cited in his claim. Why start 16 years ago? It includes 1998, when an El Nino made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. There's another problem: When you get into temperature changes that small and time frames that short, the natural variability of climate can be so large that any "trend" might be the result of chance. "Generally, for these short periods, if you're within 0.05 [of a degree Celsius] per decade you're not significantly different from zero," said John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, one of the country's best-known skeptics of global warming. (Over a 16-year period, that means the change would have to be higher or lower than 0.144 degrees Fahrenheit to be significant.) "None of the data sets show anything much different from zero since the last 16, 17 years," he said. Since the 1998 El Nino, "it's been pretty flat. There's been a slowdown in the trend." So by Christy's gauge of what would be significant, the 0.141 degree increase from 1997 through 2012 seen in the NOAA database is essentially no increase, as Goreham said. In addition to the NOAA database, we looked at the two other major climate databases, one from NASA and the other from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. We used a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, which supports the global warming theory as do the vast majority of climate scientists. Its Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Although they would indicate a significant rise by Christy's off-the-cuff definition, a more precise calculation done by the Temperature Trend Calculator showed that none of the increases exceeded chance. Thus, the global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s have stalled. The Met Office has begun referring to the last 16 years as "the recent pause in warming." Officials there have issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: "There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. "The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space," Brecha said. "So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up." One last note. Goreham, in his commentary, was citing the 16-year trend in a broader context. He and other warming skeptics argue, with some justification, that the newest global readings are so far afield from the alarming temperature increases that were once predicted by climate computer models, it raises serious questions about whether scientists understand Earth's changing climate as well as they think they do, and whether it's worth spending trillions of dollars to try to influence it. But we'll save that controversy for another fact-check. Our ruling Steve Goreham said "Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years." The databases we checked generally show small increases during that period, but not enough to be statistically significant, thanks to a short timeframe and a starting point that included an unusually warm year in 1998. That's why, at the same time, NOAA data clearly show that global temperatures in 15 of the last 16 years have been the hottest recorded. So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs. Because his statement reflects cherry-picked numbers and leaves out important details that would give a very different impression, we rate it Half True.

The fake news story resurfaced after American News shared a post on Facebook with the headline, "Denzel Washington Backs Trump in the Most Epic Way." When we looked, the BBC reported the post had been shared 22,000 times. The post has been removed since then, but other bloggers have reported similar stories, including American News24 and AmericanPoliticNews, that live on. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Each story lures in readers with flashy headlines claiming the Hollywood star has thrown his support behind Trump, and spoken out against Obama. "Denzel Washington Switches to Trump Shocks Hollywood, Speaks Out Against Obama," reads the headlines from American News 24 and AmericanPoliticNews. And each story is very, very wrong. The stories claimed Washington praised Trump, saying: "We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here. He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world." Washington never said this. The quote actually comes from a March 5 New York Post article where Charles Evers, the brother of late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, discusses his endorsement of Trump. Furthermore, Washington’s spokesman told the BBC that the story was completed fabricated. Our ruling AmericanPoliticNews wrote a story claiming that Denzel Washington has thrown his support behind Trump, with the headline, "Denzel Washington Switches to Trump Shocks Hollywood, Speaks Out Against Obama."

pomt-04415	"Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/16/james-langevin/us-rep-james-langevin-says-more-energy-being-produ/	The concern that the United States is not producing enough energy, resulting in high fuel prices, has been one of the themes of the 2012 election season. It came up during the Oct. 9, 2012, Eyewitness News debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin and Republican challenger Michael Riley. Langevin, asked about energy, said the United States should tap whatever natural resources it can, but added, "The reality is that the United States doesn't have enough of the world's energy supplies to make a real appreciable difference in controlling or bringing down our energy costs. "Under the Obama administration we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before and it really hasn't had much of an impact on bringing down energy prices," he said. We hadn't heard that the United States is producing more energy than ever before. We decided to see if it was true. We asked the Langevin campaign for the source of the candidate's claim. His communications director, Jonathon Dworkin, responded by e-mail that, "The Congressman misspoke when he said 'ever,' as he realized after the debate." "His point was that during the Obama administration, domestic drilling had increased significantly from the years before he took office, going back either 8 or 25 years depending on what you want to measure," said Dworkin. He sent us a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior asserting that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high and an Aug. 27, 2011, chart from The Wall Street Journal showing that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States had risen to 1,069, the highest level since at least 1987, according to data from the oil services company Baker Hughes Inc. We also looked at some of the statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and found that the United States has a long way to go before producing more oil than it ever has. U.S. production of crude oil peaked at nearly 3.52 billion barrels in 1970. In 2011, production was 2.07 billion barrels. That's about 41 percent below the peak. Production bottomed out at 1.83 billion barrels in 2008 -- the last year of the George W. Bush administration -- and has subsequently risen 13 percent. July production was 194 million barrels; aside from last March, that's the highest since May 1998. (Many people assume that when you produce more oil, it lowers prices at the gasoline pump. But the Associated Press compared EIA data on domestic oil production with gasoline prices over the past 36 years and found that there was no link.) But although Langevin's spokesman sent us information about oil prices, Langevin's debate statement was more general, encompassing all energy supplies. We found that if you look at all fossil fuels, not just crude oil, part of Langevin's statement was correct. The United States produced 60.1 quadrillion British thermal units of fossil fuel energy in 2011, more than any year in the EIA database going back to 1949, according to the agency's latest data, which is preliminary. (Using the BTU scale allows a comparison between different types of energy.) Fossil fuel production is higher than ever before because coal production has been rising steadily (except for the past few years) and natural gas production has increased dramatically, in part because companies are using the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to pull more gas from the ground. However, Langevin's statement saying that this happened "under the Obama administration" suggests that the administration was responsible for this trend. As we have stressed in the past, market forces play the biggest role in determining energy production. In this case, high prices for fossil fuels have encouraged production. Our Ruling U.S. Rep. James Langevin, during a discussion that touched on energy policy, said, "Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before." Crude oil production in the United States has, in fact, risen recently after a 38-year decline but it is far from its historic high. However, overall fossil fuel production is the highest it’s ever been, thanks mostly to a sharp increase in natural gas production since 2005. Langevin may have thought he misspoke, but he actually had the larger trend right. What he got wrong was the suggestion that the Obama administration was responsible when, in fact, the role of any administration in such matters is usually limited. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-08462	Says Rick Perry told students he couldn't attend a gubernatorial forum due to scheduling conflicts, then on forum day "tweeted that he'd just been running with his dog."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/14/bill-white/bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-told-students-he-co/	Hoping to engage youth in the political process, students at El Paso's Coronado High School hosted a forum featuring Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White. During the event, which we watched online, White hardly mentioned GOP Gov. Rick Perry, who had declined to participate. Later, however, White questioned Perry's absence. "The students in El Paso high schools had taken the initiative to ask the gubernatorial candidates to talk about voting, civic responsibilities and their visions for Texas," White was quoted saying in an Oct. 5 San Antonio-Express News article. "He told them he had a scheduling conflict and couldn't show up, and while I was answering questions from the students, he tweeted that he'd just been running with his dog around Town Lake," meaning Austin's Lady Bird Lake. Oops. Did Perry out himself playing political hooky? At 12:47 p.m. Sept. 24 — around the time of the El Paso forum, which was scheduled for 11:30 Austin time — Perry tweeted: "Rare AM off to run town lake with Rory....what a great asset the running trails are to Austin." He linked to a photo of a black dog swimming with a stick in its mouth on the south side of the lake. At 2:06 p.m., White tweeted: "Just at student forum; Perry declined for 'scheduling conflict'" and quoted Perry's tweet: "Rare AM off to run town lake..." Asked for an explanation, Catherine Frazier, a Perry spokeswoman, told us that "all of our responses to debate invites have clarified that we would not consider any debates until Bill White released his tax returns for his years of public service." Perry has said he won't debate White until the Democrat makes public his income tax returns for the two years he was deputy U.S. energy secretary and from when he later chaired the Texas Democratic Party. White has released his tax returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor. A story posted the day before the El Paso forum on the website of El Paso's ABC affiliate, KVIA, jibes with the Perry camp's explanation: "Initially, organizers wanted to host a debate between White and incumbent governor Rick Perry. But Perry declined all debate invitations because White has refused to release his tax returns from his time as deputy energy secretary in the mid-1990s." But Katy Bacon, a White spokeswoman, forwarded us two e-mails that she said her boss's campaign received from the students organizing the event. The e-mails suggest the students didn't receive the same pat answer from Perry. In an Aug. 12 e-mail, the students told the White camp that "the campaign for Governor Perry has recently said they are re-evaluating our event. Therefore, while the evaluation process continues, we will be sending the Governor's campaign similar information regarding the proposed agenda for the forum in the event that Governor Perry does attend our event." In an Aug. 18 e-mail, the students confirmed that the forum would take place Sept. 24. They also wrote that "we have recently received word that Governor Perry cannot make the event due to scheduling conflicts, however, we are very excited to continue on with the forum with Mayor White's participation ... Though Governor Perry will not participate, (the) event will remain a nonpartisan effort to educate students on the importance of becoming engaged voters." Gary Berglund, a government and history teacher at the school, said he helped the students organize the event. Berglund told us that the governor's state office did not tell the students that Perry wouldn't attend because White was withholding tax returns. "They couldn't do it due to scheduling conflicts," Berglund said. We asked if any of the exchanges with Perry's camp were in writing. Berglund said the students' discussions with the governor's office were by telephone only. A story posted Sept. 24 on KVIA.com quotes Jackie Wang, one of the students who helped organized the event, saying Perry "had scheduling conflicts, and we understand that, we wanted to work around that but we couldn't." Another organizer, Coronado senior Rachel Jackson, told us this week that she had communicated with the governor's office several times and that a Perry aide had said the governor could not attend because of scheduling conflicts. Jackson then forwarded us a voicemail she said she received Aug. 6 from Ryan Vise, who works in the governor's state scheduling office telling her that Perry wasn't able to make the first date — Sept. 9 — the students put forth. Our transcript: "My name is Ryan Vise, I'm with the Gov. Perry's scheduling office. I'm calling regarding the invitation that was sent in for the debate with Bill White on Sept. 9. Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts, we are not going to be able to attend. We do apologize, but we just cannot make it." Jackson told us that when the students followed up with a date that suited White — Sept. 24 — Perry's office again declined, citing scheduling conflicts. Jackson added: "However, we were aware that in the press there was a battle going on with income taxes." She speculated that the governor's office was "working under the assumption that we knew about the income tax debacle." Jackson stressed to us that the forum was a nonpartisan event to engage students in politics. "The students don't want to be in the middle of 'he-said, she-said' political mudslinging," she said. "We don't want our project to become a tool for some political campaigns." Next, we went back to Frazier, who reiterated that the campaign has consistently said it would consider debate requests only after White released more tax returns. "This debate request was one of the first we got over the summer, and Rob Johnson, our campaign manager, called the group telling them that considering debates was contingent on release of the tax returns," Frazier said. She told us that Perry doesn't distinguish between debates and forums because "they're pretty much the same thing, a Q&A between the candidates." Jackson told us that she did not communicate with Johnson. And the governor's state office? No state officials, including Vise, had responded before we finalized this story. All told, it's undisputed that Perry has often said he's not debating White until he releases more tax returns. However, it looks like there was another message delivered to the student organizers of the Coronado High forum; the saved voice mail — which no one in Perry's office questioned — is persuasive. It's also undisputed that Perry tweeted about his run around Lady Bird Lake (né Town Lake) the morning of the El Paso forum. That's also what White said. In the end, we're mindful that Perry has repeatedly said his unwillingness to debate is based on White not releasing more tax returns, whereas White's statement suggests that Perry would have joined the forum if only he hadn't ginned up the "schedule conflict" excuse. We rate White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-10-14T06:45:04	2010-10-05	['Rick_Perry']

pomt-03294	"Our recent state budgets have far exceeded population and inflation growth."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/01/tom-pauken/tom-pauken-says-recent-state-budgets-have-greatly-/	Gubernatorial candidate Tom Pauken of Port Aransas says that unlike ruling Republicans, he knows how to be tough on spending. In an Austin American-Statesman oped column posted online July 25, 2013, Pauken wrote: "There are a number of areas where I differ with the direction that Texas is headed. Our recent state budgets have far exceeded population and inflation growth. ...I will veto any budget which exceeds that criteria." We’ll take that as Pauken’s promise. And have recent state budgets "far exceeded" inflation and population growth? Pauken’s campaign spokesman, Joe Gimenez, told us by email that Pauken based his claim on a June 7, 2013, Wall Street Journal editorial stating that Texas lawmakers this year agreed to increase spending by a whopping 26 percent, per research by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. We spotted flaws in the foundation’s analysis while recently rating as Mostly True a counter-claim by Gov. Rick Perry that the 2014-15 budget he signed into law did not outpace projected population and inflation growth. The foundation did not contrast the latest two-year budgets. Instead, it compared spending approved by lawmakers in 2013 for the rest of this fiscal year plus spending budgeted for two more years to spending approved by lawmakers and Perry in 2011. For our part, we concluded that general revenue, or state, spending is budgeted to increase no more than 8.7 percent through August 2015. That is less than a 9.85 percent increase in population and inflation projection embraced by legislative leaders before the 2013 session, though officials also have mulled lower population growth/inflation predictions. Most authorities agree it makes sense to focus on general revenue because it’s directly under the Legislature’s control -- it comes from taxes and fees set by the state, not the federal government, and how such revenue is spent also is not controlled by dedications in the Texas Constitution. If the 2014-15 budget isn’t expected to outpace population growth/inflation, what of recent budgets? The latest Fiscal Size-Up report from the advisory Legislative Budget Board, issued in January 2012, includes a chart suggesting that "all funds" spending usually exceeded population and inflation growth from 2002-03 through 2012-13. However, the report’s Figure 22 indicates, general revenue spending usually ran short of population and inflation growth. Specifically, spending of all funds adjusted for population and inflation growth increased as little as 0.4 percent (from 2002-03 to 2004-05) to as much as 9.9 percent (from 2006-07 to 2008-09). All spending adjusted for population and inflation growth went down by nearly 15 percent in 2012-13, according to the chart. By telephone, though, budget board staff spokesman John Barton cautioned that legislative actions in 2013 will soon result in updates to the 2012-13 spending totals, changing the percentage growth. According to the report’s chart, state spending alone, adjusted for inflation and population growth, went up 2.5 percent from 2004-05 to 2006-07 and 10.8 percent from 2006-07 to 2008-09. Conversely, state spending adjusted for population and inflation decreased in four recent budgets: 2002-03 (down 0.3 percent); 2004-05 (down 9.6 percent); 2010-11 (down 5.9 percent); and 2012-13 (down 8.4 percent). The public policy foundation has said that by its calculations, state appropriations have greatly outpaced population growth plus inflation. When its conclusions were aired in 2012, though, the Statesman said in a Nov. 15, 2012, news story that the budget board said the foundation was inflating spending growth by starting its count in 1990, the year before the state’s last major tax increase took effect. The story quoted the budget board as saying that Texas' total budget had increased 176 percent over two decades, but "that number drops to an average rate of 1.5 percent per budget biennium when adjusted for population growth and inflation. In fact, when federal dollars are taken out of the equation, the adjusted state spending has decreased by 2.6 percent over the same period of time, according to a budget board analysis." We asked Lori Taylor, an associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service and an adjunct associate professor in Texas A&M University's Department of Economics, to pinpoint distinctions between the calculations of the foundation and budget board. By email, Taylor said the biggest difference lies "in the way the two sources adjust for population growth. Although people who want to make a political point do it all the time, you shouldn’t just add the inflation rate and the population growth rate and call that the baseline. You should calculate the expenditures per capita and then apply an inflation adjustment like the" Consumer Price Index "to get to the real (i.e. inflation-adjusted) growth in spending." She said if this approach is taken with the foundation figures, the long-term results align with the budget board’s math. Talmadge Heflin, director of the foundation’s Center for Fiscal Policy, had no objections to Taylor’s math, but stood by the foundation’s approach. "Different chefs cook differently," he said by phone. Our ruling Pauken said recent state budgets have far exceeded population and inflation growth. Spending of all funds, which folds in federal aid, exceeded population and inflation growth in five of six recent Texas budgets. Adjusted for those factors, the two-year budgets went up as little as 0.4 percent to nearly 10 percent. And while total spending trailed population growth/inflation in 2012-13, that conclusion could change once number-crunchers account for final spending decisions by the 2013 Legislature. In contrast, state spending alone, over which lawmakers have the most direct control, trailed population growth and inflation in four of the six two-year budgets from 2002-03 through 2012-13--and it’s not expected to exceed inflation/population growth through August 2015. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts giving a more meaningful impression, as Mostly False.

pomt-02548	"The CBO now says the president's health care law will cut the number of full-time jobs in the United States by 2.3 million by 2021."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/05/gretchen-carlson/carlson-cbo-says-obamcare-will-cut-full-time-jobs-/	Ever since the Affordable Care Act passed, Republicans and conservative talk show hosts labeled it as a job killer and in their view, the latest economic report proves their point. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, estimated that 10 years from now, there would be about 2.5 million fewer workers than there otherwise would be. How was that conveyed by the pundits? "The CBO now says the president's health care law will cut the number of full-time jobs in the United States by 2.3 million by 2021," said Gretchen Carlson of Fox News. In the interview that followed, interrupted by a live briefing on the report from the White House, Carlson noted that much of the change stems from people deciding not to work. Carlson then went onto interview U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, where they discussed workers who have a difficult time finding full-time work. But Carlson’s statement is missing an important distinction that the CBO report makes between workers and jobs. (And it’s a mistake we’ve spotted before.) Carlson makes it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don’t create them or they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce. Here are the key quotes from the report: "CBO’s projections of hours worked represent a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024." "The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor." The government analysts basically figured that millions of people will decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more affordable. "It will not represent an increase in either the unemployment rate or the number of unemployed workers," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based academic research center. "Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented." For economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California - San Diego, this result is no surprise. The law gives most of its assistance to people making less money. "Subsidizing insurance for low-income households, and providing Medicaid to the poor, involves reducing the returns to work. As earned income rises, the benefits phase out," Clemens said. The CBO report tracks with that, noting that the voluntary decisions to leave the workforce would be concentrated among lower-paid jobs. Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include actual full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping a job but working fewer hours, keeping one job but quitting a separate, part-time job, or leaving the workforce. And to be clear, the report predicts that total employment will rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. A drop in the number of people who feel they need to work actually could even be a boon to those who remain in the labor force, especially with relatively high unemployment. "Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs," said Burtless. "After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage." Still, the CBO expects the current unemployment rate to remain elevated; it won’t drop below 6 percent until 2017. This is not to say there are no downsides woven into the CBO projections. The labor force participation rate is expected to decline, putting a larger burden on those who remain working. "Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California - Berkeley. As the economy returns to full employment, Burtless expects that there would be a shortage of low-wage workers. "The remaining taxpayers will have to pay slightly higher taxes to finance public health insurance subsidies than they would otherwise have to pay if the work hours of low-wage workers remained unchanged," Burtless said. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to," Sinclair said. "But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing." Our ruling Carlson said that the CBO predicts that Obamacare will cut the number of full-time jobs by 2.3 million. The word "cut" sends the message that jobs are being taken away, but that's not the case. On top of that, the statement confuses the number of jobs with the number of workers, and more specifically, the number of hours worked. The CBO said the health care law will give more people an incentive to reduce their hours; some will limit their hours and some will stop working altogether by their own choice. The law would not push up unemployment. It can be easy to miss the distinction between jobs and workers, but the statement remains flawed. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12600	Says North Carolina's replacement for HB2 "orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/04/caitlyn-jenner/caitlyn-jenner-get-north-carolinas-new-hb2-replace/	Joining the national anger over North Carolina’s new law replacing the controversial House Bill 2 was Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner is perhaps the most famous transgender person in America. So when she began criticizing North Carolina’s new law to her 4 million Twitter followers, people took note. A bipartisan deal between legislators and Gov. Roy Cooper last week got rid of some of HB2’s controversial parts, but it retained two parts of HB2 that Democrats and advocates for LGBT rights have criticized for the past year. Jenner has been among those critics, even though she’s a Republican. And she was not pleased about the compromise. "The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain," she said. There have been exaggerations and falsehoods on both sides of the HB2 debate. We’ve fact-checked many of them. And this claim sounded like a stretch, so we took a look at it. We contacted Jenner’s publicist to help us understand what she meant, but have not heard back. Bathroom rules We’ll tackle Jenner’s claims in reverse order. She ended her post by saying that North Carolina’s "‘bathroom bans’ remain." That seems to be a reference to the provision of HB2 that had banned transgender people in government facilities from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify – and which instead required everyone to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But although Jenner said that ban remains on the books, the opposite is true. The most high-profile change this new law made was getting rid of that part of HB2. In fact, that’s precisely why so many conservative politicians and interest groups opposed the new law. Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said it "leaves the state without a statewide public policy on privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers." (As an aside, we previously found there are virtually no instances of sexual predators using transgender-friendly bathroom laws as cover to commit crimes.) North Carolina has now rejoined 48 other states in having no law about who can use which bathroom. The only outlier now is Washington, which is on the other end of the spectrum and has a transgender-friendly bathroom law. It is possible that Jenner meant this part of her claim as a reference to the new law’s prohibition on state agencies, colleges and school districts regulating access to bathrooms and locker rooms -- which blocks them from creating transgender-friendly policies. But no matter how you interpret it, the fact remains that transgender people are no longer banned from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. There is now simply no law at all on bathroom access. Furthermore, any private business that wants to enact its own transgender-friendly bathroom policies has always been able to do so and still can. And that leads us to the other part of her claim. Mandatory discrimination? "The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020," Jenner said. What the law says is that through Dec. 1, 2020, cities and counties can’t pass local anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations. That means LGBT people won’t be protected from discrimination in North Carolina for at least the next three-plus years, unless the legislature makes another change. But that’s a far cry from ordering cities to discriminate, which this law does not do. No, the mayors of North Carolina are not required to engage in anti-gay behavior, nor must they require businesses in their communities to do the same. Similarly, there’s no federal law protecting LGBT people from workplace discrimination. That doesn’t mean Congress is ordering every company in America to discriminate against gay or transgender people. And most other states also lack these protections, as we found in a previous fact-check. Improvements for gay rights And despite widespread condemnation from LGBT activists, the new law did make some concessions to HB2 opponents. For instance, HB2’s bans on local ordinances were indefinite, but the new bans expire in 2020. It rolled back a provision of HB2 that – as we found in a previous fact-check – might have prohibited cities and counties from protecting even their own employees from anti-LGBT discrimination. There’s no more ambiguity now. Under the new law, if local elected officials want to protect their own local government employees from anti-LGBT discrimination, they can. HB2 had also banned local governments from having certain requirements for would-be contractors – including, for example, a mandate that the contractors have discrimination protections for LGBT people. Now, cities and counties are once more allowed to have those requirements for contractors, according to the UNC School of Government’s Norma Houston – who is an expert in public government contracting – as well as Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman, who said the town’s pro-LGBT contractor ordinance is now back in place. Our ruling After North Carolina replaced HB2, pro-LGBT activists said the compromise was not nearly enough. Caitlyn Jenner, one of the country’s most famous transgender celebrities, took that criticism a step further when she tweeted: "The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain." Neither part of that is correct. The bathroom ban was repealed. And while the new law does continue banning cities and counties from giving LGBT people local discrimination protections, that’s not even close to the same as ordering discrimination. Her statement makes two claims. Neither is accurate, and we rate this claim False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Caitlyn Jenner	None	None	None	2017-04-04T17:00:00	2017-03-31	['None']

Fresh off unveiling a preliminary Fiscal Year 2018 budget that forecasts a deficit of $114 million -- the city’s smallest in 11 years -- Emanuel focused on the sun behind the clouds that have led him to pile on city debt at very high interest rates and cope with a major rating agency downgrading the city’s credit rating to junk bond status.

He repeated the claim on Aug. 9 in an address to the Chicago Investors Conference. Has Emanuel really rid city budget-making of the practices from the days of former Mayor Richard M. Daley that dug the hole from which he’s now trying to lift Chicago? What are these "financial bad management practices?" And, perhaps most important of all, has he set city finances on a distant path to soundness or is he merely trying to perfume a fiscal pig. We decided to check. Worst practices The assertion brought to mind a curious public relations stunt Emanuel trotted out occasionally for the TV cameras in the early months of his administration. He would pose in front of a giant scorecard filled with goals he had set for himself that were then checked off as accomplished. In sum, Emanuel wrote the test and then declared he had aced it. A sense of déjà vu came over us when we contacted the mayor’s Office of Management and Budget for an explanation of Emanuel’s claim to have weeded out the bad old days of city financial management. Spokeswoman Molly Poppe provided an extensive list and explanation of the practices to which Emanuel referred. They were outlined, she said, in a speech Emanuel delivered to The Civic Federation, a government finance watchdog group, on April 29, 2015, three weeks after his election to a second term. * Ending by 2019 the practice of "scoop and toss" in which the city pays short-term expenses with long-term debt; * Ending risky "swaps" in the City’s general obligation debt portfolio; * Converting all of the City’s general obligation variable debt to fixed-rate; * Pay legal settlements from operating funds, rather than with long-term debt * Replenish the city’s "rainy day fund" -- a pool of money maintained to deal with immediate emergencies -- from which $1.2 billion had been removed for operating expenses from 2009 to 2011. Here again, Emanuel is setting his own benchmarks then declaring them met. By that standard at least, there may be merit to the chest-thumping. On the other hand, the suggestion that the mayor has fixed or is fixing "every one" of the bad financial practices he inherited suggests the arrow is pointing up for city finances when a range of other meaningful indicators is still flashing a bright red danger sign. In its analysis of Emanuel’s 2017 budget, the Civic Federation noted that the administration had adhered to its pledge to gradually wean the city from "scoop and toss" borrowing and borrowing to pay legal settlements. The budget "makes significant improvements from its past practices by continuing to reduce ‘scoop and toss’ borrowing by $63 million in FY2017 and incorporating large expenses such as judgements and settlements into its operating budget rather than funding them through borrowing," the Civic Federation reported. Between FY 2015 and FY 2017, "scoop and toss" debt refinancing fell from $225 million to $62 million. "Scoop and toss" is such a bad practice that the audience at the Aug. 9 Chicago Investors Conference burst into applause when Emanuel mentioned in his speech his intent to stop it entirely by 2019. It’s a practice that was used throughout city government to mask operating costs by turning them into long-term debt. The Chicago Tribune described it as "equivalent to taking out a 30-year mortgage to buy a car and making your children — or grandchildren — pay it off, with interest." Whether the 2019 termination target represents a laudable accomplishment or the unnecessary prolonging of the city’s addiction to a terrible fiscal practice is open to debate. "I would have liked to have seen them stopping that practice earlier," said Richard Ciccarone, president and CEO of the municipal finance analysis firm Merritt Research Services and an audience member at Emanuel’s speech. The termination of risky swaps and variable-rate debt are covered in the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for 2015 and 2016. These practices subjected city debt to changing interest rates, much the way variable-rate mortgages affect homeowners. The interest rate is low when the loan is taken out but can skyrocket at any time due to changing market conditions. To avoid borrowing to finance legal settlements and judgments, the city steadily increased the amount it budgeted from $28.7 million in 2012 to $46.7 million this year, Poppe said, allowing the city by 2016 to avoid borrowing for these costs. The city also no longer uses proceeds from the long-term lease of the Chicago Skyway or the infamous parking meter privatization to balance its budget. Since 2012, only interest from those deals has been transferred to the city’s main checking account. The policy has added $40 million to the city’s "rainy day" reserves, a pool of money maintained "to mitigate current and future risks, emergencies, or unanticipated budget shortfalls." The current principal balance is roughly $620 million with an additional $17 million in interest income pending transfer. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Spin cycle On its face, Emanuel’s statement appears to hold up. But face value rarely delivers the whole story in politics, and a deeper look is required here. Clearly, Emanuel intended to convey that city government had turned the page on its long history of irresponsible budget practices. Emanuel first made the claim about ending the bad practices he inherited during his presentation of the city’s 2018 Annual Financial Analysis on July 31. That also was when he noted that the expected $114 million gap was the smallest the city had faced since 2007. (The preliminary budget is an early snapshot of how the next city budget would fare without spending cuts or tax and fee increases, which typically get added on later to bring the real budget into balance.) But the headlines in the days immediately afterward focused on $70 million that was not included in the budget projection but will be spent next year as Emanuel fulfills his promise to add hundreds of officers to the Chicago Police Department. "I should know by now: In dealing with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration, you never take anything at face value because you're always being spun," wrote Crain’s Chicago Business political columnist Greg Hinz after noticing the $70 million omission. Indeed, Emanuel since his earliest days as mayor has displayed a proclivity for downplaying key pieces of information that may punch holes in financial claims. The pledge to break the bad habits we’re discussing here didn’t come until Emanuel won reelection to his second term in April 2015. Less than two weeks later, Moody’s Investors Service dropped the city’s bond rating to junk status, although other rating agencies have not gone that far. Emanuel has stressed that some ratings agencies have upgraded the city’s long term financial outlook from negative to stable. Still, Emanuel’s pledge to change things didn’t come until 18 months after the Chicago Tribune exposed the depth of the city’s fiscal rot in a devastating investigative series titled "Broken Bonds." The Administration’s Annual Financial Analysis explains the mayor’s rationale for leaving out the police costs this way: "In addition to addressing the 2018 operating deficit, the City will move forward with the second year of its two-year hiring plan in the Chicago Police Department and further investments in training, technology and personnel to support police reform efforts by the Administration. This increased cost is not incorporated into the 2018 operating deficit as it is a new investment for the upcoming year, not an existing, structural expense currently in the City’s corporate budget." (Click here and scroll to the section "2018 Corporate Fund Projections" for more detail.) No matter how it’s labeled, the cost of new CPD personnel, along with the official budget gap projection of $114 million, will be borne by Chicago taxpayers. Emanuel has not discussed how the city will close the gap and pay for the new police "investment." Things got even more complicated on Aug. 11, when Chicago Public Schools announced it faces a $269 million shortfall in its 2018 budget and wants the city to fill the gap. And while the city appears to be following Emanuel’s timeline on ending "scoop and toss" by 2019, city taxpayers still are getting hit hard by the practice. Cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools this year relied on it to generate $500 million in operating cash. As the Chicago Tribune noted, city taxpayers ultimately will pay $835 million in interest over the 30-year financing period. That’s a $1.35 billion investment for $500 million in operating capital that will be spent within two years. Technically, CPS is separate from Chicago city government, but Emanuel effectively controls both. Ciccarone noted that city officials "have worked very hard" to ensure that the bond market treats the two as separate entities. This is important because the school district’s finances are in far worse shape than the city’s. Our ruling Emanuel says his administration has either ended or curtailed "every one" of the poor management practices that were in place when he took office in 2011. He described each of those practices in a speech in 2015 and his office provided explanations backed by official data of how each has been addressed. Yet while claiming a new era in good budget practices, the administration used budget-speak to keep the $70 million cost for Year 2 of Emanuel’s police plan out of the "lowest-in-a-decade" preliminary budget gap. Emanuel’s curtailment of expensive "scoop and toss" refinancing is admirable in city government, but it’s of little solace to property taxpayers who still foot the bill for it from Chicago Public Schools. Emanuel indeed inherited significant fiscal headaches from Daley, but fixes he is taking credit for like phasing out scoop and toss were initiated only after the problems were exposed by media investigations. It’s also worth noting that it wasn’t until after Emanuel won election to his second term that a major credit rating agency downgraded the city’s credit to near junk bond status, timing that suggests if nothing else he was slow to act.

pomt-14171	"We knew Strom Thurmond had proposed" the amendment that blocked Puerto Rico’s use of Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/27/john-oliver/mystery-strom-thurmond-puerto-rico-and-bankruptcy-/	Did he or didn’t he? Only the ghost of Strom Thurmond knows for sure. Mystery surrounds whether, back in 1984, the former senator from South Carolina knowingly deprived Puerto Rico of bankruptcy protections that every U.S. state enjoys. It’s crunch time for Puerto Rico. The island territory needs to pay bondholders $422 million on May 1. It doesn’t have the cash, it can’t use bankruptcy to reschedule its payments, and Congress seems unlikely to craft a solution in time to avoid a massive default. During his April 24, 2016, HBO show Last Week Tonight, comedian and social critic John Oliver described the devil’s brew of legal oddities and fiscal recklessness by Puerto Rican officials that brought the island territory of the United States to the financial brink. "If you are massively in debt and you can’t declare bankruptcy, you are stuck," Oliver said. "And this happened because of a tiny amendment to a law in 1984, and the crazy thing is, no one can say why it was written." The tiny amendment Oliver mentioned was stuck in the most boring location one could ever imagine — in the definitions section of HR 5174, a bill geared mainly to fixing the bankruptcy court system. Buried in a long list of changes was the meaning of "state." " 'State' includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title;" That was it. With those two dozen words, the bankruptcy protections that applied to every state, and until 1984, to Puerto Rico, too, were wiped away. "We tried to find out for ourselves why that amendment got attached," Oliver said. "We knew Strom Thurmond had proposed it. So we asked an archivist at the library where his papers are kept to go through the relevant papers, and they came up with nothing." Oliver quipped about that lack of a paper trail, saying it might be the best scenario for Thurmond given his reputation for "fervent racism." Oliver enlivened his diatribe over Puerto Rico's dilemma with a rap performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the son of Puerto Rican parents and the creator and star of the Broadway hit Hamilton. Miranda mentioned Thurmond, too: Somewhere down the line Strom Thurmond's ghost busted a cap at a chance at Chapter 9. Which brings us to the focus of this fact-check: Did Thurmond propose the cunning words that ultimately caught Puerto Rico in a debtor’s vice? Thurmond’s role In a 2015 ruling, the judges of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals provided some very helpful background. In March 1984, the House passed its version of a bankruptcy bill. That version did not have the Puerto Rico exemption. Then on May 21, 1984, the judges wrote that Thurmond introduced the package of changes that included the text at the center of this controversy. "On the day that he introduced the amendment, Senator Thurmond addressed the Senate to explain several of its numerous stipulations, yet said little about the newly added Puerto Rico exemption," the judges wrote. In fact, we went through the Congressional Record for that day (thank you, Internet Archive). Thurmond said less than little. He said nothing. The record shows that after Thurmond’s amendment, the exemption became part of the final legislation. While this seems to point the finger at Thurmond, there’s more to this story. Aside from introducing the overall amendment, Thurmond might not have had much to do with the text. It had been introduced four years before, and not in the Senate, but in the House. Congress’ earlier run at changing the law Experts question whether Thurmond actually understood the significance of the amendment. To see why, we have to go back to 1978. That year, Congress gave the bankruptcy law a complete overhaul. As often happens with major legislation, various gaps and ambiguities emerged and, in 1979, the Senate passed a bill to tidy up the loose ends. Among the dross, the Senate defined states to include Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and any territory or possession of the United States. That legislation moved over to the House, and here the trail becomes murky. Bankruptcy law professor Stephen Lubben at Seton Hall University traced the twists and turns in a 2014 article. "In July 1980, the House Judiciary Committee returned with an ‘amendment’ to the Senate bill that struck the entire Senate text and replaced it with the Judiciary Committee’s desired text, including a new definition of ‘state,’ " Lubben wrote. The House version, under Democratic control, had the Chapter 9 bankruptcy exclusion for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. That bill never passed, but in April 1981, Lubben found that the exclusion language "resurfaced" in the Senate. "This exclusion was never discussed by Congress, at least publicly, and the language apparently simply materialized as a result of the House Judiciary Committee’s extensive revision of the 1979 Senate ‘technical corrections’ bill," Lubben wrote. Lubben told us that the text in Thurmond’s 1984 amendment "was essentially the same language that was kicking around since 1980." "It’s not even clear that the parties even understood what was going on," Lubben said. "The only thing we can say for certain is the change happened without a whole lot of thought behind it." Another factor makes it hard to find Thurmond’s fingerprints on the text that beleaguers Puerto Rico today. The change was never offered as a stand-alone item. It was always bundled with a number of other small changes. Law professor John Pottow at the University of Michigan told us, "Strom Thurmond might have introduced that, but it’s an overstatement to say he played a big role." A final mystery — if you’ve followed the trail this far, you will notice that in 1984, the House version of the bill didn’t have the Puerto Rico exclusion. The logical question is, why was it dropped when the House was the first to add it in 1980? We wish we knew. Our ruling Oliver said "we know that Thurmond proposed" the text that stripped Puerto Rico of the right to let municipalities and public utilities declare bankruptcy. There is no question that Thurmond introduced the amendment with that change. So technically, he did propose it. But there’s no evidence that he came up with the idea, and experts question that he understood the significance of the change that would follow. The statement is accurate but requires some additional information.

pomt-07512	Undocumented students who qualify for in-state Oregon tuition are "actively working toward U.S. citizenship."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/09/michael-denbrow/tuition-equity-supporters-say-undocumented-student/	Among the hot topics of the Oregon Legislature this session is Senate Bill 742, which would grant cheaper in-state tuition to undocumented students brought to the country as children. Supporters say it’s only fair that these high school graduates, who are for all intents and purposes "Oregonians," get a shot at a more affordable state university education. Qualified students would have to meet specific credentials to get in-state tuition. They must have attended a U.S. school for at least five years, attended an Oregon school for three years, and graduated from an Oregon high school. But there is a puzzling final criterion. According to a fact sheet by Oregon Rep. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, the students "are actively working toward U.S. citizenship." Senate Majority Leader Diane Rosenbaum, D-Portland, also says this in a press release: "The students who will benefit from SB 742 have attended a U.S. school for at least five years, graduated from an Oregon high school, and are on the path to citizenship. By allowing a student to stay in Oregon and attend college, we’re keeping some of our best and our brightest in the state." Now we at PolitiFact Oregon understand just enough about federal immigration law to know that applying for citizenship or legal residency as an undocumented person still living in the United States is really tough under current law. So we wanted to find out what it meant to be "actively working toward U.S. citizenship." Let’s turn first to the language of Senate Bill 742, section 2(1)c, which states that the student "shows intention to become a citizen or a lawful permanent resident of the United States by filing an affidavit with the institution of higher education... stating that the student has filed an application to legalize the student’s immigration status, or will file an application as soon as the student is eligible to do so." Well, filing an affidavit with the Oregon University System does not mean that that person is actively working toward citizenship. Sorry,that’s not a step in the onerous process to achieve legal status. Now let’s look at the process if you are undocumented and in the country illegally, but you want to apply for U.S. citizenship. For that, we turned to Sharon Rummery, a longtime spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Rummery says there are a few ways an "out of status" person could seek to become a permanent resident and then apply for citizenship. The person could apply for political asylum. The person could be petitioned by an immediate family member who is here legally. Or the person could be petitioned by a potential employer who swears that he or she can’t find a legal resident or citizen to do the job that’s open. (That’s called an H-1B visa -- and frankly, it’s used by high-tech companies to get more skilled engineers and programmers to the United States; those, and fashion models.) Also, here’s the kicker from Rummery, which shows why it’s so daunting for undocumented students: Even if these petitions are made, "you still can't get permanent resident status without leaving the U.S. If you've been here out of status for more than a year, you'll be subject to a 10-year bar on returning." There's a waiver to the 10-year bar, but in most cases, you have to leave the country to apply for that waiver. David Leopold, national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, attests to the difficult position these students are in. "Other than some minor, minor, some very narrow exceptions, it’s not legally possible to put somebody on a pathway to citizenship who is undocumented," he said. Dembrow, in defense, argues a broader definition of the phrase. "‘On the path to citizenship’ simply means that they have begun the process of seeking citizenship," he wrote in an email. "By signing an affidavit and swearing their intention to put themselves through the complicated, lengthy process, they have started that journey." Tell that to USCIS. Look, we realize that immigration law is full of unique situations and exemptions, and we know that the law can change. In other words, just because it’s difficult for undocumented students to get legal status now -- which is why some in Oregon want tuition equity -- doesn’t mean they can’t get legal status in the future. The federal Dream Act, which failed in Congress last year, would have granted a way for those students here illegally to become U.S. citizens. But the federal Dream Act is not Oregon’s Tuition Equity Bill and for supporters to claim that these students are all "actively working toward" or "on the path" toward citizenship is misleading. To sign an affidavit that the student will file an application as soon as the student is eligible to do so is essentially meaningless for most students. Unless students are already in the process of applying for citizenship, which might be the case for some, the moment where they are eligible likely will never come for most undocumented students under current law. There’s an element of truth -- signing an affidavit indicates some intention on the part of the student who hasn’t yet applied -- but it’s nowhere near the same as applying for legal status with USCIS. We rate this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06764	"Since I introduced my budget -- first budget -- in March of 2010, we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs for the people of this state."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/21/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-he-introduced-his-first-bu/	For the governor of New Jersey, even a walk on the beach is political. During a boardwalk stroll in Belmar on Aug. 10, Gov. Chris Christie responded to criticism of his environmental policies from Assemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex), put to him by NJTV’s Michael Aron. "It is election time and Mr. McKeon needs to have something to say in a state where since I introduced my budget -- first budget -- in March of 2010, we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs for the people of this state," Christie said. "Where we already have seen that we are beyond the air quality goals that were set by the Corzine administration, Michael. So you should go back and ask Assemblyman McKeon that." PolitiFact New Jersey checked the private-sector jobs statistic. Christie’s number is mostly right. But did the introduction of Christie’s first budget play into that increase? As one state policy expert said, "the burden of proving [that] is rather difficult." We’ll start with the numbers. Christie introduced his first budget in the middle of March, but we’ll look at the whole month since the numbers aren’t broken down further. At the time Christie made his statement, the latest numbers publicly available were preliminary statistics from June 2011. According to that seasonally-adjusted data, the state had added 42,100 private-sector jobs since March 2010. However, on Aug. 18, the state labor department released revised numbers for June and preliminary numbers for July. According to the updated figures, from March 2010 to June 2011, the state added 48,000 private-sector jobs. If you include July 2011, the state has added 51,900 private-sector jobs since March 2010. With any of the data sets, the governor’s point is largely on the mark. But how much can the governor take credit for that increase in private-sector jobs? When we asked the governor’s office to explain how the introduction of Christie’s first budget sparked private-sector job growth, a spokesman, Kevin Roberts, told us in an email, "I think you are reading the Governor’s statement incorrectly, as he is clearly using that as a marker in time." But Roberts then said it’s a "worthwhile marker" because it "represented a break from the old way of doing things in Trenton." And since the introduction of the budget, Christie has "built a record of restoring fiscal responsibility and sanity, providing businesses and families much-needed certainty that we will not raise taxes, and providing targeted tax cuts to improve the state’s business climate and create jobs." An economist from a conservative think tank and a senior vice president at the New Jersey Business and Industry Association mostly agreed with Roberts’ assessment of the impact of the governor’s first budget. Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it’s impossible to argue with complete confidence that the introduction of the governor’s budget had a direct effect on private-sector jobs, but it’s not unreasonable. She said the governor’s efforts to "curb spending growth, cut business taxes and provide certainty about economic policies going forward are certainly things that are likely to provide some degree of confidence to firms about the reliability of investing in the state and are likely to spur job creation." But a handful of experts from other policy thinks tanks said the process of private-sector job creation is complicated and even if changes in government policy had a direct impact, it would take longer than a year and half to see any effects. "It isn’t clear a specific governor can take a lot of credit for the new jobs," said Kim Rueben, who directs the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "I think governors and state governments can change the climate but in general there has been little research showing specific programs (or economic development credits) have actually led to job creation." Bob Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government, said, "for better or worse, most of what has happened in New Jersey’s economy in the last 18 months reflects conditions that were already in place. Any state policy changes since then are unlikely to have had a dramatic impact on job totals." The ruling Christie tied the introduction of his first budget to increased private-sector employment in the state, saying that since March of last year, "we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs." His statistic is mostly correct. But his underlying point that the introduction of his budget spurred that job growth, according to most of the experts we spoke with, is a stretch. We couldn’t fully blame Christie’s budget if the state lost private-sector jobs, and we can’t fully credit Christie’s budget when the state gains private-sector jobs. We rate the governor’s claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-08-21T09:11:38	2011-08-10	['None']

pomt-04707	Says Barack Obama is a Muslim.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/sep/04/hank-williams-jr/hank-williams-jr-says-barack-obama-muslim/	Country singer Hank Williams Jr., who prides himself on being politically incorrect, took a moment during a Sept. 2, 2012, concert in Fort Worth to hammer misgivings about President Barack Obama. As reported by critic Thor Christensen, who reviewed Williams’ performance at the Stockyards Music Festival for the Dallas Morning News, Williams said to a less-than-unanimous cheer: "We’ve got a Muslim for a president who hates cowboys, hates cowgirls, hates fishing, hates farming, loves gays, and we hate him!" Most everything in the singer’s statement shakes out as matters of opinion, which can’t be fact-checked. PolitiFact also did not wade in after Williams compared Obama golfing with House Speaker John Boehner to Adolf Hitler playing with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. (After Williams made that October 2011 analogy, he no longer sang the theme song for ESPN’s "Monday Night Football.") However, his reference to Obama as a Muslim struck us as factually checkable. Such claims also have been gauged before -- and found lacking in evidence. As PolitiFact noted in an Aug. 26, 2010, story, the president’s memoirs and independent biographies indicate that Obama was not raised in a particular faith, but he became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Still, Obama had a Muslim grandfather, Hussein Onyango of Kenya, and his Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soetero, was Muslim, as biographer Davis Maraniss has written. Also, as a boy Obama was instructed in Islam at a school in Jakarta. Later, Maraniss writes, many of Obama’s college friends were Muslim. In a July 27, 2012, opinion article in The Washington Post, Maraniss said: "None of this adds up to Obama being Muslim, except in the minds of conspiratorialists." His article continues: "Obama never met his Kenyan grandfather. After infancy, he spent time with his Kenyan father only once, and in any case Barack Obama Sr. was an atheist. The truth is that Muslims had nothing to do with the rise of the Obamas of Kenya and that conservative evangelical Christians were essential every step of the way," Maraniss said. "It was proselytizing Seventh-day Adventists who first came to the Obamas’ villages out near Lake Victoria at the start of the 20th century. They taught English and Western ways to the first wave of young boys from the Luo tribe, including Hussein Onyango. His son, the president’s father, was also educated at a missionary school. "Later, as a young adult, Barack Obama Sr. was mentored by a remarkable evangelical Christian, Betty Mooney, whose grandfather was one of the founders of Texas Christian University. Mooney, who went to Kenya in the late 1950s to spread the gospel and literacy, met Obama Sr. in Nairobi and hired him to translate some of her literacy books into the Luo tribal language. She encouraged and helped sponsor his coming to the United States and specifically to the University of Hawaii, where he met Stanley Ann Dunham," the president’s mother. "One can say that President Obama would not exist except for evangelical Christians." Maraniss said that while "living in Jakarta from ages 6 through 9, young Obama temporarily took the last name of his stepfather, Soetoro, for school purposes. He was listed as a Muslim on school documents because students were listed in the religion of their fathers." Referring to Obama’s stepfather and his mother, Maraniss continues: "Lolo was not particularly religious; Stanley Ann was spiritual but not part of any formal religion. For most of his three-plus years in Indonesia, Obama attended a Catholic grade school. When his family moved to a better neighborhood in his final year, he went to the local grade school, one of the best in the city. The central doctrine taught at S.D. Besuki was not Islam but Pancasila, or five principles, of modern Indonesia, which evoked the unity of the islands on the vast archipelago, social justice and a belief in one God. Conservative Muslims detested Pancasila (a Sanskrit word revealing Indonesia’s Hindu heritage), insisting that it was too liberal and open to too many religions and interpretations." Obama has said that as a young adult, the churches in Chicago impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. "It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith," Obama said in a 2006 speech. "It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth." The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in his 2008 campaign, after video of some of Wright's more provocative sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. "Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often," journalist David Mendell wrote in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power. After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended to find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington, D.C., area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. More recently, the White House posted a photo of the president and his family walking to St John’s on Aug. 19, 2012. In April 2010, Obama hosted an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House and spoke of being inspired by Christ's resurrection, particularly in light of the human failings of selfishness and pride. "It's not easy to purge these afflictions, to achieve redemption," Obama said. "But as Christians, we believe that redemption can be delivered -- by faith in Jesus Christ. And the possibility of redemption can make straight the crookedness of a character, make whole the incompleteness of a soul. Redemption makes life, however fleeting here on Earth, resound with eternal hope." Obama also gave remarks at the April 2012 Easter prayer breakfast at the White House, saying the day was "an opportunity for us to reflect on the triumph of the resurrection and to give thanks for the all-important gift of grace. And for me, and I’m sure for some of you, it’s also a chance to remember the tremendous sacrifice that led up to that day, and all that Christ endured -- not just as a Son of God, but as a human being." Obama also said that the struggle to fathom Christ’s "unfathomable sacrifice makes Easter all the more meaningful to all of us. It helps us to provide an eternal perspective to whatever temporal challenges we face. It puts in perspective our small problems relative to the big problems He was dealing with. And it gives us courage and it gives us hope. We all have experiences that shake our faith. There are times where we have questions for God’s plan relative to us," Obama said, drawing laughter, "but that’s precisely when we should remember Christ’s own doubts and eventually his own triumph." Our ruling Obama is not a Muslim. This has been clear for years. This claim sets the woods Pants on Fire.

pomt-15013	Pope Francis uses a modest compact car to get around, while Creflo Dollar drives an expensive sports car.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/07/viral-image/creflo-dollar-pope-francis-and-their-rides/	The image that showed up the PolitiFact Georgia inbox had already pinged wildly around social media. The top part showed the Pope waving from the back seat of the small four-door Fiat 500L. Below it was a photo of a driver purported to be College Park megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar, tooling in a shiny silver roadster with an EU license plate. The reader wondered, could that actually be the lead pastor of World Changers Church International behind those sunglasses, zipping along somewhere in Europe? We wondered too, and decided to do some digging. Breaking down the rides That the top part of the meme was accurate was clear from news coverage, and the social media response, during Pope Francis’ recent visit to the United States. The Pope made news for what he said but also for his use of the Italian-made subcompact car. News reports said Vatican police, not the Holy See, selected the car, which has a starting list price of $19,935. But they did so on Francis’ specific request of modesty and simplicity for his ride. Determining who was behind the wheel in the roadster proved more of a challenge. Dollar is a recognizable face who has made his own headlines, most recently from a fundraising video to help his ministry buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 luxury jet. Though the church removed the video after a backlash, the church’s board of directors later said it still intended to replace Dollar’s jet with the Holy Grail of luxury jets. "We plan to acquire a Gulfstream G650 because it is the best, and it is a reflection of the level of excellence at which this organization chooses to operate," the directors said in a prepared statement. So, the idea of Dollar photographed in a sports car didn’t seem all that outlandish. But with the shades covering much of the driver’s face, it was hard to tell just who was behind the wheel. Focusing on the car, though, brought the navigator into much clearer view. We sent the image to Jim Donnelly and Tom Comerro, the senior editor and editorial assistant, respectively at Hemmings Motor News. The official word from the bible for car collectors: the silver roadster is a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Stirling Moss edition. Only 75 of the vehicles were produced, with a starting list price in 2009 of 750,000 Euros, or north of $1 million for a supercharged ride that could reach 217 miles per hour with no windshield. Searching for who has access to that ride led us to a similar picture, of a different angle and a driver with the sunglasses off. That’s not a reverend driving the $1 million car. The driver is rapper Kanye West, whose nickname Yeezus is a clear play on the name for the son of God, arriving at a gala in Cannes, France. (You can see a more clear photo of Kanye as the driver here). Modesty and prosperity Simply put, the image itself is flat-out wrong. And what about the context of those 1,000 words the picture is trying to say? Much has been made of the "simplicity" sought by Pope Francis ever since he took a vow of poverty as a Jesuit priest. He took the subway as a cardinal in Argentina and news reports say he humbles himself in either a Ford Focus or a 1984 Renault when getting around the Vatican. Dollar, meanwhile, is well-known for preaching the "prosperity gospel," which says that God wants all believers to do well in all aspects of their lives, including finances. Dollar listed two Rolls Royces – one paid for by his congregation and another by members of his ministerial association of those pastors he has trained – in a 2007 congressional inquiry into the tax-exempt status of a handful of such megachurches. World Changers spokesman Vic Bolton said Dollar no longer uses those $250,000 automobiles and instead drivers a regular Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan (which new lists for $96,000) that’s about 8-10 years old (in the $65,000 range). "It’s a nice car, but it’s no Aston Martin," Bolton said. "I don’t think he drives a Mercedes to send a message. He drives a nice car because that’s what he wants. True prosperity is having options." The same could be said about Pope Francis. The Catholic Church, too, is mum about its wealth. But a 2014 report found hundreds of millions of Euros tucked away, off the official church balance sheet. And the Vatican bank manages $7.3 billion in assets and keeps $20 million in gold reserves in the U.S. Federal Reserve. That is enough to buy and sell more than a few of those fancy roadsters. So the real difference – beyond the scale of wealth – is between the ideologies of those Christian faiths, said Kate Bowler, a professor of American Christianity at Duke Divinity School in North Carolina. The Catholic Church is heavily collective, with a focus on the church’s responsibility as a group. In the prosperity gospel, responsibility falls entirely to the right-believing individual. Often, the proof of that belief shows up in flashy cars or extravagant churches, such as the 8,500-seat World Changers dome that has become a landmark in College Park. But Bowler said the faith encourages family connections and community connections as truly prosperous, as well as focusing on sharing the gospel so that others may find that success. "It doesn’t really matter if it’s not true," Bowler said of the meme, "because it does capture the essence of a faith that requires proof of wealth to be true." That means Kanye West being confused for Creflo Dollar adds to, not diminishes, his message, she added. "I don’t think Creflo would mind at all," she said. "He’s a victor and that language of triumph and the wealthy car demonstrates to believers that God is with them." Our ruling A viral image making its way around social media purports to show Pope Francis getting around town in a small compact sedan, while Georgia’s megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar zips along in a stylish two-seater sports car. The roadster driver is actually rapper Kanye West, making the image clearly false. Even the context – trying to draw distinction between a supposedly humble servant of God with an apparently audacious one – ignores that both the Pope and Dollar have ready access to lavish luxuries.

pomt-03485	Says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/jun/11/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-two-thirds-groups-targeted-irs/	Amid fallout from the IRS’s admission that it improperly targeted conservative groups, Democratic-leaning Progress Texas suggested the agency’s net was cast wider, tweeting that "2/3 of groups scrutinized were not conservatives." That May 31, 2013, statement wasn’t the first time the nonprofit advocacy group made such a claim; a May 17 post on its website said, "Two-thirds of those groups that received extra scrutiny from the IRS were not conservative." Context: The IRS apologized May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included "tea party," "patriot" or "9/12." The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. Since then, groups of varied political stripes including Progress Texas have spoken up to say their own applications drew extra scrutiny. We asked how Progress Texas concluded that most of the groups were not conservative. Political director Phillip Martin told us by email that the statement was based on a May 12, 2013, Washington Post news story about a leaked report from the U.S. Treasury inspector general that the government released two days later. The Post story said that according to the report, "Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny ... 72 had ‘tea party’ in their title, 13 had ‘patriot’ and 11 had ‘9/12.’ " That equaled 96 groups, Martin said, or 32.2 percent of the declared 298. Were the other 202 groups nonconservative? Neither the report nor the story described those groups, and Progress Texas did not reply to our follow-up requests for relevant information. The IRS said in a May 15, 2013, press release that the groups without "tea party" in their names "included organizations of all political views." Precisely what happened from May 2010 through May 2012 at the agency’s Cincinnati, Ohio, office, where all such tax-exemption applications are processed, has not become clear. But according to the inspector general’s report, IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants’ political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives. For instance, the report says staffers were asked to flag groups educating Americans about the Constitution, which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. According to the report, the IRS criteria included: "Political-sounding" names such as ‘We the People’ or ‘Take Back the Country’ " "Issues include government spending, government debt or taxes" "Education of the public by advocacy/lobbying to ‘make America a better place to live’ " "Statement in the case file criticize(s) how the country is being run" "Political, lobbying, or [general] advocacy" activities Involved in "limiting/expanding government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform/movement" "Indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention" In U.S. House hearings May 17 and 22, 2013, lawmakers questioned acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and the Treasury’s inspector general, J. Russell George, about the 202 unlabeled groups. On May 22, Miller said that "202 non-Tea Party cases... were reviewed for indications of significant political campaign intervention, which was our key criteria," helping to determine whether a group’s activities affected its eligibility for the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) designations. "We did not evaluate whether or not they were conservative groups, or -- or progressive groups, or liberal groups, or whatever term you want to use," Miller said. Asked May 17 whether liberal buzz words such as "progressive" or "organizing" also were used to identify groups for scrutiny, Miller said they were not. IRS employees, Miller said May 17, were grouping similar applications together for efficiency. The method they used, he said, "while intolerable, was a mistake and not an act of partisanship." George said his report did not break out the political makeup of the 202 groups because it looked only at the names of the organizations: "Certain names were so generic that we were unable to determine whether or not they had a particular point of view." A full breakdown of the scrutinized groups, or even types of groups, might not surface. On May 20, 2013, Senate Finance Committee leaders asked the IRS for information including the names of the 298 targeted groups; they had not received the names as of June 6, 2013, committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless told us via email. Our ruling Progress Texas has twice said that two-thirds of the groups whose applications for tax-exempt status were scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative. The group’s fraction appears to be an unsupported assumption tied to a government report saying that 96 of 298 IRS-scrutinized organizations, or about a third, had "tea party," "patriot" or "9/12" in their names. The report listed other criteria the IRS used, some of which appeared to be aimed at conservatives. But the report has no information on the political makeup of the other groups, and we see no other indications that their political leanings have been authoritatively summed up or individually revealed, though the IRS has said the scrutinized groups without "tea party" in their names reflected "all political views," which presumably would fold in liberals to moderates to conservatives. Progress Texas’ claim shakes out as incorrect and, given the lack of backup documentation, ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Progress Texas	None	None	None	2013-06-11T18:40:06	2013-05-31	['None']
pomt-11950	Says Sen. Dianne Feinstein said "if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/08/chris-cox/nras-chris-cox-falsely-says-dianne-feinstein-wante/	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has offered a bill to ban bump fire stocks after police found 12 rifles equipped with these devices in the Las Vegas festival shooter’s hotel room. In a significant policy shift, Republicans and the National Rifle Association have said they believe that the government should intervene and regulate this kind of equipment, which allows semi-automatic weapons to fire over and over again without forcing the shooter to do all the work of squeezing the trigger repeatedly. On Fox News Sunday, NRA-Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox drew a sharp line between his group’s stance and what he sees as the underlying Democratic agenda. "I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it," Cox told host Chris Wallace Oct. 8. Cox is off target, because he said Feinstein said she wanted to take away all guns. In reality, back in 1995, Feinstein said she wanted to take away all assault rifles. That’s a huge difference. While firm numbers are lacking, assault weapons represent a fraction of the country’s estimated total of 310 million guns. We reached out to the National Rifle Association and did not hear back, but Cox was repeating a charge that has been leveled against Feinstein before. In the past, it tracked back to an interview she did in 1995. What Feinstein said Feinstein was a driving force behind the 1994 federal assault weapons ban. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. Those restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons made before the ban’s effective date Sept. 13, 1994. (Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004.) In a Feb. 5, 1995 segment on CBS News’ 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl explored the surge in sales that preceded the ban. Stahl cited government estimates that as many 1.5 million weapons were in circulation due to the exception carved out in the law. Stahl said Feinstein told him in an interview that she didn’t want that, but had done the best that should could. "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it," Feinstein told Stahl. "I could not do that. The votes weren’t here." Feinstein repeated that message in a speech on the Senate floor a few months later: "If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that. This is a moderate law." Her words have always applied to assault weapons, not all firearms. In a 2012 op-ed, she wrote "Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right." And in proposing to ban bump stocks, Feinstein said her bill "does not take anyone's gun." She also said she remains committed to some form of a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. Both the total number of firearms and assault-style weapons in the country remain unclear. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 2009, the country had about 310 million firearms: "114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns." In 2013, pro-Second Amendment rights attorney David Hardy said in Senate testimony that nearly 9 million people went target shooting with an AR-15-style weapon. (AR-15 refers to one of the more common styles of the banned weapons.) Hardy used figures from the National Shooting Sports Foundation that showed in 2012 that only about a quarter of shooters owned an AR-style weapon. Based on that, 9 million would be a high-end estimate of the number of assault weapons owned in 2012. Set against a total number of firearms in excess of 300 million, assault weapons are not a large share of all guns. Our ruling Cox said that Feinstein had once said "if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America , turn in all of your guns,' they would do it." This is an inaccurate characterization of what Feinstein said in a 1995 interview on assault-type weapons. It is clear in context about loopholes in the 1994 assault weapon ban that Feinstein would have liked the ban to apply to all assault weapons but did not have the votes. That is a far cry from banning all firearms, and Feinstein has said she supports the right of people to own a weapon for hunting or self-defense. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13446	In Georgia, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/sep/16/jim-barksdale/barksdale-claim-wage-gap-lacks-context/	The so-called gender pay gap has reared its head in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race. Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson is being challenged by Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley in the race, which polls indicate Isakson is leading. Barksdale hopes a strong turnout by women voters in a year in which Hillary Clinton is running to become the first woman president will boost his chances. And he makes a direct appeal to them on his campaign website. "We cannot continue to have women paid fractions compared to their male counterparts," Barksdale states on the site. "In Georgia, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and for women of color the disparities are even more stark. The wage gap is a real economic crisis and has to be addressed by our elected leaders in Washington." PolitiFact and PolitiFact Georgia have reviewed the gender pay gap on numerous occasions. But Barksdale’s numbers are a bit different, so we decided to take a look. Specifically we wanted to look at his 82-cents comparison with men’s earnings. We contacted the Barksdale campaign about the website claim and campaign spokeswoman Emily Oh responded with an email. "Jim Barksdale believes that Georgian women need a pay raise and equal pay for equal work would be economically beneficial to Georgia and the country as a whole," she wrote. The gender pay gap has become something of a rallying cry in political circles. It usually goes something like this: Women earn 77 cents on the dollar for doing the "same work" as a man. But that figure, derived from U.S. Census figures, is highly problematic when politicians wrap campaign slogans around it. In his 2012 re-election run, an ad for President Barack Obama claimed "Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." PolitiFact rated that statement Mostly False. Obama retooled his words in his 2014 State of the Union address, saying women "still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That statement rated Mostly True. The difference in the president’s two statements is subtle but important. The 77-cent figure does not apply to men and women who do the same job. It was never intended to be a measure of equal pay for equal work. Instead it refers to the average disparity between the total of what men and women earn, period. All women’s earnings compared to all men’s earnings. In reality, the gender pay gap diminishes substantially when men and women of the same age, experience and education do the same job. It still exists, but diminishes to the low single digits. But there is indeed a wage gap based on gender. It exists for many reasons besides overt discrimination, experts point out. Women tend to take more time off for unpaid child-rearing responsibilities. Men tend to work more overtime. And men often pursue jobs in the high-paying science, technology, engineering and math-related professions. A wage gap exists in every part of the United States, PolitiFact Georgia found in an earlier fact-check, ranging from a low of 66.6 cents in Wyoming to a high of 90 cents in Washington, D.C., in 2010. But if broken down by narrow groups, research shows single, childless women in their 20s in major metro areas outearned male peers, specifically in Atlanta by 21 percent and by 12 percent in Los Angeles. We contacted the Barksdale campaign about the Democrat’s claim than women in Georgia make only 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Those numbers are attributed to the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group that promotes "fairness in the workplace, reproductive health and rights, access to quality, affordable health care, and policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family." That group got its information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s one-year American Community Survey. And that survey shows women who work full time, year-round in Georgia are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, said Vicki Shabo, the group’s vice president. That figure is calculated based on median annual pay. But it is not an attempt to measure equal pay for equal work. "Median annual pay for a woman who holds a full-time, year-round job in Georgia is $36,468 while median annual pay for a man in Georgia who holds a full-time, year-round job is $44,623," Shabo wrote in an email. Our ruling Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jim Barksdale that women in Georgia only earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Technically, that is true for full-time workers as a very broad measure. But the statement is missing substantial context needed to fully grasp a very complex issue. When asked for clarification, Barksdale's campaign issued a statement that veered into the equal-pay-for-equal-work argument, something the study behind the statement did not attempt to address. Barksdale’s statement is accurate but misleading. We rate it Half True.	None	Jim Barksdale	None	None	None	2016-09-16T06:00:00	2016-09-15	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']

pomt-06152	"I've done more impeachments than anybody else in the history of the country."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/19/jim-sensenbrenner/gop-wisconsin-rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-hes-done-/	U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was so incensed at U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder during a Dec. 8, 2011 congressional hearing he threatened to invoke the political death penalty. Impeachment. Removal from office by Congress is so extreme, and so rare, we thought it applied only to presidents and federal judges. But it also can be imposed on "civil officers" -- possibly including, as Sensenbrenner suggested, Department of Justice officials. Sensenbrenner used the House Judiciary Committee hearing to chastise Holder for not providing more information about the Fast and Furious gun program, which has been the target of Republican criticism. For the suburban Milwaukee congressman to raise the specter of impeachment was extraordinary. But so was another comment Sensenbrenner made in issuing his threat when he declared: "I've done more impeachments than anybody else in the history of the country." Now, we know Sensenbrenner has served in the House since the song "My Sharona" was a No. 1 hit in 1979. But many congressional representatives have served longer tenures and impeachment has been done for more than 200 years. So, let’s go back and see whether Sensenbrenner has done the most impeachments -- and review some tales of officials behaving badly along the way. We’ll start with what got Sensenbrenner so riled up, then dig into impeachment. Fast and Furious Operation Fast and Furious, as described by The New York Times, was a federal investigation from late 2009 to early 2011 into an Arizona-based gun-trafficking network. ''Straw buyers'' bought guns, which were smuggled to Mexican drug cartels. Hundreds of guns were lost and two were found near the scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in December 2010. A week after the hearing in which Sensenbrenner threatened impeachment, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., announced that 75 House members, including Sensenbrenner, had signed a no-confidence resolution against Holder. Gosar cited Fast and Furious in his announcement. Impeachment explained Impeachment is a mechanism for removal of the president, vice president and other unspecified federal "civil officers" found to have engaged in "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors," according to the Congressional Research Service. Under the Constitution, the House determines whether someone should be impeached. If the House votes to impeach -- in other words, to file charges -- the matter goes to the Senate for trial. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, but removal from office requires only a majority vote. There is no appeal. At trial, several House members serve as prosecutors who are called "managers." Sensenbrenner argues he has done more impeachments than anyone based on his role as a manager in four of the 19 impeachment trials that have been conducted since 1799. The 19 trials, according to a Senate summary, included two presidents -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, both of whom were acquitted -- a Supreme Court justice, 14 federal judges, one secretary of war and a senator. The reasons for impeachment varied widely, as is made clear by these cases involving federal judges who were impeached and convicted: John Pickering of New Hampshire, impeached in 1804 for presiding over a trial "in a state of total intoxification"; West Humphreys of Tennessee, in 1862 for adovcating secession.; and Alcee Hastings of Florida, in 1989 for conspiring to obtain a $150,000 bribe from two mob-connected felons. As for Sensenbrenner, he was a manager in Clinton’s impeachment trial and in trials involving three federal judges. President Bill Clinton: Clinton was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in 1999 in connection with his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but was acquitted of the charges by the Senate. The verdicts capped a 13-month ordeal, including a five-week trial. Walter Nixon of Mississippi: Nixon was removed from the federal bench in 1989 and convicted of two counts of lying to a grand jury about talking with a county prosecutor about a marijuana smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy contractor. He earlier was convicted of perjury in criminal court and was sentenced to five years in prison. Samuel Kent of Texas: The Senate dismissed its impeachment proceedings in 2009 after Kent resigned from the bench. Kent’s resignation came shortly after he received a 33-month prison sentence for pleading guilty to lying to judicial investigators about sexually assaulting two female employees. Thomas Porteous of Louisiana: The Senate convicted Porteous in December 2010 on charges that included receiving cash and favors from lawyers who had dealings in his court, and using a false name to elude creditors. He was removed from office. In backing Sensenbrenner’s claim, spokeswoman Amanda Infield provided a list of the managers who prosecuted the 19 impeachments. The Library of Congress told us it has no record that compiles the managers. So we checked Sensenbrenner’s sources and consulted others, including House and Senate documents. Our verdict Many House members have served as a manager in one or two impeachments. Texas Democrat Hatton Sumners managed three during his 34-year House career, which ended in 1947. But only Sensenbrenner has managed four impeachments. We rate his statement True.	None	Jim Sensenbrenner	None	None	None	2011-12-19T09:00:00	2011-12-08	['None']
pomt-13402	"Most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today"	true	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/23/andrew-cuomo/buffalo-has-more-private-sector-jobs-ever/	New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo two weeks ago toured a sprawling solar panel factory the state paid to have built in Buffalo and said, "I am just blown away by this facility." Cuomo returned to Buffalo on Friday, a day after U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced bombshell corruption allegations that included bid rigging to build the plant at RiverBend for SolarCity. The criminal charges won’t stop Buffalo’s resurgence, Cuomo said in his remarks at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. He cited completion of the $750 million facility as a milestone in the state’s Buffalo Billion economic development initiative, which he said "is working because the private sector believes in Buffalo again." Cuomo defended the state’s investments in Buffalo with a claim about the number of private jobs in the Buffalo region. "Most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today," Cuomo said. Cuomo has devoted his time and the state’s resources on upstate revitalization. Is he right? Does Buffalo have more private sector jobs than ever before? Private sector jobs Neither the state nor the U.S. Department of Labor tracks the number of jobs for the city of Buffalo alone. Instead, they break the state up into regions, including the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The state and national labor departments both show the same numbers for private sector jobs. But information is available only back to 1990. The way job data is compiled changed in 1990, so the figures from the past 25 years can't be accurately compared with the numbers before 1990. The federal and state labor departments reported 479,500 private sector jobs in August in the Buffalo Niagara region. There were 439,000 jobs in 1990. The closest the Buffalo area came to the August jobs number before Cuomo took office was in November 2000, when the state reported 474,700 private sector jobs. Private sector jobs in June and July of this year exceeded that number, but still fell below the August number. Our ruling During Cuomo’s remarks in Buffalo, he said the "most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today." Data from the federal and state labor departments back up his claim. There are more private sector jobs in Buffalo today than any other time dating back to at least 1990. The data doesn’t prove his policies and economic development projects are responsible for the increase. But we rate his claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a3b65649-df87-4209-b2b6-41b9c7676fd6	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2016-09-23T20:07:31	2016-09-23	['Buffalo,_New_York']
pomt-07401	On whether the federal debt limit should be raised	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/29/barack-obama/obama-regrets-2006-vote-against-raising-debt-limit/	"America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America’s debt limit." -- Sen. Barack Obama, March 16, 2006 "Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. . . . (Raising the limit is) important for the country." -- President Barack Obama, April 15, 2011 As elected officials continue to grapple with the federal budget, another important vote is coming up: The vote to increase the debt ceiling. The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says it must be raised by May 16 to allow the government to keep up with its obligations. The Treasury can juggle accounts until July, but after that, options run out. We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged. Still, it's critical for the United States to keep paying its debts and experts say failure to do so could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets. The Obama administration has been pushing hard to have a debt limit vote approved, and the earlier the better. Officials say a drawn-out process could spook international financial markets. (See our story for a more in-depth discussion of the debt limit vote.) The votes -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing, and President Barack Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush. "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills," Obama said. The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. Back in January, the White House was asked about Obama's comments from 2006. Robert Gibbs, then the White House press secretary, said the outcome of the vote wasn't in doubt. "The full faith and credit of our government and our economy was not in doubt, and the president used it to make a point about needing to get serious about fiscal discipline," Gibbs said. "(But) the ultimate bottom line is we shouldn’t upset the notion of that full faith and credit. We shouldn’t, as some have rhetorically done leading up to this, suggest that a good way to deal with this is simply to not pass that extension." Obama directly addressed the matter on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange: Stephanopoulos: "You've got to extend the debt limit by May. And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?" Obama: "I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president. When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit - for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it." Obama's not unique in using the debt ceiling vote for partisan posturing. But on the Flip-O-Meter, he still earns a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-04-29T14:49:20	2011-04-14	['None']
pomt-01389	Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, "would help lift over a million Americans out of poverty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-raising-minimum-wage-/	The minimum wage is one area where Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes has gone on the offensive against Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky’s race for U.S. Senate. Grimes, now the Kentucky secretary of state, backs a Democratic effort to raise it to $10.10 an hour. In the Oct. 13 Kentucky Senate debate, McConnell, running for a sixth term in office, explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by claiming that a Congressional Budget Office report says "you will destroy between half a million and 1 million jobs (by raising the federal minimum wage)." "That’s not the way to grow our economy," he added. But Grimes retorted that McConnell was cherry-picking data from the report. "The full story of the CBO report is it would help lift a million — over a million — Americans out of poverty," she said. We looked at McConnell’s assertion in a separate fact-check and said it was Mostly True. The report said job losses would likely range from "a very slight reduction in employment" to 1 million, with a mid-range estimate of 500,000. But what did the CBO say about the other side the ledger, the people who would be boosted out of poverty by a minimum wage hike? We decided to take a look. President Barack Obama has called on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016. In the succeeding years, increases to the minimum wage would be tied to inflation. There are 23 states with minimum wages already above the federal minimum wage, while the remainder of the country (including Kentucky) either sets the minimum wage at $7.25, links the state minimum wage to the federal amount or specifies no minimum wage at all. Eight states have minimum wages set to increase to at least $10, but in most cases that would not happen until later than 2016. So this increase, if passed, would affect most of the country. In 2016, the federal poverty level is expected to be $24,100 for a family of four. By the CBO’s estimate, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. That’s enough to move 900,000 of approximately 45 million people living below the federal poverty level above that threshold. But it’s not quite what Grimes said. While she initially said "a million Americans" she quickly corrected herself to say raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift "over a million Americans out of poverty." The actual figure is close to a million, but definitely not "over" it. Grimes’ campaign told us after the debate that the candidate misspoke both times and meant to say "nearly a million." The CBO estimate of 900,000 people is a net figure. That means it factors in not only the people who would move above the poverty line if the minimum wage went up to $10.10 an hour, but also those who would move below it. How would someone move below the poverty line if the minimum wage went up? As we noted earlier, the CBO estimates that somewhere between a few people and a million people could lose their jobs as a result of a minimum wage hike. Some businesses might have to cut back on employees to pay the increased wages of other workers, which could have a ripple effect on the economy resulting in about 500,000 lost jobs by the end of 2016. So, it’s possible that more than 900,000 people would be lifted out of poverty, it’s just that some of them are offset by people moving into poverty as a result of the increase in the minimum wage. The CBO report does not say how many of the 500,000 lost jobs would move people into poverty, and it’s presumptuous to put any number on it. If one person in a family loses a job as a result of a minimum wage hike, it doesn’t always mean the family is now living in poverty. The lost job could be that of a teenage child or one parent in a two-income household. And either way, the net figure — 900,000 — is the most important number that tells the full story. Overall, Grimes is right that there’s another side to the CBO report that McConnell’s comments do not highlight. As the report noted: "The increase in the minimum wage would have two principal effects on low-wage workers: The large majority would have higher wages and family income, but a much smaller group would be jobless and have much lower family income." Our ruling Grimes said that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would lift "over a million Americans out of poverty." The report she sites actually puts the net figure slightly less than a million, at about 900,000. Grimes’ campaign later said she misspoke but our job is to check what the candidates tell the voters at the time. The stat Grimes actually said is close but not quite on the ball. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-10-14T17:35:34	2014-10-13	['United_States']
pomt-13132	Says Chris Koster "fell silent" as attorney general in pursuing a case against a free classified service accused of promoting prostitution after accepting "over $12,000 in campaign contributions' from people affiliated with the service."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/02/eric-greitens/greitens-campaign-misses-mark-backpage-attack/	In the most expensive gubernatorial race in the country, Eric Greitens and Chris Koster have taken turns flinging mud at each other. Leading up to a Sept. 30 debate in Branson, Missouri, the candidates focused their efforts on who could advocate better on behalf of Missouri women. On Sept. 29, the Greitens campaign put out a news release explaining why they think Koster is "wrong for women." The release claims that Koster "fell silent" on investigating the website Backpage.com in 2011, after receiving "over $12,000 in campaign contributions" from a legal and lobbying firm representing the site, SNR Denton. That’s a pretty heavy charge. We decided to look into the claim. Backpage, a free classifieds website, has been criticized for promoting prostitution and helping facilitate human trafficking. The company’s CEO, Carl Ferrer, was arrested Oct. 6 for pimping a minor. In 2010, Koster and other attorneys general were trying to get the site to remove its adult services page. Backpage has yet to comply. According to the campaign release, Koster ceased any efforts against Backpage following donations from SNR Denton. We reached out to both the Greitens campaign and Koster’s press secretary to compare their versions of the story. Battling Backpage Much like Craigslist, Backpage lets users buy and sell items and services online. Unlike Craigslist, which removed adult services in 2010, Backpage still has an adult services section. Before getting into campaign finance, it’s important to understand the timeline of Koster’s work against Backpage, and how that timeline is described by each campaign. Starting in 2009, Koster and a growing group of attorneys general began attacking Backpage for allowing advertisements that promoted human trafficking, particularly of minors — both campaigns agree on that. Koster was one of the lead attorneys in a multistate working group trying to get Backpage to shut down its adult services advertising section in September 2010. Spokespersons from both the Greitens campaign and Koster’s office provided news releases to back that up. In August 2011, Koster and 44 other attorneys general sent another letter to Backpage, asking for proof the website was actively working to remove sex trafficking advertisements. Both campaigns cited that letter as well. And that’s where the timelines diverge. According to Greitens "Then suddenly, (Koster) fell silent." That’s what the Greitens press release says, at least. The release goes on to cite Koster’s 2011 campaign finance records. On Sept. 1, 2011, the day after the attorneys general requested information on Backpage’s efforts to end sex trafficking, Missourians for Koster received two donations. The first was a $5,000 donation from SNR Denton, a now-dissolved legal and lobbying firm that represented Backpage at the time. The second was a $250 donation from Samuel Fifer, a lawyer with the firm, who also counseled Backpage during the investigation by the attorneys general. Missourians for Koster also received two other donations from SNR Denton in 2012, which the Greitens campaign also referenced. "Campaign cash is worth more to Koster than protecting Missouri’s children," the release goes on to say. That’s where the press release timeline ends. But we reached out to the Greitens campaign, and staffers pointed out one more piece of Koster’s involvement in investigating Backpage. In June 2013, Koster and two other attorneys general sent a letter to attorneys general nationwide. The letter asked attorneys general to sign on to a letter urging Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The Greitens campaign referenced this letter in its research sent to PolitiFact. The proposed amendment, known as the SAVE Act, would close the loophole that makes it easy for websites like Backpage to promote sex trafficking, giving state and local law enforcement jurisdiction over cyber crimes. The actual letter was sent to Congress that July, signed by Koster and 48 other attorneys general. Koster’s office referenced this letter. So, does sending a letter to Congress count as working to end human trafficking? Not if you ask the Greitens campaign. "That’s the problem with career politicians like Chris Koster," Greitens campaign manager Austin Chambers told the Springfield News-Leader. "They think sending a letter and a press release counts for doing something." According to Koster But if you ask the attorney general’s office, Koster wasn’t finished with Backpage in 2013. On Oct. 15, 2014, Koster and the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter to Congress asking for passage of the Amy and Vicky Act, which would make anyone involved in the sale or distribution of child pornography liable for restitution. Five days later, Koster and other attorneys general once again asked Congress to pass the SAVE Act, rehashing the sentiment of the June 2013 letter given to us by both Koster and Greitens. The letter, given to us by Koster’s press secretary, directly mentions Backpage. At the state level, in May, Koster’s office announced tuition-free training for prosecutors and members of law enforcement on how to effectively investigate human trafficking. Dirty money? But the question still stands: Did Chris Koster abandon efforts to restrict Backpage as a broker of sexual services as the Greitens’s campaign claims? It’s impossible to tell whether the donations caused Koster to ease up on his investigation into Backpage. However, Koster’s office provided us with evidence of continued activity against Backpage, even after the 2011 donations cited by the Greitens campaign. It’s also perfectly legal for lobbying firms to donate to campaigns, said James Klahr, executive director of the Missouri Ethics Commission. Klahr said the commission hasn’t analyzed how often or why lobbying firms make contributions, but a quick donor search shows SNR Denton and its employees donated consistently to Missouri campaigns since 2010. Even after merging into the multinational firm Dentons, the company continued political contributions. Dentons represents a long list of corporations. The firm isn’t exclusive to Koster. In fact, Dentons has donated to Greitens’s charity, The Mission Continues, since at least 2013. Koster has not had any ethics complaints related to donations from the firm, and Greitens can’t file a complaint, because the contributions were made more than two years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for ethics complaints. But, this isn’t Koster’s first time getting tangled in legal and lobbyist firm meddling. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times found that in 2013, successful lobbying by the law firm representing 5-Hour Energy led to Koster ending an investigation into false advertising by the company. Such practice is common for attorneys general across the country, the investigation found. However, one month after the Times article, Koster’s campaign decided to stop receiving contributions from lobbyistsconnected to anyone involved in litigation with the attorney general’s office. According to campaign spokesman David Turner, the campaign returned more than $115,000 since implementing the policy. Koster’s campaign did not receive any contributions from Dentons after 2014. Our rating Greitens said Koster "fell silent" as attorney general in pursuing a case against a free classified service accused of promoting prostitution after accepting "over $12,000 in campaign contributions" from people affiliated with the service. A lobbying firm that represents the classified service, SNR Denton, and its employees contributed to Koster’s campaign. Koster’s office didn’t end its efforts to restrict Backpage after the donations were made. Greitens’ campaign says Koster’s efforts were hollow. But that’s up for interpretation. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b71d872-9f1a-40e6-a5ef-59c99ba75040	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2016-11-02T10:21:01	2016-09-29	['None']
pomt-14618	"Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country."	true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/30/joe-straus/joe-straus-accurately-says-texas-growing-twice-fas/	A campaign video put out by House Speaker Joe Straus, the San Antonio Republican, shows him talking up his re-election hopes and throwing out a claim about huge Texas growth. The video, posted Dec. 17, 2015, opens with Straus signing papers to run for re-election, where he’ll face off in the March 2016 Republican primary for the District 121 seat against former schoolteacher Sheila Bean and Jeff Judson, a former San Antonio tea party director. Straus, shown shaking hands with people, also says: "Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country. This is a time for men and women who are ready to confront our challenges with humility and with purpose." Hold on; Texas is growing two times as fast as the other 49 states combined? By email, Straus spokesman Jason Embry pointed toward U.S. Census Bureau data as the basis of the claim. Texas’s population growth According to the Census breakdown, from April 2010 to July 2014, the U.S. population grew 3.3 percent. According to the data, Texas’ population grew 7.2 percent, which breaks out, Embry noted, to Texas growing twice as fast as the nation. It didn’t take long for us to identify more recent Census data covering national and state population estimates through June 2015. Then again, that information was released Dec. 22, 2015, shortly after Straus unveiled his video -- so he wouldn’t have had access to it. Regardless, the latest figures show Texas more than doubling the nation’s growth rate from April 2010 to July 2015 when the population of Texas grew 9.2 percent while the U.S. population grew 4.1 percent. Not that Texas was the fastest-growing state in the period; that distinction goes to North Dakota, which saw 12.5 percent population growth, the bureau says. Texas compared to the rest of the country We recognized, though, that the offered basis of the speaker’s claim compares Texas to the nation as a whole. That’s not what Straus said; he compared Texas to the rest of the nation not including Texas. So, does the growth of Texas double the growth of the rest of the country? You bet your boots, we confirmed, both if you look at growth from 2010 to 2014, the period singled out by Straus, and at shorter time periods. We got out our calculator and found that from mid-2013 to mid-2014, Texas grew by 1.8 percent; that rate was more than double the 0.7 population growth in the rest of the country. From April 2010 through July 2014, according to bureau data, the population of the rest of the country increased 2.9 percent (while Texas grew, as noted above, 7.2 percent). Throw in growth from mid-2014 to mid-2015, and the rest of the nation grew 3.6 percent over five-plus years (while Texas saw 9.2 percent population increase). Texas compared to other individual states There’s another way to make such comparisons -- state to state. And while North Dakota, not Texas, has lately been the fastest-growing state, Texas has ranked among the very fastest-growth states.From 2010 to 2014, year to year, Texas consistently ranked as one of the fastest-growing states. From mid-2014 to mid- 2015, only North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida grew faster than the Lone Star State. Year to Year Percentage Changes in Population, Fastest-Growing States 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 North Dakota 0.29 1.60 2.47 3.04 2.27 2.28 Colorado 0.38 1.41 1.41 1.53 1.60 1.89 Nevada 0.10 0.57 1.33 1.29 1.72 1.85 Florida 0.24 1.36 1.29 1.25 1.59 1.84 Texas 0.39 1.62 1.70 1.58 1.81 1.82 Source: U.S. Census Bureau (NST-EST2015-popchg2010_2015, Jan. 20, 2016) In this recent period, North Dakota was consistently the fastest-growing state; it grew more than 2 percent annually from mid-2012 to mid-2015 and spurted 3 percent from mid-2012 to mid-2013. Why is Texas growing? It doesn’t bear on the accuracy of the speaker’s claim, but we wondered why Texas remains fast-growing. By phone, Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said much of the state’s growth reflects net migration, the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the state in a given period of time. Potter also said migration to Texas had been driven by job opportunities in the state. "People move to one place or another, usually because they’re looking for work," Potter said. "There’s a small percentage of migration behavior that’s related to say retirement or maybe going to school, but the bulk of movement of people over space is a function of them seeking employment opportunities or leaving a place where there isn’t employment opportunities." Another factor playing into the state’s relatively high population increases, Potter said, is a "fairly healthy" natural rate of increase, meaning births in Texas outnumbering deaths. Like Potter, William Frey, a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program senior fellow, attributed the growth to fertility rates and domestic migration, as well as immigration. "Texas is unusual because it’s one of the bigger attractions for immigrants in the United States but also has really stood out in term of domestic migration," Frey said. "It’s one of the few states that have a large number of both." Our Ruling Straus said: "Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country." Census Bureau statistics show that Texas, indeed, is growing faster than the United States as a whole. Experts explain that the rate of population growth is due to its birth rate, foreign immigration and migration from other states. Although Texas is growing faster that the country as a whole, it is not the fastest growing state. Although it ranked second behind North Dakota in 2014, it dropped behind North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida in 2015, according to data released after Straus published his video. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.	None	Joe Straus	None	None	None	2016-01-30T13:10:00	2015-12-15	['Texas']

pomt-11689	"We have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/29/donald-trump/has-donald-trump-signed-more-bills-anyone-no/	President Donald Trump is known for boasting about his achievements. But is he correct that he’s enacted more legislation than any other president? At a West Palm Beach fire station on Dec. 27, Trump said, "You know, one of the things that people don’t understand — we have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman." This was a variation on an earlier, Mostly True assertion by his former press secretary Sean Spicer that Trump has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman." Eight months have passed since we rated Spicer’s statement, so we -- and a lot of PolitiFact readers -- thought it was a good time to check Trump’s most recent claim. The boast's accuracy has declined with time — big time. According to calculations by govtrack.us-- a nonpartisan website that collects congressional and other governmental data -- Trump actually ranked last in legislation signed among post-World War II presidents in their first calendar year who took office on the regular four-year cycle (as opposed to those who were elevated to the presidency after a death or resignation). In a report published on Dec. 21, 2017, govtrack.us wrote that "Trump has sunk to last place with 94 bills signed into law by his 336th day in office (today). That’s eight fewer than President George W. Bush and not even half as many as presidents Bill Clinton (209) and George H.W. Bush (242)." Trump signed two bills the day after the report was released, including a major tax bill, but that wouldn’t be enough for him to catch up to George W. Bush. Through Dec. 28, Trump had signed 96 and the younger Bush had signed 109, Joshua Tauberer, the founder of Govtrack.us, told PolitiFact. Tauberer added that Truman signed at least  126 laws in his first 100 days, so his number for the full year would be far above Trump's current 96. Govtrack.us also looked at the number of pages signed, and Trump wasn’t first on that list either. "Trump’s 2,038 pages put him in 4th place —  well behind Obama’s 3,473 pages but more than twice as much as George W. Bush by this point in their first years," the report said. Trump’s statement from West Palm Beach "is wrong no matter how you try to repair it," Tauberer said. Here’s a chart summarizing both measures, which doesn’t include the two bills Trump signed on Dec. 22. In the chart, the presidents are ordered from most bills signed to least bills signed. Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford aren’t included in this comparison because they started their tenure in the middle of a congressional session. (It would not be appropriate to compare the three presidents who entered office other than on Jan 20 to the rest because each completed their first calendar year in office with much shorter tenures in the Oval Office. Johnson, for instance, would have had only a few weeks. Also, those presidents would not have come in with a popular mandate and a new Congress starting its work.) President Bills signed in year one Pages of legislation John F. Kennedy 684 1,404 Dwight Eisenhower 514 1,107 George H.W. Bush 242 2,518 Jimmy Carter 241 1.595 Richard M. Nixon 211 545 Bill Clinton 209 2,556 Barack Obama 118 3,473 Ronald Reagan 108 1,223 George W. Bush 102 981 Donald Trump 94 2,038 The report added that Trump "has not held the title of signing the most new legislation since his 101st day" in office and has been in the bottom half for most of his presidency. Govtrack.us provided this chart showing Trump’s ranking among the 10 presidents throughout 2017. It shows that he moved into first place around Day 100 of his presidency, but fell to seventh place within the next two months, and slid down to tenth out of 10 as the end of his first calendar year approached. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s also worth noting that not all legislation is of equal importance. On the one hand, Trump has signed the tax overhaul, a bill of major consequence. And on several occasions, Trump has used the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations. But the numbers — for all presidents, not just Trump — are padded by less significant bills. Some of the ones Trump has signed have been federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running. Others have been substantive but of limited effect, such as a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy or a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets. Still others have been ceremonial in nature, such the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee or a commemorative coin for the American Legion. (Here’s a full list.) It’s also noteworthy that Trump has been working with a Congress controlled by his own party, an asset that only some of his predecessors have had at the beginning of their tenure. All told, Trump’s statement is "nonsense," said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. "Trump has signed only one major piece of legislation, barely working that into his first year." The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said, "We have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman." In his first 100 days, Trump had signed the most bills of any president since Truman. Since then, however, he has fallen further and further behind. Just days before the end of his first calendar year in office, Trump ranks last among the 10 post-war presidents who began their term on the regular cycle. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00869	On support for ethanol mandates	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-loves-hates-federal-ethanol-mandate/	Perhaps no issue is more important to Iowa farmers than the federal requirement that ethanol -- which is often made from corn -- be blended into America's gasoline supply. On March 7, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker was among potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates who visited the Iowa Ag Summit, where attendees wanted to know where each of the would-be presidents stood on the "ethanol mandate." For Walker, it was an especially interesting question. In 2006, he strongly opposed a state effort to require ethanol use in midgrade gasoline, on the grounds that the government shouldn’t be dictating such rules. In Iowa, he had this to say: "It's an access issue, and so it's something I'm willing to go forward on continuing the Renewable Fuel Standard and pressing the EPA to make sure there's certainty in terms of the blend levels set," Walker said. "Now, long term — we've talked about this before as well — my goal would be to get to a point where we directly address those market access issues and I think that's a part of the challenge. So that eventually you didn't need to have a standard." In short, he’s for a mandate in the short run, and against it in the long run. That led some commentators and critics to say he had changed his views. Did he? Let’s return to the Flip-O-Meter, which has been getting quite a workout as Walker positions himself for a presidential run. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. More on the mandate Corn is king in Iowa, with a large segment of the state’s economy devoted to growing and refining the crop into ethanol. Enacted by Congress in 2005, the Renewable Fuel Standard has attracted support and opposition from all sides, in often unpredictable alliances. Supporters say the fuel helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, supports American farmers and drives down the price at the pump. Opponents include engine makers and consumer groups who say the blended fuel hurts performance, wastes a valuable food product and needlessly drives up the price at the pump. Free market advocates oppose the government mandate that covers ethanol. In 2006, when Walker was Milwaukee County executive and weighing a gubernatorial run, he fell cleanly in this camp when it came to ethanol mandates. Walker took to his blog and radio airwaves to rip a proposed state ethanol mandate. "Mandates on individuals and businesses are bad for job growth and prosperity," Walker said in a March 9, 2006 blog post directed at the state Senate Republicans. "I ask that you remember this when voting on the ethanol mandate today." In a March 1, 2006 post he cited former president Ronald Reagan in his critique. "Republican lawmakers should remember the principles of Ronald Reagan," Walker wrote. "He warned that government is not the answer to our problems, but too often the problem is the government. The recent legislation to impose a mandate on the use of ethanol is a good example." And the Wisconsin State Journal dug up this 2006 statement, that indicated Walker’s interests were broader than the Wisconsin bill: "Mandates hurt Wisconsin’s working families, and whether they are from Washington or Madison, we as fiscal conservatives should oppose them." How does that compare to the comments in Iowa in 2015? We asked AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of his campaign for president to explain Walker’s position on ethanol mandates. "Speaking directly to the RFS as a potential candidate he has not and does not support the passage of new laws that require a specific percentage of ethanol use,"Strong said in an email. "He believes consumer choice should drive ethanol use, but first the EPA has to uphold the law on the books and set the level. Then, given the opportunity, he would work to address the root problem of market access and phase out the ethanol mandate. Additionally, he wouldn't get rid of it on day one because there’s a level of certainty that farmers and producers depend on and we have to factor that in when phasing it out." In summary: Walker opposed a state law that would have mandated the use of ethanol. He now says he supports, for now, the federal law that for 2014 set a national target of 15.21 billion gallons of ethanol be produced and blended into gasoline. We define a Half Flip as a partial change in position or inconsistent statements on an issue. That’s what we see here. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-04912	Says 1 in 7 American families is on food stamps.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/02/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-1-7-american-families-food-stamps/	Shortly before Ted Cruz won the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, he got a star-power boost from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin at a get-out-the-vote rally north of Houston. Firing up the crowd in her July 27, 2012, speech in The Woodlands, Palin touched on some claims PolitiFact has recently addressed, plus one we haven’t: "One in seven American families are on food stamps." Based on past PolitiFact work, Palin was batting better than .500 on these statements: "Thirty percent of our mortgages are underwater." More like 25 percent than 30 percent, as of January, but pretty close. The Affordable Care Act is "death-panel-filled": Still a Pants on Fire claim. "We’re going on four years now without a federal budget." Yes. Specifically, when Palin spoke, 3 years, 2 months and 28 days. So how’d she do with her food stamp claim? Another hit, according to the experts we asked. U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Alyn Kiel told us by email that Palin was correct -- in fact, one in seven individual Americans is on food stamps, aka the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kiel cautioned against translating SNAP’s term "households" to "families." "There is no single definition of a household," Kiel told us. "The Census Bureau defines it one way (anyone who lives under the same roof together); SNAP defines it another (more strictly as a group that purchases and prepares food together, so you could, for example, have a household of one, which you cannot by the Census Bureau definition). The Census Bureau defines families even more strictly than households." J.C. Dwyer, state policy director of the Texas Food Bank Network, told us by email, "Most of the time, a ‘household’ is roughly equivalent to a ‘family,’ and so contains more than one person. However, a single individual living alone is also considered a ‘household.’ "That's why one in seven individuals benefit from the program, and one in five households," Dwyer said. He sent us USDA's monthly report for May 2012, which shows that 22.3 million U.S. households encompassing 46.5 million individuals were on SNAP. He calculated the "one in seven" and "one in five" ratios using the U.S. Census population clock and average household size in 2010 (2.59 people), he said. Dwyer cautioned against tying increases in SNAP recipients to any specific president or government policy, noting that the national food bank network Feeding America has reported SNAP participation mirrors unemployment. An April 19, 2012, report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said that, nationwide, "Spending on SNAP benefits more than doubled between 2007 and 2011." Charts from the report show an increase in participation after the recession began in 2007; CBO predicts the increase will peak in 2014. In Texas, SNAP participation has also risen compared to 2007, but has held fairly constant since early 2010. Jonathan Lewis, a specialist in food policy for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, emailed us a link to state data showing that the number of Texans on SNAP has remained within the range of 3.5 million to 3.7 million since March 2010, when it was at 3.4 million. The total was 2.3 million in July 2007 and 3.6 million in July 2012. Lewis told us, "Palin’s statement about one in seven families on SNAP in the U.S. is correct besides her use of families rather than households. However, I think the public views them as the same." Lewis included a link to the Texas Administrative Code’s definitions of families and households. For purposes of the SNAP program, the code defines a household as the person or persons included in a single SNAP case by state Health and Human Services. A family, the code says, is defined as a group of relatives living together and meeting certain other conditions. The state data show 1.5 million cases, or households, on SNAP in Texas for July 2012. Our ruling Palin’s figure is supported and may even understate the share of families on food stamps. Her statement rates True.

pomt-14450	"Every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-percentage-gun-owning-households/	There’s a bottom-line reason why the National Rifle Association doesn’t want to broaden background checks on gun buyers, former President Bill Clinton said during a recent rally in Richmond for his wife’s presidential campaign. "The NRA and the gun manufacturers know that every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns," Clinton, a Democrat, said during the Feb. 24 speech at the Hippodrome theater. "So what they have to do every time somebody says ‘Would you please give us three days to do a background check and maybe a little more if we don’t have consolidated mental health records’ … they go nuts and say, ‘Well this is the beginning of the end. They’re violating the Second Amendment. They’re coming after your gun.’" We wondered whether Clinton was correct that, every year, there’s a slow and steady decline in the proportion of households that own guns. The former president’s spokesman, Angel Urena, pointed us to one article on The Huffington Post and another in The New York Times about gun ownership. Both items focused on findings about gun ownership in polls conducted by the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago. Since 1973, the survey has asked people whether anyone in their home owns a gun. The results show that the high-water mark was in 1977, when 50.4 percent of households had firearms. Since then, the survey found there’s been a long-term decline in the percentage of households with guns, which dropped to 31 percent in 2014 - the latest survey available. The decline largely occurred during the 1990s. Researchers say much of the long-term decline was caused by a drop in the popularity of hunting. But contrary to Clinton’s claim, the percentage of households possessing firearms hasn’t decreased every year. Since 2000, the percentage has been fairly static, bobbing slightly up and down. Here’s what the survey has found in its more recent polls. Keep in mind the survey is conducted every two years. The figures show the percentage of households with guns: •2000; 32.4 percent •2002: 33.5 percent •2004: 34.7 percent •2006: 33.1 percent •2008: 34 percent •2010: 31.1 percent •2012: 33.1 percent •2014: 31 percent Gun rights advocates have criticized the survey’s gun ownership number as being too low. The NRA estimates that 40 percent to 45 percent of households have guns. Gallup also has been surveying household gun ownership for decades but comes up with different percentages and a different long-term trend than the General Social Survey. Unlike the General Social Survey, it finds almost no long-term decrease in gun-owning households: It was 43 percent in the 1972 and 41 percent last year. In between, the roller coaster trend line constantly rises and falls. The pattern essentially holds up if you look at recent years: 41 percent of households owned guns in 2000 and in 2015. In between, there are many peaks and valleys. Let’s look at one last series of polls on household gun ownership by the Pew Research Center. It found that 45 percent of households owned a gun in 1993, and that decreased to 33 percent in 2013 - the last year Pew surveyed on the question. But as with the other polls, the decrease is barely discernable when starting at 2000. That year, 35 percent of households had firearms. Fast forward to 2013, when it was 33 percent. In between those two years, the percentages once again bob up and down. How should we take all these confusing poll results? Perhaps with a grain of salt. Pew said in a March 2013 report that there’s "no definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many Americans own guns or how gun ownership rates have changed over time. Also, public opinion surveys provide conflicting results: Some show a decline in the number of households with guns, but another does not." Our ruling Bill Clinton says "every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns." Although polls on gun-owning households are erratic, you can make a plausible argument they show a long-range downward trend. Clinton cites a series of surveys by the University of Chicago that show a drop of 19 percentage points since the early 1970s. Another set of polls by Gallup show the five-decade drop is 2 percentage points. A third series of polls by Pew shows a decrease of 12 percentage points since 1993. But much of the downward movement occurred in the 1990s, and Clinton goes overboard by saying the percentage is going down "every year." All three surveys show the yearly percentages have been fluctuating in recent years and that, since 2000, the drop is about 1 or 2 percentage points. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

pomt-12048	"The Affordable Care Act is the single largest tax increase in my lifetime."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/sep/11/karen-handel/handel-wrong-size-obamacare-taxes/	Republican lawmakers may have hit a brick wall in their drive to do away with Obamacare, but newly elected U.S. Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., stands firm on the need to repeal the health care bill. At a recent telephone town hall, a voter asked why she was not a fan of repairing the Affordable Care Act. "The issue with quote ‘repairing the Affordable Care Act’ is the fact that it has so many taxes in it," Handel said Aug. 30. "In fact, the Affordable Care Act is the single largest tax increase in my lifetime history. You can’t repair a tax. You have to repeal it. You have to get rid of it." A reader asked us if the tax hike in the 2010 health care law was as large as Handel said. Handel was born in 1962, so we looked at the research on every major tax bill passed since then. We reached out to Handel’s office to learn the source behind her statement and did not hear back. We looked at the scale of the Affordable Care Act taxes and found that Handel is mistaken. In terms of the dollar amounts, there were three years that topped the Obamacare tax increases. Relative to the size of the economy (using the metric of the gross domestic product) six tax increases were higher. Jerry Tempalski at the Office of Tax Analysis in the Treasury Department ran the numbers in 2013. He calculated the tax impacts of 28 tax bills between 1968 and 2013. To winnow out the effects of inflation, we used the figures he generated based on 2012 constant dollars. Tempalski found that for any given tax bill, the impact would change from year to year. To fully test Handel’s statement, we picked the year with the highest amount for each bill. (Tempalski provided a 4-year average but that diluted the magnitude of the Obamacare taxes.) With that approach, three tax increases were larger. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 (Johnson), the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Reagan) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Clinton) ranked above the Affordable Care Act tax impact. But using constant dollars misses a big piece of the picture. A larger economy can absorb a higher tax hike and the nation’s gross domestic product has grown a lot over the years. To compare apples to apples, we took the federal government’s data on gross domestic product and calculated the impact of each tax increase relative to the size of the economy. By that measure, there have been six tax hikes that were larger than those in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. (All amounts are billions of constant 2012 dollars.) Highest year Highest year as percent of GDP 1982 $89.8 billion 1.14% 1993 $84.6 billion 0.77% 1968 $80 billion 1.57% 2010 $75.5 billion 0.44% 1990 $51.1 billion 0.56% 1980 $37.2 billion 0.63% 1966 $27.9 billion 0.60% Sources: U.S. Treasury Department, CBO This analysis is a little different from one done by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for deficit reduction, but the two match up on ranking the scale of the tax increases. Tempalski’s report goes only through 2013. To get the most current estimates of the size of the Obamacare taxes, we went to the Joint Committee on Taxation. That congressional body assessed what would happen if all the health care law’s taxes were repealed. The committee found that in 2020, those taxes would total $56.3 billion (no correction for inflation). The highest amount would come in 2025 when the value would reach $87.8 billion in 2025-dollars. Even in the highest year, based on the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of GDP in 2025, the Affordable Care Act taxes are about .34 percent of GDP. That’s less than tax hikes in previous years. The last way to weigh the scale of the Affordable Care Act taxes is to compare tax collections due to the law with total federal revenues in the year before. (We used the highest year when the taxes were in effect; for the ACA that was 2014.) Change from year before 1969 + 10.5% 1986 + 7.1% 1997 + 4.5% 1966 + 4.2% 1982 + 3.5% 1992 + 3.5% 2014 + 2.8% The Affordable Care Act increase ranks last in this time frame. Our ruling Handel said the Affordable Care Act is the single largest tax increase in her lifetime. Using constant dollars, three tax laws ranked higher. Relative to the size of the U.S. economy and federal revenues the year before, six tax hikes were larger than those in the Affordable Care Act. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12882	Says Barack Obama "didn’t do executive orders in the beginning."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/26/whoopi-goldberg/whoopi-goldberg-wrongly-says-obama-waited-least-co/	The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg claimed recently that unlike President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama waited before issuing executive actions. After a striking comment from co-host Joy Behar, who hypothesized Trump was passing executive actions quickly because he was afraid he’d be impeached, another co-host, Jedediah Bila, countered Behar’s point saying "all presidents do this." Goldberg offered an instant fact-check. "I think the difference in what you're saying in terms of executive action is at least it took President Obama, at least a couple of months in, and this one (Trump) has came in and he said, ‘We're doing this and this, and this.’ And I understand that," Goldberg said in a Jan. 25 segment of the View. Goldberg repeated this idea again in response to Bila, who criticized Obama for taking executive actions at the start of his presidency when he could have passed laws through a Democratic Congress. "But (Obama) didn’t do executive orders in the beginning," Goldberg said. Executive orders are the most well-known kind of presidential action, and have a long tradition in presidential history back to the days of George Washington. In fact, every president except for William Harrison (who died a month into office) has issued at least one executive order. This specific presidential action directs the federal government and bureaucracies and carries the power of the law. However, executive orders can be revoked or amended by future presidents. We wanted to settle the matter: Did Obama, unlike Trump, wait to take executive action? Long story short is that he didn’t, and experts said executive actions are common among new presidents. Obama didn’t waste much time before issuing executive orders after his inauguration. Obama signed his first executive order (13489) about presidential records on Jan. 21, 2009, a day after the inauguration. This executive order required the Archivist of the United States notify both the incumbent president and the former president of any records the archivist feels may trigger executive privilege. (Executive privilege refers to the president’s power to withhold information from the public.) Over the next 10 days, Obama had signed nine executive orders. By the end of his first month, the number was 16. Here’s how Obama compared to Trump: As of Jan. 26, Trump had signed four executive orders aimed at achieving various campaign promises. By this time, Obama had issued five executive orders. Obama first aimed to limit access to presidential records, while another ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba within one year. That action received backlash from Republicans. As did Obama’s corresponding order to look for lawful alternatives to the detention of captives in the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. Month Executive orders signed by Obama January 2009 (starting on Jan. 21) 9 February 2009 7 March 2009 2 April 2009 1 Source: https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html Executive action has a broad definition, but just in terms of one type of executive orders, Goldberg’s claim is incorrect. That said, it’s hard to say whether Trump’s first actions as president are more significant for policy than Obama’s. Executive orders aren’t the only action president’s can take, making it difficult to compare Obama’s use of unilateral actions to Trump’s so far. Through "executive actions," presidents can also pardon criminals, amend the internal structure of the executive branch, issue signing statements, write letters and memoranda, and more. "The number of orders is often misleading, and the terminology can be confusing — both presidents issued important orders that were not ‘Executive Orders’ with numbers attached," said John T. Woolley, an American politics professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that both Trump and Obama took controversial actions at the start. "The early Trump executive actions have been on hot button issues, so they aroused a lot of early controversy, but we can’t forget how controversial presidential actions of the past have been," he said. Galston was specifically referring to the U.S. Treasury’s decision to bail out the auto industry during Obama’s first year. When Obama took office, he created a task force with a mandate to determine the fate of GM and Chrysler. He added that is not unlikely for presidents to take executive actions at first, especially when there’s a change in party, adding that presidents want to reverse actions of the previous administration. For example, Trump issued a presidential memorandum on Jan. 23 that banned all foreign nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funds from performing or promoting abortion, reversing an Obama action. The recession gripping the country when Obama took office also spurred the former president to move with more urgent executive action, Galston said. Our ruling Goldberg said Obama waited "at least a couple of months" to issue executive actions. That’s not correct; Obama issued an executive order on his first day in office, and 16 with in his first month.

pomt-14961	A Republican bill that would change John Doe criminal investigations is "creating exceptions in the law for politicians."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/22/chris-danou/gop-changes-wisconsins-john-doe-law-create-excepti/	Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature are pushing a bill that would change the state’s so-called John Doe law, which allows for criminal investigations -- like two that were related to Gov. Scott Walker -- to be done in secret. On Oct. 20, 2015, GOP Rep. David Craig of suburban Milwaukee insisted on a radio talk show that the changes made by his bill would not exempt politicians in any way from John Doe investigations. But later that day, during debate on the Assembly floor, Democrats repeatedly said just the opposite. "We are creating exceptions in the law for politicians," said state Rep. Chris Danou of Trempealeau. Is Danou right? What a John Doe is John Doe investigations are done to determine whether a crime has occurred and, if so, by whom. Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers. They can compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that a judge overseeing a John Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. Scott Walker In May 2010, when Walker was Milwaukee County executive, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched what would become a nearly three-year-long John Doe targeting Walker’s aides and associates. Six people, including three county executive employees, one Walker appointee and a major Walker campaign contributor, were convicted of a variety of crimes. In August 2012, weeks after Walker won a historic recall election to remain as governor, Chisholm opened another John Doe. It focused on whether the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups illegally coordinated with Walker's campaign. Later, the probe was expanded to four other counties and former federal prosecutor Francis Schmitz, who has described himself as a Republican, was added as a special prosecutor. In July 2015, the state Supreme Court shut down the investigation, saying the governor's campaign and the groups had not violated campaign finance laws. Walker and other Republicans have described the probe as a political witch hunt, and the bill to make changes in the John Doe process was largely prompted by that probe. Proposed changes Under current law, any crime may be investigated under a John Doe proceeding, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council. But under the bill, the crimes that could be investigated with a John Doe proceeding are limited to certain felonies. Those include murder, rape, armed robbery and numerous other serious crimes, as well as lesser crimes of a violent nature. Republicans argue that the bill limits what crimes a John Doe proceeding can be used to investigate, not who can be investigated. That’s true; there’s nothing in the bill that says politicians are exempt. But the proposed restrictions mean a John Doe investigation could no longer be used to look into a variety of political crimes. News reports have been clear on this. For instance, a John Doe could no longer be used to investigate allegations of bribing public officials, using elected office for personal gain and corruptly influencing legislation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Political corruption charges are exempted, noted the Wall Street Journal. The bill would end John Doe probes into political misconduct, said the Associated Press. To be clear, political crimes wouldn’t be the only ones exempted. If the bill became law, authorities would no longer be able to use a John Doe to look into crimes such as identity theft, mortgage fraud, dealing small amounts of heroin and cocaine, or theft reaching into the millions of dollars. But the political focus of the proposed changes has always been clear. Indeed, when Craig introduced the bill in February 2015, he said it would mean John Doe investigations could not be conducted for most political crimes. Prosecutors should use standard investigations or launch grand jury probes to look into those types of allegations, he said at the time. Wisconsin's grand jury law is rarely used and Democrats argue it would be costly and inefficient to use for political crimes. Craig’s bill was approved by the Assembly on the day of the floor debate and was adopted by the Senate the next day. Walker’s spokeswoman has said the governor would evaluate the legislation, but added he supports "common-sense reforms that protect free speech and ensure transparency and accountability" for John Doe investigations. Our rating Danou said a Republican bill that would change John Doe criminal investigations is "creating exceptions in the law for politicians." The bill would not exempt politicians from John Doe investigations, which under current law can be conducted for any crime. But the bill does create an exception in that John Doe probes could no longer be used to investigate political corruption. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Chris Danou	None	None	None	2015-10-22T05:00:00	2015-10-20	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-07893	Federal Reserve policies have led to a 69 percent rise in corn prices, 44 percent rise in wheat prices and 15 percent spike in sugar prices over the last year.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/04/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-federal-reserve-driving-commodit/	Unless you’re a farmer, grain elevator operator or pay extremely close attention to certain food prices, you may not know that the prices of corn, wheat and other commodities have pushed higher in the past year. Tea party activist and Republican Senate candidate Jamie Radtke drew attention to those increases on Jan. 27 when she spoke in Washington at a meeting of the U.S. Senate Tea Party Caucus. Radtke, after addressing national budget deficits and the Federal Reserve’s current policy of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills in an effort to spur the American economy, turned her attention to commodities. "We’re spending so much money that we can’t even borrow it fast enough -- the Federal Reserve has to print more money just to keep up!" Radtke continued: "The international financial markets know what it means when a nation monetizes its debt, even if Washington doesn’t. Commodity, food and energy prices have been climbing over the past 12 months: Corn prices have risen 69 percent; wheat prices have risen 44 percent; sugar prices have risen 15 percent; and gasoline is back at three dollars a gallon... and rising." Radtke’s statement offered a succotash of facts to check. Is she right about these sharp corn, wheat and sugar price increases? And are the spikes related to what she calls monetizing the debt? First, a word about what it means to "monetize the debt." When governments run a budget deficit, they cover it by issuing bonds that are sold to investors. When a nation’s central bank purchases those bonds, it is essentially subsidizing the government’s debt issuance. Opponents of the U.S. central bank’s latest Treasury purchases believe that this is now happening in the United States. And while the Fed is buying more Treasury bills than usual, the central bank has long-maintained holdings in U.S. government debt and has made regular bond purchases for decades. Chuck Hansen, Radtke’s director of communications, said the information on commodity prices was based on futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Board of Trade. He said the campaign compared the closing prices on each commodity for the second week of January 2011 with the closing price for each in the second week of January 2010. We went to the links mentioned by Hansen and did the math ourselves. Our numbers didn’t quite match Radtke’s, but were in the same ballpark. We found a 75 percent increase in corn prices, a 52 percent spike in wheat prices and a 12 percent rise in sugar prices. Now for the tougher questions. Why are these increases occurring? Is Radtke right to suggest they are related to actions by the Fed or the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar? Christopher Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, offered a simple explanation why corn and wheat prices have surged since the summer of 2010. "We had a really sharp reduction of global production," he said. The problems got serious back in July and August, he explained, when droughts swept across Russia and other ex-Soviet countries. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest wheat exporter, while Ukraine is fifth and Kazakhstan sixth. The 2010 harvests in those nations were down 28.6 percent compared to 2009. Canada, the world’s second-largest wheat exporter, had the opposite problem. Heavy rains last spring prevented farmers from planting their full crop and Canada’s wheat yield fell 14 percent from 2009, Hurt said. And this winter’s devastating floods in Australia are occurring during the Southern Hemisphere’s prime growing season and reducing the quality of that nation’s crop, he said. The problems with corn are also weather-related, experts said. Argentina, the world’s second-largest corn exporter, is facing a hot, dry summer (remember it is now summer in the Southern Hemisphere) that could drive yields down by 6 percent to 20 percent, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. "The real story is yield losses around the world," said Roy Huckabay Jr., a long-time commodities trader at the Chicago Board of Trade. "Starting with the spring of 2010 in Canada, then problems with drought in the U.S. wheat belt and now problems in Australia. World grain supplies are very tight right now." Ethanol production is also using up a portion of the corn supply. The United States, the world’s largest corn producer, will see 37 percent of the 2010 crop go towards ethanol production, compared with 6 percent of the 2000 crop. We asked Huckabay if a weaker dollar, meaning one that is worth less compared to other global currencies, could drive prices higher. Some critics of the Fed, including Radtke, say its policies are lowering the dollar’s value. He said that was possible in certain commodities, especially oil, which is widely traded. But in something like corn, he said, the United States is the largest supplier and largest exporter. And since less than 10 percent of American corn is exported, he said, the dollar’s value plays little role in the price Americans pay for corn. Our last call went to James Hamilton, an economist at the University of California, San Diego and an expert on monetary economic policy and the Federal Reserve. When it comes to understanding why commodity prices rise, he "wouldn’t put [the dollar] at the top of the list, though the value of the dollar certainly plays a role." This week, Hamilton said, commodity prices were reacting to the protests in Egypt. During the summer and fall, Hamilton said, a key driver was higher demand from emerging industrialized nations like China and India. Given the tight global food supply, Hurt said the 2011 planting season for the Northern Hemisphere will be crucial. If yields fail to exceed the levels of 2010, he said, the current high prices could persist at least through the summer of 2012, when that year’s harvest starts to arrive. "If we have a normal year in 2011 we will have pretty high prices still, but not as high as they are right now, Hurt said." Let’s review. Radtke is right about the basic facts: Corn, wheat and sugar prices have sharply increased in the past year, especially since last summer -- even though though her math did not match ours. But Radtke goes off track when she attributes these higher prices to a Federal Reserve that helps the United States "monetize its debt." Economists and a commodity trader told us these price spikes are primarily being driven by drought, floods and rising global demand. And while the value of the dollar plays a role in these prices, Federal Reserve policy is just one factor in the greenback’s value. Given this preponderance of evidence, we find her claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jamie Radtke	None	None	None	2011-02-04T09:55:45	2011-01-27	['None']
pomt-07501	"We have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years, and his name has been on the ballot one time."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/11/scott-randolph/rachel-maddow-show-democratic-rep-scott-randolph-c/	State Rep. Scott Randolph has taken the talk about his wife's uterus all the way to Rachel Maddow's national cable television show on MSNBC. If you haven't heard by now, Randolph, D-Orlando, said the word "uterus" during a March 25, 2011, floor debate about union dues collections. Republicans, Democrats say, told Randolph he couldn't say that word. The back-and-forth went viral and helped launched Randolph into a new stratosphere of popularity among progressives and liberals. That included a coveted chat with the high-priestess of liberal thinking, Maddow. Maddow and Randolph discussed how the Republican-dominated Legislature has 18 anti-abortion bills pending, yet some Republicans were upset with Randolph using the word "uterus." That spun into Randolph talking about redistricting, and how Republicans have been able to reach veto-proof majorities in both the House and Senate despite being outnumbered by registered Democrats in the state. "In terms of the last election and how the state Legislature in Florida ended up so very Republican right now, do you think that Floridians knew they were getting the kind of Legislature that would pursue 18 anti-abortion bills all at once? I mean, was the last election all about stuff like abortion rights?" Maddow asked during her April 4, 2011, show. "Well ... it was muddled," Randolph said. "We had a moderate Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist, who vetoed the last (abortion) bill that made it through the last Legislature. I think it lulled a couple of... some people to sleep. And, then, of course, now, we have a much (more) far right governor in Gov. Rick Scott. "And at the legislative level, you know, so many of these guys don't get challenged because the districts are so gerrymandered that quite frankly, probably, two-thirds of the Legislature was certified on the day that qualifying ended and their names never ended up on the ballot even. In fact, we have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years, and his name has been on the ballot one time." "Wow," Maddow responded. Randolph's claim about a future House speaker surprised Maddow, which means it's something we wanted to check. The man in line to be speaker four years from now is Rep. Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary. But when we reached Randolph's office, he said he was talking about Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, who will be speaker for the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions. To make sure Randolph wasn't moving the goal posts on us, we decided to check both. Dorworth represents District 34, which includes parts of Orange and Seminole counties. As of 2000, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the district by about 14 percentage points. Dorworth was first elected to the seat in 2007 during a special election to replace David Mealor. He was re-elected in 2008 and 2010. According to Department of State election records, Dorworth won a close primary in 2007 against Allen Roosa, winning by 68 votes. Dorworth then won the 2007 general election against a Democrat and two no-party candidates, receiving 54.5 percent of the vote. In 2008, Dorworth easily dispatched a primary challenger and did not have an opponent in the general election, meaning he was re-elected after the primary. In 2010, Dorworth did not have a primary, but he did beat Democrat Steve Barnes and John DeVries, a tea party candidate. That's two general elections out of a possible three, and two primaries out of three, where his name appeared on the ballot. As for Weatherford, the person Randolph says he was talking about, things get a little more complicated. A one-time aide to former Speaker Alan Bense who married Bense's daughter, Weatherford was first elected in District 61 in 2006. The district covers Pasco and Hillsborough counties, and as of 2000, registered voters in the district were 41 percent Republican and 40 percent Democrat. In 2006, Weatherford's name didn't appear on the ballot. That year, Republican Party officials selected Weatherford to replace incumbent Rep. Ken Littlefield on the general election ballot after Littlefield decided to take a position on the Public Service Commission. But the change happened too close to the election, and Littlefield's name remained in place. So votes for Littlefield actually went to Weatherford. Littlefield/Weatherford defeated Democrat Donovan Brown, receiving 60 percent of the vote. Weatherford was then re-elected without any opposition in 2008 -- not a primary or a general election. In 2010, he handily defeated newcomer Kevin Wright in a primary, and his name appeared on the November ballot where he bested Democrat Elena McCullough and received almost 66 percent of the vote. Weatherford's story is a bit trickier to judge in the context of Randolph's claim. Weatherford has run in two general elections -- though only once was his name on the ballot. He also had a primary in 2010, though Randolph's comments pertained to the larger point about redistricting and the split between Republicans and Democrats. That would put greater weight on general elections. Where does this all leave us? Randolph said: "We have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years and his name has been on the ballot one time." A basic reading of Randolph's comments would lead you to believe he's talking about Dorworth, who is scheduled to be speaker in 2015 -- four years from now. Dorworth has had two general elections out of a possible three, plus two primaries. But Randolph said he was talking about Weatherford, who is set to replace Rep. Dean Cannon as speaker for 2013 and 2014. Weatherford's name has only appeared on the general election ballot once -- but even granting Randolph wide latitude, he's still reshaping history. Weatherford was appointed to replace Littlefield on the 2006 ballot for District 61, and even though Weatherford's name wasn't on the ballot, he still spent about six weeks campaigning for the seat. If he had gotten the years right, Randolph might have had a better case. But because of the misstatement, coupled with the fact that Weatherford's story is not as clear-cut as Randolph described it, we find this claim False.

pomt-12246	"Collusion is not illegal."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/12/eric-bolling/collusion-not-illegal-fox-news-host-eric-bolling-s/	Following Sean Hannity’s exclusive interview with Donald Trump Jr., Fox News host Eric Bolling repeated an argument that the network’s personalities have used before — that even if someone from the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government, collusion itself is not a crime. Bolling and his Fox News Specialists co-hosts Eboni Williams and Kat Timpf appeared on the network after Hannity’s hourlong show on July 11, 2017. Trump Jr. had defended himself for meeting with a Russian lawyer in hopes of receiving damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. While discussing Trump Jr.’s comments, Williams noted that she didn’t see evidence of collusion. Bolling then added, "Collusion is not illegal either, by the way." We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back, but the network’s personalities have used similar arguments before. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump Jr. actually broke any laws, but we did wonder if there were laws that would apply to the idea of collusion. Actions not words Legal scholars told us that the word "collusion" may not appear in statutes, but working with Russian officials could still violate criminal law. Daniel Lowenstein, law professor emeritus at UCLA, considered collusion a vague term that would describe "some course of conduct that is adverse to someone else’s interests," especially if it were being done in secret. "It seems to me that what has been meant by collusion since this controversy began has been some agreement or understanding that the Russians would in some way assist Trump’s electoral prospects and would be rewarded in some way by Trump as president acting favorably toward Russia," Lowenstein said. "That would very likely be illegal and surely would be highly improper." Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily cited the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. A 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on that law found that foreign nationals could not make expenditures "to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate." "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime," Persily said. "And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime." The 2002 law enhanced penalties for violating statute for contributions and donations by foreign nationals that have been in effect since 1966, according to Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at the Stetson University College of Law. It’s relevant if Trump Jr. thought he was getting information about Clinton. "Since opposition research is typically something one would have to pay for, it is reasonable to consider opposition research ‘a thing of value’ under this statute," she said. University of Kentucky law professor Josh Douglas agreed that soliciting "dirt" on Clinton could arguably be considered valuable under federal law. He also said working with a foreign entity in a federal election could potentially be subject to public corruption or anti-coercion federal election law. John Coates, a Harvard University law professor, said that Russians looking to affect the election could potentially be defined as an expenditure. The related funds could be construed as an illegal contribution to a candidate who coordinates with the foreigner, he said. Discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud, Coates added. "Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to ‘deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,’ " he said. "That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute." University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said that in addition to possible violations of campaign finance and other federal laws, the Trump campaign could be open to another charge. "If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy," Hasen said. "Whether you want to call that ‘collusion’ or not seems besides the point." Our ruling Bolling said "collusion is not illegal." Legal scholars told us the word "collusion" is vague and may not be specifically used in legal language. But conduct that may be described as collusion could potentially be subject to multiple federal laws, including statutes on foreign contributions to elections and fraud.

pomt-14352	"Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/mar/23/gina-hinojosa/gina-hinojosa-vowing-reforms-says-texas-has-higher/	In a campaign mailer, Gina Hinojosa of Austin brought up incarceration. "Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran. It’s time to reverse course," Hinojosa said. We spotted that curious claim a few days before Hinojosa, a member of Austin’s school board, drew 57 percent of the vote to prevail in a seven-person field competing for the Democratic nomination to represent Austin's District 49 in the Texas House. She’s now almost certain to succeed longtime Rep. Elliott Naishtat after the November election; no Republican filed to run. To help Texas "reverse course," as the mailer said, Hinojosa would focus on youth initiatives to keep young people out of the criminal justice system, her campaign director, Patti Everitt, told us by email. Hinojosa favors decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, supporting youth jobs programs and backing educational reforms such as universal all-day pre-kindergarten. And was Hinojosa right that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran? U.S. incarceration numbers Asked the basis of Hinojosa’s comparison, Everitt said by email the campaign relied on a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that does research with the aim to "expose the broader harm of mass criminalization," according to its website. The cited report, "States of Incarceration: A Global Context," includes a graphic showing incarceration rates by state alongside incarceration rates of many countries. Texas is listed with the fifth-highest incarceration rate, of 1,063 per 100,000 in population. Russia has the 44th-highest rate, at 475 per 100,000; Iran is listed with the 68th-highest, at 284. Then again, many states look bad in the report. Russia is only the third foreign nation on the list, behind Cuba and Rwanda. Otherwise, the 42 places with higher incarceration rates are U.S. states or the United States as a whole, partly a result of the nation’s "tough on crime" policies of the 1980s and 1990s, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Louisiana is referred to as the "the world’s prison capital," with the highest incarceration rate of any country or U.S. state. The Prison Policy Initiative drew the U.S. figures for correctional population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census, the group’s director, Peter Wagner, told us by phone. According to the 2010 Census, Texas’ total correctional population that year was 375,392. Of that number, 267,405 of the people counted lived in adult correctional facilities. Facilities included in that definition were federal detention centers, federal and state prisons, local jails, military disciplinary barracks and jails as well as correctional residential facilities, like halfway houses. The rest were spread among juvenile facilities, nursing facilities and an "other" category. Another U.S. indicator But the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, which tracks data like this, reports lower state-by-state incarceration rates. In 2014, it says, Texas imprisoned 600 people for every 100,000 residents, including minors, and 816 per every 100,000 adults. That’s because those numbers only include sentenced prisoners. They exclude prisoners who are unsentenced, prisoners serving less than one year, and local jail inmates. That limited definition, Wagner said, is why the Prison Policy Initiative turned to the 2010 Census to measure by correctional population count, getting 1,063 incarcerated per 100,000 people in Texas. Upshot: Hinojosa’s source backs her up. A Texas skeptic Yet to our inquiry, a Texas criminal justice expert expressed doubts about global comparisons. Tony Fabelo of Austin, director of research for the Justice Center at the Council of State Governments, said by phone he was skeptical of incarceration numbers from undemocratic countries. "How do you know they’re counting in the right way? A lot of people are not counted, they just disappear, are arrested arbitrarily, never to be seen again. How do you count that?" he said. Many politicians or advocates of changing U.S. incarceration policies cite the statement, rated True by PolitiFact Virginia in 2014, that the United States has 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of its "known" prisoners. The caveat of "known" avoids the problem Fabelo references. Fabelo suggested that making international comparisons is tricky even when comparing U.S. incarceration rates to those of other democracies. Incarceration rates are lower in the United Kingdom and France, for example, in part because those countries have lower rates of violent crime and crime involving weapons, Fabelo said. Putting incarceration rates side by side is missing part of the picture. Next, we ran the figures for Russia and Iran past experts on those countries. Russia The Prison Policy Initiative’s international incarceration rates -- 475 per 100,000 in Russia and 284 per 100,000 in Iran -- were taken from the World Prison Population List, which says it gets its numbers in almost all cases from the national prison administration of the country at hand. The list is published by the World Prison Brief, a U.K.-based arm of the International Centre for Prison Studies. Depending on the country, might that be shaky sourcing? We decided to check incarceration rates with an independent organization, turning first to Amnesty International where Europe and Central Asia press officer Clarisse Douaud suggested that for Russia numbers, we consider the Council of Europe Member States’ 2014 Penal Statistics. That report, conducted via questionnaire with the council’s 47 member states, says Russia incarcerates 467 people per 100,000 residents, which is fewer than what the initiative says. Otherwise, a web search led us to query Jonathan Weiler, an adjunct assistant professor in global studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has published research on incarceration in Russia. Weiler said by email that the initiative’s Russia rate, 475 per 100,000, looked accurate though he said it could understate realities, for instance leaving out citizens held in local police stations. In the 1990s, Weiler said, Russia had a much higher incarceration rate. He said that was before Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed a mass amnesty for lower-level offenders due to prison overcrowding. Iran To gauge the accuracy of the cited incarceration rate for Iran, we reached out to Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the nonprofit International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. By email, Ghaemi said the initiative’s declared rate of 284 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents tracked closely with his latest estimate, reached in March 2014, of 272 per 100,000. At that time, he said, Iranian officials announced the total prison population, and it was reported by Iran-based news agencies. Those numbers, Ghaemi said, can be trusted. "The sensitive categories such as political prisoners are too few in the scheme of hundreds of thousands," to affect the total count, he told us. Our ruling Gina Hinojosa said: "Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran." Based on numbers reported by Russia and Iran, that checks out. The statement also holds up whether we use the more expansive U.S. Census measure of Texas correctional populations, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ rate based only on sentenced prisoners. Still, this assumes the figures for Iran and Russia are on the up and up and perfectly comparable to the Texas counts—and we’re not sure about that. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11870	Says county parties representing more than half the state’s Republican voters approved resolutions "demanding changes" in Texas House leadership.	true	/texas/statements/2017/nov/01/new-leadership-pac/did-gop-activists-representing-majority-gop-voters/	Before Texas House Speaker Joe Straus revealed he won’t seek re-election in 2018, a group declared that activists accounting for more than half the state’s Republican electorate had called for House leaders to skedaddle. The New Leadership PAC introduced itself in an October 2017 press release stating: "NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters." Voters might question whether party honchos automatically represent their wishes. Still, we wondered if resolutions demanding changes won widespread adoption as described. The PAC's release didn’t single out House leaders by name. But the PAC’s treasurer, Don Dyer of Austin, responded to our request for factual backup by emailing an undated document listing 56 of the state’s 254 counties under the headline, "Texas County GOP’s Voting to Oust Straus," the San Antonio Republican in his record-tying fifth two-year stint as speaker. House members fill the gavel-wielding leadership post from among themselves at the start of each regular legislative session. We unsuccessfully sought more information from Dyer, who told us whoever composed the list didn’t want to be identified. Dyer also didn’t provide copies of the referenced resolutions or the details of each proclaimed action. Independent verification We started our independent look into this claim by asking the Republican Party of Texas about such actions by local parties. By email, spokesman Jamie Bennett replied that county parties "act autonomously and are not required to submit resolutions to the state party. Therefore, I do have any list of all relevant resolutions. The best way to get that info would be to contact county chairs individually." We didn’t have the resources to check all the counties listed by Dyer. But our reporting--based on interviews of local party officials plus news stories and web posts by county parties and Empower Texans, a group long intent on banishing Straus for his resistance to its agenda--showed that anti-Straus resolutions were approved by executive committees of Republican parties in 19 counties including the eight counties accounting for the greatest numerical turnouts in the state’s latest GOP primary, in March 2016: Harris, Tarrant, Dallas, Bexar, Collin, Denton, Montgomery and Travis counties. Also, you can make a case that the 19 parties represent more than half the state’s Republicans. That is, state-posted election returns show the 1,498,383 people who voted for president in those counties comprised 53 percent of the 2,836,488 Texans who voted for president in the party's statewide primary. About 1.4 million Texans voted in the Texas Democratic presidential primary. County-by-county confirmations We turned next to confirming individual adoptions of anti-Straus resolutions. In July 2017, Bexar County Republicans led the way by adopting a resolution by 36-28 calling for "a change in leadership in the Texas House speakership." That happened, in Straus's home county, just before lawmakers began a special session on 20 topics designated by Gov. Greg Abbott including Abbott’s desire, successfully resisted by Straus, for a public-school bathroom law targeting transgender people. Like others, the Bexar County resolution says the House’s leadership should change due to Straus’s failure to support the party’s platform. The latest platform, adopted by Texas GOP activists in 2016, spells out positions that nominees are expected to champion--among them, an end to the direct election of U.S. senators; abolition of about 10 federal agencies; passage of federal legislation remanding all authority over abortion to individual states--and, at the state level, "enactment of legislation addressing individuals’ use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms that correspond with their biologically determined sex." In a phone message, Ruth Pharis of the Comal County Republican Party confirmed that its executive committee on July 20, 2017 approved a resolution supporting a change in the House speaker. Hood County Republicans similarly acted before the special session, according to a memo from Jim Logan, the county party’s chairman. "Even though many pieces of legislation have been put forward that are in line with the Republican Party of Texas platform," the resolution says, "Speaker Straus has failed to get them through the Texas House... We have no confidence going forward that he will adequately support the direction outlined by the platform and new leadership needs to be installed to effectively represent the will of the Republican Party of Texas voters and their platform." GOP leaders in Smith County likewise approved a resolution, though the Tyler Morning Telegraph quoted Brent Thompson, the county party’s chair, calling the move "symbolic" and saying the resolution "isn’t going to accomplish anything more than show Speaker Straus where we stand." An August 2017 Empower Texans web post says Liberty County Republicans that month approved a "no confidence" resolution calling for Straus to be censured by the state party’s executive committee for "his dismal failure to support" the party’s "core principles." The resolution also contains passages suggesting Straus bends to Democratic wishes. Straus, unsaid, gained momentum as an aspirant for House speaker in 2009 thanks to backing from House Democrats and a few Republican House members. On Aug. 7, 2017, Collin County Republicans voted 40-13 for a resolution in favor of House Republicans alone choosing the House speaker at the start of the 2019 regular session, Neal Katz, the county party’s executive director, told us by phone. On Aug. 17, 2017, the executive committee of the Denton County Republican Party approved a "no confidence" resolution demanding that "our elected officials in the Texas House withdraw support" from Straus. "We believe that it is time for new leadership in the House in order to effectively represent the will of Texas voters," the resolution says. Montgomery County Republican Party leaders acted similarly by a 33-11 vote, according to an account in the Golden Hammer, a local publication. Wally Wilkerson, the county party’s chairman, told us by phone the vote took place with most of the local party’s 90 executive committee members not present. Wilkerson, who’s chaired the local party since 1964, credited conservative activists. "Core elements of both parties have to have a bogeyman," Wilkerson said. Separately, Galveston County Republican Party leaders voted 14-2 to adopt a no-confidence resolution about Straus, Empower Texans reported while party leaders in Tom Green County adopted a resolution telling the county’s House member to "work to install" a speaker who’ll advance party platform directives, Jeff Betty, the county party’s chairman, told us by email. Also in August 2017, Republican precinct chairs in Hidalgo County voted in a straw poll by 20-0, with seven abstentions, to condemn Straus, according to a Rio Grande Guardian news story, though no resolution was taken up. The story quoted Jim Barnes, a tea-party activist, calling Straus an "embedded Democrat." Kaufman County Republicans approved a resolution calling for Straus to be removed as speaker for not heeding core platform principles, that party’s chairman, Jimmy Weaver, confirmed by phone. In a phone message, Marty Rhymes of the Gregg County Republican Party said its leaders approved an anti-Straus resolution. "We’re definitely excited he’s not going to run" again, Rhymes said. Also that month, Dallas County Republicans approved a resolution expressing "no confidence" in Straus, Ashley Moretti, the county party’s executive director, confirmed by email. On Sept. 25, 2017, the executive committee of the Harris County Republican Party approved--without a voiced dissent, party spokesman Vlad Davidiuk told us by phone--a resolution charging Straus with constantly obstructing the party’s platform, "resulting in a vast and deep disappointment among conservative grassroots voters." Also noted in the resolution: Straus referring in June 2017 to Abbott’s special-session topics as "horse manure." Straus, the resolution says, "has consistently killed conservative legislation, advanced liberal bills and remains beholden to special interests. It is a demonstrable fact that Texas House Republicans will pass conservative bills if those bills ever get a ‘floor’ vote. The Speaker has consistently packed his committee chair assignments with Democrats and liberal Republicans in an effort to deliberately stall and kill conservative legislation," the resolution says. Separately, Tarrant County Republicans adopted a call to choose a different speaker "that will be fair and apply the rules equitably to all members of the House on all bills," the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Also that month, Randall County Republican Party precinct leaders voted to tell local House members to vote against Straus for speaker, the Amarillo Globe News reported. And by a show of hands, precinct chairs for the Travis County Republican Party approved a resolution Sept. 12, 2017 calling for a change in the House speaker due to Straus’s "non-support" of the party platform, the county party says on its website. The resolution said Straus had "consistently denied the House the opportunity to act decisively upon conservative policies supported by Texas voters." On Sept. 18, 2017, party leaders in Guadalupe County endorsed a resolution recommending that Straus be censured by the state party’s executive committee "for his dismal failure to support" the platform’s "core principles," Karen Hale of the county party told us by email. In Williamson County, in contrast, party leaders rejected an anti-Straus resolution by 31-14, the party’s chairman, Bill Fairbrother, advised by phone. Fairbrother recalled debate about whether the move would hurt the county among lawmakers. Fairbrother said of Straus, "There’s a lot of respect for him here." We queried Jason Embry, a Straus spokesman, about the PAC's claim. Embry replied with an email expressing Straus’s gratitude for support from "mainstream Republicans." The email didn’t touch on resolutions adopted by leaders of county parties. Our ruling The PAC said county parties representing more than half the state’s Republican voters approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership. The group fell short of proving its claim. But we identified 19 counties, arguably accounting for more than half the voters in the state’s 2016 Republican presidential primary, where local party leaders approved calls this year for Speaker Straus to go. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-03264	Says the U.S. Postal Service has taken no taxpayer aid since 1971, funds operations entirely from the sale of stamps and related products and makes an "operational profit year after year."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/09/jim-hightower/postal-service-which-operates-sales-stamps-last-ha/	Jim Hightower, the populist commentator and former Texas agriculture commissioner, questions whether the U.S. Postal Service is financially imperiled. This came to our attention after an Austin resident asked whether Hightower was right that Congress in 2006 required the service to set aside billions of dollars to cover the health benefits of postal retirees for 75 years--all of it to be stashed in one decade. Such a mandate indeed passed into law. But we were stirred by another part of Hightower’s spring 2013 fundraising letter for the Hightower Lowdown newsletter. Suggesting the service isn't broke, Hightower declared: "Since 1971, the postal service has not taken a dime from taxpayers. All of its operations...are paid for by sales of stamps and related products. The Postal Service makes an operational profit year after year." We traipsed through that trio of claims, finding two flawed. By telephone, Hightower aide Laura Ehrlich told us Hightower’s letter echoed the March 2012 Hightower Lowdown, which noted that President Richard Nixon and Congress in 1970 replaced the Cabinet-level Post Office with the postal service, to be governed by a board and funded by postage sales. And contrary to reports, Hightower wrote then, the service had enjoyed "operational" profits, though the mandate to pre-pay retiree health benefits was costing $5.5 billion a year in "money taken right out of postage revenue that could be going to services." In 2011, PolitiFact rated as Half True a claim that the 2006 law "drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts." The law required payments of approximately that amount, and the payments greatly hurt the post office's bottom line. However, those additional overpayments were also subject to debate and the law was hardly the only challenge faced by the service. Not a dime of tax aid since '71? The 1970 act launching the service called for it to be weaned from federal aid, a postal spokesman, Sam Bolen of San Marcos, told us by email. Still, from 1971 into the 1980s, nearly $9.2 billion in taxpayer money subsidized operations, according to a chart Bolen sent by email. Precisely, 10 percent to 11 percent of the service’s operating expenses from 1972 through 1974 were covered by congressional appropriations, according to the chart, with smaller shares funded through 1982. That year, $12 million in federal aid accounted for 0.1 percent of the service’s nearly $23 billion in operating expenses, the chart indicates. So, the service has not taken taxpayer dimes since 1982. By email, Ehrlich put us in touch with Steve Hutkins of New York, who oversees Save the Post Office, a website that presents information on post office closures and how citizens can object. Hutkins suggested we discount the taxpayer aid that went to the service after its inception, saying by email that that funding "was not because the postal service was running deficits... It was about making the transition to a self-sustaining footing." Operations funded from stamp sales Next, does the service rely solely on the sale of stamps and the like to fund operations? By email, Ehrlich pointed us to the Postal Service’s "Postal Facts" web page which states in part that the service "relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations." That’s correct, Bolen and another Postal Service spokesman, David Partenheimer, told us by telephone. Loans also help the service meet obligations and postal spokesman Stephen Seewoester of Dallas told us, "We are currently at our statutory borrowing limit of $15 billion." Then again, Partenheimer said, such loans are repaid, though he also said it would it would be inaccurate to say the service is financially thriving. "Operational profits" year after year? That brings us to Hightower's claim that the service has an "operational profit" year after year. To our inquiries, Ehrlich suggested by email that if not for the 2006 pre-funding law, the service would not have had recent cash-flow difficulties. She pointed out a Sept. 30, 2010, order from the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees postal-rate regulations, stating that if the mandate to pre-fund retiree benefits had not been imposed, the service "would maintain substantial end-of-year cash balances without any need to resort to borrowing." We looked for financial details. By email, postal spokesman Bolen told us the service last had an operational profit, of $900 million, in the fiscal year that ran through September 2006, while Hutkins of Save the Post Office said by email that the service’s financial statements show it’s been "close to breaking even" for years despite the pre-funding mandate. The service’s financial reports issued before Hightower sent his letter show consistent slight losses. In the first six months of fiscal 2013, through March 2013, the service reported $34 billion in revenues and $37 billion in expenses, Hutkins said. Its loss of $3 billion took into account $2.8 billion needed to pre-pay retiree health benefits, he said, leaving an "adjusted loss" of $245 million. A May 2013 update, covering eight months, shows $3.8 billion in losses counting $3.7 billion in pre-paid retiree health benefits. Hutkins wrote that since the annual pre-payments began in 2007, the Postal Service has lost $40 billion, counting $32 billion in the pre-payments. He said another $8 billion "involves adjustments to workers compensation that the Postal Service considers problematic (due to the way they're calculated). Over this period of time, the Postal Service has lost $34 million (a microscopic loss in the context of annual revenues averaging around $68 billion)." Hutkins said that over the decades, the service "has had years when it shows a profit, years when it shows a deficit. It hovers around breaking even. If the profits get too big, the mailers say rates are too high; if the deficit gets too big, Congress presses for cuts; when the cuts get too big and service goes down, customers and citizens complain, and Congress tells the postal service to find a middle ground. It's always about rates vs. service." By phone, postal spokesman Partenheimer said it’s incorrect that service has had an operational profit year after year. Partenheimer emailed us part of a Nov. 15, 2012 postal service presentation indicating that the service had an operational loss of $2.4 billion in the fiscal year through September 2012--without counting expenses including the required pre-payments. In his email, Partenheimer said the service previously defaulted on $11.1 billion of the health pre-payments and expects to default on $5.6 billion more this year. Broadly, he said, the service’s financial burdens will grow without changes such as elimination of Saturday mail delivery, an expansion in permitted products and services and financial adjustments related to workers’ compensation and how retiree health plans are supported. Our ruling Hightower said the postal service has taken no taxpayer aid since 1971, funds operations entirely from the sale of stamps and the like and makes an "operational profit year after year." The service funds operations from the sale of stamps and the like. Also, Congress in 1970 set a course for ending federal subsidies. But the last subsidies flowed in 1982, not 1971. Contrary to this claim, too, the service last enjoyed an operational profit in 2006, the year it was handed a costly mandate to quickly pre-fund decades of retiree health benefits. While the post office may be doing better than people think, we rate this claim as Mostly False.	None	Jim Hightower	None	None	None	2013-08-09T14:11:12	2013-05-01	['United_States']
pomt-13257	Says Donald Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/17/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-donald-trump-plan-end-estate-t/	Campaigning for Hillary Clinton on Oct. 5, 2016 in Madison, Wis., the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination hit hard at the Republican nominee. On one front, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont attacked Donald Trump for his plan to repeal the federal estate tax, claiming the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break." Sanders was repeating a claim he had made on Medium, Twitter and elsewhere. We found that broadly speaking, the descendants of Walmart founder Sam Walton could face a tax bill of about $53 billion that would go away if Trump’s proposal became law. But that figure is based on estimates and without knowing the family members’ tax planning. And another Trump proposal would mean the descendants would face capital gains taxes on their inheritance perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars. The estate tax A few preliminary points before we dig into the Waltons’ wealth: The federal estate tax, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, is a tax "on your right to transfer property at your death." It consists of an accounting of everything you own, or have certain interests in, at the date of death. For 2016, an estate tax return must be filed if the estate is worth roughly $5.45 million or more. Trump is worth $3.7 billion, according to estimates done by Forbes for its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, although he has claimed he’s worth $10 billion. Clinton, who with Bill Clinton is worth perhaps $62 million, proposes to increase the estate tax for multimillionaires and billionaires, with rates as high as 65 percent. The Walton family Three times, twice on statements made by Sanders, we have rated claims that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. (Wealth being assets such as savings and retirement accounts, minus liabilities such as credit card debts and what’s unpaid on a home mortgage.) PolitiFact National in 2012, PolitiFact Wisconsin in 2013 and PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, each arrived at a rating of True. In those fact checks, we considered six people as being the Walton family. However, a seventh family member (Lukas Walton) joined the Forbes list in 2016. Here is their wealth, according to "real time" estimates by the Forbes 400 on the day Sanders made his claim: Jim Walton (son): $35.1 billion S. Robson Walton (son): $35 billion Alice Walton (daughter): $34.9 billion Lukas Walton (grandson): $11.2 billion Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $6.2 billion Christy Walton (daughter-in-law to Sam): $5.5 billion Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4.5 billion That’s a total of more than $132 billion. Under current law, and if the wealth estimates are accurate, that amount would be subject to a federal estate tax of 40 percent when the individuals die -- roughly the $53 billion that Sanders said. We consulted with five experts: Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center; Howard Erlanger, a trusts and estates expert and emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School; Edward Koren, University of Miami adjunct professor in estate planning and a partner at the international law firm Holland & Knight; Texas Tech University Law School professor Gerry Beyer, who edits the Wills, Trusts & Estates Prof Blog; and Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. According to the experts, there are at least two factors indicating that the actual tax due would be less than $53 billion -- possibly much less. 1. Charitable donations Wealthy people often designate a substantial portion of their assets to be donated to charity upon their death. Those funds are not subject to the estate tax. Koren gave this example: If $100 billion of the total $132 billion were designated for charity, the estate tax owed would be $13 billion, not $53 billion. It’s also possible that some assets could be shielded by tax avoidance techniques, Viard said. 2. Trump’s other proposal In addition to proposing a repeal of the estate tax, Trump has proposed to repeal a tax rule that, if approved, would result in the Walton heirs paying more in capital gains taxes. So, under Trump’s plan, there wouldn’t be an estate tax -- under which taxes must be paid essentially right away -- but an increase in capital gains taxes, which don’t have to be paid until assets are sold. It is impossible to know exactly how much of a capital gains tax the Waltons would face under Trump’s proposed change, but it could be tens of billions of dollars. On the other hand, unlike the estate tax, the next generation of Waltons could defer paying the capital gains tax for as long as they hold onto the assets they inherit. Our rating Sanders says Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break." Based on the collective wealth of seven Sam Walton descendants, they could face a tax of about $53 billion under the current estate tax law. But that amount is based on estimates of their wealth and it would be reduced based on any charitable donations the family members might arrange for upon their death. Meanwhile, Trump also proposes higher capital gains taxes, which could amount to a tax bill of tens of billions for the Walton heirs -- although that tax wouldn’t be imposed until they sell assets such as Walmart stock For a claim that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9673993-3e57-4e72-a28f-a546f1e4376e	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-10-17T05:00:00	2016-10-05	['None']

pomt-10626	Barack Obama "said in 2004 there was no difference between (Obama) and George Bush on the war."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/14/bill-clinton/bill-takes-obama-out-of-context/	In the heat of the campaign for New Hampshire — a battle Hillary Clinton ultimately won — Bill Clinton attacked Barack Obama, saying the media hasn't thoroughly vetted Obama's record of opposing the war: "It is wrong that Senator Obama got to go through 15 debates trumpeting his superior judgment and how he had been against the war in every year, enumerating the years — and never got asked one time, not once, 'Well, how could you say that, when you said in 2004 you didn't know how you would have voted on the resolution, you said in 2004 there was no difference between you and George Bush on the war. And you took that speech you're now running on off your Web site in 2004 and there's no difference in your voting record and Hillary's ever since?' Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen." Clinton's argument is that Obama's opposition to the war hasn't been consistent. Interestingly, this is similar to the argument the Republican National Committee made in September 2007 against Obama and Hillary Clinton, and we checked the RNC's allegations here . We also checked Obama's statement, "I opposed the war in 2002. I opposed the war in 2003. I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006." We found that to be true. (Check it out here .) (Hey, Bill, aren't you reading PolitiFact?) The former president and his wife have been on the offensive against Obama, trying to poke holes in his long opposition to the war. That opposition has thus far appeared to be an advantage for Obama because Hillary Clinton voted for the war authorization. In this case, Bill Clinton is citing Obama's statement, taken from a Chicago Tribune interview on the eve of the 2004 Democratic convention to nominate John Kerry for president. "On Iraq, on paper, there's not as much difference, I think, between the Bush administration and a Kerry administration as there would have been a year ago," Obama said. "There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage." The "at this stage" is an important caveat, one Bill Clinton left out. Taking the interview in its entirety, it's clear Obama is speaking about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced. "How do you stabilize a country that is made up of three different religious and in some cases ethnic groups with a minimal loss of life and minimum burden to the taxpayers?" Obama said later in the interview. His overall sentiment seems to be now that the war has started, the United States should do the best job it can to steer Iraq toward stability. This position is not the same thing as condoning the invasion after the fact. On the question of Obama saying his position on the war is similar to George W. Bush's, we find that Bill Clinton is quoting the essence of Obama's statement, but leaving out important context. We find his statement to be Half True.

pomt-02670	"When I was Mayor of South Pasadena, we actually reduced the property taxes we collected."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/10/kathleen-peters/kathleen-peters-says-south-pasadena-reduced-amount/	Heading into the home stretch for the Jan. 14 Republican primary for the late C.W. Bill Young’s House seat, Kathleen Peters is clarifying her platform and trumpeting her achievements. "What can one mother and grandmother from Pinellas do to stop gridlock and fix Washington?" asked Peters in a mailer we received on Jan. 8. Her answer: "Lower taxes." "When I was Mayor of South Pasadena, we actually reduced the property taxes we collected," the flier read. It then added, "In fact, my city had the third lowest property tax rate of the 24 cities in Pinellas." Talking about reducing taxes is a surefire way for a candidate to get voters to pay attention, but the wording seemed curious to us. Can Peters take credit for South Pasadena’s lower tax collections? It’s time for an audit. A taxing campaign Peters served as mayor of South Pasadena from 2008 to 2012, when she left before the end of her term to become a state representative. Before that, she was on the South Pasadena Planning and Zoning Board for two years, serving on the Charter Review Committee. Property taxes are a subject Peters knows well. During her state House run, Democratic opponent Josh Shulman brought up the fact that she had a history of being late paying the taxes on her former St. Pete Beach business, Captain’s Convenience Mart. Records show she paid almost $900 in late fees and penalties between 2000 and 2007. She also was late paying the property taxes on her house in 2007 and 2012, drawing just more than $200 in fees and penalties. Her campaign has noted there was never a lien on the properties, however, and all taxes and fines were paid within the calendar year they were due. She’s arguing that her city of about 5,000 took in less than before she was mayor, though. A review of South Pasadena’s annual financial reports provided the amount of property taxes the city collected during Peters' tenure. Per year, collections totaled: 2009: $790,739 2010: $782,473 2011: $717,208 2012: $694,645 It’s interesting to note that these years coincided with the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery, which brought down property values across the state following the housing bust. Collections in 2009 actually went up slightly from the prior year, from $789,282 to $790,739, but the reason isn’t because property values increased. The City Commission in fiscal year 2009 actually raised South Pasadena’s millage rate (dollars per thousand) to 1.4886 from the previous year’s rate of 1.2749 mills. The financial report says 2009 taxable property values were almost $91 million lower than 2008, down from $639.4 million to $548.6 million. In 2010, the city’s millage rate went up again, to 1.6985 mills (that was the third-lowest rate in the county, behind North Redington Beach and Belleair Shore). Taxable property values fell another $73 million that fiscal year, to $475.6 million. The millage rate stayed at that level for 2011 and 2012, but taxable property values continued to fall, down to $437.2 million in 2011 and $424.2 million in 2012. By the end of her term as mayor, Peters had overseen a significant decrease in property tax collections, to the tune of just more than $96,000 per year. The City Commission had actually increased the millage rate during her time, however, and she was mayor during a time taxable property values fell more than $215 million from 2008 levels. Overall, taxes fell because property values fell, not because of any specific action Peters took. Our ruling Peters attempted to tout her record on property taxes, saying in her mailer that as mayor of South Pasadena "we actually reduced the property taxes we collected." As a campaign promise, that implies she had a part in lowering taxes in her city. When we looked at the city’s annual financial reports, we found she actually presided over an increase in the millage rate, and tax collections fell because of a drastic reduction in taxable property values. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02652	Oregon Rep. Tina Kotek, D-Portland, has "never held a job nor run a business"	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/15/bill-post/has-rep-tina-kotek-d-portland-ever-held-job/	The meteoric rise of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook has not been lost on politicians. Rare is the officeholder or candidate who doesn’t take advantage of social media’s inexpensive platforms to reach targeted audiences. Still, rules and etiquette remain murky. Most users understand that using all-caps is like yelling, but finer points remain a work in progress. Conservative radio talk-show host Bill Post, a newly announced Republican candidate for the Oregon House, got into a spirited back-and-forth Jan. 9 on Twitter with Carla Axtman, an editor for Blue Oregon, a left-leaning political blog. When Post held himself out as a "real citizen legislator," Axtman shot back that "we need a professional legislature now. The citizen leg model is rinky dink." Post asked Axtman to define "professional." Then, referring to the Democratic speaker of the House, he added: "Tina Kotek? What profession is she? Never held a job nor run a business." We wondered if that was true. Has Kotek never held a job or run a business? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed Kotek’s Salem office and received a reply from Jared Mason-Gere, her communications director. He provided details of Kotek’s work history, a couple of which are also listed on her official website. "Most recently she has been a self-employed independent contractor working as a management consultant for nonprofit organizations," Mason-Gere wrote of Kotek, who was first elected to House District 44 representing parts of North and Northeast Portland in 2006. Before that, he said, she was policy director for Children First For Oregon after spending several years working for the Oregon Food Bank. "Like the rest of us," Mason-Gere said, "she also had a variety of jobs during and after college. While she was getting her Master’s degree, she worked as a graduate teaching assistant; she’s been a travel agent, office temp, and office administrator among other things." When she was growing up in York, Pa., he added, she and her brother delivered the York Dispatch newspaper. Checks with both Children First for Oregon and the Oregon Food Bank confirmed that Kotek worked in the jobs indicated by Mason-Gere and her website. We called Post for a response. Asked first about his exchange with Axtman, he said, "Twitter is Twitter. Twitter is yelling back and forth. I see Twitter as passing notes in high school. I don’t take it too serious." Asked about Kotek, Post said, "Define job for me. I don’t know her history. I just pulled that out of my hat." At that point, Post excused himself, saying he needed to prepare for his afternoon radio show. We called him back afterward. He said the real point of his exchange with Axtman involved debating the merits of a citizen versus professional legislature. "What Carla wants is a full-time paid legislature," Post said. "I was goading her to say that out loud. I just threw a name out. It could have been (Oregon Senate President) Peter Courtney. It could have been anyone." Informed of Kotek’s work history, he added, "Is lobbying a job? I suppose it is. You get paid for it. I guess I’m wrong. That’s a job." We circled back to Post’s initial dismissal of Twitter as akin to "passing notes in high school," noting that his own Twitter account has been used to highlight guests on his upcoming radio shows and his various campaign events. He agreed that the medium has valuable uses, adding that he has an intern who posts on his account "all day." He acknowledged that he was the one in the back-and-forth with Axtman, though. The second part of Post’s claim, that Kotek has "never run a business," is largely correct. Kotek has worked as a self-employed consultant, advising nonprofits on business operations, but she didn’t have business cards, a website or a state filing. Neither has she ever claimed to have run a business, Mason-Gere said. Post took to Twitter to argue with a blogger about the nature of the Oregon Legislature -- citizen or professional? In doing so, he claimed that Kotek had "never held a job nor run a business." Granted, use of social media such as Twitter and Facebook continues to evolve, but Post’s claim about Kotek’s job history is just plain wrong. She has, in fact held a number of jobs, including ranking administrative positions. Kotek hasn’t "run a business" in the traditional sense but has worked as a self-employed consultant. Post did later admit he was wrong on his assertion. But he also acknowledged that he made his claim about Kotek with zero research or knowledge -- noting, even, that "It could have been anyone" and "I just pulled that out of my hat." That shows an extreme disregard for the truth. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bill Post	None	None	None	2014-01-15T16:13:13	2014-01-09	['None']

pomt-13797	As a senator, Hillary Clinton "paid women less than the men" in her office.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/19/sharon-day/floridas-sharon-day-misleads-hillary-clinton-and-g/	Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite for playing the gender card, says Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee from South Florida. "She repeatedly plays the gender card. In fact she boasts ‘deal me in.’ Well, Mrs. Clinton, consider yourself dealt in because as a senator you paid women less than the men in your office," said Day at the Republican convention July 19. The gender pay gap is a frequent talking point -- sometimes botched -- by Democrats. So Day, a prominent Republican woman, is calling out the Democratic Party’s own here for the alleged sin of unequal pay. We could not reach Day Tuesday night. Gender pay gap? In 2015, we fact-checked a claim by Fox News’ Sean Hannity that as a senator, Hillary Clinton "actually paid female staffers a lot less than men." We rated that claim Mostly False. Hannity’s statement followed a Washington Free Beacon story that stated Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. The article examined data from Senate expenditure reports from 2002-08 posted by LegiStorm Pro, a company that posts information about congressional staff including salary data. The website warns users about extrapolating exact salary information because earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence. The data focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York’s junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office. The Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year. Regardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men. "The salaries speak for themselves," the story says. "The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men." Clinton campaign responds Buzzfeed reached a different conclusion in 2015 in a story headlined, "Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally." The story was based on 2015 salary data for full-time staffers who worked in the Senate office, plus what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President between 2002-08. The data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton’s pay, since all senators have the same salary set by law.) The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too. The campaign argued this is a better picture of a staffer’s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to work for Clinton’s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton’s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year. "The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers," Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact in 2015. "The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally." If you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men’s pay in 2006 and 2007. One caveat: there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year. But neither set of data fully answers whether Clinton paid men and women equally because it doesn’t compare wages for men and women who do the same work. Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, previously told PolitiFact it’s common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign’s approach. Making apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, "but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis." Our ruling Day said that as a senator Clinton "paid women less than the men in your office." The data used by Free Beacon showed that the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office. But this data has several caveats, including that it omits leaves of absences, which are common for staffers to work on campaigns. The data also didn’t contain Clinton’s first nine months in office or staffers who left after less than a year. A BuzzFeed analysis relied on more complete data and found the same median salary for men and women. But neither set of data fully answers the question about whether Clinton paid women and men the same amount for the same work.

pomt-09559	"Bill White has presided over the construction of what may be the world's largest abortion clinic."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jan/31/republican-party-texas/gop-says-white-allowed-gigantic-abortion-mill-be-b/	Jan. 22 marked the 37th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which protects a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy. In honor of the occasion, the Republican Party of Texas linked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White to what it called a "gigantic abortion mill" in Houston. We saw the claim in an e-mail the party distributed last week: "In Houston, former mayor and now Democratic contender for governor Bill White has presided over the construction of what may be the world's largest abortion clinic. White bills himself as a moderate Democrat, but his administration allowed this 6-floor, 78,000 square foot facility to be built." In its e-mail, the GOP added a dramatic kicker: "And there's more to this awful story: White's director of Health Policy was one Elena Marks. Ms. Marks is (or was) also the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Bill White's connection to this gigantic abortion mill is undeniable; he holds no claim to being a moderate Democrat." That's quite an indictment. Is it true? Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, said: "Bill White had nothing to do with a Planned Parenthood facility." Bryan Preston, communications director for the state party, said: "It happened under his watch, and he had someone working with him in his administration that he appointed that is closely connected to Planned Parenthood." What we found: This March, Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, which opened more than 75 years ago, plans to move from its current location to a building it began refurbishing in 2008 with $17 million in private donations. The seven-story, 78,000-square-foot former Sterling Bank building on Houston's Gulf Freeway will be the biggest Planned Parenthood facility in the United States, according to Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla. The new facility includes a surgical suite that will provide the same services that the current location has offered since 1973. Currently, the clinic performs about 20 abortions per day. Tafolla said more than 90 percent of the clinic's services relate to preventative care, such as breast exams and cervical cancer screening. The city issued Planned Parenthood a demolition permit to begin the project in 2008, and several building permits since for various aspects of the construction, Tafolla said. However, the mayor has no role in approving such permits, said Janice Evans, director of communications for Houston Mayor Annise Parker, White's successor. Evans said: "We have thousands of building permits, they do not come to (the) city council." Andy Icken, Houston's deputy director of public works, said his department reviewed Planned Parenthood's application for building permits to make sure they complied with the city's building code. Icken also said that nobody from the mayor's office interfered with the application process. According to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services, facilities seeking to perform abortions apply to the state Department of State Health Services to be licensed in Texas. City officials do not sign off on whether facilities can perform abortions. What about Elena Marks, White's then-director of health and environmental policy? Did she play a role in getting city approval for the facility? Marks didn't return our phone calls, though we confirmed separately that Marks served on the board of directors for Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas from 1993-2004. In 2007, Marks joined the national board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which doesn't supervise local affiliates but sets general policy for the entire organization, according to Tait Sye, a federation spokesman. Marks previously was the board chair of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the PAC for the national organization. Contrary to the GOP's claim, Marks was never the Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America; the position doesn't exist. Since 2001, Marks has personally donated about $3,500 to Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. Her latest donation was in March 2007, according to a search of campaign finance records kept by the Texas Ethics Commission. We found no evidence that Marks used her official position to ensure approval of the building permits. This much is true: White was mayor when Planned Parenthood started renovating a building to become its new facility. Using the GOP's logic, White also "presided" over Hurricane Katrina and the Houston Astros going to the World Series and countless other coincidental events. But as far as we could tell, White was no more responsible for the Planned Parenthood construction than he controlled the weather, baseball playoffs or other non-mayoral events. We rate the Texas GOP's claim ridiculously Pants on Fire. This story was updated to correct the number of abortions Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas performs each week to 20 per day.

pomt-11962	The Las Vegas shooting was the "273rd mass shooting" in the United States so far in 2017.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/04/tammy-baldwin/was-las-vegas-mass-shooting-273rd-year-or-seventh-/	In an email released to reporters on Oct. 3, 2017, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin lamented the mass shooting in Las Vegas two days earlier, calling it "the 273rd mass shooting this year." There’s no question it was a massacre: A lone gunman perched high in a hotel suite killed 59 people, including a Wisconsin native, who had gathered for an outdoor country music concert. More than 500 people were injured. But have there really been 273 mass shootings in the United States so far in 2017, as the Wisconsin Democrat says? What a ‘mass shooting’ is SFGate.com, which is associated with the San Francisco Chronicle, reported that on the morning after the Las Vegas incident, many news media and social media users were calling it the 273rd mass shooting of the year. But the actual number depends on the source being cited. Here’s a look at two counts as of Oct. 3, 2017 that reveal two extremes: Source Mass shooting definition Count of 2017 mass shootings Gun Violence Archive, nonprofit organization Four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter. 273 Mother Jones, liberal magazine A single attack in a public place in which three or more victims were killed. 7 Baldwin was relying on the Gun Violence Archive figure, her campaign told us. (The first-term senator is up for re-election in 2018.) For an idea of how broadly the archive views mass shootings, here are the circumstances of the two incidents that occurred before the Las Vegas shooting, according to news reports: A shooting in Memphis, Tenn., was believed to be the result of someone bringing a gun to a fight. A shooting in Lawrence, Kan., occurred in a street during a fight involving a number of people. There are other definitions of mass shootings, as well, including some that have produced much lower counts. The non-profit Everytown for Gun Safety -- counting incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter -- said there were 156 mass shootings from 2009 through 2016. That’s an average of 19.5 per year. The Washington Post counted 131 events in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (or two shooters in three cases), dating back to the University of Texas tower killings in 1966. That’s an average of less than three mass shootings per year. The Post didn’t count gang killings, shootings that began as other crimes such as robberies, and killings that involved only the shooter’s family. The point is: There is no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. Indeed, we’ve run into this before. Almost exactly two years before Baldwin made her claim, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., said that at that point in 2015 there had been 294 mass shootings. That number also came from the Gun Violence Archive. PolitiFact Florida rated her statement Half True, saying she relied on an overly broad definition of what most people would consider a mass shooting, counting people shot in bar fights along with victims of school shootings. Our rating Baldwin says the Las Vegas shooting was the "273rd mass shooting" in the United States so far in 2017. She cites a source that arrived at that figure using a very broad definition of mass shooting. Other sources use narrower definitions that yield much lower counts. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. Note: This item was changed on Oct. 5, 2017 to indicate that, beginning in 2013, Mother Jones changed its definition of mass shooting to three or more victims, rather than four. This change does not affect the rating. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2017-10-04T12:02:52	2017-10-03	['United_States', 'Las_Vegas']
pomt-01849	U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston "spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/15/david-perdue/perdues-earmark-claim-overstated/	The accusations are flying fast and furious between U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston and businessman David Perdue as we edge closer to the Republican primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Both claim to be the conservative candidate in the close, and closely watched, contest that voters will decide on July 22. And for the second time, Perdue is leveling accusations about earmarks, the money lawmakers pull from the federal budget for pet projects in their jurisdictions. "Jack Kingston spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks," Perdue claims in the ad, "Spender." PolitiFact Georgia already looked into Perdue’s earlier claims that Kingston requested more earmarks than any other congressman from Georgia and more than all Georgia Republicans combined. With between $211 million and $213 million in earmarks between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, we found that claim Mostly True. But the database from the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org and a separate data set from Taxpayers for Common Sense showed only 145 and 146 earmarks, respectively, in that period. So thousands? "He has voted for thousands of earmarks, not just his own, wasting tax dollars," said Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s chief of staff. "Take the 2005 transportation bill, which has 6,300 earmarks alone." The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act authorized spending $286 billion to be doled out over five years. While the majority of the money was funneled to road construction and public transit projects, the bill also contained a record 6,371 earmarks from members of both parties. Kingston was among those who voted in favor of that bill, despite a long-standing push to overhaul the earmark process. Criticism over those projects, and the punch line "Bridge to Nowhere," helped prompt Congress to ban earmarks in 2010. Shortly thereafter, Kingston began saying that lawmakers may have overreacted. In 2010, Kingston told the political website Politico that the definition of earmarks, if not the ban, needed review. "Let’s look at transportation," he said. "How do you handle that without earmarks, since that’s a heavily earmarked bill?" Earlier this month, Kingston defended his earmarks to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as support for military and defense projects in a state with eight military installations. His spokesman, Chris Crawford, called the accusation that Kingston supported thousands of earmarks false on its face – given the hundreds specifically tied to Kingston’s name. He also said it was a "blatant fabrication" trying to link Kingston to other lawmakers’ projects. In fact, Kingston may have a point, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The nonpartisan organization opposes earmarks because the system rewards political power over project merit. But Ellis said Kingston, or any lawmaker of his tenure, would have voted for thousands of earmarks simply by voting to fund the government. In some cases, lawmakers would chop spending, say for the Department of Defense, into dozens of earmarks. In other cases, earmarks were added to programs, driving up the overall cost. But the final vote reflects support for an overall defense budget bill, not the pet projects inside. Even the most die-hard opponent of pork would have cast votes that included money for state or local projects such as paving roads. "It’s not like he voted for these (earmarks) separately," Ellis said. "They were stuffed into bills." So, did Kingston vote on thousands of earmarks? In a word, yes. But so does any other lawmaker who votes for major legislation such as transportation funding. Perdue would have been on firmer ground if he had attributed to Kingston the specific earmarks for his district. Were the earmarks wasteful as the statement claims? That’s far trickier to prove. Those votes were taken as part of a central function of Congress, to vote on the budget. There’s a bit of truth in Perdue’s claim, but just a bit. We rate his statement Mostly False.

Obama avoided specifics in favor of several general points: Government needs to secure the borders, but it also needs to reduce red tape and backlogs for legal immigrants. Businesses need to obey laws that forbid the hiring of illegal immigrants. And illegal immigrants need to register with the government, pay taxes and fines, and learn English. Obama said government efforts to secure the border are farther along than some might think. "Government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders," Obama said. "That's why I directed my Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano -- a former border governor -- to improve our enforcement policy without having to wait for a new law. Today, we have more boots on the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history. Let me repeat that: We have more boots on the ground on the Southwest border than at any time in our history." Just because someone repeats something doesn't mean it's true, so we decided to check it out. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there are approximately 21,000 border agents charged with monitoring the country's borders. Most -- but not all -- are assigned to the Southwest border, that is, the land border that stretches from California to Texas. The number assigned to the area has been dramatically increasing in recent years. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a division of DHS, told us that 17,057 agents are now assigned to that border, up dramatically from 6,315 in 1997. Additionally, a report from the Congressional Research Service documented a steep increase in border agents, increasing every year since 1992. "The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration," the report concluded. The impact of the additional agents, though, has been difficult to gauge, the report noted. For several years, from 1994 to 2000, apprehensions of illegal immigrants near the Mexican border increased. In other years, the number of apprehensions decreased, seemingly along with downturns in the U.S. economy, the report noted. And in 2009, apprehensions reached a 17-year low. We checked in with groups that favor low levels of immigration to see what they thought of Obama's statement. They said the fact was accurate, but pointed out that President George W. Bush was responsible for adding many of the agents on the ground now. Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies said that the Obama administration could do more on enforcement in the interior of the country, such as stricter checks on employees' immigration status or a new entry-exit monitoring system for people here on temporary visas. "Border patrol without interior enforcement is like locking your front door and leaving the back door open," he said. We thought we were done here, but then the history buffs at PolitiFact brought up the Mexican-American War of 1846 and the lesser known Mexican Expedition of 1916. Should those military activities count as "boots on the ground on the Southwest border?" We decided that the Mexican-American War should not count -- this was a war that happened after the United States annexed Texas in 1845, so it was more of a battle to define the border than defend it. The Mexican Expedition was a little different, though. Those events occurred during the Mexican Revolution, when Pancho Villa launched a surprise attack inside the United States at Columbus, N.M. History books say that President Woodrow Wilson sent somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the border in 1916. The historians we asked, though, said the Mexican Expedition isn't directly comparable with the border situation today. "During the Mexican insurrection, Pancho Villa raided into U.S. territory. It was, then, not about attempts by Mexicans to get into the U.S. individually for various personal reasons, or drug smuggling, etc.," said Richard H. Kohn, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an e-mail interview. Another historian, Paul Christopher Anderson of Clemson University, agreed that today's concerns with stopping immigration are very different from the worries of the early 1900s. "The U.S. involvement on the border and in Mexico from 1913 to 1917 was tied primarily to questions of diplomacy, imperialism, and Mexican sovereignty," he said via e-mail. Arguments about immigration enforcement will no doubt go on, but Obama's statement on border agents is sound in the context of today's debate. "Today, we have more boots on the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history," he said. We do have more agents than anytime since the early 1990s. But there have been times in our history when the U.S sent troops to the border, and many more people than are there to guard the border today. We want to allow for that complicated history, and so we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-07-02T14:34:41	2010-07-01	['None']
pomt-12896	"The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/23/george-takei/george-takei-says-white-house-removed-pages-about-/	Barack Obama was the first president to have a robust digital strategy. His team was active on social media, and they constantly uploaded new content and tools to the White House website. But after President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, some critics of the new administration noticed that pages about issues of importance to Obama are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov. "The White House removed its climate change web page. And the health care, civil rights and LGBT sections," tweeted George Takei, the former Star Trek actor who now has a large online fanbase. Takei is correct that as of Jan. 23, whitehouse.gov doesn’t have any specific information about climate change, health care, civil rights or LGBT issues. But these changes are routine and reflect the differences between Obama’s and Trump’s priorities. Back in October, the Obama administration laid out how it would manage the digital transition. The National Archives and Records Administration would preserve every piece of content the Obama administration published online — everything from blog posts and Tweets to transcripts and Snapchat stories. The National Archives would also freeze and archive any content posted to whitehouse.gov, then the Obama administration would hand over the domain to the Trump administration. The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues. So if we’re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov’s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published. The Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade. The Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. (Their websites are archived at georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov and clinton4.nara.gov, respectively.) The National Archives treats whitehouse.gov as a presidential record and follows the relevant regulations to preserve the content for posterity, while "the new administration is free to shape a ‘new’ White House website going forward," said Douglas Cox, a law professor and expert in information policy at the City University of New York. Cox added as an aside that while whitehouse.gov is well-preserved from administration to administration, the websites for federal agencies may not be. So there is a bigger concern that federal records produced by the agencies in prior administrations may get lost. When the Obama team took over whitehouse.gov, they completely replaced all of Bush’s policy pages with 24 of their own, reflecting the new administration’s agenda, said Macon Phillips, who oversaw the website changes as Obama’s director of new media during the 2008 transition. The change from Bush’s version of whitehouse.gov to Obama’s was dramatic in its own way. While Trump kept the same digital platform the Obama team used, Obama’s transition team was working with a brand new one. Here’s a screenshot of whitehouse.gov on the morning of Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration, next to a screenshot from that same evening (found using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine): Phillips said the fact that the Trump website doesn’t have pages about things like LGBT issues and climate change isn’t really about the new administration removing pages — it’s more that his team just hasn’t made those issues a priority. "Whitehouse.gov should reflect the priorities and point of view of the president. It’s a tool of that office," said Phillips, who just ended three years as coordinator of the State Department’s International Information Programs Bureau. The Trump administration did keep one notable page from the Obama administration’s whitehouse.gov: the We the People page, where the public can sign electronic petitions. Under the Obama administration, any petition to garner 100,000 signatures in under 30 days would receive a response from the White House. A petition for Trump to release his tax returns got more than 271,000 signatures in four days. It’s unclear if the new administration will officially respond to the petition. Our ruling Takei said, "The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections." It is literally accurate that since Trump became president, whitehouse.gov no longer has specific issue pages about health care, civil rights, LGBT issues or climate change. This reflects a difference in priorities between the Obama and Trump administrations. But it’s important to keep in mind that when the Obama administration handed the whitehouse.gov domain to Trump’s team, it was a blank slate. All of the online content published during Obama’s term was purged and archived. They’re now available on a website set up by the National Archives, as was done at the end of the Clinton and Bush administrations. While Takei’s claim has truth to it, this additional context is important, so we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09113	"On the pace that we're on with job creation in the last four months ... we will have created more jobs in this year than in the entire Bush Presidency."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/18/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-job-creation-2010-pa/	Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is using employment figures to make a bold comparison between Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. "On the pace that we're on with job creation in the last four months -- if we continue on that pace -- all the leading economists say it is likely that we will -- we will have created more jobs in this year than in the entire Bush Presidency," Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Weston, said on FOX News. The comment has continued to spread across the Internet since she spoke back on May 26, 2010. Karl Rove posted a message on Twitter on June 9, 2010, highlighting Wasserman Schultz's quote as "the new Democratic claim about job creation." So we wanted to see how it stacks up. The claim, in this case, is pretty straightforward: President Obama is on pace to create more jobs in 2010 than President Bush did in his eight years of office. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the government agency that keeps the official tally. It posts monthly employment figures, and labor statistics reports are the ones cited in news accounts detailing job growth, job losses and unemployment numbers. Wasserman Schultz's comments came in May, when the BLS had released job employment totals from January through April. Since then, May figures also have been released. In those five months, 982,000 new jobs have been added to the U.S. economy -- or nearly 196,000 new jobs a month. If that growth holds -- and obviously that's an if -- the economy will have added a total of 2.356 million jobs in 2010 (Multiplying 196,400 by 12). That's twice the total job growth during Bush's eight years in office, which were marked by two recessions and generally dismal job growth. Total employment increased just slightly from January 2001 to January 2009 -- by 1.08 million, according to the BLS. So Wasserman Schultz is accurate. In fact, Obama is on a pace to create twice as many jobs in 2010 as Bush did in eight years. But that doesn't mean it's a meaningful statistic. Take, for example, some other accurate statistics we can create using the same figures. If job growth continues on pace in 2010, employment still will have decreased by 1.6 million jobs since Obama took office in 2009. While Obama is on a pace to add 2.356 million jobs in 2010, Bush created 2.36 million jobs in 2005 (a specific year to year comparison). And from April 2003 to June 2007, while Bush was president, the U.S. economy added almost 7.9 million jobs. All true. And all in seeming contradiction to Wasserman Schultz's claim. Why? Because we cherry-picked numbers to make our point. Just like she did. We asked two economists to examine Wasserman Schultz's claim -- Dean Baker with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institute. Neither was particularly impressed. "Strictly speaking, Rep. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is credible," Burtless said. "Whether it is a meaningful or useful assessment is another question." Added Baker: "This is a silly but true statement." Later, he called the comparison Wasserman Schultz was attempting to make "dubious," but literally accurate. None of that factors in that more than 400,000 of the new jobs are temporary jobs created to complete the 2010 U.S. Census. Wasserman Schultz gets her numbers right in saying that the U.S. in 2010 is on a pace to add more jobs to the economy than during the eight years George W. Bush was president. But the comparison is misleading because it ignores the job losses in 2009, and compares one year to eight. In fact, you can take the same statistics and reach an entirely different point. Not that we recommend that. We rate Wasserman Schultz's statement Half True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2010-06-18T16:06:59	2010-05-26	['None']

pomt-08718	"When Pepper’s tax was finally voted down, Pepper laid off cops and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/03/dave-yost/republican-dave-yost-attacks-democratic-david-pepp/	The auditor’s role in state government is obscure to many voters, so the Republican candidate in this year’s race has attacked his opponent on taxes, a much more familiar issue. In a recent online video, Republican Dave Yost lists a handful of tax increases Democrat David Pepper supported as a commissioner in Cincinnati’s Hamilton County. As the taxes are recounted, the video’s narrator issues a brief warning to voters about Pepper’s solution after voters rejected a tax hike he pushed. "When Pepper's tax was finally voted down, Pepper laid off cops, and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets," the video’s narrator said. We found facts to back up Yost’s statement, but the underlying message that Pepper negligently endangered the public is misleading. Pepper is judged here on two votes he made as one of three Hamilton County commissioners: One in favor of a tax hike and another in approval of the county’s 2009 budget. Pepper and another commissioner, without a vote of the people, raised the sales tax in 2007 to pay for a "comprehensive safety plan," which called for a new jail and holding steady the number of deputies patrolling the streets. The third commissioner voted against the tax hike. Voters later followed suit, rejecting the tax increase when petitioners forced it on the ballot. Yost’s video makes no mention that "Pepper’s tax" was an attempt to boost public safety. Hamilton County, without any money for a new jail, continued to pay rent at other correctional facilities. The economy worsened over the next year, and commissioners realized they would have to slash budgets in 2009. The sheriff’s budget was slashed 16 percent, from 74.8 million to 62.8 million. The cut forced 165 layoffs, including 24 patrol officers, closed the Queensgate Correctional Facility and resulted in more prisoners getting released before their sentence ended. All of these consequences were laid out before Pepper and the other commissioners unanimously approved the budget. Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis, a Republican who’s held the job for more than 20 years, had the final say on how to spend his budget. He said there was no choice but to close the jail and lay off workers. He would not blame Pepper because he tried to pay for a new jail and keep police on the street by temporarily raising the sales tax. Voters also rejected a tax levy for a new jail in 2006, before Pepper became a county commissioner. "The voters had two chances to solve the problem, and they turned it down both times," Leis said in a phone interview. The fact remains, however, that Pepper voted in favor of a county budget he knew would reduce the sheriff’s staff and shutter an 822-bed jail at a time when prisoner overcrowding already was a longtime problem. Early releases of prisoners spiked to 501 in 2009 after Queensgate was closed in late 2008. The county saw 143 early releases in 2008 and 106 in 2007, according to the sheriff’s department. So there’s no doubt the county budget Pepper approved resulted in laid off cops, the shuttering of a prison and more criminals on the street. But Yost’s claim exaggerates Pepper’s role in the matter. And it says Pepper closed multiple jails, when only one was closed as a result of the 2009 budget. Each commissioner’s vote carries equal weight, yet the video solely blames Pepper for the actions of the entire board, made of two Democrats and one Republican. Solely blaming Pepper also excuses the sheriff, who ultimately decides how to spend the money commissioners allot him. And the county’s hand was forced when voters rejected the 2007 tax increase to fund public safety. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12776	On whether the Senate should vote in a timely manner on a Supreme Court nominee.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/22/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem/	Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin was one of many U.S. senators who abruptly switched from offense to defense in the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The contrast has been particularly sharp when it comes to Supreme Court nominees. Baldwin, a Democrat, was a vocal supporter of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee, but was quick to push back against Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch. When Garland was nominated in March 2016, Republicans moved to block his nomination, which prompted the ire of Democrats. Baldwin declared: "It’s the constitutional duty of the president to select a Supreme Court nominee, and the Senate has a responsibility to give that nominee a fair consideration with a timely hearing and a timely vote." Baldwin also tweeted in May 2016 that Garland deserved "an up or down vote," adding the hashtag #doyourjob. Since the Republican-led Senate never held a confirmation hearing or vote for Garland, the seat remained open for Trump to fill. He announced Gorsuch as that pick Jan. 31, 2017. Two days later, Baldwin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would support a filibuster to block the Gorsuch nomination, would vote against the Senate action required to block a filibuster and would vote against Gorsuch if he made it to a final vote. Is that consistent with her position on Garland’s nomination that the Senate should vote for a nominee in a timely manner? We thought that was a question for the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Not all votes created equal The Garland and Gorsuch nominations came up in dramatically different contexts — one a nominee late in a lame duck presidency, the other immediately after a highly divisive campaign. Baldwin — like most other senators — switched sides between the two nominees. In an email, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus said the senator’s position is consistent because she supported a hearing, a committee vote and a floor vote for both nominees. But the voting claim isn’t quite that simple. Figuring this out means diving into Senate rules of procedure. When the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours. For cloture to pass, it must be supported by 60 of the 100 senators. That creates a higher threshold for nomination. Gorsuch would otherwise need only a majority to be approved — and the Republicans hold that majority. Cloture is unusual but not unprecedented, having been used four times for Supreme Court nominees since 1968. Kraus said Baldwin is consistent because she "supports" a cloture vote, even though she would vote against Gorsuch in that vote. But cloture is a maneuver executed by the majority party (Republicans in this case), so Baldwin’s "support" for that is both unnecessary and irrelevant. (Cloture and the 60-vote threshold itself could also become irrelevant if Republicans choose to use what has been termed the "nuclear option," a parliamentary procedure by which they can use majority votes to override the requirement for a supermajority, effectively overcoming a filibuster with just 51 votes. Democrats did this to push through Obama’s lower court appointments in 2013, but it hasn’t been used for a Supreme Court nominee.) Baldwin said during the Garland process the Senate should give him "fair consideration," and she pledged the same thing to Gorsuch in a statement issued the day of his nomination. Two days later she announced plans to vote against Gorsuch, before meeting with him or participating in any hearing process. Gov. Scott Walker labeled Baldwin a hypocrite on Twitter for telling others to meet with Garland but deciding on Gorsuch before meeting with him. But Kraus said Baldwin had reviewed the backgrounds and records of Gorsuch and other finalists before Trump’s announcement. He said that allowed time to give fair consideration before deciding she would oppose Gorsuch due to a "record of ruling against disabled students, against workers and against women’s reproductive health care." Our rating When Baldwin’s party put forth a Supreme Court nominee, she advocated for a "timely vote" and an "up or down vote." A common-sense interpretation is that she wanted a final nomination vote, where passing meant being approved by the Senate. But now that Baldwin is in the minority and facing a Republican nominee, she is supporting a filibuster that creates a roadblock to reaching that final vote. Her claim to "support" a cloture vote makes no sense since that isn’t up to her party — cloture would be pushed by Republicans and is only needed if Baldwin and other Democrats pursue a filibuster. And that cloture vote would only advance the process, not result in a final decision on Gorsuch. That’s what we call a Full Flop.

pomt-09445	The Senate version of the health care reform bill "allows taxpayer money to pay directly for abortion in federal community health centers funded in the bill."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/09/daniel-lipinski/lipinski-says-senate-health-bill-allows-taxpayer-m/	Abortion foes have seized on a new issue with the Senate version of the health care reform bill: a plan to funnel an additional $7 billion to expand the reach of community health centers. Groups like the National Right to Life Committee, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the conservative Family Research Council claim the bill would create a loophole for roughly 1,250 community health centers nationwide to offer abortion services. Rep. Daniel Lipinski, an antiabortion Democrat from Illinois who said he could not vote for the Senate version of the bill due to its stance on abortion, stated it more definitively in a January press release that said the bill "allows taxpayer money to pay directly for abortion in federal community health centers funded in the bill." Community health centers are clinics that provide primary and preventive health services primarily to low-income Americans and those who live in underserved rural areas. None of them provide abortion services. And we could find no legislators who said they intend for the new funds to pay for abortions. So why are abortion opponents worried they will if the Senate health plan moves forward? It's the way the $7 billion would be distributed. Currently, community health centers receive their funding -- about $2.2 billion a year -- through the annual appropriation budget for the Department of Health and Human Services. That appropriation money is subject to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of funds for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. In the Senate health bill, however, the additional $7 billion for community health centers would be dedicated (read: guaranteed) funding for five years, and would be administered directly through HHS. In other words, the $7 billion would bypass the annual appropriations process, and does not carry any Hyde-type restrictions on using that money to pay for abortions, said Lipinski spokesman Nathaniel Zimmer. "Therefore, there is nothing legally prohibiting community health centers from using the money to provide abortions." The Washington Times quoted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops saying the new community health center funding could lead to "hundreds of thousands of abortions per year that taxpayers would be forced to pay for." Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Senate bill includes "federal funding for community health centers that could be used directly to kill unborn babies." Not so, says Rep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, who told the Washington Times the idea that federal dollars would cover abortions is "patently false." "They're interpreting the Senate language incorrectly," DeGette said. "Any federal money that goes to community health centers or anything else cannot be used for abortion." That's also the opinion of the National Association of Community Health Centers, which just wants to be left out of the abortion debate. Community health centers "have never performed abortions," said Dan Hawkins, senior vice president of policy and programs for the group. "They do not plan to or seek to become a provider of abortions. They don't do that." Community health centers are focused on their mission of providing primary and preventive health care -- things like immunization and prenatal care -- to those typically underserved by the health care community, he said. Community health centers were around for 11 years before the Hyde Amendment went into effect in 1976 and they never provided abortions, he said. And last year, they got $2 billion in federal stimulus funds. Of that, $500,000 was for operational funding. It has already been used to provide health care to more than 2 million additional people, he said. Like the Senate bill's proposal, the stimulus money came separate from the HHS appropriation funds (with its Hyde Amendment limits) and contained no specific abortion language. And again, none of it was used for abortions. Hawkins makes one last point: the $7 billion over five years through the Senate health care bill would be combined by the secretary of HHS (currently Obama appointee Kathleen Sebelius) with the roughly $2.2 billion the centers receive through the annual appropriations bill. "In our opinion, once this money is combined with the appropriated funds, the Hyde restrictions will apply to the whole thing," Hawkins said. Together with repeated assurances from Sebelius that no federal funds will be used to pay for abortions, Hawkins said, "We feel confident the restriction (against abortions) will apply." "And again," Hawkins said, "they haven't done abortions and they aren't looking to do them in the future." It doesn't really matter whether the authors of the bill or the folks running the community health centers intend for the new money to fund abortions, said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. By failing to address the issue directly in the health care bill, he said, the courts will certainly rule that abortions are permitted, and even require that they be allowed. Even without the additional funding, he noted, powerful abortion rights groups are pushing for community health centers to segregate federal funding to allow them to provide abortions right now. Providing new federal dollars without Hyde Amendment restrictions will only strengthen their position, he argued. "We know what the result is if they don't put that language (specifically prohibiting abortions) in there," he said. "If it's not explicitly excluded, it ends up being included." The courts have several times ruled that without specific abortion prohibitions, generic health care language like that spelled out for community health centers "would certainly encompass abortions, if it ever got to court," Johnson said. Johnson can't say whether the funding construction was a deliberate attempt by some in the Senate to allow abortions at community health centers. But, he said, "If they really want to prevent that, it requires a quick legislative fix: put the money through the regular pipeline." So why didn't the Senate put the money through the annual HHS appropriations pipeline? Hawkins said the intent was to provide a guaranteed, dedicated source of funding as part of a multiyear effort to ramp up access to health care. So then why not simply add language that spells out that the additional money provided to the community health centers could not be used for abortions? "It probably would have been a lot easier if they'd done that," Hawkins said. A Washington Times story on the issue quoted White House spokeswoman Linda Douglass saying, "If there is a drafting issue that requires a technical change to make clear that federal funds for community centers should not be used to fund abortions, he (Obama) will work with Congress to clarify it." So in summary, the White House and the co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus said they do not intend for the additional funds to be used for abortions. The White House says it's even willing to put that in writing in the bill. A spokesman for the National Association of Community Health Centers says the clinics have never provided abortions, that they don't plan to or want to. And he's satisfied that it would be prohibited under existing law anyway, as the additional money would be combined with the appropriations money (which is subject to the Hyde Amendment). Could the money be used for abortions? It doesn't seem likely based on the comments from the White House, Sebelius, the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus and the umbrella organization for community health centers. But neither can we say definitively that the scenario laid out by the Lipinski and the National Right to Life Committee could not happen. If you focus on the technical possibilities -- which is an entirely legitimate thing to do -- who can say whether a court might rule that without a specific prohibition, abortions could be permitted? You can't fault organizations like the National Right to Life Committee for raising concerns about potential loopholes, even if they seem unlikely. And perhaps language will have to be added to remove any doubt. A White House official saying the president would work with Congress to draft language to make clear that federal funds for community health centers should not be used to fund abortions certainly sounds like an acknowledgement that there is at least room for interpretation. But we think the issue looks more like a political dart than a legitimate concern. That's especially true in light of the track record of community health centers. They have never in their 45 years provided abortions. They did not even before the Hyde Amendment was enacted. They have not even when they got $500,000 from the economic stimulus to expand their services (essentially coming the same way as proposed through Senate bill). They have not even though federal funding limited by the Hyde Amendment comprises just 20 percent of their annual budget now (and they'll still be getting that appropriations money, with its strings). Given all that and the public pronouncements from the White House, the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus and Sebelius that the money could not be used to provide abortions, we think it's highly misleading to state definitively, as Lipinski did, that if the Senate bill passes then federal dollars will start flowing to community health centers to provide abortions. We rule Lipinski's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04444	Says the Obama administration spent taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland (and) windmills in China.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/paul-ryan/ryan-says-stimulus-dollars-paid-electric-cars-finl/	In the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan and Joe Biden argued whether the stimulus was worth the hundreds of billions of dollars that it cost the government. Ryan said, "Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was in charge of overseeing this. Ninety billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups." Biden responded with, "It was a good idea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to stop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again." They argued about whether the stimulus money was wasted, and Ryan said "Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland, or on windmills in China?" Republicans have made these charges before. In this fact-check, we look at whether the stimulus money went where Ryan said it did. The Fisker electric car In 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic. The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on it is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open. The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far. Not stimulus dollars The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects. First, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating. That money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it’s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. The only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses. The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it. Fisker Automotive says that the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to insure that all federal dollars are spent in the United States. Windmills in China Windmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for this claim. Among the reports and articles the campaign cites, one refers to a massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University. The Investigative Reporting Workshop’s report backs the claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn’t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. "Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe," he wrote. A challenging money trail Federal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $7.6 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes. To choose an example, let’s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world’s third largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, "The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China." We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But "that might not be exactly right," said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis . "Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms." If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese "windmills," then they account for less than 1 percent of the total. Our ruling Paul Ryan said stimulus dollars were spent on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China. In fact, the program that provided loan guarantees for the Fisker cars was not part of the stimulus -- and the money went toward engineering and design in the United States. As for the windmills in China, it's true that a small number of windmills and components to build them came from China. But the statement greatly exaggerates China’s role in the overall use of stimulus money. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07637	Says that Republicans "bragged about how every bill was going to be paid for, right from the beginning" and that the first vote, the repeal of health care reform, violated that rule.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/16/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-chides-gop-saying-vote-health-ca/	Bolstered by Tea Party support, Republicans seized majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives this year on a pledge to reel in government spending, starting with the repeal of Health Care Reform. The Republican-controlled house did just, voting to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law nearly a year ago. But before taking that vote the Republicans in the house also scuttled "pay as you go" provisions that Democrats had restored in 2007, requiring any increased expenditures flowing from a new piece of legislation to be offset by decreases in other programs. In its place, Republicans approved "cut as you go," which requires that any proposed spending increases be paid for with cuts in other areas. And unlike "the Democrats’ pay-as-you-go policy, tax increases (including closing of tax loopholes) to pay for new spending are prohibited. But at the same time, Republicans specifically exempted from the rule votes to extend the Bush tax cuts and the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. Also exempted was the vote to repeal the health care reform legislation. This moved Sherrod Brown, the senior senator from Ohio to observe that Republicans "bragged about how every bill was going to be paid for, right from the beginning. And the first bill they put out there, it would be paid for, according to Congressional Budget Office calculations. That's the way things are done in the Congress and have been agreed to by both parties for years and years. They already violated their own rule by not paying for this." Given that the Republicans have preached the need to cut the budget, PolitiFact Ohio thought it’d take a look at Brown’s claim. The Congressional Budget office was created by an act of Congress in 1974 to act as the non-partisan authority on how proposed legislation would affecting the federal budget. When it analyzed the health-care reform legislation, it said the impact over the next 10 years would be a deficit reduction of $143 billion. That’s what Brown cites when he says the health reform bill would be paid for. Republicans dispute those estimates and argue that health reform will drive up the deficit. That being the case, they say, the effect of the "cut as you go" rule change is moot because repeal would save the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars -- meaning there would be no spending increase that needed to be offset elsewhere. Letters from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders warn that all projections carry a degree of speculation because there are economic variables that can reshape revenues and expenditures over the next decade without foreseeability. Ultimately, who is right may prove to be academic. Republicans acknowledge the repeal vote was symbolic because it’s unlikely the Democratic-controlled Senate will act on the legislation and even if it did, Republicans don’t have enough votes to override an Obama veto. So where does that leave Brown’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter? The senator is correct that House Republicans did pledge to not approve any legislation that would push up the federal deficit. The question then is did they, as he said, violate their own rule? That's where the exemption that was approved with the House rules comes into play. Brown mentioned that exemption during his teleconference, describing it as a loophole Republicans carved out to avoid the cut-as-you-go restrictions. But with that exemption, the repeal vote didn't violate the rule. That's a point of clarification. We rate Brown’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-12564	Said Vin Diesel declared his love of Rockford, Ill., after locals provided him car help and hospitality.	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2017/apr/13/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-vin-diesel-names-rockford-his-favo/	If you’re a major movie star driving a rental car in Illinois this year, you may want to avoid Rockford. Or perhaps make a beeline there. In March, the website WBN 12 News had the hearts of at least a few Twitter and Facebook users in and around Rockford racing with a heartwarming story about "Fast & Furious" star Vin Diesel’s heavy praise of the town’s people and cuisine. "During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently," read the post. The story then describes Diesel praising the people of Rockford as "the real deal" and voicing his plans to retire in Rockford when his acting days are over. He also applauds the "great freakin’ burger" he had at Rockford’s GreenFire restaurant. Indeed there is a restaurant in Rockford called GreenFire and a quick skim of its menu indicates that its burgers likely would earn the "great freakin’" label. (Ex.: "BEEF & DUCK BACON brioche bun. grass fed beef. yellow cheddar. duck bacon. $13." Sounds freakin’ great to us.) The story then describes Diesel praising the people of Rockford as "the real deal" and voicing his plans to retire in Rockford when his acting days are over. He also applauds the "great freakin’ burger" he had at Rockford’s GreenFire restaurant. Indeed there is a restaurant in Rockford called GreenFire and a quick skim of its menu indicates that its burgers likely would earn the "great freakin’" label. (Ex.: "BEEF & DUCK BACON brioche bun. grass fed beef. yellow cheddar. duck bacon. $13." Sounds freakin’ great to us.) RULE No. 1: READ THE DISCLAIMER There’s plenty in this post to create a veneer of truth. Who’s going to argue that the people of Rockford aren’t a friendly and helpful bunch? After all, this is the town that gave the world Cheap Trick, perhaps the world’s most affable and hard-working rock band. The "WBN News 12, Breaking news, local news" banner at the top of the page certainly looks like something you’d find on a news website. But when a story appears under a heading that contains a link labeled "disclaimer," it’s a smart news consumption practice to click that link. In this case, doing so gives the reader vital information: "wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes. The satirical and fantasy articles on wbn12.com poke fun at our celebrity obsessed cultures and the politically correct world we’re forced to live in." A recent Pew Research study found that 35 percent of news consumers use social media as their primary pathway to news -- roughly equal to the 36 percent who said they go directly to news sites. So when a joke gets shared on social media as real news, there’s significant potential for confusion. "‘Fake news’ propagated by endless (social media) ‘printing presses’ can be a source of entertainment and amusement that is appreciated for its satirical presentation but too often is taken much too seriously," says Jim Grubbs, associate professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Springfield. When that happens, it creates a dilemma for legitimate media. Has the phony story become so rampant that it merits coverage? On this one, the answer was "no" for the Rockford Register Star. "The staff here was aware of the Vin Diesel report and checked it out," said Mark Baldwin, executive editor of the Rockford Register Star. "When we discovered there was nothing to it, we dropped it." The paper didn’t want to call undue attention to the story or confuse readers by reporting on it, Baldwin said. Kudos to Rockford radio personality Mark Charvat for using his blog on station WXXQ-FM 98.5’s website to call out the Vin Diesel story as fake. VIN DIESEL: TWO-TIMER When we plugged a chunk of the "Vin Diesel" quote into Google, we learned that WBN News 12 is just one piece of a satirical website empire. Vin Diesel fans who believed the Rockford story likely would have been crestfallen to learn that the actor had said the very same things about Norwalk, Ohio, on the website Local 31 News, which carries a strikingly similar disclaimer to that of WBN News 12. While Rockford fed Diesel a mere burger, Norwalk feted him with a "great freakin’ steak" at Berry’s. Rockford residents, however, need not feel jilted by Diesel’s affection for Norwalk. They’ve also got Johnny Depp raving about their hospitality. As reported by the website Daily News 10, the "Pirates of the Caribbean" actor had mechanical problems with a rental car when he was passing through Rockford. He, too, found Rockfordians to be "the real deal" and, like Diesel, plans to settle in Rockford when his acting days are over. Depp’s Rockford helpers treated him to a "great freakin’ burger," but it was at Buddy’s, not GreenFire. Another Rockford radio personality, Mandy James, deserves credit for flagging that one as phony in a Jan. 3 blog post. OUR OWN GATEKEEPERS PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan noted on International Fact-checking Day that in an age of ever-more-slick websites putting out articles that, at first glance, seem legitimate, news consumers need to be especially vigilant. Before sharing an article on social media, check its original source. In the examples above, an obvious disclaimer fairly screamed that the articles were not to be taken seriously. Yet they still were shared is if they were true. "If a headline strikes you as so outrageous that you want to immediately tell all your friends about it, take a quick pause. It might well be fake. You can do your homework by inspecting the source of the news story," Holan cautions. "Is it a news organization you’ve heard of? Look at the web address. Is it a clever knock-off? For example, abcnews.com.co is a phony version of the actual news site abcnews.go.com and is a purveyor of fake news." There’s certainly no harm in imagining Vin Diesel or Johnny Depp getting a lesson in Heartland hospitality in Rockford, Norwalk, Ohio, or any other off-the-beaten-path Midwestern town. The sites that offered those articles accomplished their clearly stated goal of poking fun at our celebrity-obsessed culture. But sites that traffic in more serious "fake news" don’t put disclaimers on their articles. They’re out not to entertain, but to agitate. Know the warning signs and be a smart news consumer. OUR RULING Anyone who saw the Vin Diesel or Johnny Depp posts should have been tipped off about their nature by the "disclaimer" tab above the headline. Even the most cursory second look at this claim would have revealed it worthy of our Pants on Fire rating.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-04-13T13:15:14	2017-03-13	['Illinois']

pomt-14706	"A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/05/barack-obama/obama-violent-felons-can-buy-guns-online-without-b/	Under the current system, dangerous people are able to buy firearms far too often, President Barack Obama said in a speech announcing new executive action on gun policy. "The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules," he said Jan. 5. "A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked." Quite a few readers flagged Obama’s claim that a violent felon can buy a gun online without a background check, so we decided to fact-check it. Some readers seemed to think Obama was suggesting such transactions were legal. We don’t see that in Obama’s comments. (The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said "can," not "may.") To be clear, such a transaction would be illegal. What Obama said is that such transactions are possible. That is accurate, but it’s also a little more complicated than Obama’s comment suggests. A big loophole Federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or receiving guns unless their rights have been formally restored. However, felons can get around this obstacle by buying guns from sellers who do not require criminal background checks. "Violent felons aren't allowed to buy guns, period," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. "But they can take advantage of the loophole in federal law that allows gun sales, including some gun sales over the Internet, to purchase from non-licensed sellers, who don't have to conduct a background check." Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms "with the principal motive of making a profit" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. If an individual buys a gun from someone who does not have or require a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a couple of important limitations on these sorts of online private transactions. First, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers "can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions," said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. In its own 2013 review of Armslist and similar sites, the New York Times found that these sites "function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them." Their investigation identified several individuals with criminal backgrounds buying and selling firearms over the Internet. Still, only a small slice of gun purchases take place online. In a December Quinnipiac poll, just 3 percent of gun owners said they obtained a gun from an online seller. Obama’s statement "rings true," said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. "Since our goal is to keep guns from the hands of criminals, it doesn't make sense that if you go to a store to buy a gun you have to go through a background check," Donohue said, "But if you buy the exact same gun on the Internet from a private seller, you don't have to go through a background check." Winkler said Obama’s proposed executive action won’t do much to curb these kinds of transactions, though, "because the loophole is baked into federal law." Regarding background checks, Obama has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to "clarify" that anyone "engaged in the business of dealing in firearms" needs a license — meaning self-described hobbyists who regularly sell guns, rather than just occasionally, might be violating the law by operating without a license. But this doesn’t directly stop felons from buying guns from private sellers who don’t have a license and don’t require purchasers to undergo background checks. Our ruling Obama said, "A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked." The kind of transaction Obama described is possible, though illegal, and more complicated than his comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they can purchase guns from private sellers over the Internet without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. That seller would have to be in the same state as the buyer. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07549	South Korea doesn't pay the United States for U.S. troops that protect their country.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-south-korea-doesnt-pay-us-troop-/	A whirlwind media tour by Donald Trump -- the flamboyant businessman, reality show star and possible Republican presidential candidate -- took him to ABC’s The View on March 23, 2011. Trump discussed everything from the dynamics of the Republican primary field to his own personal life. But we were particularly intrigued by his comments on U.S. military support for South Korea, which came up in a discussion of U.S. intervention in Libya. "If you look at North Korea, South Korea, we're protecting South Korea," Trump said. "They're making a fortune. Let's call it hundreds of billions of dollars of profit on us. We have 25,000 soliders over there protecting them. They don't pay us. Why don't they pay us?" First, some preliminaries. Trump’s reference to "hundreds of billions of dollars of profit" sounds plausible to us, if you look at the size of South Korea’s gross domestic product -- $832 billion in 2009, according to the World Bank -- and consider the existential threat to the nation posed by North Korea, the heavily armed and unstable dictatorship on its border. Meanwhile, Trump’s estimate of 25,000 soldiers is not far off: A Pentagon spokeswoman, Cmdr. Leslie Hull-Ryde, said there are approximately 28,500 U.S. service members stationed in South Korea today. Nick Sarantakes, a professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College, notes that a majority of U.S. personnel based in Korea are actually in the Air Force, so Trump is technically wrong to use the term "soldiers," which refers to Army troops. But that's not the focus of our fact-check. We were curious if he's correct that South Korea does not reimburse the U.S. for those troops. First, we should note that the number of U.S. service members is dwarfed by the more than 500,000 South Korean service members on active duty, plus many more South Korean reserve troops. "The South Koreans defend themselves," said Allan R. Millett, a historian and director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. "We do the high-tech things so they can have more shooters." But do they pay for the U.S. help? Indeed, they do. South Korea has regularly signed agreements spelling out its "burden sharing" responsibility for U.S. troops. The current agreement, which was signed by representatives of the two governments in January 2009, covers the five-year period between 2009 and 2013. The financial burden South Korea must shoulder, converted into dollars, is about $694 million. That amount will rise for each of the succeeding four years at an amount pegged to inflation. The prior agreement covered 2007 and 2008, with payments totaling $664 million and $678 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The payments by South Korea fall into several sub-categories. Labor cost sharing, paid in cash, accounts for about 41 percent of the total. Logistics cost sharing, which is paid in kind, accounts for about 18 percent. And construction programs, which are a combination of cash and in-kind payments, account for the remaining 41 percent of the costs. Trump’s statement that South Korea doesn’t "pay us" is a sweeping statement that suggests they get U.S. protection for free. But in fact, they are paying the U.S. hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It should be noted that some have questioned whether South Korea is paying enough. Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan Administration Defense Department official who is now a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, recalls that there’s been frustration on that point dating back to at least the administration of President Jimmy Carter. But if Trump’s point is that we’re giving something away for free, experts note that the U.S. benefits from our military investment in South Korea, too. We’re not only helping protect a major trading partner, but the U.S. presence in South Korea is aimed at preventing a crisis that could have significant economic, military and humanitarian consequences around the globe. "We are in the Republic of Korea for our own national goals, deterring a regional war" between some combination of China, Russia, Taiwan, North Korea and Japan, Millett said. When we contacted Trump’s organization, Michael Cohen, his political aide, said that the point Trump was making is that "we have no money … and yet here we are playing police officer to the entire world, and we do it at whose expense?" But Trump’s statement on The View is incorrect. South Korea has signed an agreement to cover labor, logistical and construction costs running into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That may or may not be a big enough payment, but Trump is wrong to suggest that South Korea bears no financial burden at all. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13057	Since the salary for state lawmakers was raised to $79,500, "that purchasing power has now been reduced to $53,000."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2016/nov/18/carl-heastie/salary-worth-less-today-state-lawmakers-when-first/	Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie believes members of the New York State Legislature deserve a pay raise. It will be 18 years without one when state lawmakers return to Albany in January. Lawmakers who live in areas with higher costs of living are especially pressing for an increase from the current $79,500 salary, which took effect in 1999. "When the salary was $79,500, that purchasing power has now been reduced to $53,000," Heastie told WBFO last month. "Legislators have children that they need to help go to college. They have real lives." Their prospects for a raise look dim after the State Commission on Legislative, Judicial and Executive Compensation this week denied a proposal to boost their salaries by 47 percent to $116,900. It remains unclear when the pay issue will come up again. The Legislature has the power to reinstate the commission, or lawmakers can even vote to increase their own pay. We looked into whether Heastie is right about how far lawmakers’ current pay goes today compared with when they first received their $79,500 salary. The politics of pay The last pay raise, adopted by the Legislature in late 1998, took effect in January 1999. It did not come easily. Lawmakers got a 38 percent increase in pay from $57,500 to $79,500, but only after the Democratic-controlled Assembly passed a bill supported by then-Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, allowing charter schools in New York State. After the commission rejected the proposed pay raise last week, a member of the commission said the governor’s appointees would support a meaningful raise if the Legislature held a special session before the end of this year to limit lawmakers’ outside income. The commission is made up of appointees from the governor, the Legislature and the judiciary. Two appointees from the Legislature voted in favor of the pay increase. Two appointees from the governor did not vote on measure. An appointee of the judiciary also abstained. The proposal failed by one vote. What’s it worth now? The $79,500 base salary that lawmakers receive today ranks as the third highest for state lawmakers in the country. That doesn’t include stipends lawmakers receive for taking on leadership positions, which range anywhere from $9,000 to $41,500 for the highest-ranking lawmakers in each chamber. The purchasing power of that salary has fallen as the cost of living rises. One dollar in 1999 now has the purchasing power of just 68 cents according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The calculation proves Heastie’s point: $79,500 in January 1999 has the same buying power as $54,060 in October 2016. Our ruling While visiting Buffalo, Heastie said the purchasing power of a state lawmaker’s $79,500 salary "has now been reduced to $53,000" since that salary took effect 18 years ago. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Heastie is slightly off in his comparison. Inflation actually pegs the purchasing power of the current salary at $54,060.

pomt-00048	Says border patrol agent recently killed in ambush.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/04/blog-posting/fatal-accident-falsely-used-evidence-murderous-int/	The danger posed by people coming across the United States-Mexican border is a common theme among people concerned about immigrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally. A Nov. 2, 2018, Facebook post from the account of Todd Sowers has a picture of a man with a hat and sunglasses that is captioned: "Border Patrol agent, 36, killed by 'rock throwers' in ambush attack near US-Mexico border in Texas that also injured his partner.... So! Next time Trump says our Troops will protect themselves from rock throwers and they fuss & whine.... Show them this! Authorities were searching Texas' Big Bend area for suspects and witnesses Monday after US Customs and Border Protection agent Rogelio Martinez was allegedly beaten to death with a rock while on patrol." This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In fact, Martinez's death occurred nearly a year ago, on Nov. 18, 2017, and a subsequent investigation found there was no evidence that he was murdered. Sowers is citing outdated information. At the time, people jumped to the conclusion that Martinez and his partner had been attacked. The U.S. Border Patrol reported that Martinez had died and his partner hospitalized with serious injuries "in the line of duty." It said Martinez's unidentified partner "reported that they were both injured and in need of assistance" and that officials were "searching the area for potential suspects or witnesses." The border patrol never specifically said the two were attacked. But others, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, did. And the next Monday morning Texas Gov. Greg Abbott released a tweet announcing a reward of up to $20,000 "for information leading to arrest of those responsible for death of Border Patrol agent." Two weeks after the death, with the FBI still investigating, Fox news reported that "officials with the National Border Patrol Council assert they were unequivocally the result of an attack by assailants using rocks, a common weapon." On Feb. 7, 2018, the FBI released a statement saying that although it was receptive to any new information about the case, "To date none of the more than 650 interviews completed, locations searched, or evidence collected and analyzed have produced evidence that would support the existence of a scuffle, altercation, or attack on November 18, 2017." The partner, Stephen Garland, had no recollection of what happened. Martinez's partner had contacted a Border Patrol dispatcher by phone, the FBI reported. "Although disoriented and unsure of his location, the second Border Patrol Agent advised that both he and Agent Martinez were hurt. The second Border Patrol Agent also made a statement to the effect of, 'We ran into a culvert,' 'I ran into a culvert,' or 'I think I ran into a culvert.' The dispatcher also wrote into a Border Patrol log, '[He] thinks they (both agents) ran into a culvert.'" The results of the FBI investigation were widely publicized. Nonetheless, Martinez and his picture are still being used as evidence of the murderous intent of people who cross the border. We rate the claim False.

pomt-03196	In the Wisconsin health insurance exchange, "the Society of Actuaries points out that there'll be, according to them, an 82 percent increase in individual premiums over the next couple years under Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/29/scott-walker/gov-walker-study-says-health-law-will-raise-premiu/	The new health care law faces tough sledding in many states controlled by Republicans. Wisconsin is a good example, There, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has opposed opening a state-run online site called an exchange where individuals and families can shop for health insurance. Walker left that to Washington to operate. In explaining his reasons, Walker said on Fox News, "there's the practical issue of what it means for people who may or may not want to be a part of the exchange." He claimed the rates would skyrocket. Citing a report from the Society of Actuaries, Walker said in Wisconsin, there would be "an 82 percent increase in individual premiums over the next couple years under Obamacare." As it turns out, the Society of Actuaries told us that a report it released in March is often misinterpreted by politicians and the media alike. We thought it worthwhile to clarify what the report does and doesn’t say. We contacted Walker’s office to make sure that we were looking at the same document. Spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster referred us to the March study and said the governor "misspoke" slightly. The actual number in the report is 80 percent, which is very close to what Walker said. More fundamental is what the 80 percent figure describes. The study The study’s goal was to give policymakers a sense of what it would mean when millions of Americans who currently lack insurance joined the pool of the insured. It aimed to predict how much health care these new people would require. That’s an exercise of looking partly at their health and partly at their behavior. If as a group, they are a little sicker than the current group, then the average cost of care would rise. If they are healthier, the average cost of care would fall. Even if there were no difference, the cost of care might rise simply because they might use more services when they become more affordable. Importantly, the study dealt only with that part of the insurance market where families and individuals buy policies on their own rather than through an employer. It said nothing about what would happen with employer-provided insurance, which covers more than 80 percent of the population under 65 years old. The technical name for the slice of the market the study examined is ‘non-group’. The report’s authors estimated that the new law would bring a major cut in the number of the uninsured. Nationally, the percentage would fall from 16.6 percent of Americans down to about 6.8 percent. That result would play itself out over several years. The report aimed to paint a picture of the insurance market in approximately 2017 under two circumstances: if every state expanded Medicaid and if no state expanded Medicaid. The key finding, and the one that drove Walker’s comment, was that under the Affordable Care Act, with full expansion of Medicaid, the cost of medical claims would go up 80 percent in the non-group market in Wisconsin. There is enormous variability across the country. Nationally, the number was 32 percent. Claims are the single largest driver of premiums. That said, the report emphasized again and again that it was not estimating what would happen to premiums. The authors wrote, "Note that the ACA’s affect on premium is not modeled in this research; rather, long-term relative claims cost is modeled. Many aspects of the ACA will affect premiums, including changing benefit designs, new taxes and assessments, federal risk mitigation programs, minimum loss ratio rules, rate review rules, and premium subsidies." We spoke with David Tuomala, director of actuarial consulting for the Lewin Group, one of the organizations commissioned by the Society of Actuaries to do the analysis. The Lewin Group is owned by UnitedHealth Group, a holding company that includes a large insurer of the same name. Tuomala said the 80 percent figure for Wisconsin was their best estimate for the total claims for service in the total non-group market. Three factors drove the projected increase. The newly insured people would need more care because they would tend to be sicker than the current group. The insurance plans they would buy would be fairly generous. And people with insurance tend to use more services once they become more affordable. Tuomala said many steps lie between claims and premiums. As noted in the report, many people will be eligible for premium subsidies that will reduce the prices they pay. Those subsidies will be hefty, especially for families making about $95,000 or less. According to a government estimate, about half of the people in the exchanges will receive some level of subsidy. That would represent a large share of the group the actuaries focused on. They predicted that 85 percent of the total non-group market in Wisconsin would get policies offered on the exchange. The exchanges are expected to create competition and lower prices, with insurance companies setting prices strategically to gain market share. Still, "ultimately, claims will be reflected in the premium," Tuomala said. Uncertainties ahead Making accurate predictions is challenging. The higher cost estimate for Wisconsin assumed the state would expand Medicaid, something it doesn’t plan to do. That difference however has little impact on the cost of claims. Importantly, other projections by different organizations come up with different results. For example, the Congressional Budget Office predicted premium increases of 10 to 13 percent in the non-group market. Its methods and assumptions were different from the actuaries’ report. Whether this report’s projection turns out right depends largely on who actually signs up for coverage. "This is the great unknown," said Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "In the initial years, 7 million people are expected to sign up. The mix of that 7 million will be absolutely critical." Interestingly, while the actuarial study predicts a large rise in the cost of claims in the non-group market, it sees a modest increase in overall health care spending of just 2 percent. A major reason goes back to the reality that the non-group market is a smaller slice of the total marketplace. Since most people with insurance get it through their employers, there would be little change in the total demand for health care, along with little change in premiums. Our ruling Walker said the study by the Society of Actuaries projected an 82 percent increase in premiums over time. The actual figure was 80 percent, and the report explicitly did not try to predict premiums. What it looked at was the cost of claims in the non-group market, which pertains to less than 20 percent of people with private insurance. Higher costs for insurers typically mean higher premiums for consumers, but there are many uncertainties. When most people hear the word "premiums," they think of the bill they will get, and that is not what the report attempted to describe. Walker was reasonably close in relaying the strong upward pressure on costs, but he mischaracterized that as a change in actual premiums, and he ignored the significant subsidies that will cushion the impact of those cost increases for about half of the people who buy insurance on their own. Still, the half that don’t receive subsidies will likely see higher premiums. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12897	"The media ... sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/22/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-blames-press-feud-intel-community/	The first agency Donald Trump visited as president was the Central Intelligence Agency, and he had nothing but praise for the people who work there. "Very, very few people could do the job you people do," Trump said. He vowed to give the CIA all the support they might ever need and dismissed any talk that they didn’t enjoy his respect. "I have a running war with the media," he said. "They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the No. 1 stop is exactly the opposite." In this fact-check, we examine whether the press created the storyline that there was friction between Trump and the intelligence community. A look at Trump’s own words reveal his readiness to deploy some harsh language. We count several specific instances when he publicly disparaged the intelligence community. On Dec. 9, 2016, the Washington Post reported that intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had interfered with the presidential election to undermine Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Citing an unnamed official, the article said, "It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected." The Trump transition team responded with a statement that discredited the intelligence agencies. "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," the statement said. On Jan. 5, 2017, Trump had kinder words. "The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!," he tweeted. Trump’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, emphasized that point in a Jan. 22, 2017 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. She noted a Jan. 6 statement from Trump in which he said, "I respect the service of our great men and women in the intelligence community." But Trump’s language took a sharper tone when CNN reported on Jan. 10, 2017, about a file claiming that the Russians had embarrassing personal and financial information on Trump. According to reports, the file had actually been compiled by people working for Trump’s American political opponents and leaked to the press. CNN reported that intelligence officials also received the file and had briefed both Trump and President Barack Obama about its existence. On Jan. 11, Trump tweeted "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump didn’t back down when he was asked about the Nazi comparison at a press conference later that day. "I think it was disgraceful — disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out," he said. "I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that — and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do." Trump also tweeted his suspicions that intelligence officials were behind the leaked file. "Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably released by ‘Intelligence’ even knowing there is no proof, and never will be." Throughout the campaign, Trump consistently expressed doubt that Russia had meddled in the election at all. Allegations that Russia had stolen emails off the Democratic National Committee server were circulating by September. When the issue came up in the first presidential debate, Trump said "I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?" Trump stuck to that line even after the heads of Homeland Security and the National Intelligence office said in early October that they believed Russia was behind the DNC hacking. By that point, intelligence officials had briefed Trump with the details behind their conclusions. His steadfast skepticism prompted retired Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency, to tell the Washington Post, "it defies logic." National security historian Stephen Walt at Harvard University’s Kennedy School told us no other modern president has attacked the intelligence community in the way Trump has. "Trump went well beyond the norm in this charge and now pretends he didn’t pick a fight with them, even though his remarks are a matter of public record," Walt said. Walt dismissed the idea that the press invented the friction between Trump and the intelligence community. Our ruling Trump said the media created the appearance that he had a feud with the intelligence community. Trump’s own words undercut that assertion. While he did call himself a "big fan" and respected the service of the members of the intelligence community, he also lashed out on several occasions. He said that intelligence officials had used Nazi-like tactics against him and belittled the agencies as a whole for their incorrect belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Trump also openly doubted their conclusions during the campaign that Russia was trying to interfere with the presidential election. The press did not invent Trump’s harsh words and dismissive tone.

pomt-07701	"Last year it was discovered that Rhode Island's public employees ranked 4th in average pay, while the private sector ranked 23rd."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/07/travis-rowley/young-republican-chairman-says-rhode-islands-publi/	Amid tough economic times and an alarming deficit looming in state government, the pay and benefits state workers receive have come under increased scrutiny. In a column arguing that things have gotten out of control in Rhode Island, Travis Rowley, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, said the pay of the state's public employees is excessive compared with the rest of the country. "Last year it was discovered that Rhode Island's public employees ranked 4th in average pay, while the private sector ranked 23rd," he said in his posting on a local news website. We found those statistics interesting. When we e-mailed him asking for their source, he said he found them in a 2009 report -- "Rich States, Poor States," by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council. That ALEC report says the information came from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, a business-financed research group, but it doesn't indicate which RIPEC report it's referencing or when the data were collected. We went looking for the RIPEC report that had those numbers. We couldn't find it. Neither could RIPEC, which searched reports going back to the mid-1990s. RIPEC Executive Director John C. Simmons said the group even contacted the American Legislative Exchange Council to determine what it was talking about. "We don't know where it came from," Simmons said. "We're going back 10-12 years." That's the type of analysis the organization would like to do, he said, but added that comparing public- and private-sector jobs is difficult "because the educational requirements are different. Normally public employees have a higher need for higher education, versus private employees." In an attempt to find our own data, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), where spokesman Gary Steinberg said the bureau doesn't routinely report such numbers for some of the same reasons Simmons talked about. "It's not an apples to apples comparison," he said. One reason: the mix of jobs is very different. "In the private sector, one occupation that's very large is cashiers, or retail sales clerks; there's a lot of low-paying jobs that don't exist in the public sector. And in the public sector you have jobs like police, fire and teachers that aren't always comparable" in the private sector, he said. Another reason, said Steinberg: public-sector pay is likely to be higher because there is less turnover than in the private sector "and you would expect more-experienced employees to have higher earnings overall." That's why comparing the state-by-state ranking of public- versus private-sector employees is a fairer way to look at the issue. We ended up doing our own comparison after discovering government statistics available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at BEA.gov. We found that Rhode Island's state and municipal workers ranked 7th, not 4th, in wages and salaries, behind New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Nevada, New York and Maryland. Private-sector workers rank 15th, not 23rd. And when you look at the pay for state workers only, they ranked -- 12th -- behind the six states mentioned above and Alaska, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont. Meanwhile RIPEC, whose calls to the American Legislative Exchange Council have gone unanswered, was building its own spreadsheet using numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine whether the statistic cited by the ALEC report was ever accurate. The closest match that Simmons and his staff could find was in 2001, when Rhode Island ranked 24th in private pay. Municipal workers ranked 4th, but that doesn’t include state workers, who ranked 8th. With their help, we were able to cull comparable numbers for 2009 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' database. The result: combined state and municipal worker pay ranked 3rd; private sector pay in Rhode Island ranked 20th. That's much closer to Rowley's assertion. (Why the difference in rankings? Ashley Denault, a RIPEC policy analyst, said that may be due to the different ways the two agencies adjust their numbers. For example, we also found that the BEA reports higher numbers for wages in Rhode Island -- about $100 million higher for state and local government wages and $1 billion more in private sector wages paid out in 2009 -- than the BLS.) Bottom line: *Rowley accurately quoted statistics from a report, but that report cited a source that apparently doesn’t exist. * Data from two federal databases offer two different pictures, with one set of statistics producing rankings much closer to Rowley's claim than the other. * Rowley said the data "was discovered" last year, but the report he cites is from 2009. Correctly citing bad information -- attributed or not -- doesn’t make a speaker’s statement true. Rowley could have uncovered the problem if he had examined the original source material. But because the latest numbers from one federal database are somewhat close to Rowley’s assessment, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-03147	In the event of a U.S. strike on Syria, "the Russians will replace the weapons immediately. They’ve said it on the record. They’ve suggested they might even replace it with better stuff."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/11/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-said-russia-would-replace-any-weapons/	As the United States seemed to be headed toward a congressional showdown over whether to authorize a bombing of Syria -- and before Russia brokered a proposal that seemed to slow the rush to a military strike -- Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., offered several arguments against military action during an interview with the Washington Post’s Wonkblog column. One of the arguments Grayson made was that whatever the United States destroyed, Russia would simply replace. The comment alluded to the staunch support Russia had provided its longtime ally during the uprising and civil war that began in 2011. In the Sept. 7, 2013, interview with the Post’s Ezra Klein, Grayson said, "My understanding of the target plan is that it focuses on military infrastructure: Things like rocket launchers and runways and aircraft. In theory, the idea is this is the infrastructure that delivers chemical weapons, but in practice, it’s punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by degrading his general military capabilities." One of the problems, Grayson responded, "is that the Russians will replace the weapons immediately. They’ve said it on the record. They’ve suggested they might even replace it with better stuff." When we asked Grayson’s office for support for their claim, they provided several pieces of evidence. Putin’s comment at a press conference The first was a comment made by Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a press conference following the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. Question: "You said once that there is no way Russia will ever intervene in a military conflict in Syria. However, if hostilities do begin, will Russia provide any aid to the country?" Putin: "Hostilities are already under way." Question: "I was talking about a foreign military intervention. Will Russia help Syria? Which country do you think is likely to find itself in a situation like Syria's?" Putin: "You know, I don't even want to think about it -- to think that another country might find itself the target of foreign aggression. Will we be helping Syria? Yes, we will. We are helping now. We are supplying arms and providing economic cooperation. I hope we will further expand humanitarian cooperation, including humanitarian aid and support for the civilian population, people who have found themselves in a very difficult situation in that country." While this falls short of a clear statement that Russia would replace weapons destroyed in a U.S. attack, the exchange does reinforce the idea that Russia has been selling arms to Syria, and Putin made no indication that such assistance will stop. Putin’s interview with the Associated Press and Russia’s Channel One In an interview with the Associated Press and Russia’s Channel One before the G-20 summit, Putin discussed the status of an existing contract to supply Syria with the S-300, a surface-to-air missile that one Australian analyst described as "rapidly deployable ... and highly lethal" to military aircraft. The system has been a particular bone of contention internationally. Russia has said the missiles are defensive and are needed by the Syrian government to fight the rebels. But in May, Israel and the United States asked Russia not to deliver S-300s to Syria, arguing that they could block Israel’s air force from operating along the Syrian and Lebanese border, according to the Jerusalem Post. In the interview before the G-20 summit, Putin said scheduled deliveries of the S-300 had been partially fulfilled but are now "suspended." (Officially, the reason was that Syria had stopped paying for them, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported.) Putin added, however, that "if we witness that some steps are being taken in violation of the effective international regulations, we will think it over how we should act in the future, particularly regarding the supplies of such sensitive weapons in some regions of the world," Putin said. Putin added that Russia continues to provide Syria with supplies and maintenance because Russia feels "we are cooperating with the legitimate government and, meanwhile, do not violate any provisions of international law and any our commitments. … The United Nations Organization imposed no restrictions on the weapons supplies in Syria." Finally, Putin referenced two advanced models, the S-400 and S-500, but he didn’t explicitly say in the interview that he would provide the enhanced technology to Syria. In all, then, Putin reiterated that he is continuing arms sales with Syria, and he suggested that an attack by the U.S. or other outside countries could cause it to revive currently suspended deliveries related to a key surface-to-air missile. But this was couched as a possibility, not a certainty, and he did not explicitly say Russia would send Syria technology more advanced than what Syria had already been promised. Dempsey’s Senate testimony Another piece of evidence was testimony given by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As for Dempsey’s testimony, the comments came in response to a question from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. "You talked about the Russians now having four vessels in the eastern Mediterranean, but you did not seem to be that concerned about it," Markey said. "Syria is a proxy state of Russia. They provide the military assistance, the training to Syria. Are you concerned in any way that a strike by the United States could increase the amount of military assistance that Russia sends into the Syrian regime?" Dempsey responded, "It could, senator. … There is some indication that they have assured the regime that if we destroy something, they can replace it. But you know, that's not a reason for me to hesitate to act." By specifically suggesting that Russia would actually replace something the United States destroyed, Dempsey’s comment goes somewhat further than Putin did. But it is also couched with the phrase "there is some indication that," which suggests that there’s a degree of doubt or conflicting evidence. In addition, while Dempsey would presumably be apprised of any U.S. intelligence on Russia’s intentions, he -- unlike Putin -- can’t be marshaled as evidence that Russia has said what it plans to do "on the record." Additional comments Grayson’s office also cited comments by retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a military analyst with Fox News, and British defense analyst Francis Tusa, but neither reflects what Russia said "on the record." Finally, Grayson spokeswoman Lauren Doney said that Grayson "sees both unclassified and classified information, the sources and details of which he obviously cannot discuss." But secret intelligence cannot be considered on the record, so we will not factor it into our rating. Our ruling Grayson said that in the event of a U.S. strike on Syria, "the Russians will replace the weapons immediately. They’ve said it on the record. They’ve suggested they might even replace it with better stuff." Grayson’s office offered an array of evidence, but none of it definitively proves his claim. Putin’s comments -- the only ones that could support a claim about what Russia has said "on the record" -- suggest that Russia is reserving the right to replace Syrian military hardware destroyed by a U.S. attack, but the Russian leader’s own words do not go as far Grayson suggests. Grayson has not provided proof that Russia has said it "will" pursue that course, or that Russia will do so "immediately."

pomt-06862	"There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/02/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-said-there-are-no-tax-increases-debt-l/	After weeks of partisan rancor, Congress approved a debt ceiling increase that will fund the federal government through 2013 and prevent potential economic catastrophe. The final legislation -- the Budget Control Act of 2011 -- allows the United States to borrow $2.1 trillion through the next election. In modern congressional tradition, representatives flocked to their Twitter accounts to share their thoughts about the legislation. On the evening of Aug. 1, 2011, after the House of Representatives passed the bill, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., tweeted, "There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period." His tweet alludes to the debate between Republican and Democratic lawmakers regarding taxes. President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats wanted tax revenue increases in the bill. It was one of the chief sticking points through the negotiations. The final bill that Congress approved Aug. 2, contained no explicit tax increases or revenue raisers. Still, that's not quite the end of the story. We reviewed the text of the legislation, as well as detailed summaries put out by the White House and congressional Republicans. To help analyze Cantor's statement, here's a quick rundown of the Revised Budget Control Act of 2011: The bill raises the debt limit by $2.1 trillion but requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the federal budget over the next decade to match and exceed this increase. Roughly $917 billion of the cuts are implemented with the passage of the bill. The specifics of the second $1.5 trillion in cuts will be determined by a newly created bipartisan deficit reduction committee, made up of 12 lawmakers, with six members from each party. The committee must make its recommendations on what to cut by Nov. 23, 2011. Both houses of Congress must then approve these recommendations in an up-or-down vote, allowing for no amendments. If the committee deadlocks and can't achieve $1.2 trillion in cuts, or if Congress doesn't approve the committee's recommendations, then there is an automatic $1.2 trillion in cuts that come from both defense and domestic programs. Several programs, including Social Security, benefits for Medicare recipients and initiatives for low-income Americans, are exempt. The bill also requires that both chambers vote on a constitutional balanced budget amendment. If both chambers approve this amendment, then no automatic cuts will occur even if the committee reaches an impasse. But the chances of a balanced budget amendment aren't good: It requires a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate. Getting back to Cantor's tweet, it's possible that the bipartisan committee could recommend revenue increases to help bridge the deficit gulf. However, there are several things Republicans could do to block this outcome. First, the six Republicans on the committee could refuse to go along with additional tax revenues. If the recommendations include tax increases, the Republican House could still vote the deal down. Cantor's tweet is largely correct. It's true that there are no tax increases written directly into the bill. Still, the debt committee has the power to propose tax increases if a majority of its members feel it is appropriate, and if Congress approves those recommendations they would become law. Those are high hurdles, so we rate Cantor's statement Mostly True.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2011-08-02T17:27:52	2011-08-01	['None']

pomt-13676	"American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-claims-homeownership-51-yea/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often used economic statistics to attack President Barack Obama’s administration, and he did the same following the Democratic National Convention. "American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs," Trump tweeted July 30, 2016. "WE will bring back the 'American Dream!" We haven’t fact-checked Trump on this particular statistic before, so we took a look at the data. On the numbers The "homeownership rate" is defined as the proportion of occupied households actually owned by those living there. A Census Bureau report released last week contains Trump’s 62.9 percent figure, referring to the non-seasonally-adjusted homeownership rate. Trump’s tweet referred to Federal Reserve Economic Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. His math checks out — the homeownership rate (again not seasonally adjusted) was last this low in 1965, 51 years ago. As the graph shows, the rate grew steadily since 1995, reaching a 69 percent peak in 2005. But it has been in decline ever since. Other studies paint a similar picture, such as one finding the share of first-time home buyers in 2015 was 32 percent, the lowest since 1987. So Trump’s data is accurate, but there are some caveats. Demographic trends Experts told us millennials are largely to blame for the dropping homeownership rate, but it’s as much their lifestyle preferences as it is a sign of a poor economy. Many millennials graduated college at the onset of the 2008 recession, meaning more people chose to live with their parents, said Adam DeSanctis, economic issues media manager at the National Association of Realtors. One survey identified rising student and credit card debt, as well as difficulties saving for down payments, as key deterrents. At the same time, lifestyle choices — such as marrying later in life, going to college and having fewer children — all contribute to lower levels of homeownership, DeSanctis said. Jed Kolko, an independent housing economist, argues that lifestyle shifts, not financial variables, are primarily responsible for more youth living with their parents. Many millennials have expressed little desire to own a home, said Byron Studdard, a financial adviser at Studdard Financial, which focuses on estate and retirement planning. Witnessing the financial crisis and their parents’ difficulties paying off their mortgages, as well as general desire to be mobile, serve as deterrents. Studdard also cautioned against comparisons to 1965, because that was a different generation that was more likely than millennials to view homeownership as the first step to prosperity. "I’m not sure the homeownership rate is necessarily going to be a good indicator of if America is great again, like it was when we had the World War II generation," Studdard explained. How big a problem is it? While the falling homeownership rate is not a positive, economists we spoke to disagreed on how problematic it was. In a New York Times article, Kolko wrote that the homeownership rate is misleading because it fails to capture renters. He said the "headship rate" — the percent of adults heading a household — is a better figure that captures both owners and renters. Increases in the headship rate still stimulates household construction, he said. That rate, according to the Census Bureau’s 2015 Current Population Survey, has been going up as of 2013. Slight decreases in owner-occupied households were outpaced by increases in renter households, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia, a company providing real estate information for buyers and sellers. Yet renter-households still boost demand for construction and other goods, he said. The comparative benefits of renting versus owning a home are still disputed, said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, an online real estate database company. On the other hand, DeSanctis said the low homeownership rate poses problems for the American economy. Owning a home has typically been a major source of investment for the middle class, and renting does not fulfill the same investment function. "As a result, the country has become more unequal in recent years as rising home values have benefitted current homeowners greatly at a time more people are renting and facing escalating rental prices each year," he said. He said Trump has a point in identifying the troubles people have buying a home, especially as rising rental rates and housing prices surpass income gains. The biggest housing losses immediately after the recession affected middle-aged adults, Terrazas said. Our ruling Trump said homeownership is at its lowest since 1965. The numbers back him up. However, there are some caveats. Some of the decline is due to lifestyle, and not economic, changes. In addition, experts told us the housing market is not in as dire straits as one statistic suggests. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f520daeb-1a93-4cbe-9abf-10d1f36a51ee	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-02T17:10:48	2016-07-30	['United_States']
pomt-04923	After the 9/11 terrorist attacks grounded commercial air traffic, "there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/01/michael-j-gardiner/michael-gardiner-ri-candidate-congress-says-morato/	In their first debate last month, three Republicans seeking Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat -- Michael J. Gardiner, Michael G. Riley and Kara D. Russo -- were discussing the role fossil fuels should play in a national energy strategy when the issue of climate change emerged. When Russo questioned whether climate change even existed, considering there is "so much . . . propaganda about global warming," Gardiner, a Providence lawyer, said human activity had "clearly" affected climate. As an example, he pointed to the three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the United States. "We did see in 9/11, we did see I believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards, that there was an average temperature drop," he said. "So I think clearly there are man-made effects." We wondered whether Gardiner knew of some new research confirming the much-discussed theory in the 11 years since the attacks. The theory caught wide attention a year after the attacks when University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Prof. David Travis and two colleagues published a study -- here’s a summary -- that found that the absence of jet vapor trails in the skies during the three-day flying hiatus had a climatological effect. Travis and his colleagues had collected the daily high and low temperatures for those days from 4,000 weather stations across the country and compared the data with the same three-day period in each year from 1971 through 2000. They determined that without contrails acting as artificial clouds trapping in heat (and to a lesser extent blocking the sun) the average daily temperature range over the continent had widened by about two degrees. In other words, the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly. Since then other studies have questioned whether the lack of contrails in the skies during those three days after the attacks actually played any role in the widened temperature variations that Travis reported. They have suggested that the temperature change Travis found might have been a coincidence -- the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded. When contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended. After reading those news stories again, Gardiner acknowledged in an e-mail that he had misspoken during the candidates’ debate; Travis’ study showed a widened daily temperature range in both directions following the terrorist attacks -- not just a drop in temperature -- and, said Gardiner, "indeed there is controversy surrounding the observations . . . " Said Gardiner, "I do a better job of illuminating a path for discussion and thought than 'nailing' a precise scientifically unassailable statement." Still, while Gardiner stated incorrectly what climatological event had occurred in the days after 9/11, his point for raising it was well-taken. Gardiner’s underlying point that humans are affecting the climate is accepted by the vast majority of scientists. But he misstated the conclusions of a study that itself has been called into question. We rule his statement Mostly False.	None	Michael J.

pomt-02688	"You don’t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/07/jonathan-harris/ri-sierra-club-official-says-despite-its-astronomi/	Depending on your political point of view, taxes are either an enormous drag on the economy or a shared burden to support necessary infrastructure and services. Count Jonathan L. Harris, chairman of the Rhode Island Sierra Club’s transportation committee, in the latter group. In a Dec. 24, 2013, commentary in The Providence Journal, he made an energetic counterargument to the notion that tax increases drive productive residents to lower-taxing jurisdictions. "Heck, you don’t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical," Harris wrote. With its long winter nights, Norway is a prime place for astronomical observations, such as watching the aurora borealis. Are its taxes sky-high? And do Norwegians tend to stay put, regardless? We decided to check. First, Harris is right about the population. According to Eurostat, the census bureau of the European Union, Norway’s population grew 11 percent between 2003 and 2013, to a record high of 5.05 million people, about the same population as the State of Colorado. So how about those "astronomical" taxes? Just as different countries speak different languages, different nations’ tax systems are often set up in ways that make direct comparisons difficult. For example, both the United States and Norway tax income. But Norway, like much of Europe,also imposes a "value added tax" on items sold at retail that assesses a tax at each step of production, rather than at the point of sale. The United States has no comparable tax. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based association of 34 developed nations that share information and study economic policy, tracks an array of economic statistics from its member nations. One those statistics is taxation. To make apples-to-apples comparisons of tax burdens between nations, the OECD looks at how much a nation collects in tax revenue each year and calculates what percentage that represents of the country’s gross domestic product, the monetary value of everything the country produced in that year In 2011, the most recent year for which the OECD had complete figures, the United States federal tax bite was 24 percent of its gross domestic product. That was 32nd of the 34 OECD nations. The lowest was Mexico at 19.7 percent and Chile at 21.2 percent. Norway? It placed seventh on the list, with a national tax obligation equal to 42.5 percent of its gross domestic product, a little short of twice the United State’s share. Of the top ten, eight countries were over 40 percent of their GDP, with Denmark topping the list at 47.7 percent. Half of the OECD countries had levels over 34.1 percent. Our ruling Jonathan Harris of the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club said, "You don’t see Norway losing population, and its taxes are astronomical." Census data shows he’s correct on the first point. On the second point, by the OECD measure, Norway’s relative tax burden is among the highest in the world. Federal taxes would need to be hiked 77 percent in the United States to reach Norway’s level. Is Norway’s ranking, seventh out of 34, "astronomical"? We believe it’s close enough for a Mostly True.

pomt-14852	"It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-it-takes-almost-year-refugee-be-processed/	A Syrian passport found on the body of a dead suicide bomber in the Paris attacks has prompted some to question President Barack Obama’s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees. Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes noted on Nov. 15’s Fox News Sunday that there are "very robust vetting procedures for those refugees" and said the administration will still continue to take them. But that’s "untrue" and, in fact, "there’s virtually no vetting," according to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who chairs the House Subcommittee on Terrorism. Elsewhere on the airwaves, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush suggested that the vetting process was at least enough to distinguish between Christians — whom the United States should focus on, according to Bush — and everyone else fleeing Syria. "It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States," Bush noted on CNN’s State of the Union. We were curious if that’s how long the refugee vetting process takes. We found that Bush is actually understating the duration, especially for those from Syria and other countries where terrorism is a concern. Let’s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process. Before a refugee even faces U.S. vetting, he or she must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO — determines which refugees (about 1 percent) should be resettled through its own process, which can take four to 10 months. As we noted in a previous fact-check, once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee undergoes a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes, and one final security clearance. This all happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Karen Jacobsen, the director of the Refugee and Forced Migration Program at Tufts University noted that this intensive vetting process as well as U.S law on refugees and asylum seekers "makes it difficult to quickly admit large numbers of refugees." So how long does it take? Worldwide, about a year to 18 months, according to a State Department fact-sheet cited by the Bush campaign. A different page on the State Department website estimates an average time of 18 to 24 months. For refugees from Syria and similar countries, however, the process can span two years, a spokesperson for the State Department told the Voice of America in September. Experts confirmed that two years is the average review duration for Syrian refugees, which means that some wait even longer. "It can actually take almost three years. (Bush) is being optimistic," said Lavinia Limón, the president of the advocacy group, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. "The process for refugees is the most extensive security screening we have for visitors. It’s easier to come in as a tourist, a student, a businessman." Even if they weren’t from countries where terrorism was a concern, refugees would be "lucky" if the process took less than a year, Limón said. She pointed out that since the refugee program for Central American minors was established a year ago, the United States has yet to admit one child. The length and thoroughness of the U.S. vetting system sets it apart from the "chaotic, dangerous process" for refugees fleeing into Europe by sea, said Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA. Refugees enter European countries as asylum seekers and are granted access into the country without a thorough vetting from the UN. Scrutiny comes later. "No vetting process can make guarantees, but the population identified by the UN and vetted by both organizations has worked successfully in alleviating crises in dozens of other countries, including Iraq, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and the Central African Republic," Mock said. "There’s no reason to believe Syria will be any different." In other words, the process for admitting a Syrian asylum seeker into France is much simpler than the process for resettling a Syrian refugee into the United States. "The U.S. refugee program is incredibly controlled. You can be 99.9 percent sure that guy wouldn’t have gotten here," Limón said. "I understand the kneejerk reaction but you’re painting a very broad brush stroke. Refugees, by definition, are fleeing terrorism. What happened in Paris, they’ve experienced. They’ve seen family members slaughtered and their houses burnt and they’re running for their lives." Our ruling Bush said, "It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States." Bush actually gave the low estimate for how long the refugee admissions process takes. The worldwide average is between a year to a year and a half. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Bush’s overall point is correct, and his estimate is in the ballpark if even low. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02589	Monica Wehby and Jason Conger are "causing devastating consequences" for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/28/justin-barasky/are-monica-wehby-and-jason-conger-causing-devastat/	One of the most contentious issues that Congress has faced since before Christmas break is whether to extend unemployment benefits for an estimated 1.6 million Americans. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., have yet to agree on a plan. Senate Democrats generally favor an extension, while Republicans insist that any extension be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. The temporary extended benefits, meanwhile, expired Dec. 28, 2013. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a D.C.-based group dedicated to maintaining Democratic control of the upper chamber, waded into the issue. In a Jan. 15, 2014, news release, Justin Barasky, the group’s national press secretary, blamed the lack of extension, in part, on two Oregon Republican senatorial candidates -- Portland physician Monica Wehby and state Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend. Both hope to oppose the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley, in the November general election. "Monica Wehby and Jason Conger’s reckless refusal to support the renewal of unemployment benefits is causing devastating consequences for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work and hurting the state’s economy more each day," Barasky wrote. Are Wehby and Conger "causing devastating consequences" for unemployed Oregonians? PolitiFact Oregon wondered how that could be, since neither candidate is even in the Senate. We contacted the Wehby and Conger campaigns. Conger, now in his second term in the Oregon House, confirmed on KXL’s "The Lars Larson Show" on Jan. 8, 2014, that he would not vote to extend unemployment benefits if he were in Congress. He told PolitiFact Oregon: "I don’t think another extension of benefits will actually help people who have been long-term unemployed and already extended multiple times." Wehby, in a statement, said she supports a temporary extension of benefits, but added, "We need to find a way to pay for these extensions by cutting government waste." However, representatives of both campaigns noted that neither candidate is in the U.S. Senate, so neither has any direct say on the issue. We contacted Barasky, who defended his assertions in an email. Regarding the candidates’ positions on benefits extensions, he referred to the original news release. It underscored Conger’s statements to Larson, which Conger confirmed. It also cited a Jan. 14, 2014, news story that ran on mycolumbiabasin.com that said that Wehby, following a swing through the state to meet with business owners, indicated "she’s not so sure it’s the right way to go." Barasky said another quote in the story demonstrates Wehby’s opposition to an extension. The story said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., disputes the idea that long-term benefits dissuade workers from returning to work. It then added, "Wehby thinks Wyden is wrong." "How is that anything but opposition?" he wrote us. In our reading, however, Wehby was disputing Wyden’s take only on the effect of unemployment extensions. The question of an unemployment benefits extension did not come up at a debate last Saturday among GOP candidates, including Conger and Wehby, hoping to take on Merkley. If it had, Conger said he would have said no, but told us he commiserates with those looking for work. Wehby said she would have answered yes -- with the qualifier that any extension be paid for through spending offsets elsewhere. That pokes a hole in Barasky’s assertion that both candidates oppose an extension. On the larger question of whether the candidates are "causing devastating consequences" to unemployed Oregonians, Barasky said, "We know they aren’t in the Senate, and our release doesn’t pretend they are. We are saying, if they were in the Senate, this is how they’d be voting and those votes would be hurting unemployed Oregonians." But that’s not what his statement says. It accuses Conger and Wehby, through "reckless refusal," of "causing devastating consequences" -- present tense -- for Oregon’s unemployed workers. That’s just wrong; neither is in a position to cast a vote on the issue, let alone cause "devastating consequences" for Oregonians. Even if one is elected to the Senate, he or she won’t be sworn in for nearly a year. Barasky, given the chance to revise the claim, doubled down, saying he was on "solid ground."

State lawmakers are mulling SB 2086, an omnibus bill packed with different election-related proposals, one of which seeks to reduce the number of weeks allowed for early voting from two weeks to one. Republicans laud the measure as an efficiency move, while Democrats say the bill could disenfranchise voters. State Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a Miami Republican, listed his reasons for supporting the measure during an April 15, 2011, Senate Rules Committee meeting. "Generally, early voting in Miami-Dade County has not been very efficient," Diaz de la Portilla said, as reported by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau. "What you see more often than not is that there is a trickle of two or three people a day at a very high cost to keep those public libraries and polls open. … We felt it was an efficiency measure." We wondered if Diaz de la Portilla's low turnout number is correct for people trickling in to Miami-Dade's 20 early voting sites. First, some background on early voting. It became an option for Florida voters in 2004, in response to the flawed 2000 presidential election. Lawmakers vowed to leave as little room for error as possible after that vote, where voters complained about complicated ballots and being turned away from overcrowded voting locations. In Miami-Dade, there are 1,205,770 voters registered for the 2010 general election in November (including 368,221 Republicans and 532,095 Democrats). Of all those, 97,076 voted early on the Nov. 2 ballot that included the U.S. Senate race, governor, state cabinet and constitutional amendments. We called Diaz de la Portilla's Tallahassee office seeking comment from the senator, but did not hear back. However, we did get a response from the Miami-Dade Elections Department when we asked about early voting statistics. The elections department provided us with early voting tallies from seven recent elections. They were the 2006 primary and general elections; the 2008 presidential primary, regular primary and general elections; and the 2010 primary and general elections. You can find them all here. While some sites are busier than others, we could only find two cases where the number of voters on a particular day fell to single digits -- and that was likely because of Tropical Storm Ernesto, not because of inefficiencies. On Aug. 29, 2006, early voting was suspended for a day as the storm passed through South Florida. And on Aug. 30, only eight people showed up to vote at Florida City City Hall and five at Miami City Hall. Each of the other sites also had low numbers that day, probably a result of weather distractions. For other dates over those seven elections, daily voting tallies at different sites ranged from 13 to 3,324. Most recently, in the Nov. 2 election, the lowest turnout was 80 voters, recorded at the Lemon City Library on Oct. 23. For all 20 sites over the 14-day early voting period, an average of 117 votes were cast in the 2010 primary and 346 votes in the 2010 general election. If fact, as each election cycle has gone by, the number of voters casting early votes has increased. For example, during the 2006 general election, 66,192 voters cast their ballot at an early voting site to decide between then-Republican Charlie Crist and Democrat Jim Davis for governor. That number swelled to 326,492 early votes cast during the 2008 presidential election when Democratic Sen. Barack Obama defeated Republican Sen. John McCain. Granted, presidential elections usually draw a bigger turnout, but even during the 2010 Senate and gubernatorial election, 97,076 voters headed to early voting sites -- a 47 percent increase from the 2006 election. "A lot of it has to do with the outreach we’re doing in the community, and people being more aware as each year goes by that early voting is an option," said Miami Dade Elections spokeswoman Christina White. It costs Miami-Dade County approximately $2,000 a day, per site, to conduct early voting, White said. For 20 sites over 14 days, that's $560,000. When asked whether Diaz de la Portilla’s figures of two to three voters a day trickling into sites seemed accurate, White said: "I think the spreadsheets speak for themselves." During the 2008 presidential election, early voting sites were so packed that voters usually waited in lines that circled the libraries and city halls where early voting is held. "Voters waited more than four hours to get their ballot counted at the Aventura Government Center," according to a Nov. 3, 2008, Miami Herald article detailing the long waits. The lines and wait times at some Miami-Dade early voting sites were so long that the elections department eventually created a link on its website updating wait times at each site. "At 3 p.m. at the Miami-Dade government center, the line was hundreds strong winding its way through the outdoor plaza," according to a Nov. 2, 2008, Miami Herald article. "Large golf umbrellas poked out of the crowd, first steeling people from the rain and then the sun. Some people in line checked the wait times from PDAs. ''I think we'll go to Aventura,'' voter Craig Hooten, 41, told a Miami Herald reporter on that date, after noting an hour and 45-minute line at the Aventura City Hall early voting site. While there have been cases of early voter turnout falling below the double-digit mark, those instances were related to inclement weather. Overall, early voting in Miami-Dade County has experienced steady growth each election cycle, with some sites processing more than 3,000 voters. Based on the figures provided to us by the Miami-Dade elections department, we have not come across any cases of just "two or three voters" showing up to an early voting site, as Diaz de la Portilla claimed.

pomt-05453	Says "$57,000 is the mean [income] in our state" for a family.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/25/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-average-family-income-new-jerse/	Democrats in Trenton scoffed when Gov. Chris Christie unveiled a proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, saying property taxes are more of a burden for New Jersey residents. Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) reiterated that point during a recent radio interview. "In New Jersey our constituents want to see the Legislature and the governor focus on cutting the property taxes. The average New Jerseyan pays close to $8,000 a year and that is just average," Oliver told Steve Adubato Jr. on WOR-AM on April 19. "The proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, if you took a family with an average income of $50,000 -- which, by the way, $57,000 is the mean in our state -- that would provide $80 over a three-year period in the pockets of a New Jersey family. That is not anything of significance. We say that won't buy a bag of groceries for a working-class family," Oliver said. We previously checked a statement about potential savings from the governor’s income tax cut proposal. It’s true a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 would pay about $80 less in income taxes under Christie’s plan. But is Oliver right that the average family in New Jersey lives on $57,000 a year? We should note that economists generally prefer median income to mean income, since the mean income can be skewed by extremes, such as very high-income earners. Robert Bernstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, said since the mean can be distorted "it's not a good reflection of the situation there. Median is better." The median income is the amount in the middle when a series of numbers are ordered smallest to largest. By either measure, Oliver is wrong. The mean family income in New Jersey was $106,125 in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the American Community Survey, a yearly national assessment conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The median family income, according to the same survey, was $82,427. Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, told us Oliver meant to refer to the annual average wage in New Jersey, not the average family income. There’s a significant difference between the two. The annual average wage is calculated by determining the total amount of wages paid out in a year and dividing by all the workers covered by the state’s unemployment insurance system who got a paycheck. The figure is "based on workers employed at New Jersey companies, those workers may or may not be New Jersey residents," Brian Murray, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in an e-mail. According to a state labor department report released in 2011, the annual average wage in New Jersey was $56,385 in 2010. Our ruling Oliver said, "$57,000 is the mean [income] in our state" for a family. That’s not true. The mean family income in New Jersey in 2010 was $106,125 and the median income, a measure less influenced by very high-income earners, was $82,427. We rate Oliver’s statement False.

pomt-11562	Says Mike DeWine "interfered with and stifled" a sexual harassment investigation and then "eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/feb/06/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democrats-lack-proof-ag-mike-dewine-stifled-s/	Ohio Democrats have attacked Attorney General Mike DeWine about his role in a sexual harassment investigation in his office in 2013. The unnamed accuser would never identify the alleged harasser. Ultimately, multiple investigations were closed without any action. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a Jan. 4 press release that DeWine failed to provide a safe workplace for employees "when he interfered with and stifled an investigation of sexual harassment allegedly involving a member of his inner circle, and then he eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office." Pepper lost his bid to unseat DeWine as Attorney General in 2014. Democrats attacked DeWine for his role in the investigation that year, too. The Democrats are rehashing the attack this year since DeWine is running in the May 8 Republican primary for governor. We found no evidence that DeWine "stifled" the investigation. We also found that while DeWine did eliminate the position of an officer who investigated sexual harassment, he also established a new procedure for investigating such complaints. DeWine ‘interfered with and stifled an investigation of sexual harassment allegedly involving a member of his inner circle’ In August 2014, the Sandusky Register reported that DeWine played a role in an investigation the previous year involving allegations that an employee in the Attorney General’s office had sexually harassed an intern. A spokesman for DeWine sent PolitiFact the 118-page investigative file which included the steps taken through three investigations: first by the Attorney General’s human resources office, then by the Franklin County prosecutor and finally by the Attorney General’s equal employment opportunity compliance officer. The file includes summaries of witness statements and conclusions by investigators. Throughout the process, the accuser declined to name the alleged harasser, even to investigators, and gave conflicting reports about what happened. The accuser’s attorney, Ritchey Hollenbaugh, told PolitiFact that the accuser did not want to be interviewed. Here is a summary of what happened, according to the investigative file: The law student started as an intern in 2011 and accepted a full-time position in November 2012, pending completion of the bar exam. But in April 2013, she withdrew her acceptance citing personal reasons. A supervisor who had spoken to the woman told human resources that it sounded like the woman had been sexually harassed by a "higher up" who was close to DeWine. The Attorney General’s office contacted the woman to obtain more information, but she would not name the alleged harasser. She initially said that the relationship with the man was sexual in nature but in a subsequent interview she said she must have made a mistake by stating it was sexual. Shortly after the investigation started, the accuser hired an attorney and declined to provide more information. On April 22, 2013, DeWine’s office turned over the case to the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron O’Brien. About a month later, the woman met with O’Brien after he threatened a grand jury subpoena if she didn’t cooperate. The woman described incidents involving an employee that were "creepy," such as sitting very close to her or putting his hand on her shoulder. She denied that he touched her in a sexual way, according to O’Brien’s memo. The woman told O’Brien that after she backed out of the job, she felt compelled to provide an explanation and provided misinformation. O’Brien concluded he had no prosecutable case. Next, the matter was investigated by Kristine Cadek, the Attorney General’s equal employment opportunity compliance officer. Cadek launched her investigation in June in 2013. At this point, the accuser still hadn’t named the person who allegedly harassed her, but a confidential informant had come forward with the harasser's identity. Cadek interviewed about two dozen employees ending with DeWine. He asked her to provide the name of a confidential informant, which she was reluctant to do, but she did. Ultimately, she found informant’s information was unsubstantiated. DeWine’s office spokesman, Dan Tierney, told PolitiFact that DeWine asked for the name to make sure every possible step had been taken. Cadek closed her investigation on Aug 8, 2013. "I could find no evidence to substantiate (the woman’s) claim and, without her cooperation, and absent any evidence or any identification of the alleged harasser, this case is closed," she wrote. DeWine ‘eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office’ This part of Pepper’s attack relates to what happened to Cadek’s position about a year after she closed her investigation. In 2014, the position of compliance officer disappeared when Cadek was transferred to a new job. Cadek was promoted to the position of crime victims claims lead investigator and received a pay raise of $3,640, Tierney said. (Cadek resigned in 2016 when she took another job.) Instead of filling the compliance officer position, DeWine changed the procedure to have an outside law firm investigate employment complaints. At least 10 internal employment investigations -- including two about sexual harassment -- have been assigned to the lawyer since December 2014. Our ruling The Ohio Democratic Party said that DeWine "interfered with and stifled an investigation of sexual harassment allegedly involving a member of his inner circle, and then he eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office." The evidence cited by the Democrats does not show that DeWine interfered or stifled the investigation. There were three investigations -- one by human resources in his office, one by a prosecutor and then one by DeWine’s compliance officer. All three investigations were closed after the woman declined to identify the accuser, even to investigators. There is a kernel of evidence related to the Democrats’ attack that DeWine eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims. A little more than a year after Cadek closed her investigation, she was promoted into another job. Rather than fill the position, DeWine changed the procedure for investigating such complaints by outsourcing them to a law firm. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14656	China has "total control, just about, of North Korea."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-when-he-says-china-has-to/	During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea. Trump said, "China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us." With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has "total control, just about, of North Korea." When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of "total control." "China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge," said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager. "It’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent," Ross said. "Do the parents have total control? Perhaps – they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable." China’s leverage over North Korea The strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel. North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea’s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows. "North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so," Haggard told PolitiFact. Why ‘total control’ is an exaggeration Yet while China’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump’s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border. "China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees," Haggard said. It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders. "Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had," said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. "This is hardly control." Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance. "North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead," Revere said. "This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large." Indeed, despite North Korea’s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, "it is not clear that the leadership cares," said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. "For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well." Meanwhile, North Korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China’s situation. This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb. "China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail," said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. "As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader." That does not sound like a country in "total control" of another. Trump’s claim "suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades," Revere said. "It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community." Our ruling Trump said China has "total control, just about, of North Korea." He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching "total control" over North Korea. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11683	In Milwaukee, "murder is up an astonishing 57 percent."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/03/jeff-sessions/milwaukee-murders-are-coming-down-peak-theyre-not-/	The attorney general of the United States came to Milwaukee and said murder in the city "is up an astonishing 57 percent." His number wasn’t entirely wrong. It reflects a spike in murders that occurred after 2014. But after the spike, the murders leveled off, and have begun to drop. The claim Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s attorney general, came to Milwaukee on Dec. 18, 2017, to announce he was adding two more federal prosecutors to fight violent crime in the city. The former GOP U.S. senator from Alabama used statistics to underscore the need, saying: And sadly, in this beautiful city, it has not been immune to these problems. Milwaukee, rape is up 21 percent in two years. Assault is up. Murder is up an astonishing 57 percent. So, these trends cannot continue. Sessions’ statistic We asked the White House to provide information to back Sessions’ statement. A spokesman noted that Sessions had made a two-year reference when he cited an increase in rape in Milwaukee and told us Sessions was also making a two-year comparison for Milwaukee’s murder rate. We were directed to City-Data.com figures showing Milwaukee had 90 murders in 2014 and 141 in 2016. That’s an increase of 57 percent. The City-Data.com figures do correspond with official FBI figures: Year Milwaukee murders according to FBI UCR statistics 2014 90 2015 145 2016 141 But the FBI figures show the big spike in Milwaukee murders occurred between 2014 and 2015 (perhaps because of opioids, according to a new federal study) -- and then dropped in 2016. More importantly, figures for an up-to-date two-year comparison -- including 2017, which had nearly ended when Sessions made his statement -- were available. Newer numbers These numbers were available on the day Sessions made his statement from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s continuously updated homicide database and from the Milwaukee Police Department: Year Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Milwaukee Police Department 2015 153 147 2016 154 142 2017* 121 118 *As of Dec. 18 Both sets of figures show that from 2015 through Dec. 18, 2017, the number of murders was down -- by 21 percent, according to the Journal Sentinel figures, and down by 20 percent, according to the Milwaukee Police Department figures. Note: The Journal Sentinel counts are higher because they include killings, such as those deemed self-defense, that are not included in the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting counts. The figures given to us by the Police Department follow the UCR system. Our rating Sessions said that in Milwaukee, "murder is up an astonishing 57 percent." Sessions wasn’t entirely clear on his time frame, although in citing Milwaukee crime figures, he had just made reference in his remarks to a two-year increase in rape. The FBI’s count of homicides in Milwaukee in 2016 -- the latest year for which FBI figures are available -- was 57 percent higher than it was two years earlier, in 2014. Clearly, murders are higher since 2014. But that paints a misleading picture of the current situation. Using an up-to-date two-year comparison, homicides in 2017, while still higher than in 2014, were about 20 percent lower than they were in 2015. For a statement that has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06527	"Health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/09/nick-tsiongas/says-health-care-greatest-contributor-increases-rh/	In September, Dr. Nick Tsiongas wrote a commentary for The Providence Journal about how the federal health-care overhaul is taking shape in Rhode Island. Tsiongas, a former state legislator and past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, is a founding board member of HealthRIght, a statewide group working for "the passage and implementation of comprehensive health care reform." His piece made the case for a "robust" health benefits exchange, which would create a marketplace where people and businesses could buy health insurance. To frame the issue, Tsiongas began by saying, "In Rhode Island, as elsewhere in America, the cost of health care threatens bankruptcy for those without insurance, individuals and businesses find premiums increasingly onerous and even unaffordable, and health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget." The debate about the health-care exchange can extend to a range of topics, but we wanted to test one of Tsiongas’ underlying claims: That health care is the biggest factor driving state budget increases. We contacted Tsiongas, who said he was referring to three main categories of health-care spending: "Medicaid (which includes RIte Care/Share and nursing home and long-term care costs … ), state employees health insurance costs, and retiree costs." To bolster his claim, Tsiongas cited a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council report, which said that total state spending from all sources increased by about $2 billion between fiscal years 2001 and 2011. "Human services accounted for the largest share of the increase (37.5 percent), followed by general government (28.8 percent) and education (26.3 percent)," the report says. "Grants and benefits for human services programs represent the largest share of expenditures in the total budget" and "the majority of these expenditures are for medical assistance programs." The RIPEC report noted that The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation tracks Medicaid spending by state, and in fiscal year 2009 Rhode Island ranked fourth (behind Ohio, New Hampshire and Massachusetts) in state Medicaid spending as a percentage of the general fund. "Medicaid remains about a quarter of the state budget and projected increases are unsustainable without health system payment reform," Tsiongas wrote in an e-mail. "One can argue that this and next year’s state pension contributions may dwarf other increases, but this represents a ‘catch-up’ of long-standing pension underpayments by the state, whereas the state’s health-care costs have had a sustained role in the budget over time." Tsiongas said the state’s health-care costs don’t just include Medicaid; they also include the cost of providing health-insurance coverage to state employees and retirees. To check Tsiongas, we turned first to RIPEC, a business-backed organization that has been analyzing the factors that drive public spending since 1932. In a chart it prepared for PolitiFact, RIPEC showed that "medical assistance," which includes most Medicaid spending in the state, increased by $713.5 million between fiscal 2002 and the enacted budget for fiscal 2012 -- accounting for 28.4 percent of the spending increase from all sources of revenue during that decade. No other category of spending increased by that much, according to the RIPEC chart. A category of "other grants and benefits," which includes some higher education spending and unemployment insurance, rose by $566 million, accounting for 22.6 percent of the spending increase. And "salaries and benefits" for state employees rose by $499 million, accounting for 19.9 percent of the increase during that decade. But it should be noted that "salaries and benefits" includes the employee health-care costs that Tsiongas referenced. So when you combine all three areas of health-care spending -- Medicaid, employee health care and retiree health care -- they make up the single largest category of increased spending in the state budget over that 10-year span, RIPEC officials said. During that time, those three areas have driven up the budget even more than state pension payments, RIPEC officials said. In recent months, public attention has focused on the pension system because the cost to Rhode Island taxpayers of financing the state-run pensions for public employees has more than doubled during the last seven years and actuaries say it could double again next fiscal year to more than $600 million. RIPEC officials said that those rapidly escalating pension costs could become a bigger factor than the health-care costs in the near future -- if nothing is done. But they noted the treasurer and the governor are formulating a pension proposal, and they expect the General Assembly to take action to curtail pension costs during an upcoming special session. "In 2013 and in the future, pensions will become the main issue that needs to be addressed," RIPEC Executive Director John Simmons said. But, he said, "historically the Medicaid and health-care issue has been the largest driver of costs." State Budget Officer Thomas A. Mullaney agreed that pension costs could become a much bigger factor in the budget, if nothing is done. But, he said, "over the last several years, particularly in the area of Medicaid, health-care costs have been the largest driver in the budget, from an absolute dollar amount standpoint." So Tsiongas had the correct diagnosis when he said that health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09114	"Without representation, (the IRS) can increase taxes."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/18/rick-barber/alabama-congressional-candidate-rick-barbers-gathe/	Say this for Alabama candidates, they know how to make political ads that get noticed. The latest ad making a bid to join Dale "Cowboy" Peterson and Tim "Learn It" James in the Viral Ad Hall of Fame comes from Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber holding a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers -- Sam Adams, George Washington and Ben Franklin, all dressed in period garb. Barber rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The idea is that the Founding Fathers would be appalled to see where things have gone in America. As Barber reaches a fevered pitch, he concludes, "You gentlemen revolted over a tea tax. A tea tax! Now look at us! Are you with me?" The kicker comes from the George Washington character, who delivers his response through gritted teeth: "Gather ... your ... armies." Enter the national media. David Weigel of the Washington Post weighed in, calling it "the latest performance art TV ad from Alabama." Keith Olbermann designated Barber the "Worst Person in the World," and called the ad a treasonous attempt to incite the violent overthrow of the government, for which he hoped Barber would be prosecuted. Conservative radio host G. Gordon Liddy was kinder, but Barber got some harsh treatment from fellow tea party cheerleader Glenn Beck. On his radio show, Beck called Barber, "one of the dumbest people I have seen." Ouch. Added Beck, "What the hell are you thinking? What is wrong with you? ... I know it's been a tough couple of years. It may not be time, yet, to 'Gather your armies.' This Republican is a dope." Double ouch. Barber insists his ad was not intended to advocate a violent overthrow of the government. "That couldn't be further from the truth," Barber said. "It's a call to action." We won't get into that debate, but we did think it was worth assessing some of Barber's claims about the IRS. Here's some of what Barber says in the ad (remember, he's supposedly talking to some Founding Fathers). "Some of you men owned taverns," Barber said. "Sam, you were a brewer, Mr. President, a distiller. You know how tough it is to run a small business without a tyrannical government on your back. "Today, we have an Internal Revenue Service that enforces what they call 'a progressive income tax.' You'll love this: Every year, if not every quarter, we're basically required to spy on ourselves -- report what we earn, who we hire and fire, with an all-powerful separate court system. Without representation, they can increase taxes, impose costly regulation or conduct malicious audits. "Now this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance. Cram it down our throats, or else. Now I took a took an oath to defend that with my life [points at copy of Constitution] and I can't stand by while these evils are perpetrated." Let's start with the claim that "without representation, they (the IRS) can increase taxes, impose costly regulation or conduct malicious audits." The IRS has does not have the statutory authority to increase taxes. That's entirely up to Congress. We'll cite that Constitution Barber poked in the ad. Section 8 begins, "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes ..." And Amendment 16, ratified in 1913, lays out Congress' ability to levy income taxes: "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." So it's Congress that controls whether to increase taxes. We spoke to Barber, and he said some people are taking the ad way too literally. "Some pieces of that ad are metaphorically speaking," Barber said. Barber said that when he said that "without representation" the IRS "can increase taxes," he meant that our elected leaders in Washington are not "properly representing their constituents." "Unfortunately we don't have good representation in office that listens to the voice of the people," Barber said. For the record, Barber explained, he's not opposed to taxes. Rather, he's in favor of a "Fair Tax." Under that plan, all federal income taxes would be replaced with a consumption tax on retail sales. But we think it's disingenuous for Barber to hide behind a claim that his ad is meant figuratively. How else can one interpret a claim that "without representation," the IRS can increase taxes? The IRS doesn't increase taxes. Congress does. You may not agree with what legislators have done with the tax codes, but legislators are duly-elected representatives. It's also misleading for Barber to claim "this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance." Congress is the body that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And the bill establishes that in 2013, there will be a penalty for those who are deemed to be able to afford insurance, but choose not to. The mechanism for enforcing the policy is the tax code. The full penalty will be phased in over several years, but according to a Kaiser Family Foundation summary of the law, it will ultimately come to "those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income." The IRS, of course, would enforce those tax penalties. Because people could opt to simply pay the tax penalty and refuse to buy insurance, there is some debate over whether it's correct to say that people will be "forced" to buy health insurance. We think many people would reasonably describe a tax penalty as a mandate. But it would be wrong to suggest the IRS is the one requiring people to buy insurance. To the extent insurance will be required, that was a decision of a duly-elected Congress. Lastly, we take issue with Barber's comment that the Founding Fathers revolted against the British over a tea tax. We'll let Robert Middlekauff, a professor emeritus of colonial and early United States history at the University of California, Berkeley, take it from here. "The issues that divided Americans and the British government were far more complicated than the tax levied on tea," said Middlekauff, who has written several books on early American history. "The Americans insisted from the Stamp Act crisis on that a free people could be taxed only with their own consent, and only their own representatives could give it. They were not represented in Parliament, and could not be, given the character of that body and the problems of representation in an empire. ... There were other related uses involving the British use of troops against the colonies, the corruption of imperial officials, and the essential rights of Americans." Barber said he was constricted by the limits of a 60-second commercial. "It's such a short period of time to try to give a history of how the American Revolution started," Barber said. "You only get 60 seconds to get your message out, to start a discussion," he said. There's no doubt Barber's ad has started a discussion. As of press time, ad was viewed more than 252,000 times on YouTube. That doesn't yet put the ad in the same league as the ones from Alabama candidates Dale Peterson (1.6 million views) or Tim James (nearly 1 million views). But give it time. We have no doubt that the Founding Fathers would be displeased if things had gotten to the point where "without representation," the IRS could increase taxes. But it can't. The tax codes, complicated as they may be, unfair as they may seem to some, were voted on and approved by duly-elected legislators. That's the very definition of representation. Call it figurative or metaphorical language, the bottom line is the statement is flat-out wrong. And we suspect the Founding Fathers wouldn't like being misled. We rule Barber's statement Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Barber	None	None	None	2010-06-18T11:02:32	2010-06-13	['None']

pomt-08726	"More than half of our unemployed Ohioans have been out of work for six months or more."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/02/rob-portman/rob-portman-statement-unemployment-illustrates-how/	It’s rough out there, as anyone who’s lost a job can attest. Rob Portman, running for U.S. Senate in Ohio, caught our attention by describing on a radio program just how tough it is. "Look, we’ve got a situation in Ohio and so many other states right now where people are starting to lose hope," the Republican candidate told Roger Hedgecock, a nationally syndicated radio host, on Aug. 18. "More than half of our unemployed Ohioans have been out of work for six months or more." Portman’s solutions -- lower taxes, more spending on highways but less on other government programs, redirected stimulus money -- would be popular among many Republicans and unpopular among many Democrats. But we’re not assessing Portman’s platform here. His figure alone -- "six months or more" -- seemed worth checking, because it is stark. It also is accurate -- by one measure. There’s a different measure, however, that would change the claim.. We started by asking the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS, which is in charge of unemployment compensation in the state. Ben Johnson, a department spokesman, said that a primary statistic used to measure the number of people out of work comes from a monthly survey that merely asks, "Are you unemployed?" If the answer is yes, it asks another question: Have you actively looked for work in the prior four weeks? As of July, 614,000, or 10.3 percent of Ohio’s working-age population, answered yes to both those questions. While high, that’s down from the 656,000 figure reported for March. Yet slightly more than half the Ohioans who are unemployed received unemployment compensation. The others are getting severance pay from their former employers, or they work some weeks but not others. Still others might not have applied for compensation, don’t qualify for it because of the way they quit their jobs, were fired for just cause, or have exceeded the number of weeks in which they can collect it. Portman’s figure comes from that first, smaller universe: the number of Ohioans getting unemployment compensation, not the broader number of people without a job. During the week that ended Aug. 21, 309,522 Ohioans received unemployment compensation, according to ODJFS. Of those, 127,873, or 41.3 percent, had received those state unemployment benefits for a half year or less. Another 150,990 Ohioans, or 48.8 percent of those getting help, had gone on to federal unemployment compensation for as much as an additional 53 weeks. And 30,659 more, or 9.9 percent, were getting up to 20 more weeks under a federal program. That means that 58.7 percent of Ohioans on unemployment compensation were out of work for more than half a year. "That’s a factor of the recession," said George Zeller, an economic research analyst in Cleveland who watches the employment numbers closely. And while Portman’s statement referred strictly to Ohio, "it’s true for the whole country," Zeller said. Yet there is another way of measuring unemployment duration. Used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, it classifies people as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. It is the same survey, in fact, from which ODJFS was able to determine that 614,000 Ohioans were out of work in July. Remember, not all of those workers got unemployment benefits. And unlike the weekly state benefits reports, which are current, the surveys have a slight time lag. But through this Current Population Survey, conducted every month since 1940, BLS is at least able to determine on an annual basis how long people have been out of work, regardless of whether they are getting benefits. In 2009, the last full year, Ohio had 608,000 people who were out of work, and 181,000 of them had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to this data. That means that of all the unemployed Ohioans last year, 29.7 percent had been out of work for six months or more. So which figure is right? Is it more than half, or 29.7 percent? Actually, both are accurate measures, according to agencies that keep the numbers and groups that use them. Policy Matters Ohio, a Cleveland-based think tank, cites the 29.7 percent figure in reviewing the economic climate of the past year, but with the caveat that "we’re looking at different things," says Amy Hanauer, the executive director. Unless there’s a dramatic adjustment in the BLS numbers, it’s looking like the year-round figures for 2010 will be higher, as they already nationally. Last year, 31.5 percent of people without jobs across the nation had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to another BLS measure, not adjusted for seasonal employment. Moving forward, the success of those looking for work for at least half a year has not gotten better; as of July, 43 percent of those without jobs nationally had gone without work for at least 27 weeks. That level of detail was not yet available for Ohio. Now back to Portman. This is where those paying close attention to politics will bring up a pertinent point: Although Congress provides extra money so people can get unemployment compensation beyond 26 weeks, a majority of Republicans delayed the program’s extension in July. Senate Republicans said that theirs wasn’t a heartless filibuster; they just wanted to find a way to keep the cost of extending benefits from adding to the federal debt. Portman, though not in office, agreed that Congress should find a way to pay, and his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, said Portman supported a provision by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota to tap unobligated economic stimulus funds and cut or freeze several other federal programs. Sen. Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, had a similar proposal that Portman also supported, Towhey said Democrats said these approaches, and the delay, were callous. "Although Republicans have no hesitation giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, they continue to pull out all stops in an effort to block unemployed Americans from receiving unemployment benefits, including over 112,000 in Ohio alone," Eric Schultz, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in July, criticizing Portman. But Towhey, the Portman spokeswoman, noted that Democrats later came up with their own ways to pay for other economic programs -- with offsets that included a cut in food stamp funding. Charges of callousness could go on all day but that is not for us to referee here. To those who decry the polarity of partisan politics, take solace: Both sides agree that too many people have been out of work for too long. Has it been six months or more? By one measure, it has. That’s why we rate Portman’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-09-02T12:15:00	2010-08-18	['None']

pomt-01246	Republicans approved 12 times larger tax breaks for "people making over 350 grand" than for "the average middle-class person."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/14/peter-barca/peter-barca-gop-tax-breaks-12-times-larger-top-ear/	The state Assembly’s Democratic leader, veteran Rep. Peter Barca of Kenosha, looked drained and sounded down when asked to explain his party’s poor showing in the Nov. 4, 2014 elections. And it’s no wonder: Democrats failed to recapture either legislative chamber and in the Assembly will face the largest Republican majority since Barca was a toddler in the mid-1950s. Here’s how Barca responded when Wisconsin Public Television’s Frederica Freyberg put the question to him Nov. 7, 2014: "We’ve got to communicate differently with the middle class, because there’s no question the middle class is much stronger with the Democratic Party. Even in our state, 12 times the tax breaks were for people making over 350 grand than the average middle-class person. We’ve got to go back to the drawing board." That claim about income tax cuts drew our attention. Democratic candidates around the state, including Mary Burke at the top of the ticket, pounded their GOP opponents over income-tax breaks approved by the Republican-led Legislature and Gov. Scott Walker. They argued the breaks were too tilted to the higher income level. Republicans countered that separate tax cuts Walker signed benefitted earners at all levels. Walker’s second budget, for 2013-’15, lowered income tax rates (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four). And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again (from 4.4 percent to 4 percent). Asked to back up the claim, Barca spokeswoman Laura Smith pointed us to a June 2013 report by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper. That report broke down the effect across income groups of the first income tax cuts -- the ones approved in 2013 -- in raw dollar terms. Smith said his mention of the "average middle class person" referred to the median household income in Wisconsin. That was $52,627 as of the most recent U.S. Census five-year average. The Fiscal Bureau report shows that in the $50,000 to $60,000 income range, the average tax savings for 2014 was estimated at $112. At the level of $300,000 and above, where Barca’s example of "350 grand" falls, the savings were estimated at $1,518. By our math, the top earners’ break is 13.5 times the size of the average group. The study did not calculate what percentage of income those breaks represented. Barca’s analysis, though, leaves out the second tax cut approved by the GOP -- the one in 2014 that dropped the rate for the lowest part of peoples’ incomes. We found a Fiscal Bureau memo from July 2014 that looked at the combined effect of the two cuts. There, the difference is somewhat smaller. The savings for top earners was estimated at $1,402, compared to $161 for those in the $50,000 to $60,000 range -- about 9 times higher for the upper group. That 2014 report presented another way to look at the distribution of the cuts -- a way that accounts for the reality that rate reductions from top to bottom mean that higher earners will get the biggest break, because they are paying the most in taxes. The highest earners will get a cut worth 2 percent of their income, while the "average" earners Barca mentioned get a break worth 7 percent. We’re pretty sure most people gauge the worth of their tax breaks in real, spendable dollars, not percentages. But this percentage-of -income way of slicing this highlights the fact that the top tax rates were not cut as much as the lowest tax bracket So top earners got less of a break than others as a percentage of income. This second way of looking at the tax cuts is used to analyze the effects of a tax cut from an ability-to-pay standpoint, a principle that is a feature of a progressive tax system such as Wisconsin’s, we were told by researchers Richard C. Auxier and Norton Francis of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Barca cites accurate figures in making the point that Walker and Republicans could have designed tax reforms to even up the raw dollar savings for different groups, but his claim needs more discussion, they said. Our rating Barca said that Republicans approved 12 times larger tax breaks for "people making over 350 grand" than for "the average middle-class person." That was accurate for the major tax cuts Walker signed in 2013, but the gap narrows to 9 times larger when all of the GOP income-tax changes are considered, according to a trusted budgetary agency. We rate Barca’s claim Mostly True.	None	Peter Barca	None	None	None	2014-11-14T14:07:49	2014-11-07	['None']

pomt-01024	The Affordable Care Act "basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/29/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obamacare-puts-penalty-or-tax-em/	As a new, entirely Republican-controlled Congress kicked into gear this month, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sat for an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes. The pair addressed many topics, including one of the biggest sources of friction between Republicans and President Barack Obama: the Affordable Care Act, the major health-care overhaul sometimes called Obamacare. "All the regulations that are coming out of Washington make it more difficult for employers to hire more people," Boehner said in the interview. "Chief amongst those, I would argue, is Obamacare, which basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create." Boehner’s concern that there would be "a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create" stems from a provision in the law known as the employer mandate, which levies a penalty on employers if they fail to offer their workers health insurance. The provision -- twice delayed by the Obama administration -- applies to workers who are on the job for at least 30 hours per week. The penalty is calculated on a formula that takes into account the number of uninsured workers. (A Republican proposal to raise that hours-per-week threshold has inspired some debate, as we noted in an earlier fact-check.) We don’t doubt that the law will impose an added financial burden on some employers. But Boehner’s description was too sweeping. Here are some of the reasons why: Not every company will be affected by the employer mandate When the penalty finally took effect this month, it did so for companies with at least 100 workers. Companies with between 50 and 99 workers will have another year until the penalty hits them. (We should note that the penalty applies only if a worker qualifies for an insurance subsidy from the government.) What this means is that the rule is never supposed to apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers. So when Boehner said Obamacare "basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create," it’s a significant exaggeration by the numbers. How much of an exaggeration? Let’s start with larger businesses. According to a widely tracked survey of employers conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 94 percent of firms with 100 or more workers already offer health insurance to their employees. That means 6 percent of those big companies will need to start offering health coverage. The U.S. Census Bureau says there are 101,642 firms with at least 100 employees, so that means roughly 6,000 big firms will have to change their behavior because of the employer mandate. Meanwhile, the Kaiser study found that for firms with 50 to 99 workers, 90 percent already offer health insurance. Census data doesn’t use the same size ranges; the census counts 494,170 firms with between 20 and 99 workers. That still means that fewer than 50,000 firms would need to offer coverage. As an example, if 200,000 businesses have between 50 and 99 workers, then 20,000 will need to start offering coverage due to the law. If you combine these two figures, that means perhaps 26,000 private-sector firms will have to start offering health coverage or else pay penalties this year or next year. That’s hardly a trivial number -- but it’s important to remember that this is not a large proportion of all American employers. The Census Bureau found 5,726,160 employers nationally, so less than one percent of all companies will have to start offering coverage due to the law. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel emphasized to PolitiFact that the speaker didn’t "say ‘all’ employers." Where Boehner voices legitimate concerns All this said, independent experts told us that Boehner could have raised some valid concerns about the employer mandate if he’d offered a less sweeping claim. • While businesses with fewer than 50 workers are exempt from the individual mandate, they may feel an impact nonetheless. If these companies offer insurance, the law institutes a range of pro-consumer regulations that could increase health insurance premiums. "This is not the same thing as a tax for every job created, but some firms may view it negatively," said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at RAND Corp. Eibner added that such regulations could cut both ways -- the new rules could potentially lower premiums for certain firms, such as those with older workers. • As we noted in our previous fact-check, the law’s employer mandate is likely to drive some companies to cut the hours of some workers so they can get them under the 30-hour-per-week floor that triggers the health-insurance requirement. While we found that critics of the law had exaggerated the number of workers who have already suffered that fate, we found it plausible that such work-hour cuts could happen to several hundred thousand workers. Of course, it’s worth remembering that the costs from the law don’t stop with the employer -- whenever new taxes or regulations are imposed, companies typically pass them on, including to their workers. "Most economists believe that firms ultimately pass the costs of benefits onto their workers in the form of reduced wages or other compensation," Eibner said. "If benefits become more generous, workers’ wages won’t rise as quickly. In this sense, the economic burden of these provisions is more likely to fall on workers than firms, especially over time as wages adjust. Some workers may be willing to accept that trade-off because they value having access to health insurance." Our ruling Boehner said the health care law "basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create." The law does impose penalties and regulations that could increase costs for some companies, though the impact depends heavily on the individual employer’s situation (and could actually result in lower costs for some companies). However, the law will force only a tiny fraction of employers -- less than 1 percent of companies by our estimate -- to start offering coverage when they did not do so before. That’s something that wouldn’t be clear to someone who heard Boehner’s comment. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2015-01-29T17:56:49	2015-01-25	['None']

What's at least a little surprising, though, is that a former congressman from Tennessee -- Harold Ford Jr. -- is now considering running for Senate from New York. Ford, who served five terms in the U.S. House representing the Memphis area, ran for the U.S. Senate in Tennesee in 2006 and lost to Republican Bob Corker. Ford's family has deep roots in the Memphis area -- his House seat had previously been held by his father -- but after the Senate loss, Ford moved to New York City to be with his girlfriend (now wife). Ford is now the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate, pro-business Democrats and a senior policy adviser at Bank of America. He's considering running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate against Kirsten Gillibrand, who was appointed to the seat by Gov. David Patterson after Hillary Clinton was named secretary of state. Gillibrand's appointment disappointed some Democrats, who believe she is too conservative on immigration and gun rights. But Ford's time in Tennessee is already coming back to haunt him. Not because he's a carpetbagger -- New York elected Robert F. Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, after all -- but because of several statements he made about abortion while running for Senate in Tennessee. There have been allegations that Ford flip-flopped, particularly after an interview last week in the New York Times. Reporter Michael Barbaro said in the interview that "we know you describe yourself as pro-life," but Ford interjected: "No, no, let's be clear." Later in the interview, Ford elaborated: "To say that I am pro-life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice." NARAL Pro-Choice New York, however, put out this YouTube video of Ford telling then-MSNBC host Tucker Carlson and then-Fox News host Alan Colmes during the 2006 campaign that he is "pro-life." Is this a classic flip-flop? Did he say one thing to appeal to the conservatives in Tennessee, and something else to strike a chord with the liberal New Yorkers? It's not that simple. Ford's actual positions on abortion didn't change at all -- just his descriptions of them. When Ford first ran for Congress, his district was safely Democratic and he ran as an abortion rights supporter. His voting record in Congress reflects this. For his five terms in the House, the National Right to Life Committee found Ford voted with the group's anti-abortion positions 5, 6, 18, 25 and 22 percent of the time. While he was running for Senate in Tennessee, Douglas Johnson, the committee's legislative director, wrote an open letter in which he said he was "astonished" journalists and commentators were "unskeptically" accepting Ford's "pro-life" declarations when "his claim ... cannot survive 10 minutes study of his actual voting record." But at the other end of the spectrum, NARAL Pro-Choice America isn't enamored with Ford, either. Its president, Nancy Keenan, said in a statement last week that Ford "did not have a consistently pro-choice record," and made clear the organization was supporting Gillibrand. Why are both sides unhappy? Ford isn't a purist on abortion rights. He supports them generally, but he also voted to ban late-term abortions and to require parental notification for girls under 18 seeking abortions. He's held those positions consistently, but has alternated between describing them as "pro-choice" or "pro-life." Ford's "pro-life" period appears to be an attempt to appeal to more conservative voters outside of his Memphis base while he was running for Senate in Tennessee. Aides also told the New York Daily News this week it was an attempt to make the "language of life" relevant to issues like education and health care. His two "pro-choice" periods come before he ran for the Senate in Tennessee and now that he may run in New York. So his descriptions have changed, but his positions haven't. We give Ford a Half-Flip.

pomt-15388	"Lincoln was fervently making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the (Civil War) was over. … The only thing that kept this from happening was his assassination."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/26/blog-posting/did-abraham-lincoln-plan-send-ex-slaves-central-am/	The debate over whether states should allow the Confederate battle flag in close proximity to their state capitol -- reignited by the June 17 killing of nine African-American worshippers in a historic church in South Carolina -- has intensified discussion of slavery and the Civil War on social media. A reader recently asked us to check out claims repeated in a variety of places on the Internet that offer a revisionist history of the Civil War, with a sympathetic spin on behalf of the Confederacy. Here, we’ll focus on one of the claims from those sites -- one that calls into question whether President Abraham Lincoln was really "the Great Emancipator": "Martyred President Abraham Lincoln was fervently making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the war was over," the Internet posts say. "Knowing that African society would never allow the slaves to return back to Africa, Lincoln also did not want the slaves in the U.S. He thought the jungles of Central America would be the best solution and conducive to the freed slaves best interest. The only thing that kept this from happening, was his assassination." We wondered whether mainstream historians believe that Lincoln was "making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the (Civil War) was over" and that "the only thing that kept this from happening was his assassination." The short answer is that Lincoln had long favored the "colonization" option, though as a voluntary option rather than a mandated removal. Moreover, his issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, rendered even that voluntary option effectively dead -- and since that was more than two years before the end of the war on April 9, 1865, his assassination didn’t stop it from happening. Lincoln never spoke publicly of colonization after issuing the proclamation, and apparently did little behind the scenes to advance the idea after that date, focusing instead on creating a post-war society that included both blacks and whites. "The post is preposterous," said Michael Burlingame, a historian who holds a distinguished chair in Lincoln studies at the University of Illinois at Springfield. The notion of re-colonizing slaves in Africa had a long history. The main group supporting the idea, the American Colonization Society, was founded in 1817. "The goal was the charitable and restorative ideal of un-kidnapping people from their homeland in Africa by offering to use private funds to transport them back voluntarily, for any who so wished," said James M. Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln collection at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill. Monrovia, Liberia, was founded in the 1820s by former American slaves, and by the early 1850s, Lincoln and like-minded politicians were supportive of that approach. But by the mid 1850s, the anti-slavery movement shifted toward stopping the spread of slavery to newly admitted states in the Great Plains and the West. In his book The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery, historian Eric Foner writes that by 1862, Lincoln, as well as politically moderate members of Congress, saw colonization as at least a piece of the policy puzzle. "Both the law providing for abolition in the District of Columbia and the Second Confiscation Act included provisions for the colonization of those willing to emigrate. During 1862, Congress appropriated a total of $600,000 to aid in the transportation overseas of African-Americans," Foner wrote. Policy entrepreneurs of varying trustworthiness offered colonization proposals in such far-flung locales as Brazil, Colombia, and the Caribbean island of St. Croix. But most black Americans weren’t buying. Seeking their support, Lincoln met with a black delegation at the White House on Aug. 14, 1862, and made the case for colonization. It was widely considered a failure. Lincoln offended his visitors, and others who read the after-the-fact newspaper coverage, by saying such things as, "It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated" and that for blacks to refuse to colonize elsewhere would be "extremely selfish." Undeterred, Lincoln continued to tout colonization when addressing Congress in December 1862 and asked lawmakers to offer funding. "I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization," he said. Yet within weeks, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which offered an entirely different model for post-Civil War America. One of the key elements of the proclamation was that it opened the door to military service for freed slaves. Cornelius noted that Mark Neely, in the Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia, published in 1982, wrote that "when Lincoln accepted freedmen as soldiers on Jan. 1, 1863, he guaranteed a biracial future for the country, because no president could ask a man to fight for his country and then tell him it was no longer his country." Foner agreed, writing that "Lincoln still retained an interest in colonization. But he would never again publicly advocate this policy. ... Putting some black men into the military and asking others to labor for wages implied a very different vision of their future place in American society than plans for settling them overseas." Instead, political attention turned to passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. The idea of colonization faltered further when news of disastrous attempts at settlement filtered back to Washington. "By 1864," Foner writes, "although Lincoln still saw voluntary emigration as a kind of safety valve for individual blacks dissatisfied with their condition in the United States, he no longer envisioned large-scale colonization. ... The idea of white America did not die with the Civil War, nor did blacks' own emigration efforts. But colonization as an official policy was dead." And that was well before Lincoln’s assassination on April 15, 1865. "His views, like those of millions of other Americans before and during his lifetime, evolved over the course of roughly 30 to 40 years," Cornelius said. Our ruling A widely shared bit of text on the Internet says that "Lincoln was fervently making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the (Civil War) was over. … The only thing that kept this from happening was his assassination." This is incorrect on many levels. Even when he was arguing for voluntary colonization during his first two years as president, Lincoln did not envision forced deportations of ex-slaves. Moreover, historians agree that the idea of large-scale, voluntary colonization was effectively dead by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on Jan. 1, 1863 -- more than two years before Lincoln’s assassination. We rate the claim False. EDITOR’S NOTE, July 9, 2015: After this article was published, we were contacted by three historians who have studied the period in question and offered additional information.

pomt-06911	Says "the most dangerous time for children" is from "3 to 6 p.m., during which time juvenile crime rates triple"	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/25/raymond-lesniak/state-sen-raymond-lesniak-says-juvenile-crime-rate/	In his bid to restore $3 million in funding for an organization that sponsors after-school programs, state Sen. Raymond Lesniak said juvenile crime rates triple between 3 and 6 p.m. Lesniak (D-Union) argued that after-school programs, in general, keep children out of trouble and without such initiatives, crime rates would rise. If New Jersey After 3 -- the organization Lesniak was trying to restore funding for -- shuttered its programs, "five thousand students in 13 school districts will be left unsupervised during the most dangerous time for children: 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., during which time juvenile crime rates triple and children are most likely to experiment with risky behavior," Lesniak said during a July 12 Senate hearing. "The effects of putting more children on the streets at a time when urban districts are forced to cut social services and layoff public safety officers will lead, most definitely, to an increase in crime." PolitiFact New Jersey researched Lesniak’s claim about juvenile crime rates and found that while the statistic comes from data nearly two decades old, his overall point is still sound. Lesniak got his information from NJ After 3, which mainly serves elementary and middle school children in urban areas. Mark Valli, the head of NJ After 3, cited Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a Washington, D.C.-based anti-crime organization. A 2000 study from Fight Crime: Invest in Kids said "in the hour after the school bell rings … violent juvenile crime suddenly triples" and "on school days, the prime time for violent juvenile crime is from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m." Data used for the study shows that from 1 to 2 p.m. the percent of violent juvenile crime occurring was 3.7 percent. Between 3 and 4 p.m., the rate had more than tripled to 12.1 percent. But the study is based on a 1997 study by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, a juvenile justice research organization, that analyzed the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, data from 1991 to 1993. The data for those years came from eight states -- not New Jersey -- and includes all offenders younger than 18. Violent crimes in that study included murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. New Jersey does not participate in the NIBRS and the state police do not specifically distinguish juvenile crimes by the time they occurred. Still, analysis of more recent NIBRS data on violent juvenile crime shows a spike after school. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a division of the U.S. Department of Justice, analyzed 2008 NIBRS data and found that juvenile violent crime, including violent sexual assault and simple assault, peaks at 3 p.m. on school days. The data -- represented as offenders per 1,000 juvenile violent crime offenders -- climbs from 39.3 between 1 and 2 p.m to 71.7 between 3 and 4 p.m. -- less than double. The juvenile justice office also notes that though the number of school days in a year is about equal to the number of nonschool days, 63 percent of violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days. Also, 19 percent of juvenile violent crimes occur between 3 and 7 p.m. on school days. It’s worth noting that violent juvenile crimes on nonschool days don’t follow the same time pattern as on school days -- on nonschool days, juvenile crime peaks between 7 and 9 p.m., according to the federal analysis. Melissa Sickmund, chief of systems research for the National Center for Juvenile Justice, said the real point is "that juvenile violence peaks right in the hours after school." And "that he got right," Sickmund said about Lesniak’s statement. "He just tried to be too precise." But there are some other problems with Lesniak’s statement. He was using the statistic to support funding for a New Jersey program that primarily serves elementary and middle school children, but the data doesn’t include figures from New Jersey, and includes all offenders younger than 18. Two experts told us that children younger than 10-years-old are rarely involved in violent crime. Back to Lesniak’s statement. He said juvenile crime rates triple between 3 and 6 p.m. The state Senator’s statistic was based on a study using FBI data -- that didn’t include New Jersey -- from the 1990s. Still, Lesniak’s argument that juvenile crime spikes when school lets out is sound -- and supported by more recent data. We rate his statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04708	In 2008, Charlie Crist ‘"applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do ‘a great job.’"	true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/04/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-charlie-crist-sarah-palin-said-grea/	On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Charlie Crist -- Florida’s former Republican governor turned independent -- penned an editorial in the Tampa Bay Times endorsing President Barack Obama. And voila! He landed a gig speaking at the Democratic National Convention. Crist’s decision to back Obama wasn’t totally shocking. Crist literally embraced Obama over the stimulus package in 2009, and a year later he was headed toward defeat in a GOP U.S. Senate primary against Marco Rubio. Crist fled the GOP for "no party affiliation" and still lost the 2010 Senate race. Now Floridians are wondering if Crist will officially turn blue and try to win back his old seat from Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2012. The latest step in Crist’s reinvention prompted Florida Republican leaders to rev up their Crist-bashing engines. One of those attacks is coming from George LeMieux, Crist’s former campaign strategist and chief of staff. "This isn't the Charlie Crist I knew," LeMieux wrote an editorial that ran in the Tampa Bay Times. LeMieux was the person Crist picked to fill a suddenly vacant Senate seat back in 2009. LeMieux hoped to return to the Senate by challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in November, but he dropped out of the Republican primary after lagging behind U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, now the nominee. LeMieux zeroed in on the fact that during the general election in 2008, Crist was a cheerleader for Obama’s rivals. "The Charlie Crist I knew eagerly endorsed and campaigned for Sen. John McCain against Barack Obama," LeMieux wrote. "He put himself forward as a potential vice presidential running mate for McCain. When he was not successful, Crist applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do ‘a great job.’ " Here, we will fact-check whether Crist said Palin would do "a great job" when McCain chose her as his running mate, and if his support for the ticket was as full-throated as LeMieux claimed. Crist praises McCain’s choice of Palin Crist was an early backer of McCain’s presidential bid and was often mentioned as a potential running mate. But on Aug. 29, McCain chose Palin, then the governor of Alaska, as his running mate. The Miami Herald noted at the time that Palin and Crist shared some traits: "She and Crist were among only three Republican governors elected in 2006. They ran populist campaigns. And their poll numbers remain high in their states." Crist’s office released a statement praising McCain’s choice: "Sen. John McCain has made a great pick in Gov. Sarah Palin. She has demonstrated tremendous leadership as the chief executive of her state." Crist went on national TV to praise McCain’s choice on the same day. CNN host Larry King asked Crist if he was disappointed that he wasn’t picked by McCain. "No, I was impressed at Gov. Palin being picked. I think that, once again, Sen. McCain has shown his independent streak, his maverick status, his go-with-the-gut call. And I think he made a great choice in Sen. (sic) Palin. I think that she'll be a great candidate. I watched her speech today. I was very impressed with not only what she had to say, but the way in which she delivered. I thought she was very effective, very articulate. And she's very bright. I've had the occasion to meet her at some governor association meetings and she's a very impressive lady." When King pressed Crist about whether Republicans would be able to sell Palin as commander in chief, part of Crist’s response was: "I think they will have no trouble talking about the attributes that Gov. Palin brings to the ticket. As I say, she is a governor, she has executive experience and I think she'll do a great job." Crist also described Palin as someone who is "not afraid to take on the establishment, not afraid to take on big oil companies, not afraid to establish tremendous ethics legislation. She's a reformer, worked incredibly hard in Alaska and will work incredibly hard in Washington to do exactly the kinds of things that Sen. McCain wants to do for our country. And that is to move us forward, to stand up for people, to stand up for country first and to do whatever it takes to put the people before any partisan politics. She's also reached across the aisle, as Sen. McCain has done; worked with Democrats, independents and Republicans to make a difference to the people of her state...." Crist and Palin on the campaign trail Crist campaigned alongside Palin in Clearwater and Jacksonville in October 2008 (here are some pics). Crist warmed up the crowd for Palin in Clearwater on Oct. 6: "It's giddy-up time. We've got to get the action going. … It's up to each and every one of you now, it really is. Sarah did her job on this night and brought it home. She is a great governor, she's one of us. She'll be a great vice president of the United States of America.'' On Oct. 22, 2008, Crist was interviewed about Palin on CNN. Interviewer Kiran Chetry asked Crist: "Are you fully confident that if anything were to happen to John McCain, Sarah Palin could take over as president from day one? Crist: "I think she would do a great job. I mean, realize that, you know, she really is the only executive that's running -- the only one who has been the head of the government in Alaska. She's held executive positions as a mayor, executive position as a governor. Made those kinds of decisions. I think she's ready." About a week after McCain-Palin lost, Crist didn’t jump on the blame-Palin bandwagon at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Miami. "She carried the banner for our party extraordinarily well. It was a tough campaign," Crist said. He said his party lost because Obama was such a great candidate and the sour economy was a terrible drag on Republicans, the Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog wrote. But when Palin took the stage, he wasn’t standing with her, although he said that was because he was working on his own speech. But sometimes love doesn’t last forever -- and the falling out was evident by the spring of 2010. As Crist lagged behind Rubio in the GOP Senate primary, it was clear Crist was considering leaving the Republican Party, and that would mean a break from Palin. In 2010, Palin publicly praised Rubio, while Crist named her in a campaign ad that accused Rubio, Palin and the tea party of following a road to "extremism." Our ruling LeMieux said that after Crist was passed over by McCain for vice president, "Crist applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do ‘a great job.’ " Yep, that was the case in 2008. Crist had heaps of praise for her and campaigned for the McCain-Palin ticket. Crist had plenty of motivation: It gave him free national publicity, and if McCain-Palin had won, Crist would have had some powerful buddies. It’s worth noting that Crist started backing away from his previous praise during his hard-fought loss to Rubio in the 2010 Republican primary for senate. In a campaign ad, he accused Rubio, Palin and the tea party of following a road to "extremism." And though the Truth-O-Meter isn’t in the business of making predictions, we think we are on safe ground to say that Crist won’t be praising Palin at the DNC. Still, we found lots of evidence to support LeMieux’s statement. We rate his claim True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election. See video fact-checks here.

pomt-12596	"The United States Department of Education has introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for the public schools, called ‘Access Islam.’ "	false	/florida/statements/2017/apr/05/volusia-county-republican-party/did-us-department-education-introduce-islamic-indo/	The Volusia County Republican Party says that the federal government is promoting Islam to public school children. "The United States Department of Education has introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for the public schools, called ‘Access Islam,’" states the mass email sent by the party April 2. The email said that classroom instructions have students learning "the core duties of Muslims" and "what it means to proclaim faith or belief as a Muslim." "The Education Department offers no similar learning material for Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism or any other major world religion. Just Islam," the email said. This claim earns a failing grade, though. Access Islam is a real program for school teachers looking to offer lesson plans on the religion of Islam. But to say it’s part of an "indoctrination program" delivered from the federal government isn’t accurate. Here’s your tutorial on the facts. Teaching Islam To support its claims, the party points to a March 28 video by the Christian Action Network, a group that says its goal is to "protect America’s religious and moral heritage through educational efforts." The video, narrated by network founder Martin Mawyer, criticizes Access Islam, a program produced by PBS’ Thirteen/WNET New York. The program received grant money from the federal government about a decade ago. The network recently sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to denounce the program and remove it from any government website. We looked at several of the lesson plans and videos from Access Islam, which draws from the PBS series Religion and Ethics Newsweekly. Much of the content provides educational information about religious traditions and holidays. Other video segments explained the tensions between Somali Muslim immigrants and other residents in Maine; how students learn in a madrassah, and the challenges faced by Muslims to differentiate themselves from terrorists. Lesson plans include facts such as that Muslims pray five times a day, cultural variations and what the First Amendment says about religion. It’s unclear how many schools have used the materials, and there is certainly no requirement that schools do. Mawyer told PolitiFact he found a few examples including the state of Indiana, which listed Access Islam in a resource guide for teachers of world history. The guide includes a disclaimer that the Indiana department hasn’t evaluated the materials which "are not intended to represent the best or only approach to any particular issue." In Florida, high school history standards include lessons about Islam such as a comparison of Islam, Judaism and Christianity and key developments in Islamic history. The Florida Department of Education said whether to use Access Islam is a decision for local school districts. Access Islam is not part of the resource list given to Volusia County Schools World History teachers however teachers can choose their own resources as long as they conforms to the standards, a district spokesperson said. Broward, Pinellas and Hillsborough school districts don’t use the Access Islam curriculum, district spokespersons said. The U.S. Education Department granted $166,000 in fiscal year 2005 and $8,000 in fiscal year 2006 for the program, but we could find no recent involvement by the department. In case there was any tinge of partisan politics, the grants came while George W. Bush, a Republican was president. Spokespersons for the department and PBS did not respond to our questions by our deadline. Experts on whether program is ‘indoctrination’ We asked four experts to review the Access Islam materials and all said they did not consider the materials to be "indoctrination": Linda K. Wertheimer, journalist and author of the book Faith Ed, Teaching About Religion In An Age of Intolerance; Mark Fowler, Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding deputy chief executive officer; Charles C. Haynes, Vice President of the Newseum Institute’s Religious Freedom Center and Diane Moore director of Harvard Divinity School’s Religious Literacy Project. Haynes said the claim that the lessons are indoctrination is "completely unfounded." "Nothing in these lessons crosses the constitutional line dividing education and indoctrination," he said. "Students learn the basic tenets and practices of Muslims and then are assessed on what they have learned. Students are not asked to affirm or reject any religious teachings. Nor are students required to participate in any religious or devotional activities." Wertheimer said the lessons are a clear example of teaching "about" religion. "It is not preaching or promoting Islam over other faiths," she said. "In fact, the lesson plans include questions about comparing and contrasting beliefs and practices of Islam to those of other faiths." Indoctrination has as its motivation having children choose a faith over another, Fowler said. But the lessons he reviewed didn’t ask students to choose a religion or rank them, he said. Moore said that the videos present individual Muslims’ personal experience of their faith. "When any religious tradition is only represented in its positive light, it can feel like indoctrination to those who don't believe the tradition has merit or has equal credibility to one's own faith," she said. "This is why it is so important to make the distinction between teaching about a religion and teaching religion, and the Access Islam site makes this distinction in its first lesson on the First Amendment." Our ruling The Republican Party of Volusia County says "The United States Department of Education has introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for the public schools, called ‘Access Islam.’ The Access Islam program was created by a New York PBS station about a decade ago and received some funding from the federal education department during the George W. Bush administration. The program includes educational lesson plans and videos about various topics related to Islam including how Muslims pray, but the materials we reviewed didn’t appear to try to convince students to become Muslims or to argue that Islam is a better religion than other world religions.

pomt-01756	Says U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo "opposes the repeal of Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jul/31/ed-macdougall/carlos-curbelo-opposes-repeal-obamacare-says-attac/	Republicans have a shot at winning back one South Florida congressional district: the seat held by U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, who ousted scandal-plagued GOPer David Rivera in 2012. Miami-Dade school board member Carlos Curbelo is the frontrunner in fundraising and establishment endorsements in a crowded GOP primary set for Aug. 26, 2014. That makes him the target of some of his opponents, including Ed MacDougall, the mayor of Cutler Bay. MacDougall portrays Curbelo as a Democrat -- a serious charge in a GOP primary (though overall the Miami-Dade/Monroe district now leans to the left.) In both a flier and a radio ad in Spanish, MacDougall portrays Curbelo as a defender of the Affordable Care Act, the law pushed by Democrats and President Barack Obama. On radio the narrator says, "Se opone a la apelación de Obamacare." (Our translation is "he opposes the appeal of Obamacare" but the ad is trying to refer to the "repeal" of Obamacare.) MacDougall is trying to get the votes of Republicans who support repeal. When we contacted MacDougall’s campaign, we received this response about his position: "Obamacare must be repealed, with no strings attached." Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, has voted more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare as a symbolic protest to the legislation. The Democratic-led Senate has refused to vote on the House bill. We decided to fact-check if Curbelo opposes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Curbelo’s statements A spokesman for MacDougall pointed to a December 2013 Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog for Curbelo’s comments related to repeal. The blog related to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that accused Curbelo of being part of "obsessive repeal efforts" to get rid of the health care law. The Miami Herald interviewed Curbelo and politics reporter Marc Caputo wrote: "Curbelo, in an email, suggested the ad is misleading because he doesn't want full repeal: ‘I support substituting Obamacare with legislation that genuinely makes healthcare affordable for all - including those with pre-existing conditions - and that does not punish low income earners and those that employ them.’ " We found other statements in which Curbelo was highly critical of the health care law but didn’t mention whether he wants to repeal it. In his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in March, Curbelo portrayed the law as a jobs-killer: "Under this law, workers are discouraged from seeking the jobs that they need and employers are encouraged to suppress employee hours. ... Obamacare is just the most recent example of the left’s misguided policies that close the path of upward social mobility for those that have the desire to grow and achieve more for themselves and their families." On his campaign website, Curbelo states that the law: "has increased the cost of healthcare for millions of Americans and is threatening our economic recovery. A law that gives the IRS an outsized role in our healthcare system, considers 30 hours a full work week, and cuts funding for Medicare is at best, deeply flawed." The Miami Herald editorial board questionnaire asked respondents if they support the law and Curbelo replied "no," but he did not specifically use the word "repeal." Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida in an email, "I clearly do not support the law and think it is bad policy. ... However I prefer to use the word ‘replace’ or ‘substitute’ Obamacare because to just say ‘repeal’ implies that there is no need for health care reform. But yes, if we replace or substitute Obamacare, that means it would no longer exist." While he wants to replace the law, he agrees with at least a couple of policy goals within it that we asked him about. "I agree with extending access to the health care system to people with pre-existing conditions. I believe that to be a worthy policy goal. I do not agree with the inefficient manner in which the ACA achieves that goal. I do not oppose letting young people stay on their family’s plans a little longer. 26 is probably too long – maybe 23 or 24. We have to remember there is a cost to all of this." Curbelo directed us to a a couple of sentences in an interview he gave in January to a Spanish-language show a Fondo. We translated the line this way: "Ideally, we need to get rid of/eliminate this law and start over, but that's not going to happen. So we need to sit down and rewrite the bad parts of this law.") Our ruling MacDougall said that Curbelo "opposes the repeal of Obamacare." MacDougall points to an interview Curbelo gave in December in which he said he was against total repeal but wanted to replace the law. In subsequent interviews, Curbelo called for a substantial overhaul of the law. MacDougall’s statement could leave voters with the false impression that Curbelo is a straight-up supporter of the health care law. Curbelo supports at least a couple of policy goals in the law -- such as providing coverage to those with pre-existing conditions -- but overall he is very critical of the law. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05186	Says Barack Obama "supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/13/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-supports-plan-ban-deer-hunting-ammuni/	Never mind that President Barack Obama has done little on gun issues -- so little, in fact, that gun control advocates are unhappy. The National Rifle Association continues to portray him as a relentless threat to the Second Amendment who wants to take your guns away. The NRA has a website called "Gun Ban Obama" that warns he "would be the most anti-gun president in American history." One article is headlined "Hillary was right: You can't trust Obama with your guns." In the mail comes a flier that offers "10 reasons why Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment." This week, we plan to focus on several of those top 10 reasons as part of an effort to triangulate Obama’s positions on guns and whether the NRA attacks are accurate. Here we’ll examine what the NRA listed as reason No. 2 -- "Obama supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition." It's an oldie, but a goodie. The NRA used the same general attack against John Kerry in 2004 and against Obama in 2008. The attack against Obama is rooted in a vote he took while serving in the U.S. Senate. It has to do with what the federal government considers armor-piercing ammunition (not, as the statement says, ammo for deer hunting). The sale, manufacture or import of armor-piercing ammunition in handguns was banned by Congress and President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The measure, which applied only to civilians and did not outlaw the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, passed the House 400-21 and the Senate 97-1. As part of the 1986 law, Congress defined armor-piercing ammunition as: (i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or (ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. In 2005 -- as he had in years past -- former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy offered an amendment to a gun bill that would have broadened the definition of armor-piercing ammunition -- moving away from specific metals and weights to include ammunition capable of penetrating body armor. Specifically, Kennedy proposed to add: (iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be capable of penetrating body armor; or (iv) a projectile for a center-fire rifle, designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be more likely to penetrate body armor than standard ammunition of the same caliber.''. Kennedy’s amendment was defeated 64-31. Obama voted in favor of the amendment. To be clear, Kennedy wasn’t proposing to outlaw deer-hunting ammunition (and so it’s even a bigger stretch to say Obama supported it). Kennedy’s amendment changed the definition of what is considered armor-piercing ammunition. It had nothing to do with deer hunting. It’s the NRA that interpreted the deer-hunting connection. The gun rights group did not respond to us for this fact-check, but the group previously explained its thinking to FactCheck.org during the 2008 campaign. Specifically, the NRA said it was worried about Kennedy’s (iii) definition of armor piercing, because: 1.) There are a few (uncommon) models of handguns that can shoot rifle rounds, and; 2.) Most rifle rounds are considered armor piercing. Therefore, the NRA concluded, the government can ban the rifle rounds used to hunt deer. That reasoning ignores the latitude the amendment gives to the attorney general and Kennedy’s own words when asked about the intent of the change. "This is not about hunting. We know duck and geese and deer do not wear armor vests; police officers do," Kennedy said during debate about the amendment. Still, David B. Kopel, research director of the Independence Institute, a libertarian-leaning group that generally opposes government regulation, says Kennedy’s bill language is broad enough to allow for the banning of almost any ammunition and that his intent may be irrelevant. (Kopel’s writings have appeared on the NRA website.) "Sen. Kennedy, the sponsor of the bill, said that he did not want to ban hunting ammunition," Kopel said. "Nevertheless, the plain language of the bill, and not Sen. Kennedy’s floor statements, were what would be enacted into law. If there were ever a judicial challenge to ban particular rifle ammunition, a court might well find that the language of the statute, along with judicial deference to agency interpretation of the statute, meant there was no need to look to legislative history." William Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University-Sacramento and a former Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agent, sees this differently. While it’s true that almost all rifle ammunition will penetrate body armor worn by police, "it is absolutely ludicrous to believe that a Democratic administration would have risked the political fallout of trying to use this section to prohibit rifle ammunition. "The Democrats have avoided all gun control controversies assiduously," Vizzard said, adding that the attempts to ban armor piercing ammunition is "as phoney as the typical NRA issue." "This is an example of both sides pushing symbolism over substance," he said. There are other problems with the NRA claim. In its 2008 attack, the NRA -- using the same evidence -- claimed Obama wanted to "ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition," arguing that "many" bullets designed and intended for use in rifles (including hunting rifles) have, over the years, been used in special-purpose hunting and target handguns, thus they ‘may be used in a handgun.’" The 2012 version of the attack drops the qualifier "virtually" but ignores that the NRA’s own research found that "many" -- not all -- bullets designed for rifles can be used in special-purpose handguns. Moreover, the proposed changes would not have outlawed any ammunition completely. Federal law does not prohibit the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, and Kennedy’s amendment wouldn’t have changed that. Point being, you could keep the ammo you have. You can do a quick Google search and find plenty of people in chat rooms discussing the "AP" rounds they acquired or own. The NRA’s claim was found to be misleading in 2008 by fact-checkers working for the Washington Post, CNN and Factcheck.org. Said Factcheck.org in 2008: "We grant that it is a theoretical possibility that some future administration could interpret Kennedy’s language as banning common hunting ammunition, despite Kennedy’s clear statement of intent to the contrary. But we judge the likelihood of that to be vanishingly small, given the outcry that would surely follow." Our ruling In its best light, the NRA claim is cherry-picking an extreme, worst-case interpretation of an amendment proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. But even if you accept the NRA’s rationale -- which we do not -- the group fails to prove that Obama supports a ban on "all deer-hunting ammunition." It’s entirely possible Obama voted for Kennedy’s amendment and still would have opposed a ban on deer-hunting ammunition. (For the record, there’s no evidence of Obama acting on a deer-hunting ammunition ban during his first term as president.) Moreover, it’s worth noting that the use and possession of armor-piercing ammunition for handguns is not a federal crime. That would not have changed if Kennedy’s amendment passed. The NRA says Barack Obama "supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition." We rate that claim False.

pomt-05459	Says more than 8,000 people have supported her campaign as volunteers, donors and advisors and endorsers.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/24/mary-nolan/can-portland-city-council-candidate-mary-nolan-cou/	Campaigns like to highlight the number of donors and volunteers on board. The numbers can be a great gauge of a person’s grassroots support, although the figures may not have much bearing on whether that candidate wins. State Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, is no different in her campaign to unseat incumbent Amanda Fritz from the Portland City Council. On Nolan’s campaign website, she lists heavy-hitting endorsements from former Gov. Barbara Roberts and former Portland Mayor Vera Katz. And this: "Over 8,000 people have supported her campaign as volunteers, donors and advisors and endorsers." More than 8,000 individuals support Nolan? The number seemed a bit suspect for a City Council race. It’s a small matter, but if it’s meant to reflect broad support, we figured it was ripe for a fact check. First, we checked with other Portland city candidates to get a ballpark feel. We started with the three main mayoral contenders. Stacey Dycus, campaign director for candidate Jefferson Smith, said the campaign has 2,000 individual donors, 850 volunteers, and endorsements from 500 people. Of course, those numbers probably overlap. Campaign manager Jessica Moskovitz said Charlie Hales’ campaign probably has about 4,000 people in the category of endorsers, volunteers, supporters and donors. We checked the list of supporters on his website and found at least 800 individual names. Neel Pender, a spokesman for Eileen Brady, said such numbers can be fuzzy -- it’s all in how you count them after all -- but that "8,000 seems high unless you count all the members of your endorsing organizations." Brady’s website lists more than 700 individual names as supporters. Again, we’re looking at magnitude, not exactitude. But it appears that 8,000 individual supporters is a big number for a citywide race. KJ Lewis, Nolan’s campaign manager, cleared up the mystery behind the numbers pretty quickly for us. She explained that the campaign included the individual members of unions that have endorsed Nolan -- even if the individual might not support Nolan. Is that fair? "I think so, because they all contribute to their union so they have a collective voice; they have a process to decide who they are endorsing," Lewis said. "I think a case could be made that the union members can be counted as supporters. Let’s see which unions back Nolan, according to her website: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW Local 48); American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME Local 189, AFSCME Local 328, AFSCME council 37); International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU Local 8 and state council); Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 49). Also, Portland firefighters and police. That’s a hefty list. Did the unions care that she was counting some of their members as individual supporters to boost her number? "My members know she’s been a friend of the IBEW for many, many years," said Joe Esmonde, political director for electrical workers. "I get elected and chosen to make these decisions and put it to the membership, and I’m down in the Capitol a lot and she has a 97 percent rating from the AFL-CIO, and she’s always been good to the building trades." Sure, he acknowledges that all 1,600 active members in Portland may not vote for her -- or vote at all -- but he’s OK with Nolan counting his people. So were other representatives we called. Of course, you’re probably thinking, what else would they say? Fritz makes the point, rightly, that not all members of a union will support the endorsement. Nolan’s campaign website states that more than 8,000 people volunteer, donate, advise and endorse her. (By the way, the last time we checked Nolan had at least 280 individuals named as supporters on her website; Fritz had 480. We heart you Excel!) Unions are valuable when it comes to campaigning on behalf of a candidate -- making phone calls, knocking on doors -- and donating political action committee money. But a union endorsement is not the same thing as getting support or money from the individuals who make up that union. The statement is partially accurate in that certain unions with their memberships have endorsed Nolan. But the statement takes things out of context, in that the members have not all individually cited support for Nolan. We find her statement Half True.

pomt-07766	The five states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers all rank below 44th in the nation in test scores, while Wisconsin ranks 2nd.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/23/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/labor-union-supporters-say-wisconsin-test-scores-v/	In tweets and Facebook postings, supporters of labor unions in Wisconsin have promoted statistics that would suggest that collective bargaining for teachers -- which would be severely restricted under a proposal by Gov. Scott Walker -- is correlated with higher scores on standardized academic tests. On Feb. 23, we found the following version on Facebook by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin: "Only 5 states do not have collective bargaining for educators and have deemed it illegal. Those states and their ranking on ACT/SAT scores are as follows: South Carolina -50th/ North Carolina -49th/ Georgia -48th/ Texas -47th/ Virginia -44th. If you are wondering, Wisconsin is currently ranked #2." When a reader brought this to our attention, we thought it deserved a look. First, we checked to see whether it’s true that only five states bar teachers from collective bargaining. We found a webpage maintained by the National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group that urges "reforms of the nation's teacher policies." The group agrees. It reports that all but five states -- Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- "either require or permit school districts to bargain a contract with the local teachers' union." While the organization notes that states' "scope of bargaining statutes has a considerable impact on the balance of power," we think the Facebook post is accurate because it referred explicitly to states that deemed teacher collective bargaining "illegal." With that question out of the way, we’ll take a look at the thornier question of how those five states' test scores stack up nationally, and against Wisconsin in particular. On Feb. 20, 2011, Angus Johnston, an adjunct assistant professor at the City University of New York, published a comprehensive analysis of this question on his blog. He published links to a chart that appears to have been the inspiration for the tweets and Facebook postings. It offers a state-by-state analysis of scores on the SAT and the ACT, the two leading college-admissions tests, assembled by University of Missouri law professor Douglas O. Linder. Johnston is critical of Linder’s methodology for a variety of reasons, which he explains in more detail here. But without even taking those concerns into account, we find the statistics unreliable. They were published in 1999, meaning that the statistics themselves are likely more than a dozen years old -- far too old to be presumed valid in 2011. Fortunately, it’s possible to obtain state-by-state rankings for the SAT and ACT of a more recent vintage. Here’s a table of the relevant states: Mean SAT scores by state, 2010: State Overall Score National Rank Participation Rate Wisconsin 1778 3rd 4 percent Virginia 1521 34th 67 percent North Carolina 1485 38th 63 percent Texas 1462 45th 53 percent Georgia 1453 48th 74 percent South Carolina 1447 49th 66 percent Mean ACT scores by state, 2009 State Overall Score National Rank Participation Rate Wisconsin 22.3 13th 67 percent Virginia 21.9 22nd 20 percent North Carolina 21.6 26th 15 percent Texas 20.8 35th 30 percent Georgia 20.6 40th 40 percent South Carolina 19.8 46th 50 percent Before we analyze these figures, let us explain why we included the fourth column above -- "participation rate." That refers to the percentage of high school graduates in that state who took the test in question. The SAT and the ACT serve the same general purpose -- gauging academic achievement for college admissions, but the tests are essentially competitors in the marketplace. By force of tradition or other factors, states vary widely in the percentage of students who take one test rather than the other (or both). So, knowing the participation rate is crucial to knowing whether the ranking being measured is statistically valid. Consider Wisconsin’s third-place ranking in the SAT. It sounds great -- but only 4 percent of graduates in the state took the test in 2010, and those that did likely did so because they had a particular need to take the SAT as they applied to certain colleges. And that means that Wisconsin SAT takers were a self-selecting group, probably more academically advanced than average. As a result, it’s fairer to look at Wisconsin’s ranking on the ACT, which was taken by 67 percent of graduates in 2009. And that ranking was 13th in the nation -- not bad, but well short of the 2nd place finish cited in the Facebook post. Meanwhile, in the five non-collective-bargaining states, the SAT was the more widely taken test, and in those rankings, the non-union states placed between 34th and 49th nationally. Meanwhile, for the ACT -- where participation ranged from 15 percent to 50 percent -- the rankings in the non-union states ranged from 22nd to 46th. So, on neither test did the five non-collective bargaining states perform as well as Wisconsin did, and in general those five states clustered in the bottom half of the national rankings. Given these statistics, it’s reasonable to say that Wisconsin outperformed the other five states significantly -- but not as overwhelmingly as the blog and Facebook posts suggest. After we contacted the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, Melissa Baldauff, the party’s research director, wrote us to say that "after further investigation, we determined that the data was not the most up-to-date. Accordingly, we have removed the post from our Facebook page." We should add another key question: What does SAT and ACT data actually tell us about the connection between collective bargaining rights and student achievement? The answer is a little -- but not very much. Looking only at these six states, there’s a suggestion that lack of collective bargaining rights for teachers is mildly correlated with test scores, even though the linkage is a lot less striking than the Facebook post suggests. Still, it’s impossible to know whether collective bargaining has any role in causing test scores to rise. That’s because countless other demographic, economic and cultural factors play a role in shaping a state’s test scores. "Most of the states that don’t have teachers’ unions are poorer than Wisconsin and have more English Language Learners in their schools, and rank higher for other demographic factors that make strong academic performance less likely," Johnston wrote. "Rich kids in a school with a teacher’s union will do better than poor kids in a school without one, generally, but that doesn’t have much to do with the union itself." Consider just one statistic -- the percentage of residents living below the poverty line. Wisconsin ranked 38th in the nation, similar to Virginia (39th), and well below Texas (8th), South Carolina (9th), Georgia (13th) and North Carolina (15th). The fact that many fewer Wisconsin residents, proportionally, were impoverished almost certainly had an impact in shaping the states’ comparative test results. Matthew Di Carlo, a senior fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which studies education policy, added in a recent blog post that there’s "tremendous variation within and between states in the strength of individual locals (there are thousands) and in the terms of the contracts they have negotiated, to say nothing of all the other factors that might influence achievement," such as school-level policies, student characteristics and resource availability. In general, Di Carlo notes that, according to the available evidence, there may be some overall benefit from unions on student test scores, but due to all the complex factors involved, there is little basis for drawing strong causal conclusions. He also pointed out that unions confer other benefits, such as improved communication between teachers and administrators. However, that’s all beyond the scope of our item. Ultimately, the Facebook post uses outdated data based on a questionable methodology. A review using current data finds that Wisconsin does perform better on test scores than the non-union states, but not as dramatically as suggested in the Facebook post. And there is at best limited evidence that unionization played a causal role in shaping differences in test scores. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00061	"The Democrat plan would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage ... seniors who have been paying for this for years (and) will not be taken care of anymore."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/02/donald-trump/medicare-all-expands-medicare-does-not-obliterate-/	President Donald Trump has picked up a time-tested Democratic attack line. "A vote for Democrats is also a vote to destroy Medicare," Trump said at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Oct. 26. When Democrats said Republicans "voted to end Medicare" in 2011, we called it the Lie of the Year. Trump is also wrong here. In rallies across the country, Trump has been claiming health care coverage for the elderly is under threat by Medicare for All, a plan Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced in September 2017. "The Democrat plan would – it would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage ... Do you know about this? Has anyone heard this? It will obliterate 700,000 North Carolina seniors who have been paying for this for years (and) will not be taken care of anymore." Trump said the same thing in a Wisconsin rally. First, there are a wide array of approaches Democrats have proposed to expand health care coverage. Medicare for All is the most aggressive plan that offers most benefits to seniors, but it is certainly not supported by all Democrats. It had 16 co-sponsors in the Senate, which is fewer than half the Senate Democrats. Similar legislation in the House has 123 co-sponsors. It has been referred to a Senate committee, but nothing more has been done with it. While the Sanders bill would likely change Medicare, it would not get rid of it or "obliterate" it. The Sanders bill would transform the health insurance system from a mix of private and public coverage options that depend on age, employment and income, to a single-payer system where everybody would be insured through the government. "It would mean people who are currently enrolled (in Medicare) would get something much more generous and comprehensive than they are currently getting," said Linda Blumberg, health policy fellow with the Urban Institute. Medicare serves almost one out of six Americans. It primarily covers people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. Medicare has four main parts, but three – B, C and D – are optional. People can decide to use them and pay premiums for the coverage. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage for part A. Medicare Advantage is the C component; it’s run by private companies and offers the services Medicare does and more, such as dental or vision coverage. About a third of Medicare enrollees are signed up for such a plan. Under Sanders’ plan, after a four-year transition period, all of these components would be replaced with a health care plan that includes vision, hearing and dental coverage, as well as stronger financial protections. There would be no premiums or cost-sharing requirements, other than limited cost-sharing (up to $200 per year) on prescription drugs. Patients would be allowed to go to any provider, not limited by a network. Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, said provider access might change when the federal government is in charge of negotiating and potentially setting rates for services. The amount of services providers are willing to offer, for example, may decrease if the prices are too low. Tricia Neuman, director of the program on Medicare Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said Sanders’ bill includes a provision that would allow doctors to opt out of the program, just as they can under Medicare. "For this to create widespread access problems, doctors would need to have enough patients who are wealthy enough to pay whatever fees the doctors charge out of their own pockets," Neuman said. "So far, this happens very rarely under Medicare." But the effect it would have remains to be seen. The same goes for cost; the revenue options are not incorporated in the legislative language. But Sanders has proposed funding through payroll taxes as well as income taxes for the highest earners. That would only affect the highest-earning seniors. The same benefits would be extended to all citizens; the plan would eliminate employer-based coverage and replace virtually all private insurance. Our ruling Trump said, "The Democrat plan would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage ... seniors who have been paying for this for years (and) will not be taken care of anymore." Not all Democrats support Medicare for All. The proposed new system gets rid of Medicare and Medicare Advantage as they stand in order to expand health benefits. Nobody would lose their health care coverage. We rate this statement False.

pomt-13152	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/31/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-doesnt-believe-ther/	With just over a week until the rematch between Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, the volley of attacks is at full speed. The two candidates met separately with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board. About 40 minutes into his visit, Feingold offered a series of issues he believes Johnson has overlooked, including climate change. Johnson "doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change," Feingold said. Later in the meeting, he added climate change "is an issue that was bipartisan before people like Senator Johnson were elected and started saying absolute nonsense about sunspots and other reasons to avoid the issue." We wondered whether Feingold is right that Johnson has denied a human role in climate change. Johnson’s record When Johnson and Feingold first ran against each other in 2010, Johnson definitively told the Journal Sentinel’s editorial board his position at the time: "I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. It’s not proven by any stretch of the imagination." The far more likely cause, he said, is "sunspot activity or something just in the geologic eons of time where we have changes in the climate." Ben Voelkel, a Johnson campaign spokesman, told us Johnson later acknowledged humans played a role in climate change in a 2014 interview with Boston Public Radio. "There are other forces that cause climate to change," Johnson told Here and Now’s Robin Young. "So climate does change and I don’t deny that man has some effect on that. It certainly has a great deal of effect on spoiling our environment in many different ways." But Johnson softened his view as soon as the next sentence: "I’ve got a very open mind, but I don’t have the arrogance that man can really do much to affect climate." The next year, Johnson voted against a Senate amendment to affirm that human activity significantly contributes to climate change. While all but one senator supported an earlier amendment affirming the existence of climate change, only five Republicans this time voted to acknowledge there is a human impact. The amendment, seen as a symbolic effort by the Democrats to force GOP senators to take a position, failed 50 to 49 (it required a 3/5 majority). Meanwhile, an energy policy position that appeared on Johnson’s campaign website in 2015 questioned human’s impact on climate change: "Man-made global warming remains unsettled science. World-renowned climate experts have raised serious objections to the theories behind these claims. I believe it is a bad idea to impose a policy that will raise taxes on every American, will balloon energy prices and will hurt our economic competiveness (sic) – especially on such uncertain predictions." That passage has since been removed. In August 2016, when asked about global warming on WRJN-AM radio in Racine, Johnson seemed to think it settled — before tempering his response. "Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it," he said. "The climate has always changed, it always will. … The question is, how much does man cause changes in our environment, changes in our climate, and what we could possibly even do about it?" Since Feingold made the claim, Johnson’s statements have been a similarly mixed bag: He called himself a "skeptic" of man-made climate change in a meeting with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 21, 2016. He downplayed the issue of global warming three days later — saying mankind flourishes in warmer weather — while admitting humans "obviously" play a role. But these statements aren’t relevant to a claim made weeks earlier. Our rating Feingold said Johnson "doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change." Johnson did not support a Senate amendment to acknowledge a man-made role in climate change and expressed skepticism each of the few times he acknowledged humans might contribute. He has acknowledged at times that humans can play a role but downplayed how significant that role might be. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7ea29645-7850-49e8-9a39-5f24dedffe12	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-10-31T05:00:00	2016-10-06	['United_States']
pomt-00338	Says Dino Rossi "stripped" health care "from 45,000 children."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/18/house-majority-pac/dino-rossi-take-away-coverage-45000-children/	Did Dino Rossi, a Republican Washington state senator running for U.S. Congress, once take away coverage from 45,000 children? That’s what an attack ad by the House Majority PAC claimed. "He’s back. Dino Rossi," the voiceover in the ad says. "Rossi first showed up in Olympia decades ago. He went to work! Health care stripped from 45,000 children." They’re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman. The budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time. But the cut didn’t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn't a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changes ultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid. While it didn’t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor. First, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family’s income was over the income standard, the child’s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals. Third, it adopted new income verification requirements; while it previously accepted a family’s statements, it now verified the information provided through available databases. "These changes were requested by the legislature and they did have the impact of reducing the children’s caseload by at least 45,000," said Amy Blondin, chief communications officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority. Andrew Bell, spokesman for Dino Rossi, said the changes Rossi pushed forward in the budget ensured resources were given to the neediest families. "So it seems like the HCA is saying that that was a combination of families who were making enough money to afford healthcare themselves moved off of Medicaid coverage, and a reduction in wealthy families who were cheating the system and taking health care from poorer families," Bell said. "Either way, this seems to leave more resources available for truly needy families (which is the standard we've always used)." That’s one way to interpret the drop. Using data from the Medical Assistance Administration, the University of Washington Health Policy Analysis Program found most children leaving Medicaid weren’t ineligible in an April 2004 study. "In fact, only about 20 to 30 percent of the children removed are ineligible for Medicaid," the report read. "Most are eligible but are inhibited from getting coverage because of the administrative barriers and hurdles described above." When the first two rules changed back (and income verification stay put) in 2005, the numbers mostly returned to normal. Source: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2006 "I don’t think that ‘wealthy’ families were taking advantage of the program given the bounce back in enrollment," said Tricia Brooks, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. Our ruling The ad said Rossi stripped health care from 45,000 children. Rossi wasn’t solely responsible for the move, but he did support it. The 2003 Washington state Senate budget measure he voted for increased administrative hurdles for children seeking Medicaid coverage. Most of the eligible children regained coverage when the rules changed back in 2005. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-00529	My support from young voters -- those 18 to 24 -- in November 2014 was "largely unheard of for a Republican."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/22/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-has-unusually-strong-appeal-a/	As Gov. Scott Walker moves closer to launching his presidential campaign, he’s working to distinguish himself from a crowd of contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination. Walker, one of the younger contenders in the field, often reminds audiences he has successfully faced statewide voters three times since 2010. He took that talking point a step further June 2, 2015 when responding to a question in Florida about how the party can appeal to younger voters, especially after the dismal showing of Mitt Romney among young voters in 2012. President Barack Obama took 60 percent of the 18- to 24-year-old vote, compared with 36 percent for Romney. "Last year, when I was up for election -- again, for the third time -- we won again," Walker said. "But we carried -- one of the polls, exit polls -- showed we went 49-48 amongst 18- to 24-year-olds. That's largely unheard of for a Republican." Was Walker’s performance among young voters in 2014 unusually strong for a Republican? Behind the numbers In November 2014, Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke, 53 percent to 46 percent, to win a second term. He previously won a recall election in 2012. In 2014, Edison Research conducted an exit poll for a number of news organizations based on responses from voters after they left the polling place. In his claim, Walker specifically referenced voters 18 to 24 years old and said he "carried" that group. But Walker had the numbers reversed: Burke won 49 percent, while Walker had 48 percent, according to the exit poll. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, Walker’s campaign exploratory group, said the governor misspoke. In the 2012 recall, Walker won that age group by 51 percent to 48 percent. Strong said he was thinking of that when he made the "carried" comment and mistakenly combined the 2012 edge with the 2014 numbers. However, it is important to note that the 18 to 24 year old segment in the 2014 exit poll included only 191 voters -- about 8 percent of the overall sample of 2,319 voters. That means it carries a large margin of error, said Joe Lenski, executive vice president for Edison. And that kind of margin of error for the subgroup makes analysis of that portion of the poll difficult. "There’s really not much you can say other than among 18 to 24 year olds they were really close," Lenski said of Walker and Burke. How Walker compares But what about Walker’s broader point, that his appeal to young voters in 2014 was unusually strong for a Republican candidate? That’s difficult to measure as well, according to Lenski and Charles Franklin, a respected pollster and director of the Marquette Law School poll. Franklin suggested comparing Walker’s performance with young voters to that of other Republican governors who were up for re-election in November 2014. Here’s a look at three such races: Florida: Among 18 to 24 year olds, the exit poll showed Republican Gov. Rick Scott had 38 percent, while Democrat Charlie Crist and Libertarian Adrian Wyllie had a combined 62 percent. So Scott, who won reelection, did not fare as well as Walker. When you look at the broader group of 18- to 29-year olds, Scott had 41 percent. Michigan: In the 18 to 24 group, the exit poll showed Republican incumbent Rick Snyder had 46 percent, while Democrat Mark Schauer had 52 percent. Again, Walker fared a bit better than Snyder, who won reelection. Among 18- to 29-year olds, Snyder had 48 percent. Ohio: Numbers were not available for the 18 to 24 group, but the exit poll showed Republican incumbent John Kasich won 56 percent of the 18 to 29 year olds, compared with 41 percent for his challenger, Ed Fitzgerald. In Wisconsin in 2014, Walker had 47 percent of the votes in that broader group, compared to 51 percent for Burke. So, Kasich fared better than Walker, but it should be noted he won reelection in a landslide, 64 percent to 33 percent. That points to another challenge with a claim such as the one made by Walker. Candidates don’t run by themselves. For voters, it is a choice between two (or even more) contenders. Lenski said younger voters nationally -- especially in the 25-29 year old group -- tend to lean Democratic, in part because of the excitement stirred by Obama’s first campaign in 2008. Strong, the Walker spokeswoman, pointed to a Nov. 7, 2014 story in The College Fix, a right-leaning web site that is written by college students. The story noted that in the 2014 election, "overall, exit polls found voters age 18 to 29 favored Democratic candidates by a margin of 54 percent to 43 percent in U.S. House races, a trend often mirrored in Senate and gubernatorial races as well. Yet the youth vote was key in several of the battleground states where Republicans won." So, generally speaking, Walker’s performance was better than that of a typical Republican among young voters. Our rating Walker said his performance in 2014 indicates that he appeals to young voters in a way "that’s largely unheard of for a Republican." He based his claim on a narrow group of voters -- 18 to 24 year olds. When we measured his claim against the performance of three other Republican governors for the same election he fared better than two and not as well as the third, who won in a landslide. In any case, the data comes with a wide margin of error and should be used cautiously. As poll director Lenski said: the best we can say is that it was close. We rate Walker’s claim Half True.

pomt-15286	President Barack Obama met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/24/restoration-pac/barack-obama-met-iran-president-says-pac-backing-w/	A new super PAC supporting U.S. Sen Ron Johnson’s re-election bid released a TV ad July 22, 2015 that praises the Wisconsin Republican while criticizing President Barack Obama on Iran. A still image used in the ad, funded by the suburban-Chicago based Restoration PAC, purports to show Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Both men are smiling. Obama led negotiations that resulted in a deal, eight days before the ad was released, aimed at limiting the nuclear weapons capability of Iran -- a nation regarded by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. The two nations have been adversaries since 1979, when Islamic militants took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. So, was there a historic meeting between the two presidents that somehow never made worldwide headlines? The group and its ad Restoration PAC is led by Doug Truax, who in 2014 ran in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. It was formed in January 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission. The PAC said in a news release that the ad is running in Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay in support of Johnson. He faces a tough re-election battle from former U.S. Sen. Russell Feingold, the Democrat he defeated in 2010 to win the Senate seat. At one point in the ad, the narrator says: "Iran is funding terrorism not just in the Middle East but in Africa, Asia, South America and right here in the United States. Some of our leaders, like Ron Johnson, understand that preventing Iran from getting the bomb is essential to our safety." Then an an image of Obama and Rouhani appears on the screen as the narrator says: "Others, like President Obama, insist on signing a toothless agreement that makes us less safe." A fake? The day after the ad was released, BuzzFeed News posted an article saying that not only have Obama and Rouhani never met, but that the image used in the ad was fake. Without citing a source, the article said the image was created from a photograph of Obama meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan in 2011. Asked for comment, Restoration PAC spokesman Dan Curry said, according to BuzzFeed: "I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re saying that’s a photoshop -- can you explain what you’re talking about?" When Curry was told that Obama and Rouhani have never met, Curry said he would "take a look at that," BuzzFeed reported. Curry did not reply to request for comment from PolitiFact Wisconsin. Perhaps because there is no meeting he could point to. In September 2013, Obama and Rouhani made history by talking on the phone -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979. That signaled a change in relations that culminated in the nuclear deal. But, as two experts on Iran told us -- barring some meeting that has never been made public -- a phone call is the closest the two presidents have gotten. Certainly there is no record of them ever meeting in person. Our rating Through an image in a TV ad backing Johnson, Restoration PAC claimed Obama had met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. The image shows the two men together smiling and shaking hands. There is no record that any such meeting has ever occurred. That makes the claim ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. Editor's note: After this item was posted, Curry called PolitiFact Wisconsin to say the group had decided the day before -- after the Buzzfeed article -- to replace the image with side-by-side photos of the two men. He said the new ad began running the morning of July 24, 2015. (However, the old version contined to appear on YouTube and as a link from the group's website that afternoon). In a statement, Curry criticized BuzzFeed as "not able to provide any proof that the photo was fake" and noted the photo "is in circulation widely on the internet, posted on dozens of websites. There also are no articles directly claiming the image is fake. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are replacing the image with side-by-side Obama and Rouhani photos that makes exactly the same point." Editor's note II: When posted, this item included a link to a video of the ad in question. The group has now taken it down, so we have removed the link.

pomt-00546	"The United States still ranks 20th in the world in access to broadband -- over 50 percent below the best nations."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/17/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-us-ranks-20th-access-broadband-/	As a part of his plan to improve the nation’s infrastructure, U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold wants to get America plugged in. Feingold, who is looking to reclaim his old seat on Capitol Hill, outlined a plan June 5, 2015 at the state Democratic Convention for improving the country’s infrastructure: roads, bridges and even broadband. Broadband provides a high-speed Internet connection necessary for everything from streaming videos to doctors treating patients over the Web. Feingold said the United States has fallen behind and that other countries have a higher percentage of residents on broadband. "The United States still ranks 20th in the world in access to broadband -- over 50 percent below the best nations," he said. We decided to see for ourselves. Do we rank 20th? In making the claim, Feingold relied on data from the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, an advocacy group established by the United Nations and the International Telecommunication Union to promote broadband access throughout the world. But he cited outdated numbers: In 2012, the United States ranked 20th. In 2013, the most recent year available, the United States ranked 24th. Both years, around 28 percent of residents in the United States subscribed to fixed, or wired, broadband. Fixed broadband access is an important measurement, but a country’s connectedness cannot be described using just one number. Feingold overlooked the percentage of residents with mobile broadband subscriptions, which includes cell phones and hotspots. In this category, the United States ranks 10th. Between 2011 and 2013, The United States' access to mobile broadband increased from 65.5 percent of residents to 92.8 percent, even though its international ranking fell from 8 to 10. At the same time, the percentage of residents who subscribe to fixed broadband remained about the same. Is the distinction important? Technology experts note the reliability of fixed broadband is more important to the economy than mobile broadband. "I think that most people would agree … that for businesses and the economy, a robust fixed-broadband network is still a key indicator," Vanessa Gray, a senior analyst for the International Telecommunication Union, said in an email. Wireless broadband does not boast the reliability or speed of fixed broadband, but mobile broadband has seen an increase in investment in recent years. A report from the Federal Communications Commission dated Feb. 4, 2015 said, "Wireless providers in the U.S. have spent more than $134 billion in capital investments during the past five years, and incremental capital investment by wireless providers rose by more than 10 percent from 2012 to 2013 to $33.1 billion." The same FCC report indicated America was behind in its goals to implement fixed broadband nationwide. The areas with the least access include rural areas, American Indian reservations, and some U.S. territories. Many American schools have access to broadband, but they are still behind in terms of broadband speed. Over 50 percent lower Feingold’s claim also noted the United States ranked "over 50 percent below the best nations." Monaco ranks at the top of the world for fixed broadband access, with 44.7 percent of its residents having access to fixed broadband. That is 57 percent higher than the United States, where 28 percent of residents have fixed broadband access. Singapore sits at the top of the world for mobile broadband access, with its mobile subscriptions outnumbering its population. In this tally, each device (cell phones, tablets, etc) is counted separately, so the percentage listed for Singapore is 135.1 percent of its residents. That is 46 percent higher than the United States. So, Feingold is roughly on target with the percentage difference. But there are some important notes about the comparison. At two square kilometers, Monaco is the second-smallest independent state in the world. It has a population of 30,500; the country is almost entirely urban and it has the eighth highest GDP per capita in the world. Singapore is a quarter of the size of Rhode Island with about 5.6 million people living there, again, mostly in urban areas; and it has the seventh highest GDP per capita in the world. A country's connectedness is not as closely correlated with overall population as it is with urban population, Gray said. That is, it's easier to wire in 10,000 people living in a one square-mile than it is to wire in 10,000 who live in 100 square miles. Some countries, such as Switzerland and France, are less urbanized, but have better access to fixed broadband than the United States. The vast majority of countries ahead of the United States on the list are much smaller geographically. The only exception is Canada. "The U.S. probably does better than expected on average, once its large -- relative to other countries -- rural hinterland is taken into account," said Phillippa Biggs, a senior policy analyst for the International Telecommunication Union, in an email. Our rating Feingold said "The United States still ranks 20th in the world in access to broadband -- over 50 percent below the best nations." The ranking he uses is a year outdated, but the new numbers paint a somewhat worse ranking (24th instead of 20th). Though fixed broadband is preferred by some as a measure, since it can mean more for the economy, Feingold oversimplifies the issue by excluding mobile broadband access. By that measure, the United States fares considerably better, with 92.8 percent of the population subscribing. Though he is literally correct in saying the United States is "over 50 percent below the best nations" in fixed broadband access, the countries that sit atop that list are not comparable to the United States.

pomt-12119	White nationalist protesters in Charlottesville "had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-charlottesville-counter-protest/	During the contentious Trump Tower question-and-answer session about protests in Charlottesville, Va., President Donald Trump said that the Unite the Right marchers had a permit to demonstrate, but that counter-protesters did not. Here’s a portion of Trump’s extensive comments about Charlottesville during the session with reporters: "There were people in that rally. I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest. "Because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit. So I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country." Here, we’ll take a look at whether white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville "had a permit" and that the counter-protesters "didn’t have a permit." The counter-protesters’ Saturday permit The Washington Post Fact Checker published a document in an earlier fact-check showing that counter-protesters had indeed acquired an official permit for Saturday, when the Unite the Right march was scheduled. The permit was issued to Walt Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education. The "special events certificate of approval" for a public demonstration at two parks in Charlottesville, McGuffey Park and Justice Park. Those are located within one and two blocks, respectively, of Emancipation Park, the location of a Robert E. Lee statue and the destination for the Unite the Right march. The certificate covers Saturday, Aug. 12, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Click on the markers in this map to see key sites in the clashes on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. You can zoom in and out. Here’s an image of the certificate, which has been authenticated to PolitiFact by both Heinecke and Miriam Dickler, a spokeswoman for the city of Charlottesville. In an interview, Heinecke told PolitiFact that he had secured the permit as a citizen, not in his capacity as a University of Virginia professor. Before requesting the permit, he said he consulted with representatives of several local organizations. The counter-protest was called the Peoples Action for Racial Justice and was co-sponsored by two groups, Together Cville and Charlottesville Center for Peace and Justice. According to the Facebook post advertising the march, it was to be "a peaceful protest against all forms of white supremacy, racial intolerance, and discrimination." Heinecke said he sought the permit after seeing what had happened during a July 8, 2017, rally in Charlottesville by Ku Klux Klan members. After KKK members were removed from the rally, Heinecke said, counter-protesters who were also in the area found themselves vulnerable to arrest and potential targets for tear gas. Given this experience, he said, the initial purpose for the Aug. 12 permits in McGuffey and Justice parks "was to assure that there would be two spaces for lawful assembly" by counter-protesters. "What we did was provide food and water, and medics were stationed there. We allowed for that space to be used for peaceful and nonviolent demonstrations, and for protesters at Emancipation Park to have respite from a lawless melee," he said. In addition, Dickler of the city of Charlottesville said that counter-protesters would have been permitted even outside of the two park locations specified in the permit. "A permit does not bar other individuals from entry to a public park (such as Emancipation Park), nor does it restrict who can be on streets or sidewalks outside of and/or adjacent to the park." For the record, the city of Charlottesville had sought to have the Unite the Right march hold their demonstration in McIntire Park, which is away from downtown. But a court ruled that the march be held at Emancipation Park instead. So the Unite the Right march effectively had judicial permission to hold it there, rather than a city permit. The existence of the city permit issued to Heinecke flatly debunks Trump’s assertion that the counter-protesters lacked a permit -- assuming you understand Trump to mean that counter-protesters had no permit for Saturday’s march. And that’s where the White House told us they differ. The Friday night march at the University of Virginia The White House told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about a related, but separate, Friday night protest on the campus of the University of Virginia. On the night before the Saturday march, about 250 white nationalists carrying torches marched on campus and confronted 20 to 30 students who had locked arms around the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson, according to the Washington Post. Clashes occurred there, leaving some injured. The White House pointed to the president’s statement from Trump Tower that "I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. ... You had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit." (Emphasis by the White House.) However, there are a few problems with this explanation. First, no permit was required for any protest on the University of Virginia campus, either from the university (which has jurisdiction on the campus) or the city (which does not). "The University does not require permits to use public spaces," said University of Virginia spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn. "Existing university policy speaks only to the ability to access university-owned facilities such as academic buildings and performance venues." He added that "the University of Virginia is a public institution, and as such must abide by state and federal law regarding the general public’s right to access outdoor spaces. This includes open spaces such as … our historic Lawn." So if Trump meant to refer to the Friday night protest, then he’s wrong here, too. Neither side had permits because there were none to give. Second, it’s worth noting another problem: Documentary footage by Vice shows clearly that marchers shouted "blood and soil" -- a slogan from Nazi Germany -- and "Jews will not replace us." That’s not a case of "people protesting very quietly," as Trump said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said that white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville "had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit." In reality, both the Unite the Right marchers and the counter-protesters had official permission to assemble on Saturday, either from a court or from the city. If Trump meant to refer to the Friday night march, then neither side would have needed a permit to assemble. And if he did mean Friday night’s march, then he is seriously distorting the torch-light march by saying participants were "protesting very quietly." We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-03403	Michelle Nunn has praised the Occupy movement.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-group-takes-potential-candidate/	Republicans are wasting no time defining a Georgia Democrat considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2014. Michelle Nunn has never run for political office, so the National Republican Senatorial Committee is eager to tell Georgians all about her. Case in point, a June 17 news release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "Nunn's extreme record of praising radical liberal groups like the Occupy Movement illustrates just how dangerously out of touch she is with voters in Georgia," NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen wrote. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC is correct that Nunn praised the Occupy movement. The movement began in September 2011 when protesters camped out for months in a park near New York City’s Wall Street to voice their grievances against what they describe as "the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process." In Atlanta, Mayor Kasim Reed had police remove Occupy sympathizers from a city park after a three-week stay. The Occupy movement is now less demonstrative, with more strategic protests against banks and other businesses for various practices. So what does Hougesen have to prove she’s right about Nunn? She pointed to an op-ed that Nunn wrote in The Washington Post a few days before Christmas 2011 titled "Millennials to business: Social responsibility isn’t optional." It contained a few references to the Occupy movement. Here’s what we know about Nunn. She is the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat who is respected by many conservatives on national security issues. She is the chief executive officer of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the foundation brought in $55 million in revenue in 2011 and mobilized 4 million volunteers worldwide for a range of causes last year. Neil Bush, son of the former president, is the board chairman. Being in charge of a nonpartisan volunteer organization requires skill in working with people of all political positions. As an elected official once told us "I have friends on both sides of the issue and I always support my friends." One recent Nunn blog post on the Points of Light website had a picture of Republican strategist Karl Rove and Democratic Party organizer Donna Brazile dancing together at a conference. So what did Nunn write about it in her op-ed? "The Occupy Wall Street movement is largely fueled by a relatively small set of young people who view the protests as a fight for their future," her op-ed began. "The vast majority, however, are getting up and going to work every day — or wishing they could. These individuals are part of a less dramatic but, perhaps, equally powerful movement of Millennials shaping the future of business. As consumers, employees and entrepreneurs, Millennials are shifting the norms of corporate America’s conduct, ethical imperatives and purpose." Most of the article was about millennials, people typically born between 1980 and 2000. Nunn’s only other reference to the Occupy movement was at the end of her op-ed. "The values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies that are failing to take notice should start," she wrote. "These people-powered movements may not have stopped the markets in their tracks, but they are creating the demand for new forms of corporate behavior and ethical imperatives. The winning brands of the future will be ones that authentically respond." Hougesen said she was convinced Nunn was praising Occupy Wall Street upon reading the op-ed. "When Michelle Nunn wrote that the ‘values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies’ and that protestors are ‘fighting for their future,’ it led us – and many progressives - to believe that she supported the movement. If over the past seventeen months Ms. Nunn has changed her view or beliefs, we would welcome her clarification," Hougesen said. Nunn referenced Occupy Wall Street in a January 2012 blog post reflecting on a dinner party discussion at her Atlanta home involving Martin Luther King Day. "We broke bread and talked about the bright spots and challenges in our community in terms of race, class and the unfulfilled dimensions of Dr. King's dream. We talked about how Dr. King's nonviolent and creative dissent continues to animate our world - from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street," she wrote. Nunn did not respond directly to our interview requests. Gordon Giffin, a former aide to her father who has been involved in discussions with the younger Nunn about her political future, contacted us via email. Giffin and a Points of Light spokeswoman said Nunn’s op-ed was aimed at talking about millennials. "Her writings do not endorse the actions of the ‘occupy’ movement but rather point out that there are numerous other examples of how the younger generation is seeking to make a difference that might be ignored by (the) press’’ focus on the ‘occupy’ crowd. Perhaps misrepresentation is the game of the day in DC but we have higher standards in Georgia," said Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada who now is a partner at the influential law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge. This was a tough call for us. To sum up, the NRSC claimed that Nunn praised the Occupy movement. Its argument is based on an op-ed she wrote in 2011. The op-ed referenced Occupy a couple of times, but Nunn supporters say the intent of the article was to talk about young people and their role in the marketplace. The bulk of the op-ed was about millennials. The claim has an element of truth but ignores critical factors that give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14697	Medicaid expansion "could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion a year..."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/11/steven-landes/landes-says-medicaid-expansion-could-cost-virginia/	Del. Steve Landes says Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s long-sought initiative to expand Medicaid in Virginia is financial quicksand. "Do you support or oppose Medicaid expansion in Virginia?" Landes, R-Augusta, asked constituents in a recent survey about issues. "While expansion would enroll up to 400,000 currently uninsured Virginians in Medicaid, it could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion per year, forcing cuts to other key services like education, mental health and public safety." Landes is hardly the first Republican to sound the $1 billion-a-year alarm about the potential cost of expanding Medicaid. Others, including House Speaker Bill Howell, also have tossed around the number during the GOP’s successful three-year effort to block expansion. Democrats say the state has a moral obligation to make Medicaid available to all low-income Virginians who are qualified - particularly because the federal government has agreed to pay for the vast majority of the expansion. Republicans counter that Medicaid already is unwieldy and that Uncle Sam, deeply in debt, can’t be relied upon to pay his promised share. The issue is certain to re-emerge this winter when the General Assembly convenes for a 60-day session starting Jan. 13. So it’s a good time to look into the accuracy of the $1 billion-a-year claim. Let’s start with some background. The costs Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, states have the choice of extending their Medicaid programs to people who earn 138 percent of the U.S. poverty level. The federal government pays all of the expansion costs through this federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and gradually will drop its future share to a standing 90 percent after 2019. To date, 31 states have decided to expand Medicaid. Virginia’s Medicaid program is run by the state Department of Medical Assistance Services which, in September, issued annual cost estimates for Medicaid expansion through 2022. They show the expansion would cost a total of $800 million in fiscal 2017, with the state shouldering $32 million of that amount. In 2022, the cost would be $3.1 billion, with the state responsible for $325 million. But these gross figures don’t take into account savings that DMAS says the state would realize by expanding Medicaid. For example, Virginia now covers all the costs of hospitalizing a state prisoner; under Medicaid expansion, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the bills. Virginia pays most of the costs for uninsured low-income residents who receive behavioral health treatment from community service boards; under Medicaid expansion, the federal government again would pay 90 percent of those bills. DMAS concluded that the savings would outweigh the costs of Medicaid expansion through 2020, when Virginia would see a $34 million net gain from joining the program. After that, there would be some - but not much - red ink. DMAS estimated that the bottom-line cost to expand would be $3 million in 2022. Landes’ figure So how does Landes reach his estimate of a potential $1 billion-a-year cost to Virginia taxpayers? His calculation rests on the premise that the federal government, already over-committed, will renege on its legal promise to never pay less than 90 percent of expansion costs. "If the federal government cut the expansion match rate back to 50/50, it would cost Virginia over $1 billion per year in the out years," Landes wrote to us in an email. He pointed out that the bottom-line price of expansion - combining Washington’s share with the state’s net cost - is estimated to exceed $2 billion a year starting in 2018. If the federal government tosses half of the expense back to Virginia that year or later, the state would be shackled with annual bills of at least $1 billion. Craig Markva, a spokesman for DMAS, told us the state has every reason to believe that won’t happen. For one thing, legislation would be required to cut the federal contribution. Edwin Park, the vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, told us there’s no movement afoot in Congress to take such an action. In 2012, the Obama administration proposed a budget-cutting measure that would have changed the formula for how much it pays for Medicaid patients, boosting the federal match for current enrollees and lowering the match for people who became newly insured under the law. But after the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that expansion was an option, not a mandate, the White House dropped that proposal, because it wanted to assure states the match would stay at 90 percent, Park said. It also should be noted that the Obama administration notified states in December 2012 that if they enrolled in expansion, they could drop out of the program at any time. That assurance was repeated in a March 20, 2014 letter that Cindy Mann, then the White House’s top Medicaid official, wrote to Bill Hazel, Virginia’s secretary of health. McAuliffe, a Democrat who has been pushing to broaden Medicaid, has proposed a state law that would require Virginia’s withdrawal if Washington reduced support for expansion. Republicans have been skeptical the state could extricate itself from the expansion once it began. Our ruling Landes, in a constituent survey, said Medicaid expansion "could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion per year." That contradicts the latest estimates on expansion. Virginia’s gross cost in 2022 - the furthest out the projections go - would be $324 million. The net cost, after taking into account a variety of savings the expansion offers, would be $3.1 million. That’s light years away from Landes’ figure. Landes’ estimate rests on the eye-popping supposition that the federal government could decide in the future to cut nearly half of its commitment to pay 90 percent of the costs for expansion, leaving states holding the bag. But this is pure speculation of his part. There’s no effort in Congress now to cut the federal share at all, let alone by the proportion Landes suggests. There’s a burden on Landes to prove his statement with facts, and he comes up short. We rate his claim False.	None	Steven Landes	None	None	None	2016-01-11T11:45:00	2015-12-24	['None']

pomt-11635	In a government shutdown, "what they are really doing is shutting down our military."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/17/donald-trump/would-military-shut-down-if-federal-government-doe/	As a possible government shutdown loomed, President Donald Trump preemptively blamed Democrats for any negative fallout. Trump charged that Democratic intransigence about how to renew Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was preventing an agreement on federal spending that would keep the government open — including the country’s defense forces. "Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards," Trump tweeted on Jan. 12, 2018. "The Dems will threaten ‘shutdown,’ but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We won’t wade into the question of who would be to blame for the shutdown. However, we wondered whether Trump was correct that a government shutdown is tantamount to "shutting down our military." When we checked with the White House, they said that Trump was not using the term literally, to suggest that the entire military will cease to operate. In other tweets, Trump used less sweeping language. In one, for instance, he warned against moves that would "stop paying our troops and government workers." Still, the less cautiously worded tweet attracted nearly 23,000 retweets and almost 91,000 likes, so we thought it was worth a closer look. What is a shutdown? Federal government shutdowns occur when spending bills expire, and Congress and the president find themselves at an impasse. A law known as the Antideficiency Act requires suspending a federal agency’s operations until an appropriation bill is enacted. But there is some leeway to continue certain federal activities deemed essential. A two-week shutdown occurred most recently in 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Democrats controlled the Senate, and Republicans controlled the House. Prior to that, there were two shutdowns in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. One was for five days in November 1995, and the other was for 21 days, from December 1995 to January 1996. Who works and who doesn’t During the 2013 shutdown, as many as 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce (not counting active-duty military personnel and U.S. Postal Service workers). The longstanding guidance is that "employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property" remain on their jobs during a shutdown. The determination of who works and who doesn’t has traditionally been made by senior executives and legal advisors at each agency. This means that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could theoretically order which federal workers must continue to show up for work, said Stan Collender, a budget specialist at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP. During a shutdown, national parks typically shut their doors, government-funded scientific research is halted, and various health and safety inspections — by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration — are put on hold. (Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown.) But workers responsible for human safety and security will typically remain on the job, and that includes many members of the military. How the military is affected Active-duty military personnel have always been required to work through shutdowns. Army troops don’t abandon their posts and naval ships don’t all return to port. In addition, many civilian workers in the Defense Department have been required to work through shutdowns. Other civilian workers in the Defense Department, however, hold jobs that do not meet the urgency threshold to keep working. In 2013, the government furloughed about half of its civilian workers, or about 400,000 employees, leaving a patchwork of various permissible and impermissible activities, according to Federal News Radio. "We can and will continue to support key military operations," former Defense Department comptroller Bob Hale told Federal News Radio in 2013. "We’re allowed to do that by law, but the law would force us to disrupt many of our support activities. We wouldn’t be able to do most training, we couldn’t enter into most new contracts, routine maintenance would have to stop, and we couldn’t continue efforts to improve contracting and financial management including our audit improvement efforts." The Defense Department, like other parts of the government, will experience some consequences from a shutdown. But experts we interviewed agreed that Trump’s language in this tweet amounted to an exaggeration, especially because the Defense Department is hurt less by a shutdown than most agencies. "All critical military functions will continue," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "There would be some wrinkles, but nothing like other areas of government." Todd Harrison, a defense budget specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the "biggest impact is probably on defense contractors, who will have to stop working." But "troops that are in harm’s way overseas will continue operating as normal and won’t be at any increased risk," he said. Paychecks could be delayed One way that even active-duty troops could feel the shutdown is in their wallets. Employees who are required to work are not paid until a new spending bill is passed— effectively working for free, at least temporarily. Workers who are furloughed have historically been compensated for back pay through subsequent congressional action, though there is no requirement that such a bill be passed. In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that $2.5 billion in pay and benefits was paid for hours not worked government-wide, said Tyler Evilsizer, research manager for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Usually, paychecks have been sent after a shutdown is over, but for the Defense Department in 2013, Congress and the president agreed to a bill in the middle of the shutdown that paid all active-duty and many civilian Defense Department employees. This enabled Defense Department employees to return to work while the shutdown was still going on for workers in other departments. Delayed paychecks are just one downside of government shutdowns. "A shutdown is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, disruptive of government operations, and simply bad management," said John Palguta, a former federal human-resources official who is now an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. "A shutdown, however, will not put the U.S. in harm’s way by shutting down our military." Even just planning contingencies for a possible shutdown divert time and effort from the government’s duties, said Mallory Barg Bulman, vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service. Our ruling Trump said that in a government shutdown, "what they are really doing is shutting down our military." This is an exaggeration. Based on historical precedent, the Defense Department does stand to see a substantial fraction of its civilian workers furloughed, and employee morale would likely suffer if paychecks are held back. But experts agreed that core military functions would remain operational, including all active-duty military personnel and many essential civilian workers. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01558	In Texas public schools, "we spend an average of $12,000 per pupil per year."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/sep/12/matt-mackowiak/matt-mackowiak-overshoots-texas-spending-public-ed/	Calling how Texas funds its schools a "supercharged" topic for the 2015 Legislature, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak questioned a Democratic state district judge’s decision finding the state’s finance method unconstitutional. In a Sept. 8, 2014, opinion column in the Austin American-Statesman, Mackowiak asked how much is enough to spend on education. He continued: "The Dallas Morning News reports that ‘Texas spends nearly $60 billion a year on its schools, which includes billions in federal funding and local property tax revenue.’ Texas has five million students in public schools. So," Mackowiak wrote, "we spend an average of $12,000 per pupil per year. That is more than some four-year colleges. Is that not sufficient?" A reader asked us to check his per-pupil figure. By email, Mackowiak confirmed he took the total spending mentioned in the Morning News and divided that by 5 million to get his per-student estimate. Curiously, the News story included a chart presenting a per-student Texas spending figure, attributed to the Legislative Budget Board, of $5,809 statewide for 2013-14. By email, a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, said the figure represents what the state in 2013 expected school districts to spend in state and local revenue on general operations in the fiscal year through September 2014. A May 2013 chart posted online by the budget board lists predicted per-student expenditures for each district; the Austin district, for instance, was expected to spend $6,220 per student. Then again, DeSilva said the figure, incorporating school funding decisions by the 2013 Legislature, did not add in other funding such as federal aid or state grants not part of the state Foundation School Program, the main way state aid flows to schools. There are various ways to estimate spending per student. A teacher lobby group, the National Education Association, annually estimates combined state and local school spending. In its latest report, released in March 2014, the association said Texas schools spent an average of $8,275 per student enrolled in the fall of the 2012-13 school year. That was the fifth-lowest amount among the states; Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah and Arizona spent less while nationally the average was $10,938 per student, the group said. According to another chart in the report, Texas was expected to spend at least $8,399 per student in 2013-14. By email, an association analyst, Robert Glenn, said the presented figures took into account state, federal and local spending on general operations, but excluded capital outlays for buildings and equipment and interest on school debt. The excluded items, Glenn said, are "programs that are not part of the regular public elementary and secondary school program." Separately, we asked the Texas Education Agency about per-student spending. By email, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency chart indicating that in 2012-13, the latest available year of actual expenditure data, Texas schools spent $10,549 per student from state, local and federal sources. That year, 5,057,960 students attended the public schools. For another perspective, we turned to a former TEA analyst, Lynn Moak, a partner in an Austin firm that advises school districts. By email, Moak suggested wrinkles in most of the per-student spending figures posted by the TEA. While the state reported $61.2 billion in total disbursements for public schools in 2012-13, or $12,106 per pupil, Moak said, about $7.3 billion of that didn’t reflect in-school spending. The rolled-in dollars, he said, included funds transferred among districts for equity purposes; money used to refinance bonds and lower interest costs; and charges for districts buying services from other districts. Another spending figure on the agency web page, $53.4 billion, or $10,549 per pupil, Moak said, would be a more accurate base for education spending -- though that too has weaknesses, he said, in that nearly $11 billion of the total went to debt service or capital outlays as in funds that could only be spent for building or equipping facilities or for interest and principal payments on school facilities, again not direct in-school spending. "A portion of this amount is also double-counted over time because principal repayments represent the same funds used for capital outlay," Moak wrote. Subtract the capital and debt expenditures, Moak said, and operating expenditures are reflected in another total on the web page, $42.6 billion, or $8,419 per pupil. Finally, Moak said, federal aid to the schools is usually restricted to certain programs. If most such categorical aid is left out, he said, education spending drops to $36 billion, a result based on combining $30 million in payroll costs and $6 million in other operating costs, for $7,127 per student. We also asked the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which says it’s "dedicated to being the trusted resource for school finance and operations in Texas," to consider this topic. By email, the group’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, similarly said she wouldn’t generally count debt service and capital costs into average spending comparisons partly because, she said, such decisions reflect voter approval of bonds in individual districts. Ginsburg said she would focus on the $8,327 per pupil figure shown by the TEA for average total operating expenditures, which takes into account the salary and benefits of school employees and the purchase of supplies, materials and utility costs. Our ruling Mackowiak said Texas spends $12,000 per student on its public schools. Mackowiak had a way to reach his figure, but he overshot. Authoritative calculations suggest spending has been running closer to $7,100 to $8,500 per student or so. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13922	Says Hillary Clinton "has even deleted this record of total support (for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) from her book."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-flubs-claim-hillary-clinton-deleted-h/	Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of trying to delete part of her personal history during a June 22, 2016, speech that focused in part on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Clinton tried to promote the deal as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but she withdrew her support for the 12-nation pact in October 2015 amid sharp criticism from Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders. In his speech, Donald Trump took credit for getting her to change her mind and accused her of trying to cover up her support. "Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas — and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission," Trump said. "Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. "She has even deleted this record of total support from her book," he said, adding, "deletion is something she is very good at," a reference to the tens of thousands of emails she deleted on her home internet server. Did Hillary Clinton actually censor her own book to hide her past support for the trade agreement that has since come under fire? We contacted the Trump campaign asking for its facts to back up the claim. They didn't respond to our query. For starters, there is no evidence that any of Trump's comments have influenced Clinton's thoughts on the treaty. As for the treaty itself, Clinton offered support for it in 2012, long before the deal was finalized. She hailed the deal as "setting the gold standard" during a 2012 speech in Australia, to name just one example. She now says she was, at the time, trying to sell the deal to U.S. allies as a member of the Obama administration. The deal was reached in October 2015, well after Clinton departed as secretary of state, and signed the following the February. During her debates with Sanders, Clinton said she had waited until the deal was actually negotiated before ultimately deciding to oppose it. Because of her early supportive comments, we rated her statement Half True. So what, if anything, did she say about the deal in her book Hard Choices? The book was published in June 2014, with a deal still more than a year away. On pages 77 and 78 of hardcover edition, she said the deal "would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property." Clinton also refers to it as "important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia." "Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement," she wrote, echoing the stance she would take when Sanders criticized her support for the deal. "It’s safe to say that the TPP won’t be perfect—no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be—but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers." So how much of this did Clinton delete from the paperback edition, which the publisher says was trimmed to accommodate the smaller size? Nothing. The pages are now renumbered as 69 and 70, but the content is the same. We found one reference to the TPP that was cut. Here it is from page 254, in a chapter dealing with Latin American issues: So we worked hard to improve and ratify trade agreements with Colombia and Panama and encouraged Canada and the group of countries that became known as the Pacific Alliance -- Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile -- all open-market democracies driving toward a more prosperous future to join negotiations with Asian nations on TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. The Alliance stood in stark contrast to Venezuela, with its more authoritarian policies and state-controlled economy. That's a description of trying to get other countries involved, not a ringing endorsement. Finally, Clinton came out in opposition to the deal after it was finalized in October 2015. By then, the paperback had been out for six months. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton "has even deleted this record of total support (for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) from her book." The paperback removed a small reference to the TPP but the two pages that talked about it and why the agreement was important weren't deleted.

pomt-06737	Says direct shipment of wine "makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/29/joseph-cryan/assemblyman-joseph-cryan-says-direct-shipment-wine/	You can do a lot of things with the click of a mouse. End a relationship. Destroy a career. Forward funny pet videos to your friends. Add get alcohol when you’re underage to the list of possibilities if a bill allowing wineries to ship directly to New Jersey consumers becomes law, said Assemblyman Joseph Cryan (D-Union). Cryan wrote an op-ed criticizing legislation in the state Senate that would allow direct shipment of wine. Cryan has sponsored a bill that would amend the state’s licensing laws for wineries but does not allow direct shipping. And the debate over shipping wine is certain to raise at least one concern: underage drinking. "Direct shipment provides a virtual store for teens to buy alcohol they would otherwise be prohibited from buying at liquor stores. It makes the face-to-face purchase transaction practically irrelevant; and makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click," Cryan wrote in an op-ed posted on CourierPostOnline.com on Aug. 21. Can the under-21 crowd get drunk with the click of a mouse? PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s not that easy. Cryan’s deputy chief of staff, Dave Jenkins, sent PolitiFact New Jersey a 2005 report from an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the claim. The report said "the Internet acts as a general store" where teenagers can "get hold of almost anything," including beer, wine and liquor, but also marijuana, prescription drugs and "crack dealer locator services." Though the report raises concerns about what teenagers can access online, it does not address underage consumers ordering wine through a licensed winery. A 2003 study by the Federal Trade Commission and a 2010 report from the Comptroller of Maryland -- that noted the difficulty of proving a cause and effect relationship in this case -- found little to no evidence of an increase in underage drinking due to direct shipment of wine. The Maryland report said, "The reasons for this may be that: (1) "wine" is not the drink of choice for youth; and (2) direct shipment of wine is costly and time-consuming." Jenkins called the Maryland report "useless" because its conclusion "only recognizes the need for a better method of evaluation." Other studies show, and experts said, that underage consumers looking for alcohol probably aren’t going to buy wine. An April report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and a 2006 report by Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse both concluded that wine is not the first choice for underage drinkers. Marilyn Aguirre-Molina, professor of clinical population and family health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said, "teens are going online for everything imaginable, but something like alcohol -- which requires a credit card, an address to mail it too, as well as patience until it arrives -- online purchase of wine is a drag and hassle, especially if it’s the least preferred of alcoholic beverages." Even if someone younger than 21 wanted to order a bottle of wine and successfully placed that order online, Cryan’s claim starts to unravel when the product is packaged. FedEx and UPS require packages containing wine to be labeled, saying they contain alcoholic beverages. Also, both companies require the signature of an adult 21 or older upon delivery. The U.S. Postal Service does not ship wine. Cryan’s deputy chief of staff said it’s lawmakers’ responsibility to ensure underage individuals do not get access to alcohol. "We cannot depend upon the policies of FedEx, or others to properly deny those underage from delivery. We must be proactive, not reactive. What if FedEx changes their policy tomorrow?" he wrote in an email. Joanne Tetlow, a division staff attorney with the Comptroller of Maryland's field enforcement division who compiled the agency’s report on direct wine shipment, said since "we don’t license consumers like we do retailers" states that allow direct shipment of wine are relying on the shipping companies. And there is a chance those measures will fail. "Do we believe it represents a threat? Absolutely," said Michael Scippa, public affairs director for Alcohol Justice, a California-based industry watchdog. He said age verification online and by delivery companies are "two areas where it seems easy to or possible to bypass the law." The ruling Cryan claimed that allowing wineries to ship their product directly to consumers makes "underage drinking as simple as a mouse click." But even if an underage individual can order a bottle of wine online, the two major shipping companies in the U.S. require an adult signature in order to deliver the package. Cryan’s claim exaggerates a legitimate concern, but we can’t ignore the hint of truth in the statement -- that shipping wine directly to homes provides another opportunity for underage access. We rate his statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Cryan	None	None	None	2011-08-29T05:15:00	2011-08-21	['None']

pomt-11150	GOP candidate for California governor Travis Allen "on the floor vote … refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/may/29/john-cox/did-travis-allen-oppose-driver-licenses-undocument/	Republican gubernatorial candidates John Cox and Travis Allen are competing for the conservative vote in California’s June primary. As part of that competition, they’re trying to prove who has the toughest credentials on immigration. Or, in the case of a recent TV attack ad by the Cox campaign, disprove their opponents’ record on the issue. Last week, we rated Mostly True Cox’s claim from the same ad that Allen, an Orange County assemblyman, donated to three of California’s top Democrats. We noted the donations took place when Allen was running his financial business full-time and before he ran for office. In this fact-check, we’ll examine the ad’s separate allegation that "on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens." The ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018. Did Allen, who has positioned himself as a staunch opponent of benefits for undocumented Californians, really miss this key vote? Background on Republican rivals Recent polls show increasing support for Cox, a wealthy San Diego businessman, who President Trump endorsed earlier this month. A survey released May 23 by the Public Policy Institute of California shows Gavin Newsom, the state’s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Missed vote? The claim in the Cox ad refers to votes on AB 60, which the California Legislature approved and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed in 2013. Advocates for the law successfully argued it will make California’s roads safer by ensuring that many of the unauthorized immigrants who already drive have been properly trained and tested. Critics argue AB 60 condones law-breaking, and some claim the licenses could be used to commit fraud and that it could increase security risks. As of April 2018, the state had issued more than one million licenses under the law, which requires the new cards to display the words "Federal Limits Apply" in the top right corner. The license is for driving privileges only and not for federal use, such as boarding a plane. Nor does it allow undocumented Californians to vote, despite inflammatory claims to the contrary. Legislative records show Allen and other Assembly Republicans voted against the measure during a floor vote on May 29, 2013. But that wasn’t Allen’s final chance to weigh in on the bill. During a final concurrence vote on September 12, 2013, records show no vote was recorded for Allen. The lawmaker was present at the Capitol that day, and voted on bills before and after the final decision on AB 60, according to records kept by the Assembly Journal. Allen’s vote would not have made the difference, as the bill passed 55 to 21. Asked about this, Allen’s campaign spokeswoman pointed to the lawmaker’s May vote. She said he "missed" the final vote but did not elaborate on why he missed it. Our ruling John Cox’s campaign for governor claimed in a recent TV ad that Travis Allen "on the floor vote … refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens." Legislative records show Allen voted against a bill that allowed undocumented Californians to apply for a state drivers license during a floor vote in the state Assembly in May 2013. They also show he missed a final vote against the same measure in September 2013, even though he was present at the Capitol that day. There’s some truth to Cox’s claim. But it leaves out the key context about Allen’s earlier opposition, a detail that’s too important to omit. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-09337	"President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/11/jon-kyl/obama-criticized-supreme-court-filibuster-alito-ev/	U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement last week, and while President Obama has not yet announced his nominee, U.S. senators are already discussing prospects of a filibuster. Democrats in the Senate hold 59 votes, one short of the 60 needed to bring nominees or legislation to an up or down vote. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he thought a filibuster was unlikely, but he wasn't taking it entirely off the table as an option. Kyl appeared on ABC News' This Week, alongside Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. "President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court," Kyl said. "So if the president isn't going to take it off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues to support his position or her position." We wanted to examine whether Kyl was correct about Obama's position on then-Judge Samuel Alito back in 2006, when Obama was a senator and Alito was President George W. Bush's nominee. We found that Obama did join a broader Democratic effort to filibuster Alito. Democrats said Alito opposed abortion and was too deferential to executive power. But in what's become Obama's trademark on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand style, he joined the filibuster while at the same time saying he thought it was a bad idea. Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 29, 2006: Stephanopoulos: "Two of your colleagues, Senator (Edward) Kennedy and Senator (John) Kerry, want to try to mount a filibuster tomorrow. Will you join them?" Obama: "Well, I will be supporting the filibuster because I think Judge Alito, in fact, is somebody who is contrary to core American values, not just liberal values, you know. When you look at his decisions in particular during times of war, we need a court that is independent and is going to provide some check on the executive branch, and he has not shown himself willing to do that repeatedly. I will say this, though, I think that the Democrats have to do a much better job in making their case on these issues. These last-minute efforts using procedural maneuvers inside the Beltway, I think, has been the wrong way of going about it, and we need to recognize, because Judge Alito will be confirmed, that if we're going to oppose a nominee that we've got to persuade the American people that, in fact, their values are at stake and frankly I'm not sure that we've successfully done that." Stephanopoulos: "Well, it sounds to me like you're not really happy about going forward and joining this filibuster. And I've actually seen some reports that inside the Democratic caucus you were arguing against this strategy. Is that true?" Obama: "Well, you know, I don't talk about what I, you know, what takes place in caucus but what I will say is that there is an over-reliance on the part of Democrats for procedural maneuvers and mechanisms to block the president instead of proactively going out to the American people and talking about the values that we care about. And, you know, there's one way to guarantee that the judges who are appointed to the Supreme Court are judges that reflect our values and that's to win elections." Later that day, a report from the Associated Press carried the headline, "Sen. Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic." The next day, Democrats failed in their attempt to filibuster on a vote of 72 to 25, with Obama joining 24 other Democrats on the losing end. Obama may have criticized the filibuster even as he joined it, but at the end of the day, he still joined it. Kyl said, "President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court." We rate Kyl's statement True.

pomt-04799	"A small business in my district" needed "31 different permits and fees just to be able to expand."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/21/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-business-florida-needs-31-permits/	It’s one of U.S. Rep. Connie Mack’s favorite stories for the campaign trail. Owners of a Cape Coral-based boat building company want to expand and hire new people. But a long list of government-imposed permits and fees threaten to capsize their plans. "There’s a small business in my district. They wanted to expand their business," Mack said during a recent visit to Sayler’s Suncoast Water in Pinellas Park. "It took 31 different permits and fees just to be able to expand their business. This is a government that is out of control." Republicans frequently rail against burdensome regulations that stifle job growth. And Mack’s story of job-killing regulations anchors his platform as he strives to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, who’s seeking his third term. Mack’s story surfaces so frequently, we fact-checkers couldn’t help but dive in. Here, we’re checking if it takes 31 different permits to expand a business. We launched our research with Bob Long, owner of the business Mack was referring to, Marine Concepts, which manufactures fiberglass and boats. This check won’t include the details of Long’s expansion, since plans are still tentative and under wraps. We’ll just say he’s shopping for property to open a new location, and that’s enough information to estimate how many permits he’ll need. In an impromptu phone interview, Long shot off his list of legal obligations. They check out. "You’ve got to have occupancy permits, site permits, parking permits, waste disposal permits, wide load permits, fire permits, the ocean regulations and what they require, landscaping permits, immigration checks and reports, air permits from the Department of Environmental Protection," he said, later emailing a list 32 notches long. He added another list of 26 tax and insurance requirements, which could also be considered fees. "I’d rather be able to hire more people and have more space. I’ve got to have people full time working these permits and fees and so on. It costs money," he said. Many permits and fees, such as those that protect the environment, are worthwhile, he said. But, in many cases, he said, complying with regulations requires more work and money than necessary. "The landscaping permits tell me what kind of trees I can put in and how big and where," he said. "Some of these things are a bit much." Marine Concepts is required to get more permits than most businesses because the company manufactures fiberglass, uses chemicals and pollutes, said Susan Noe, business assistance director at Fort Myers Regional Partnership and the Lee County Office of Economic Development,who checked Long’s list and verified the permits. Her office pointed to at least nine Marine Concepts permits that are industry-specific, from wide-load permits and boat tag licenses to air emission reports. "They have to make sure they have the necessary protections in place to protect the environment, the health and safety of employees, in addition to the surrounding businesses," she said. "Do they have to file for these things? Yes....it’s because of the type of business they’re in." Mack’s stump speeches (at least the ones we’ve seen) describe a mindset, and don’t outright claim he will initiate regulation reform. That’s the tricky part, said John Hudak, a fellow with the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington. For one, many permits and fees are imposed by state and local governments. Sometimes federal lawmakers can use their status to pressure state politicians and get things done. But, in Florida, which is ruled by a Republican super majority, lawmakers have already stripped away most regulations they can, Hudak said. If elected, Mack’s ideas could garner traction under a Mitt Romney administration. But Mack would be a junior senator and U.S. Senate newcomers are not likely to be appointed as chairs to the powerful committees that oversee federal regulations, Hudak said. Our ruling Mack was on target in describing the number of permits and fees required of Marine Concepts. He might have even underestimated. But Marine Concepts is in a highly regulated industry, so it’s not an example of the typical amount of permits a company would have to get to expand. Many other types of businesses would require less permitting, a business liaison told PolitiFact Florida. We rate Mack’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-11955	"It's time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger who was a white suprematist (sic), spoke at kkk events & supported by democrats. #prolife"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/05/andrew-koenig/margaret-sanger-alleged-white-supremacist/	The debate over confederate and white supremacist statues has ramped up in the past few months with the August attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the proposal to remove a confederate statue and the vandalization of a confederate statue in Springfield, Missouri, which prompted a Missouri state representative to call for hanging its vandal. Missouri State Sen. Andrew Koenig pointed attention away from confederate soldiers and toward a different historical figure: Margaret Sanger. Sanger was a birth control advocate in the early 1900s, set up birth control clinics and is recognized as one of the founders of Planned Parenthood. Koenig tweeted on Aug. 18, 2017, "It’s time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger who was a white suprematist (sic), spoke at kkk events & supported by democrats. #prolife" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We contacted Koenig for clarification on his statement and received response from a Koenig staffer that "the tweet speaks for itself and he (Koenig) stands behind it." So we talked with experts in the fields of history, black studies and those with extensive knowledge on Sanger to verify just how many statues of Sanger there are and if she was in fact a white supremacist who spoke at KKK events. Those statues The most-well known statue of Sanger is in the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution; groups have demanded it be removed from the museum for years. The other documented statues of Sanger are in the Old South meeting house in Boston and the "Knowledge is Power" sculpture at Rowan University. There are also some other modern-day dedications to Sanger in the form of street signs, plaques and building names. KKK events In Koenig’s tweet, he states that Sanger spoke at Ku Klux Klan events. Sanger’s appearance at one KKK event is well documented. Sanger wrote about the event herself in her 1938 autobiography "Margaret Sanger: an Autobiography." In the book, Sanger writes that, "I accepted an invitation to talk to the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing." But to say that Sanger spoke at KKK events, plural, is an exaggeration. The 1928 speech before the women’s group is the only documented case that our sources were aware of. And, according to Ellen Chesler, a Sanger biographer and senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute in New York, Sanger’s appearance at the event was less about race and more about reaching as many people as possible. "It was to try to encourage a broad swath of ideological support for birth control at a time when birth control was immoral (and) illegal," Chesler said. White supremacist? This is where things get a little murky. It’s a bit subjective in this case, but several historians we spoke to said that Sanger was not a white supremacist. Jean Baker, a Sanger biographer, said Sanger was trying to bring birth control to both white and black women. Many of the race-related criticisms linked with Sanger come from her opening a clinic for birth control in Harlem. Her opening the Harlem clinic brought on allegations that she was sterilizing black women, but Baker said Sanger was not for compulsory sterilization. She was also later criticized for her work with the "Negro Project," a controversial program that aimed to provide birth control services to black communities. According to a research organization at New York University specializing in Sanger, the program failed to speak with members of the black community before it was implemented and has been criticized as being racist. That said, the project was supported by black leaders of the time, including W.E.B. Du Bois, with whom Sanger worked closely. And although the project was later criticized, Sanger presented it in a fundraising request letter as an opportunity to help "a group notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a ‘caste’ system that operates as an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things in life." What many argue as the sticking point for Sanger’s white supremacy was her belief in eugenics, which as defined by Merriam-Webster is "a science that deals with the improvement (as by control of human mating) of hereditary qualities of a race or breed." All of the historians we spoke with agreed that Sanger was a eugenicist, but most said that Sanger’s approach was not specific to race. Though eugenic policies have led to tragic outcomes such as the Holocaust, it’s important to remember that eugenics was widely supported by progressive groups during Sanger’s time, experts told us. "Eugenics enjoyed tremendous broad support among secularist people who didn’t want sexuality and reproduction to be shrouded in the myth and mystery that organized religion had always placed them," Chesler said. Our ruling Koenig said Margaret Sanger statues should be removed because Sanger was a white supremacist who "spoke at KKK events." Sanger spoke at one event for the women’s affiliate of the KKK, but it was to educate those women on birth control. And this was the only event she spoke at that any sources or documents pointed to. Sanger has been accused of white supremacy by many because of her belief in eugenics and her implementation of a birth control clinic in Harlem and other black communities. But historians point out this was because she wanted to share her belief in the importance of birth control with both white and black women. Koenig’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06107	"By the way, I'm not raising tolls 50 percent....Jon Corzine did."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-blames-corzine-new-years-toll-hikes/	The news might have hit motorists like a rock smacking against a windshield, but the recent toll increases on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway should not come as a complete surprise. They were approved more than three years ago. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has reminded listeners of that history during various radio interviews in recent weeks. During a Dec. 23 interview with WFAN’s Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton, the governor corrected Carton when the co-host said Christie was raising tolls by 50 percent. "Oh, and by the way, I’m not raising tolls 50 percent," Christie said. Carton asked, "Who is?" "Jon Corzine did," the governor responded. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie has his facts straight. The toll hikes, which took effect New Year’s Day, represent the second phase of a two-part rate increase approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in October 2008 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. A Democrat, Corzine, signed off on the plan. The first phase of the toll hikes began on Dec. 1, 2008 with 40 percent and 43 percent increases on the Turnpike and the Parkway, respectively. The second phase represents a 53 percent hike on the Turnpike and a 50 percent increase on the Parkway. The toll increase was initially scheduled to support a $1.25 billion contribution to a Hudson River commuter train tunnel project, known as Access to the Region's Core, or ARC. But citing potential cost overruns, Christie terminated the project in October 2010. In September, the turnpike authority agreed to redirect $975 million from the canceled tunnel to local road and bridge projects. Those projects are part of a five-year capital plan unveiled by Christie earlier this year. The increased toll revenue also is going toward the authority’s $7 billion capital program, which includes a Turnpike widening project between exits 6 and 9. Our ruling In a radio interview, Christie directed blame for the new toll hikes to his predecessor, claiming "I'm not raising tolls 50 percent....Jon Corzine did." The governor’s planning to spend the money, but he didn’t raise the tolls. With Corzine’s approval, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority approved the two-phase toll increase in October 2008.

pomt-10098	"Barack Obama has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/27/republican-party-florida/felony-cherry-picking/	A recent attack mailer from the Republican Party of Florida calls Obama "Soft On Crime." "Barack Obama has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals — including major offenses — allowing criminals to remain on the streets," the mailer states. This mailer, like so many other mailers and TV ads, cherry-picks a few choice examples and conveniently ignores evidence that contradicts its conclusions. We'll review the four Obama positions highlighted by the mailer to back up its claim, and put Obama's position in a fuller context. We'll also examine Obama's fuller record on each front to show how the ad distorts its claims. A mail ad targeting Barack Obama. • Against tough penalties for drug-related crimes. "Obama is against tougher penalties on crack-cocaine users and would use taxpayers dollars to provide addicts with hypodermic needles." When the federal Sentencing Commission voted in November to lower sentencing guidelines for crack-related crimes, and bring them closer to sentences for powder cocaine, Obama spoke approvingly of the action and said he supported applying the lower jail terms retroactively to current prisoners. Obama echoed concerns among some civil rights leaders and elected officials about disparities between mandatory prison terms for crack cocaine offenses, which affect mostly black prisoners, and terms for powder cocaine, which affect mostly whites. As for the second part of the claim, Obama did tell the Associated Press in February that if elected, he would move to repeal a 20-year-old ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs. And when he was an Illinois senator, Obama also supported a law that would allow the purchase of needles without a prescription. Obama's position was framed as an attempt to help stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic — particularly acute among black Americans — by encouraging drug addicts who might otherwise use contaminated needles to exchange them for clean ones. Obama also expressed concern about disease being spread to the innocent children of drug users. "And what’s more important is the fact that many intravenous drug users are now passing on their afflictions onto a spouse who does not engage in drug use or, more tragically, an infant who, as a consequence of being born to a mother who engages in drug use, might be born with AIDS," Obama said. "And so I think I recognize some of the cultural concerns and the symbolic concerns that people may have, what kind of message does this send. But I also think it’s just important to recognize the enormous costs and potentially fatal consequences that we’re placing on individuals when they are reusing dirty needles over and over again. We may think that’s what they deserve, but I personally, at least, think particularly because the impact often goes beyond the drug user themselves, that this is a modest, measured and effective strategy for dealing with this problem." For the Republican Party of Florida to single out these two positions to conclude that Obama is "against tough penalties for drug related crimes" is grossly misleading. It's not hard to find a few examples of Obama initiatives that show just the opposite. For example, Obama took aim at the methamphetamine epidemic when he co-sponsored the Combat Meth Act of 2005, which sought to provide more money to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine offenses, tighten controls on the sale of meth ingredients, and provide assistance grants to the children of meth abusers. And in 1997, Obama voted to increase penalties for marijuana possession. • Against protecting children from danger. "Obama refused to take a stand and protect our children from guns fired at or near schools." This relates to a 1999 bill in the Illinois Senate that sought to allow adult prosecution for juveniles over the age of 15 charged with aggravated battery with a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. Obama voted "present," a procedural vote that carries the same effect as a no, though the bill passed overwhelmingly. Speaking before the general assembly at the time, Obama said, "there is really no proof or indication that automatic transfers and increased penalties and adult penalties for juvenile offenses have, in fact, proven to be more effective in reducing juvenile crime or cutting back on recidivism." Yes, Obama did not support this bill, but there are many other votes that contradict the mailer's blanket claim that Obama is "against protecting children from danger." In 2001, for example, Obama voted to increase penalties for repeat sex offenders; for those convicted of child abduction and child molestation. In 2005, he co-sponsored legislation to require sex offender data be available on the Web. • Against tougher penalties for street gangs. "Obama voted against making gang members eligible for the death penalty if they kill someone to help their gang." In 2001, Obama was one of nine Illinois senators who voted against a bill that would have allowed the death penalty for a person convicted of first-degree murder "in furtherance of a gang activity." Obama argued the law was too vague about what constituted gang activity and would disproportionately affect black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Again, this bill is not the entirety of Obama’s record with regard to gangs. Someone could just as easily have highligted a few other votes to reach an exactly opposite conclusion. In 2003, Obama voted to prohibit released gang members from associating with their old gang members. In 2004, he voted in favor of a law to make gang recruiting at a school a crime. • Against protecting families from abuse. "Obama is against a cooling-off-period of 48 hours for those who abuse their family." Obama served on the Illinois Senate Judiciary Committee that declined to pass a bill that would have required anyone convicted of domestic battery to serve at least two days in jail. According to a Copley News Service story on April 20, 1999, opponents of the measure feared it would take away too much discretion from judges and tax already overcrowded jails. Specifically, the article says Obama "questioned whether the bill would hurt prosecutors in the long run. Victims are usually reluctant to testify, so prosecutors have to push more for plea bargains. If defendants know they face a minimum two-day sentence, more will choose to fight their cases in court." Not mentioned in the mailer is that in 2001, Obama co-sponsored a bill to increase penalties for domestic batteries committed near domestic violence shelters. Or that in 2002, he co-sponsored a bill to toughen penalties for repeat domestic violence offenders. In each case, the RPOF has taken selective votes or positions to prop up sensational headlines that are belied by a fuller examination of Obama's record. Similarly, the claim that Obama has " consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals" — when weighed against the entirety of Obama's record — is untrue. We rule the ad’s claim False.

pomt-06110	"What is the proper collective noun for a group of baboons? Believe it or not . . . a Congress!"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/02/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-when-baboons-congregate-its-ca/	"We are all familiar with a herd of cows, a flock of chickens, a school of fish and a gaggle of geese," the e-mail begins. "However, less widely known is a pride of lions, a murder of crows (as well as their cousins the rooks and ravens), an exaltation of doves and, presumably because they look so wise, a parliament of owls. "Now consider a group of baboons. They are the loudest, most dangerous, most obnoxious, most viciously aggressive and least intelligent of all primates. And what is the proper collective noun for a group of baboons? Believe it or not ... a Congress! I guess that pretty much explains the things that come out of Washington!" We at PolitiFact have learned from experience to be skeptical of anything we see in the contagion of e-mails we receive. But we wondered, since we're always skeptical of our own skepticism, could this just be a joke, or could this little tidbit be true? First stop: Dictionary.com. None of the definitions for congress referred to baboons, apes, monkeys or primates. A "congress" can be a meeting or session of any group, but the e-mail makes it clear that this is a specific term for a gathering of baboons. Merriam-Webster.com also produced negative results. So did the online version of the Oxford Dictionary and the 2,059-page Random House Unabridged Dictionary from 1973 in our newsroom. Two places where we did find it were sources in which virtually anybody could insert a definition on a whim: Wikipedia and UrbanDictionary.com. (In the Urban Dictionary, someone added the definition on Sept. 3, 2011, in response to the e-mail.) So we turned to Orin Hargraves, a freelance lexicographer and president of the Dictionary Society of North America. The names for collections of animals are called "terms of venery," and Hargraves said the best reference source for them is the 1968 book "An Exaltation of Larks" by James Lipton, host of "Inside the Actors Studio." The first part of the book, which examines real terms, has no reference to baboons. Only in the section that includes whimsical terms that Lipton coined or uncovered is there any reference to the primates. "A rumpus of baboons" is listed right next to "a buffoonery of orangutans." (One of our favorites: "a prickle of porcupines.") Hargraves could find no evidence that congress is the correct term. "Apparently someone just made it up," he said. "It has the ring of truthiness and so people like it. They do behave like the caricature of the baboons, but I think real baboons probably behave a lot better." We also turned to two anthropologists who really know baboons. Shirley Strum is at the University of California, San Diego, and director of the Uaso Ngiro Baboon Project in Nairobi,Kenya. Larissa Swedell is at Queens College of the City University of New York and studies the primates in Ethiopia and South Africa. Both said the correct term for a group of baboons is a "troop." "I have never heard the term congress used for a group of baboons!" Swedell said in an e-mail. "I would prefer to be governed by baboons than the current Congress, however!!! They are more socially committed, abide by the golden rule and are generally nicer people," said Strum, also in an e-mail. Swedell disputed the e-mail’s description of baboons. "Least intelligent? No way. … Among monkeys, baboons are pretty smart," she said, adding that chimpanzees are probably more dangerous. Baboons are "socially sophisticated and incredibly smart" and among primates, "no species is as dangerous as humans," said Strum. "Only baboons who have been spoiled by humans feeding them are dangerous and are never as aggressive as humans." Finally, we searched Google Books for "congress of baboons" and came up with just 10 books with the phrase. In contrast, "troop of baboons" produced 393 hits. Our ruling The e-mail claiming that a group of baboons is known as a congress states the claim as fact and tickles our sense of irony at a time when the U.S. Congress' approval rating is about 16 percent or lower. But the correct term is a "troop." You may be tempted to call the U.S. Congress a group of baboons, yet a group of baboons is not a congress. If someone presents this joke e-mail to you as the truth, tell them they need to step away from the smoke detector because they've got Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-09970	Obama used $20 million in federal money "to emmigrate (sic) Hamas Refugees to the USA."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/08/chain-email/money-humanitarian-aid-not-emmigration-assistance/	Claims in chain e-mails we are asked to check have so often proved to be ridiculously and maliciously false, we wonder who takes these things seriously anymore. In this case, the answer seems to be be ... a U.S. senator. First, the chain e-mail. Our readers have sent us several versions, but they all begin with typical chain e-mail boilerplate (at least the conservative variety), beginning with the suggestion that President Barack Obama is actually a Muslim and that Congress has recently passed something "behind our backs." (To see one version, click here .) Then the meat: "Obama funds $20M in tax payer dollars to emmigrate (sic) Hamas Refugees to the USA. This is the news that didn't make the headlines... "By executive order, President Barack Obama has ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in 'migration assistance' to the Palestinian refugees and 'conflict victims' in Gaza. "The 'Presidential Determination', allows hundreds of thousands of 'Hamas' Palestinians to resettle in the United States and was signed on January 27, 2009 and appeared in the Federal Register on February 4. "Few on Capitol Hill, or in the media, took note that the order provides a free airline ticket, replete with housing and food allowances, to individuals who have given their overwhelming support to the Islamic Resistance (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of Jan, 2006." Most of this appears to be lifted from a Feb. 7, 2009, article written by Dr. Paul L. Williams for The New Media Journal, a conservative Web site. Helpfully, some of the e-mails include a link to "Presidential Determination No. 2009-15 of January 27, 2009," a memo from Obama to the Secretary of State on "Unexpected Urgent Refugee and Migration Needs Related To Gaza." The memo — which is legitimate — states that "it is important to the national interest to furnish assistance under the (Migration and Refugee Assistance) Act in an amount not to exceed $20.3 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for the purpose of meeting unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs, including by contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations and payment of administrative expenses of Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State, related to humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza." We can understand how someone could misinterpret the "migration needs" language in the memo. But a news release from the State Department on Jan. 30 makes it all very clear. It provides a breakdown on the distribution of the funds and shows the money does not got for plane tickets for "Hamas" Palestinians to resettle in the United States: "$13.5 million will go to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), $6 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and $800,000 to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). These organizations are distributing emergency food assistance, providing medical assistance and temporary shelter, creating temporary employment, and restoring access to electricity and potable water to the people of Gaza." And, the release notes, the contribution to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency supplemented $85 million the U.S. contributed in December 2008 (under President George W. Bush). And it says the money was used in the Middle East. "Of that amount, $25 million supported UNRWA emergency operations in West Bank and Gaza," the release notes. "The remaining $60 million supported UNRWA’s services for 4.6 million Palestinian refugees in the region, including Gaza. UNRWA is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza, providing 70 percent of the population with emergency food assistance, essential healthcare, and primary education." At this point, we'd like to tip our cap to our fellow fact-checkers over at Snopes.com, who first knocked down these false e-mail claims with an item posted on Feb. 17, 2009. Two days later, on Feb. 19, 2009, FactCheck.org debunked it as well. We note the dates, because two weeks later, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the Senate minority whip, offered an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, a "prohibition on the use of funds in this bill for resettlement into the United States of Palestinians from Gaza." Explained Kyl: "There has been a suggestion that perhaps that might be permitted, and we simply want to make it clear that will not be permitted with any funds in this bill." Three days later, several senators objected on the floor of the Senate. "Frankly, it is unnecessary and for the United States, a nation of immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. "We don’t resettle anybody from Gaza, nor do we resettle anybody from Gaza who is living in the U.N. refugee camps in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan. The amendment is a solution looking for a problem. If a Palestinian from Gaza gets to a place like Italy, or somewhere in Europe, the amendment would prevent the State Department from even considering that person for resettlement to the United States. We would have to tell them 'Sorry, you can’t come in, because you are from a place that has terrorists.'" Kyl defended the amendment by saying "it was a response to a news story which gained a great deal of attention from my constituents related to the January 30 order by the President, ordering $20 million for urgent relief efforts to provide migration assistance to Palestinian refugees. That has gotten a lot of attention from folks. They wanted to know what we were doing." Again, the only source we found for this claim was a story in The New Media Journal, which our friends at FactCheck.org noted has posted stories comparing Obama to Hitler and calling Islam "a pathological doctrine and a vestige of long ago barbarism." We called Kyl's office to get more details about his knowledge of the e-mail but did not hear back. Kyl was right that it gained a lot of attention. We found it posted on lots of conservative Web sites like NoBamaNation, AntiObama.net and Patriots for America. Nevertheless, the following day, Kyl withdrew the amendment after receiving a letter from the Department of State, which he entered into the Senate record. The letter, from Michael C. Polt, acting assistant secretary of state, states that the $20.3 million drawn from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) "will be used to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. None of these funds will be used to resettle Gazans in the United States." And yet, the chain e-mails live on. Like so many chain e-mails we are asked to check, we throw this one on the Pants on Fire heap.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-05-08T17:00:18	2009-05-02	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06039	Says Romney and Bain Capital drove KB Toys into bankruptcy by loading it up with debt.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/video-blames-bain-capital-demise-kb-toys/	A 28-minute anti-Mitt Romney video uses clips of adorable singing puppets and a scared child's face to drive home a point: Romney's Bain Capital drove KB Toys into staggering debt and bankruptcy. But is that the whole story? The video, produced by pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future, seeks to paint Romney as a "predatory corporate raider" who "looked for businesses he could pick apart." It highlighted four examples, including mall toy store chain KB Toys, from the more than 100 companies that Bain invested in over the years Romney led the private equity firm. About eight minutes into the documentary-style piece, the video uses an old jingle from KB Toys along with this narration: "Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed." That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys went into bankruptcy in 2004 under Bain, later dissolving in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. But what drove it out of business? Romney's retirement The first two words in that quote, "Romney and Bain," raise the first question: How was Romney involved with Bain in 2000? He had retired from the firm in February 1999 to help organize the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Charlyn Lusk, who does public relations for Bain, pointed to a fact-check this week by Fortune that said, "Romney left Bain in 1999 and had no operational role thereafter. It is true that he remained an investor, but so did dozens of university endowments, private foundations and pension systems. None of them played a part in Bain's investment decisions or portfolio company management." But a New York Times report from December 2011 explains he had something more than investor status — he got a share of corporate buyout and investment profits "enjoyed by partners from all Bain deals through February 2009. ... He was also given the right to invest his own money alongside his former partners." A Bain partnership bought KB Toys in 2000, putting up $18 million and borrowing the rest, $302 million, the Times reported. Less than a year and a half later, KB Toys borrowed more to pay Bain and its investors — which would have included Romney — an $85 million dividend. (That dividend was part of a $121 million stock redemption, funded in part by $66 million in bank loans, Bloomberg reported based on other news coverage.) Bain partners made a 370 percent return, but left the company heavily in debt. Did Romney lead the decision to buy KB Toys, and to reap a dividend? That's what the wording "Romney and Bain bought ..." suggests. That's highly unlikely, since he no longer led the firm. Still, he would have benefited from any deal that benefited the partners. 'The debt was too staggering' The video uses an old ad from KB Toys to paint a rosy picture. Puppets sing about a place with all the "hottest toys." ("Hot we got at KB Toys!") The ad uses a logo with the old "Kay-Bee" name, abandoned by the company in 1981. Viewers are left to think that "staggering debt" drove a merry, healthy company into ruin. Toy industry analysts paint a different picture. KB's model worked in the 1980s. But those puppets would have been crying by the late 1990s. "KB was for many years in a precarious position because of where it was in the industry. It wasn't able to compete on price," said Sean McGowan a senior leisure and lifestyle analyst for Needham & Co. "... If you layer on financial strain, that could push it to the breaking point." The financial strain helped lead to the bankruptcy filing. But even with no debt, it would have been losing money, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play magazine. "Their business model was obsolete," he said. "The world had changed. KB had not changed." Small mall toy stores, such as KB's, couldn't carry enough inventory — or stay tidy. But mall rents were high, and leases long, limiting KB's ability to shift to compete with its larger rivals. Meanwhile, Target, Walmart and Toys "R" Us could carry far more toys and heavily discount the hottest merchandise. KB's strategy at the time of the bankruptcy had been selling closeout toys at a discount — read: stuff that was no longer popular — and offering a few hot items at regular prices. "Knowing all these facts, why is the consumer going to go in there? Is it the higher prices or the old toys?" Silver said. KB wasn't the only toy store chain struggling. Time to Play made a list of 100 retailers around in the mid 1980s that no longer exist, Silver said. What about Bain's role? "To me, it's almost irrelevant," Silver said. "You take a business model that doesn't work, it doesn't matter how much money you have, or how much debt you have." Closing stores The video says, "By 2004, 365 stores had closed." We asked Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, for support for the ad's claims. He sent us a single Associated Press article from Jan. 29, 2004. It reported KB's plans to cut 3,500 jobs and close at least 375 stores after a judge approved the chain's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The article said KB had filed to reorganize in January 2004, blaming "the Christmas season's sharp price wars and increased competition from mega-retailers like Wal-Mart." (The story didn't mention the company's debt burden.) Chris Byrne, a toy industry analyst who wrote an "obituary" for KB Toys in 2008, notes that while the company did close 365 stores, it was part of a strategy that included expansion into KB Toy Works and KB Toys Outlet. What killed the company wasn't so much its debt but poor strategy, he said. Bain and the new executive team had tried to walk away from KB's closeout-old-toy strategy and compete with Toys "R" Us, Walmart and Target by selling new, hot toys at full markup, Byrne said. That resulted in a price war, forcing KB to lower its prices — and eroding margins. So the store tried to carry only a few hot toys, with closeout products in the back of the store. "The numbers just wouldn't work," he said. "It was volume of toys and price as a function of square feet that, in my mind, really undid KB, not the taking of cash out by Bain. This is not the first time that a corporation has misread the toy industry." "If the anti-Mitt Romney people were smarter ... they would be criticizing Bain for rushing into a business that it didn't fully understand, looking for an outcome that probably wasn't likely given the realities of the industry and its context at the time." Still, was it a good idea to pull money out of a company struggling to find its place in a tough industry? Roger Goddu, a former Toys "R" Us president who's now in the private equity business, had invested in KB Toys and consulted for two years with new management in 2005. "In hindsight, it's possible that Bain may have taken a dividend on KB Toys that was too aggressive," Goddu said. "However, the issues at KB Toys were not one-dimensional or purely financial." What seemed like a decent idea could have quickly looked foolish, he said. "In a highly competitive season, which happens in the toy business, the financial health of KB Toys could change quickly, and I suspect that's indeed what happened," he said. "What may have seemed okay could change in a very short period of time, based on other factors influencing KB's operations." Another private capital firm, Prentice Capital Management, bought KB Toys out of bankruptcy in 2005, ending Bain's reign. The toy store landed again in bankruptcy court in 2008, its stores gone by 2009. Our ruling The video King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town, claims that "Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed." The clear implication is that Romney and Bain were responsible for the toy company's demise. Bain Capital bought KB Toys in 2000, after Romney retired. He wouldn't have been involved in financial decisions, though he would have profited from them. The company did choose to take on debt, buy stock and pay investors a dividend, even as the toy store chain struggled to find its niche in a volatile industry. But toy industry analysts agree that far more than debt drove KB Toys into bankruptcy court. It was a troubled company before Bain bought it, and Bain wasn't able to fix it. Did more debt hurt? Probably. But to blame Romney and Bain for the chain's downfall is to ignore critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10378	Barack Obama "passed laws moving people from welfare to work."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/23/barack-obama/obama-co-sponsored-illinois-welfare-reform/	In one of his first ads since winning the Democratic nomination for president, Sen. Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments. "America is a country of strong families and strong values," the ad begins. "My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up." Later in the ad, Obama says, "I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected." The claim that Obama moved people from welfare to work goes back to his days as a state senator in the Illinois legislature. President Bill Clinton and Congress significantly overhauled welfare in 1996, requiring recipients to work and setting time limits on benefits. The states in turn had to change their laws to meet the new federal requirements. In 1997, Obama signed up as a chief co-sponsor (one of five in the senate) on Illinois' version of the legislation. But the Illinois governor at the time, Republican Jim Edgar, got a lot of credit as well. Press reports from the time referred to the plan as "the Edgar plan." This isn't the first time Obama has referred to Illinois laws as if he passed them singlehandedly . Nevertheless, the legislation's primary role was welfare reform, and the legislative record shows that Obama had a leadership role in getting it passed. For these reasons, we find Obama's claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-23T00:00:00	2008-06-19	['None']
pomt-13267	Says Libya "Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help" in Benghazi.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wildly-exaggerates-amb-christopher-st/	The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents. Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House. Trump: "She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help." It’s hard to overstate how much is wrong here. The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out. So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help. Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 "requests for help" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different. First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected. Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including "heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements," according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex. A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi. But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later. Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, "During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained ‘over 600 requests’ for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim." The minority report continues, "Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted." A few things are worth noting right off the bat. • The Republicans’ count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months. • Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. • The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, "1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy." It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication. Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of "concern" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count. The Post was given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total. To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents. At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report "is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure." We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check. In any event, Kessler noted, "few if any" requests were likely from Stevens. He called Trump's comment "a whopper." Our ruling Trump said "Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help." There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence. The highest the number could be, according to that data, is 205 and there's no evidence that those "requests and concerns" — which may include duplicates — were even sent by Stevens.

pomt-06067	"You can hire lots of bureaucrats. That’s what the president’s done. He’s added 135,000 people to the government workforce."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/09/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-hired-135000-bureaucrats/	The day after a hair’s breadth victory in Iowa, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney powered up his New Hampshire campaign in two events featuring the 2008 Republican nominee, Arizona senator John McCain. A hefty crowd of 300 fans packed into the Peterborough, N.H. town hall Jan. 4, 2012, to hear the man who defeated Romney four years ago now endorse him. Romney has built his campaign around contrasting himself with President Barack Obama rather than his Republican primary rivals, and this night was no different. He told the crowd that if the goal is to create jobs, you could rely on the private sector, or you could take Obama’s approach. "You can hire lots of bureaucrats," Romney said. "That’s what the president’s done. He’s added 135,000 people to the government workforce." So let’s examine that statement. Did President Obama hire 135,000 bureaucrats? The Romney campaign sent us the source of that assertion. It comes straight from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and numerically, it’s accurate. In January of 2009, the month that President Obama took the oath of office, the total number of federal employees, excluding the Postal Service, was 2,064,700. In November 2011, it was 2,204,800 for a net gain of 140,100. If anything, Romney was cutting the president a bit of slack. But the story behind the raw number is considerably different than what Romney suggested. The BLS web site gives a breakdown. There we see that the single biggest area of growth, some 63,000 employees, was in the Department of Defense. Federal hospitals accounted for about 30,000 and a blend of other agencies contributed about 70,000. By the way, if you add all those together, you get more than either Romney or BLS gives for the net increase. That’s due partly to the lack of seasonal adjustments to the data and partly to the survey techniques used at the BLS. You can unpack the numbers a little further by using a government database tool run by the Office of Personnel Management called Fed Scope. John Palguta, Vice-President for Policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that studies the federal workforce, says using that tool, the trends are clear. "Just about all of the increases are at the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice," Palguta says. The Office of Personnel Management tallies are done every quarter, not every month, so the numbers don’t exactly match what you find on the BLS web site, but the trends line up. In round figures, from September 2009 to September 2011, the federal workforce grew about 100,000. Counting permanent civilian employees, the departments of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense grew by 53,000 -- more than half of the total. Veterans Affairs provides another 24,000, or about a quarter of the overall increase. Homeland Security contributes 12,000 -- call that another 10%. All told, national defense, assisting veterans, and protecting the national borders account for close to 90% of all federal civilian employee growth. The numbers fall off quickly after that. The departments of Justice and Health and Human Services are tied at roughly 4,000 each. There’s a nuance in Romney’s statement that bears some scrutiny. He talked about hiring lots of bureaucrats which raises the question, is everyone on the federal payroll a paper-pushing practitioner of the dark arts of red tape? Not in the opinion of Palguta. "The sad fact is that the VA has had to increase staff at the hospitals to care for the wounded warriors coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan," Palguta says. There is another connection to veterans behind the single largest increase in manpower at the Defense Department. Tri-Care, the military’s health insurance program added some 5,000 people over the past three years. The general growth of the military over the past decade further drove up that number . Protecting the country against terrorism also helped grow the ranks of federal workers. Within Homeland Security, the big gainers were the Transportation Security Administration, about 5,000, and a new division called the National Protection and Programs Directorate. Among other duties, the NPPD is charged with preventing attacks on the nation’s communications, water systems, and other infrastructure. While this reflects a consolidation of workers from other divisions, it still added some 2,700 employees to the Homeland Security tally. Whether Romney would want to give President Obama full blame -- or credit -- for these changes, the Republican candidate’s statement overlooks the reality in Washington that no money gets spent without the consent of Congress. To take one recent vote, the House and Senate passed a spending bill that increases funding for certain areas of defense and both Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. Among other details, the measure requires the Border Patrol to achieve an active duty presence of not fewer than 21,370 agents protecting the U.S. border. The bill passed with 81 votes in Senate; one of those votes came from John McCain, the man standing next to Romney in Peterborough. Historic trends are worth a mention. The high water mark for government employees was in 1969 when there were 2.3 million workers. The number today, about 2.2 million, is less than during the second term of President Ronald Reagan. The low water mark came at the end of the Clinton administration but the 9-11 attacks put the country on an upward course during the presidency of George W. Bush. Our Ruling Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney cast President Obama as using expanded government to increase employment. PolitiFact does not attempt to assess motivations. What we can resolve is that in terms of the raw numbers, Romney is right. The country has more federal employees today than it did in 2009. But Romney referred to those government workers as bureaucrats. This is a loaded term that obscures what most of the new employees actually do. Merriam-Webster lists as one of its definitions of bureaucracy: "a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation." That may not bring to mind doctors and nurses caring for wounded veterans or border patrol agents. When we examine the largest areas of growth, we find it is in national defense, veteran care, anti-terrorism and border security. Finally, while Romney makes it sound as if this is solely Obama's doing, congressional Republicans and Democrats have approved increases in those areas. If President Obama is responsible for this growth, he had a lot of help from members of Romney’s own party. We rate Romney’s statement Half True.

pomt-04215	A "foreclosure tax" that would take effect in 2013 could mean a high tax bill for those facing foreclosure and millions of families who modified their mortgage or had a short sale through their lender.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/30/national-association-realtors/realtors-push-congress-extend-foreclosure-bill/	In Washington, much of the political conversation these days surrounds a "fiscal cliff" of tax increases and drastic budget cuts that could ignite another economic recession if lawmakers don’t reach a compromise on such issues before this year ends. One organization, though, recently raised its concerns about another piece of federal legislation and its potential impact on many American homeowners if Congress doesn’t act before Dec. 31. The National Association of Realtors posted an item on its Realtor Party webpage with a "Call for Action" about a law set to expire this year. A PolitiFact Georgia follower on Twitter asked us to check out the accuracy of the information. "Congress will soon return to Washington with unfinished business to complete. One of those items is a housing issue that could affect almost one-quarter of all real estate transactions -- the expiration of Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief," the webpage says. "Without action before the end of the year, millions of families who hold distressed properties could face a hefty tax bill for trying to modify their mortgage or to seek a short sale through their lender. Even those facing foreclosure will find themselves forced to pay a ‘foreclosure tax’ if Congress doesn’t act." Walter Molony, a spokesman for the association, said "distressed properties" is a reference to homeowners who owe more on their loans than the property is worth. As for a "foreclosure tax," Molony said that "is our term of art to highlight that a family would face income tax on the amount of the loan forgiven after a foreclosure." In late 2007, Congress passed the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act to help the rising number of homeowners whose finances were being demolished by foreclosures. The act prevents homeowners from being taxed for the cancellation of any debt by a lender during a loan modification or foreclosure. The federal act applies for the years 2007 through 2012. The Internal Revenue Service’s website offers an example of how it works: "You borrow $10,000 and default on the loan after paying back $2,000. If the lender is unable to collect the remaining debt from you, there is a cancellation of debt of $8,000, which generally is taxable income to you." If the cancellation of debt is $100,000, a borrower could be taxed on that amount. Generally, the debt must have been used to buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer's principal residence and must have been secured by that residence. Debt forgiven on second homes, rental property, business property, credit cards or car loans does not qualify, the IRS says. The maximum amount of debt a homeowner can claim is $2 million or $1 million if you’re filing a tax return as a single payer. IRS spokesman Mark Green stressed that point with PolitiFact Georgia, since it was not mentioned in the "Call for Action." In 2011, the estimated tax savings to borrowers from the exemption was at least $1 billion, The New York Times reported, quoting calculations by the association. Some estimates show short sales account for 20 percent to 25 percent of all homes sold in recent months across the country. Slightly more than 4 percent of U.S. homes were in foreclosure, according to a Bloomberg article published in August. It’s unclear whether Congress will pass any legislation to extend the act. Some National Association of Realtors officials believe Congress will pass an extension at the last minute. A one-year extension would cost the federal government about $1.3 billion, according to some estimates. Let’s recap. The National Association of Realtors wrote that millions of Americans could face a hefty tax bill if Congress does not extend this act. It’s possible, if the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act isn’t extended. The Realtors’ estimate that it could have an impact on one-quarter of transactions seems on target, if you add up the percentage of homes in foreclosure and short sales. The association’s "Call for Action" could have used the additional detail about the amount of debt borrowers could write off. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06951	"Under our (2011-’13) budget, the average (Wisconsin) property taxpayer will save $700."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-average-property-tax-payer-w/	Trying to put the divisive fight over collective bargaining behind him, Gov. Scott Walker is framing his budget battle as a victory for Wisconsin’s property tax payers. In a July 7, 2011 news release and column, Walker said a 60-year-old custodian told him a $500 property tax increase he experienced in 2010 will mess up his coming retirement. Walker said the man, who was not identified, told him, "I will have to find a part-time job just to live normally." The governor continued: "Under our budget, the average property taxpayer will save $700. It is my hope that savings like this will help keep more people like that custodian safely in their homes." That claim of $700 savings caught our eye. Walker’s budget featured tight property tax caps -- caps that fulfilled a campaign promise, and would rein in growth. But there was no talk of a big reduction in property taxes. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said Walker did not mean to suggest people would see a real-dollar tax cut of $700 over their previous bill. Rather, Werwie said, Walker means they would pay $700 less over the two-year (2011-’13) budget compared with what they would have without Walker’s moves. At best, that’s highly confusing. Especially since Walker juxtaposes the "$700 savings" claim with the story of one person’s bill going up $500 the year before. In other spots where we found Walker using the $700 figure we found a similar lack of context. But under either approach, there are problems with Walker’s claim. A bit of background first. For years, the state has imposed property tax limits on local governments and school districts, resulting in a slowing of tax growth that somewhat reduced Wisconsin’s high national ranking on property tax burden. Ultimately, in the two-year budget signed in June, Walker won support for much tighter property-tax controls -- even a virtual freeze on municipal levies. The tight levy limits were important to lead to property tax relief. Walker’s budget included large aid cuts to school districts and local units of government. If those officials didn’t -- or couldn’t based on in-place union contracts -- use tools to make employees pay more for pensions and health care, they could have raised property taxes to cover the difference. To back up the governor’s statement, Werwie pointed us to one page in a Department of Administration budget document from March 2011. It was part of Walker’s budget proposal. The page shows a chart estimating the property taxes on a median-valued home for the next two years under Walker’s budget, compared to what they might have been under a different scenario. "The typical taxpayer will save a total of $736 over the biennium," the chart notes. So that’s where the governor gets the $700 figure. Let’s take a closer look at the two scenarios Walker is comparing in order to make his savings claim. The department, which constructs the state budget, provided us the assumptions behind the chart. The problem was immediately obvious -- the chart, while useful in one respect, doesn’t offer a clean "old way" vs. "new way" comparison that Walker would have needed to make the claim he did. To get that, you could compare what property taxes might have been under the old aid levels and a continuation of the Doyle-era tax limits -- vs. the estimated taxes under Walker-proposed limits and aid cuts. That’s old vs. new. Instead, on the "old" (pre-Walker) side of the equation, the chart inserts one of Walker’s own key proposals -- the big aid cut to local governments and schools. That has the effect of pushing up the property tax hike that "might have been" -- in part because it assumed that schools and local governments would almost tax to the maximum allowed to replace the lost aid. That makes the "savings" projection bigger. The chart is not wrong. It’s a useful cautionary illustration for lawmakers deciding how strong the levy limits needed to be to avoid big property tax increases in light of Walker’s school aid cut plans. But its conclusion can’t be used to make the kind of claim Walker makes. No such analysis has been published yet, based on what we heard from tax experts. To sum up, Walker claimed the 2011-’13 state budget will "save" the average homeowner $700 over two years. If he meant a $700 tax cut compared to the past bills, that’s not in the cards at all. The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects the typical homeowner would see a $55 increase in two years compared with 2010. And even if he meant $700 less of an increase, his assertion is not based on an apples-to-apples comparison of his budget vs. the old law. The real figure is not yet known, but we do know that the approach Walker cited was designed in a way that puffs up the "savings." The claim, with its shorthand presentation, rates as False.

pomt-02699	Because of the health care law, "by 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/03/michael-moore/michael-moore-obamacare-sends-over-100-billion-ins/	Michael Moore, the rough-edged populist maker of films about guns, the erosion of the middle class and capitalism itself, kicked off 2014 with some harsh words for President Barack Obama. In a New York Times op-ed, Moore called Obama’s signature health care law "awful." "The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go," Moore said. "By 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies." We have consistently found that, contrary to the claims from the president’s critics, the newly implemented law is not a government takeover of health care. Instead, it drops a layer of regulations and subsidies on top of the existing private sector system. While that generally supports Moore’s contention that the government is sending lots of dollars in the direction of private insurance companies, we wanted to dig further into the specifics. Moore’s staff directed us to a May 2013 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers who help Congress assess its choices. The money Moore has in mind represents the subsidies the federal government is offering to make health insurance more affordable for millions of people. Many individuals who purchase coverage through either the federal or a state marketplace, at prices set by insurers, will be eligible to receive tax credits that lower their premium costs. There are a couple of ways the money can make it to the private insurers that offer the plans. The government might transfer the funds directly to the company or the customer might pay and then get a tax credit at the end of the year. Regardless, each month the private insurance companies get their money. The $100 billion number Moore cited in the New York Times is off, but just slightly, said Josh Fangmeier, a health policy analyst at the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan. A more accurate figure from that CBO report is $95 billion in 2017. The subsidies, which have the effect of lowering premiums, "will increase demand for coverage, and insurance companies will likely benefit from this by gaining more customers," Fangmeier said. The CBO figures there will be 20 million people getting subsidies in 2017. That’s a fair bit of new business for private insurers but Scott Harrington, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said no one should confuse revenues with profits. Most of the new money will pass through the insurance companies’ hands. "At least 80 percent of those dollars -- and probably more -- will go directly towards paying medical claims of enrollees," Harrington said. Still, Harrington noted that there will also be new customers who buy without subsidies because the law requires all citizens to have insurance. "There is no doubt that the law will increase insurers’ revenues given that more people will be buying coverage," he said. At least a couple of the largest insurance companies speak of the Affordable Care Act as an opportunity, not a threat. This past October, Joseph Swedish, the chief executive officer of Wellpoint, gave this upbeat summary. "Today we are raising our 2013 membership and earnings per share guidance, reflecting our strong performance, our continued preparation and the outlook for coming market changes under the Affordable Care Act," Swedish said. In a December press release, UnitedHealth Group touted government-sponsored programs as a significant source of growth. "Approximately 25 million consumers are expected to purchase coverage through public exchanges (the online marketplaces) in the coming years. We are well positioned to meet both consumer and employer needs in the traditional, public exchange and private exchange marketplaces," the company said. Both of these insurers emphasized that nothing is guaranteed and warned that the Affordable Care Act could cut into profits. UnitedHealth Group cautioned specifically about the next couple of years. But after that, their projections were positive. In one respect, the government takes back part of what it offers insurers. The overall plan raises billions in taxes and fees. In 2017, the government expects to collect about $11.4 billion from insurance companies. That could cut into profits but most analysts, including the CBO and America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, expect companies to pass those costs on to consumers. The health care law also phases out subsidies in place today that make the Medicare Advantage program more lucrative for insurers. At the end of the day, the extent to which insurance companies will profit is a matter of debate and uncertainty. Chris Conover, a health policy analyst at Duke University, does not believe the subsidies will add to the companies’ bottom line once you factor in the cost of care. "It’s simply a pure pass-through operation on which insurers make zero profit," Conover said. But Fangmeier pointed to work by the Urban Institute, which projected that for different age groups, sometimes premiums would tend to be higher than health care claims and sometimes they would be lower. Fangmeier said the companies could "at least break even." How it turns out will depend on who buys coverage, how much health care they use, and how efficiently the insurance companies operate. A final note: Both Fangmeier and Conover emphasized that the federal government already heavily subsidizes the health insurance industry through the unique tax rules for employer-sponsored coverage. The employer can take the share it pays of the premiums as a deduction, while the worker gets the benefit tax-free. In 2017, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that will cost the government $171 billion, much more than the subsidies paid through the Affordable Care Act. That is not the only difference. "Unlike the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which is a progressive subsidy, the employer insurance tax exemption is regressive," Fangmeier said. "Meaning that the value of the subsidy to employees increases as their income level increases." Our ruling Moore said that in 2017, Obamacare will funnel over $100 billion to insurance companies. The analysts we contacted told us $95 billion would be a more accurate figure, so Moore overshoots a bit. He characterized Obamacare as a pro-insurance industry program, which might lead some people to think that insurers would pocket all of the money. That clearly won’t happen because the companies will pay for care, and also because insurers might need to absorb a portion of about $11.4 billion in new taxes. What happens to the bottom line of insurance companies is somewhat uncertain. Some firms speak optimistically about turning a profit. Some analysts predict it will be a wash, with revenues and expenses cancelling each other out. All such assertions are based on predictions that could be on target or not. Here, we're focusing only on the specifics of Moore’s claim -- which is largely accurate. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2014-01-03T11:11:24	2014-01-01	['None']
pomt-10392	John McCain opposed bankruptcy protections for families "who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/16/barack-obama/no-exemptions-for-debtors/	Trying to portray his opponent as insensitive to the plight of debt-laden Americans, Sen. Barack Obama used a June 11, 2008, speech to highlight Sen. John McCain's support for a 2005 law that made it more difficult for personal bankruptcy filers to escape debts that they could repay. Specifically, he noted McCain's opposition to an effort to exempt from the law individuals whose medical expenses pushed them into bankruptcy. "John McCain has been part of the problem," Obama said. "When he had the chance to help families avoid falling into debt, John McCain sided with the credit card companies. When he had the chance to protect teenagers and college students from deceptive credit card practices, he sided with the credit card companies. And when I fought against the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt, he supported it — and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay." The attack line revives many Democratic criticisms of the 2005 measure, which created a means test designed to force more consumers to file under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, instead of Chapter 7. Under Chapter 7, individuals could have much of their debt erased, while Chapter 13 requires debtors to enter into court-ordered plans to repay their debts over several years. The legislation was a huge priority of the financial service industry, which mounted an eight-year lobbying effort to get it enacted. But Democrats, then in the minority of the House and Senate, branded it a "sweetheart deal" for credit card companies and argued it would force qualified bankruptcy filers to pay higher attorneys' fees and face more paperwork. As the bill approached a final vote in the Senate at the end of February 2005, Democrats led by Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois threw up a series of roadblocks in the form of amendments designed to exempt certain groups from the means test, including long-term caregivers and victims of identity theft. Each was shot down by the Republican majority, which was eager to send a "clean" bill to the House, where GOP leaders had made it clear they would not vote on legislation laden with amendments. One amendment offered by Kennedy would exempt debtors if their financial problems were caused by medical expenses. All 54 Republicans in the chamber, including McCain, voted against the measure, which was rejected 39-58. Obama joined 37 other Democrats and Vermont Independent James M. Jeffords in voting for it. In fairness, McCain did not play a prominent role in this debate. And the vote on Kennedy's amendment was not an especially dramatic moment in the life of the bankruptcy law; there was more attention focused on high-profile votes on amendments to raise the minimum wage and to prevent violent protesters from escaping court-ordered fines or judgments by filing for bankruptcy protection. Still, a vote is a vote, and in a year where candidates are trying to show empathy for economically stressed Americans, votes like this are likely to carry strong symbolism. Because Obama correctly cites McCain's vote on an effort to narrow the bankruptcy law's reach, we judge his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-16T00:00:00	2008-06-11	['None']

pomt-09421	My "border security efforts have led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/mar/16/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-his-border-security-efforts-le/	At a time when violence along the U.S.-Mexico border is again in the news, Texas Gov. Rick Perry makes an eye-catching claim on his campaign Web site: "Governor Perry's border security efforts have led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime." We had lots of questions about that, so we went looking for answers. In 2005, saying the federal government had not done enough to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Perry announced he was investing in state border security efforts. His plans included helping local law enforcement agencies hire additional officers, buying the agencies equipment, assigning Texas Department of Public Safety personnel to the border and installing surveillance cameras. According to Perry's office, the governor spent about $30 million from his office's budget on the operations in fiscal years 2006-07. The Legislature allocated $110 million for border efforts in 2008-09 and more than $110 million for 2010-11, for a total of $250 million to date. And what was the impact of the efforts? Perry's campaign pointed us to a report from the Texas Border Security Council, whose members were appointed by Perry. According to a chart in the report, "serious" crime in the border counties dropped 65 percent in the two-year period between the third quarter of 2005 — when Texas funding for border operations started — and the third quarter of 2007. We learned that backup for the chart came from the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks the incidences of seven "index" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. However, the chart (dubbed "Texas Border Counties Crime Index") is only that: a jagged line on a page, rising and falling between 2004 and 2007. It doesn't detail specific crime data from border localities, making it impossible to tell exactly where crime dropped, by how much and in which categories. Seeking more detail, we talked to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which reports the state's crime numbers to the FBI. We then learned that the chart was drawn from data that omitted significant facts. The Border Security Council report only counted crimes from unincorporated areas of counties along the border which, it states, accounts for 93 percent of the 1,254 miles of the Texas-Mexico border. By taking that approach, the report excludes all the border region's towns and cities including major population centers such as El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen and Harlingen. By our analysis, more than 75 percent of the population in the border counties lived in incorporated areas in 2007, the last year covered in the chart. What's wrong with leaving out the urban areas? More crimes usually occur where more people live. Consider El Paso County. According to DPS data, the sheriff's department there reported 1,350 "index" crimes in the county's unincorporated areas in 2005. Adding in offenses reported by the city's police department and other law enforcement agencies in the county causes the "index" crimes to total 25,134. Data provided by DPS to support the chart shows that crimes in unincorporated border areas dropped 65 percent between the third quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2007. But that only compares two different quarters. When we looked at crime over all three years of data — 2005 through 2007 -- the decline amounted to less than 1 percent. We also considered the data for both urban and rural areas of all the border counties during those years. The total number of "index" or serious crimes rose from 103,884 in 2005 to 103,986 in 2007. The "index" crime data omits crimes that may occur at higher rates in border regions, including drug offenses and human trafficking. Without those numbers, the border crime story is incomplete. We asked for that data. The DPS says it doesn't collect it but plans to in the future. Separately, the U.S. Border Control offered information on only two enforcement actions that the agency tracks: the number of foreign nationals caught for being in the United States illegally — what it calls "apprehensions" — and the amount of drugs seized. Apprehensions in the Border Patrol sectors that include Texas dropped 58 percent from fiscal 2005 through 2009. The amount of drugs seized — measured in pounds of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and others — more than doubled. Border Patrol spokesman Mark L. Qualia and Tony Payan, an expert on the U.S.-Mexico border and political science professor at the University of Texas-El Paso, agreed that some crimes happen more often in border areas because of the large numbers of people passing through. Qualia cited trespassing and shoplifting as examples of such "transient" crimes. Such caveats undermine Perry's claim -- and build a case that border crime is a complicated subject. As for not counting crimes in cities and towns to assess changes in the border region, Payan said: "This strikes me as sheer manipulation of geographical areas and numbers in order to make the governor look good." When we asked the governor's office for an explanation of the report's methodology, we were referred to the DPS, whose spokeswoman Tela Mange said: "We were focusing on the unincorporated areas ... because that is where much of the illegal activity involving human and contraband smuggling occurs." That may be, though neither the state of Texas nor the Border Patrol gave us data on that activity. Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said that members of his group still believe that crime has gone down and that Perry deserves credit for improving the situation on the border -- though not all the credit. "Crime has gone down based on cooperation between counties, between the state and between the federal government," Reay said. Since 2006, Washington has spent more than $3.7 billion on border security, although Qualia said he could not say exactly how much of the money went to the southwestern or Texas border. Some of the major initiatives have been to hire more Border Patrol agents and build hundreds of miles of fencing. Payan also said that outside factors could have caused border crime to decline. He cited the war raging between drug cartels in Mexico, which he says has limited the cartels' ability to do business across the Rio Grande. Perry's claims about reducing border crime have come under scrutiny before. In 2006, the El Paso Times investigated his statements touting the impact of Operation Rio Grande, which shifted DPS officers and other state resources to border areas. That October, Perry's office trumpeted in a press release: "Crime down 60 percent across the border." The Times questioned the statistic, noting it was based on average crime reductions in "several" counties -- not the entire border region -- where the state participated in "surge" operations over a four-month period. The operations beefed up federal, state and local law enforcement personnel in selected rural areas; urban areas weren't included in the statistics. That's relatively old news. What about more recently? We checked the latest available UCR crime data in both urban and non-incorporated areas along the Texas border in 2008, as reported by the DPS. Overall, serious crime went up 1.6 percent from 2007. Summing up: Perry's claim that his border security efforts have led to a 60 percent drop in crime doesn't hold water. The calculation he touts doesn't consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years' worth of data. Crime may have temporarily subsided in some rural areas of the border region. However, it's not clear how much of any decline can be traced to the state's investment in security. We rate Perry's sweeping statement based on an unreasonable manipulation of crime statistics -- the second instance of his administration touting questionable border crime numbers -- as Pants on Fire.

pomt-14644	"Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter’s college tuition on just two weeks wages."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/25/martin-omalley/could-gm-worker-afford-college-tuition-just-two-we/	Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley recently offered a striking comparison about American families and college tuition. "Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter’s college tuition on just two weeks' wages," O’Malley wrote in a post on Medium. "Today, we are saddling our graduating kids and their families with more than $1.3 trillion in loan debt." Really? We decided to take a closer look. What tuition cost The easier part of this equation to nail down is the average cost of college tuition. According to the U.S. Education Department, average undergraduate tuition and fees -- excluding room and board -- in the 1965-66 school year was $607 per year for a four-year college (public and private) and $203 for a two-year college. (Adding room and board bumps up those figures to $1,375 and $884, respectively, but O’Malley said "tuition," so we won’t consider room and board.) What the average GM worker made According to an article in the Aug. 25, 1964, edition of the Chicago Tribune, the average hourly wage in the auto industry that year was $3.01. That grew a bit after a new union contract was negotiated later that year, but a figure in that ballpark is about right for the time frame O’Malley was talking about, said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry and labor group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Historical wage data from Ford, for instance, shows that the base wage for a "major assembler" was $2.91 an hour in 1965. Dziczek noted that workers in durable-goods manufacturing averaged 44 hours per week in 1965, with time-and-a-half for the final four hours. So a $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period O’Malley cites. So if you ignore taxes -- a questionable policy, but one we’ll grant O’Malley for the sake of argument -- then two weeks of average GM pay would have been enough to pay for one year at the typical two-year college in 1965. But it would not be enough to pay for a year at typical four-year college. That would take a little more than four weeks’ work. What the O’Malley campaign says The O’Malley campaign said they took the wage number from a column by University of California-Berkeley economist Robert Reich, who also served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. In 2014, Reich wrote. "Fifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today’s dollars." But that works out to $4.66 an hour in 1965 dollars, and contemporary evidence suggests that wage is about 50 percent too high. Meanwhile, on the tuition side of the equation, the O’Malley campaign said that one year of in-state, undergraduate tuition at University of Iowa in the 1964-65 school year cost $340, and that this was the case for other states, as well, such as New Hampshire. However, if you use the $3.10-an-hour wage -- rather than Reich’s $4.66-an-hour wage -- then two weeks’ pay, even when untaxed, would not quite cover a year’s in-state tuition at the University of Iowa. And since many GM workers wouldn’t have been residents of Iowa, and thus eligible for the in-state rate at the University of Iowa, we think it’s fairer to look at average tuition nationally. Comparing 1965 to today So O’Malley’s comparison doesn’t quite hold up. However, it’s fair to note that he has a point about the larger question. Namely, it was a whole lot more realistic to be able to pay for a year of tuition with just a few weeks of blue-collar income in 1965 than it is now. During the 2012-13 school year, a year’s tuition at the average four-year college was $14,101, and the base wage at Ford for a major assembler was $28.13 an hour. If you include overtime pay, then two 44-hour weeks at that wage (without setting aside anything for taxes) works out to about $2,700, or less than 20 percent of the one-year average tuition cost. At that rate, it would take more than 10 weeks’ work, including some overtime, to pay for a year’s worth of tuition. We should note that the rise of college tuition costs is the bigger culprit here. In nominal dollars, auto worker wages have grown ninefold since 1965. But average four-year-college tuition is up 23 times from what it was in 1965. Our ruling O’Malley said, "Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter’s college tuition on just two weeks wages." That’s not quite right -- it would have taken about four weeks of work at GM, not two, to pay for a year at the average four-year college in 1965, and more than that if you take account of taxes. Still, O’Malley has a point that the situation in 1965 was quite a deal compared to today, when a typical auto worker would have to work for 10 weeks in order to pay for a year of tuition at the average four-year college. We rate the statement Mostly True. CORRECTION, Feb. 2, 2016: The calculations in our original version slightly overstated the typical weekly and biweekly wages for UAW workers. A $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period Martin O’Malley cited. The difference does not affect the final rating.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2016-01-25T15:00:00	2016-01-14	['None']
pomt-01661	While "Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare," Sen. Mark Pryor supports an overhaul so they "couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/20/crossroads-gps/arkansas-senate-race-crossroads-gps-accuses-mark-p/	The idea of raising the retirement age is popping up in one of the nation’s hottest Senate races -- and not in a positive way. Crossroads GPS, a Republican-aligned group, has launched a television ad in the race between incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and his Republican challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton. A portion of the ad says, "Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare. It’s troubling that Sen. Mark Pryor said we should overhaul Social Security and Medicare. On Social Security, Pryor suggested raising the retirement age." The ad then cuts to a 2011 interview of Pryor saying, "... say that they couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69." Greg Sargent, author of the Washington Post’s liberal Plum Line blog, noticed the truncated sentence in the video clip, which suggested the ad’s creators had removed some context from the interview with Pryor. Sargent flagged this to PolitiFact in a tweet, and we thought it deserved a look. The interview excerpted in the ad was conducted by Jerry Westmoreland of KTSS-TV, an Ion Television affiliate based in Bill Clinton’s birthplace of Hope, Ark. In the interview, Pryor was talking about some of the long-term funding challenges Social Security faces: "Social Security is another thing that’s not in any of the budgets right now, but it is very, very fixable. And again, if people get serious about this in Washington, we can fix Social Security next week if we wanted to. It's not that hard to do, especially if we start right now, because Social Security is solvent for about 25 years. So if you make small changes now, you have 25 years for those little changes to accumulate over time and really help. You could pretty easily make Social Security solvent in perpetuity. Probably the biggest change would be to take my kids’ generation -- teenagers today -- and life expectancy is longer etc., and probably say that they couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69. If you just did that one change, you’d fix about 80 percent of it." The Pryor campaign, in a written response to the ad, said that the senator "has never voted to raise the Social Security retirement age," and even in the context of the interview, he doesn’t say that a retirement-age hike is his official policy stance. We found no evidence to contradict those assertions by the Pryor campaign -- but it’s important to note that the ad didn’t make either of those claims. It simply said that Pryor "suggested raising the retirement age." Because the full KTSS interview makes that much clear, the ad does contains a grain of truth. However, the Crossroads GPS ad glosses over -- indeed, actively edits away -- some important context. Specifically, in the KTSS interview, Pryor limits his suggestion to raising the retirement age for his "kids’ generation -- teenagers today." For an ad whose narration directly addresses "Arkansas seniors" -- and that only includes images of seniors, without showing any teenagers -- that’s a crucial omission. Crossroads GPS did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling The Crossroads GPS ad said that while "Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare," Pryor supports an overhaul by which they "couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69." The ad has a point that "Pryor suggested raising the retirement age" in the KTSS interview. However, the ad is explicitly directed toward "Arkansas seniors," and through selective editing of the KTSS interview, Crossroads GPS omits a clear and important qualifier Pryor had made, that any future hike in the retirement age would be for his "kids’ generation -- teenagers today." The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12640	"In fact, if you add up the net wealth of his cabinet, it has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to 100 million people."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/27/charles-schumer/does-trumps-cabinet-own-more-13-americans/	President Donald Trump’s promise to "drain the swamp" was not convincing to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who illustrated his criticism with Trump’s billionaire cabinet, which "has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to a 100 million people." That seems like a large share of wealth in cabinet member’s pockets. But is Schumer right? He is, although his comparison is disputed among economists because so many Americans have a low net worth. Schumer specifically talks about the "net wealth" of cabinet members. Net wealth is how much a person’s assets are worth once you have subtracted liabilities, like mortgage or credit card debt. If a person has high debt that exceeds their assets, their net wealth is negative. It is impossible to calculate the exact net wealth of Trump’s cabinet, because the members are only required to indicate a range while filling out their financial disclosure forms, such as "between $15,001 and $50,000". The ranges can vary by up to 25 million. That is a pretty vague indication. Schumer’s office cited an article from December by the website Quartz that evaluated the wealth of 17 of Trump’s cabinet members to be more than $9.5 billion. Other news media, like the NBC News estimated it to be as high as $14.5 billion. We looked at data provided by OpenSecrets and publicly available financial disclosure forms and found a much lower number: $3.5 billion, not including assets of spouses. Due to a lack of information, we could not add Sonny Perdue, the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture, and Alexander Acosta, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor, to that number. However, it would not have made a big difference. It also doesn’t really matter how rich Trump’s cabinet members exactly are. According to the Federal Reserve, a U.S. household had an average net wealth of $46,700 in 2013, which are the most recent numbers available. However, the bulk of wealth in the United States is owned by the top 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bottom half only holds 1 percent of U.S. wealth distribution. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2011 the bottom quintile of Americans had a negative net wealth of -$6,029 and the second quintile had a net wealth of $7,263. This is compared to a large difference with the third quintile: $68,839 in 2011. The number keeps rising exponentially for the fourth quintile who own $205,985 and the highest quintile who owned $630,754. "The bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing," says Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of Berkeley. That is because some either have a very low or even negative net wealth, due to high debt. For that matter, it does not take a lot to "have more wealth than a third of the American people," like Schumer claimed, Zuchman added. So even if Trump’s cabinet were all people from the middle class, Schumer’s statement would still be accurate. Our ruling Schumer said that Trump’s cabinet had more net wealth than a third of the American people. He bases his claims on an estimate of $9.5 billion of net wealth for the cabinet. Economists familiar with those kinds of comparison told us that Schumer got his numbers right. But they also told us that there needs to be clarification on the meaningfulness of Schumer’s statement, since it doesn’t take billions of dollars to be richer than the bottom third of of the United States. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Charles Schumer	None	None	None	2017-03-27T15:07:02	2017-03-01	['United_States']

pomt-10399	"The U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/09/john-mccain/navys-record-unblemished/	In making his pitch for more nuclear power plants as one way to address global warming, Sen. John McCain is fond of citing a military statistic. "My friends, the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident," McCain said in Nashville, Tenn., on June 2, 2008. "That's because we have well-trained and capable people." Indeed, the U.S. Navy turned to nuclear power in the 1950s to make its submarines faster and able to stay submerged longer. They are also quieter, more stealth. Since commissioning the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus , in 1954, the Navy has steamed 139-million miles around the world on various nuclear-powered vessels. Currently, there are 102 nuclear reactors aboard 80 Navy combat vessels, mainly submarines and aircraft carriers. "We have never had an accident or release of radioactivity which has had an adverse effect on human health or the environment," said Lukas McMichael, a public affairs officer for Naval Reactors, the U.S. government office that oversees the operation of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. "His (McCain's) statement is correct." Now, two nuclear subs still sit on the Atlantic floor, having sunk in the 1960s. The first to go down was the USS Thresher in April 1963 during deep-diving tests 200 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. All 129 officers, crewmen and military and civilian technicians aboard were killed. The USS Scorpion submarine went down about 400 miles southwest of the Azores in May 1968. All 99 crewmen aboard died. While there is some disagreement about the cause of the accidents, neither went down as a result of problems with the nuclear reactors. The Navy has done some environmental monitoring over the years of the ocean floor around where the subs sank, and has determined there has been no significant impact to the environment. The low levels of radioactivity close to the submarines, McMichael said, were no different than the background levels of radioactivity found anywhere on the ocean floor. While environmental and nuclear watchdog groups agree with McCain's statement about the Navy's accident-free record, many take issue with its significance as it relates to expanding the number of commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. "The Navy, they train their people well," said Kurt Zwally, National Wildlife Federation global warming solutions manager. "The Navy's safety record is admirable. But there is a different safety record with plants in the U.S." Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., said commercial nuclear power plants have at times been run haphazardly and sloppily. The Navy is one thing, Lyman said. "Are they going to be able to run the commercial sector with that kind of discipline? I doubt it." The Navy's good safety culture is certainly one reason for its success, said Thomas B. Cochran, senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But there are other reasons. The Navy's reactors are much smaller and more robust than reactors used commercially. They are designed for combat and to take jolts from being in a submarine. So the comparison isn't entirely fair, he said. In short, while there is debate about the relevance of McCain's statistic, McCain is right when he says there have been no reactor accidents aboard the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered vessels. We rate his statement True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-09T00:00:00	2008-06-02	['None']
pomt-14827	"This incident of supposed feces depicting a swastika on the wall of a bathrooms in one of the halls ... has been supported by zero fact."	pants on fire!	/missouri/statements/2015/nov/22/peter-kinder/missouri-politician-wrongly-claims-zero-evidence-s/	Turmoil at MU has opened the door for politicians and bloggers to comment on recent racial incidents that fueled protests and a hunger strike. Some latched onto to one incident: a swastika found smeared on a bathroom wall in a campus residence hall. Peter Kinder, Missouri’s lieutenant governor and a GOP candidate for governor, appeared on the conservative radio show "Breitbart News Daily" on Nov. 12 to speak about the racial turmoil on the campus. He was asked by host Stephen K. Bannon, "Are there any facts?" Kinder replied that evidence of racism is slim. As an example, he talked about the swastika incident. "This incident of supposed feces depicting a swastika on the wall of a bathrooms in one of the halls … has been supported by zero fact," Kinder said. Zero fact? We had to look into that. We reached out to Kinder’s press secretary regarding this claim. We didn't hear back from him until after this story first published, but during Kinder’s talk on Breitbart, he cited two sources. The first was an article by The Federalist published Nov. 10, which originally began as an attempt to prove the swastika was a hoax. Two days after the article was published, it was updated to include information about a police report of the incident. "On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missourireleased photos of the incident," it read. The second article Kinder mentions is a Fox Sports article written by Clay Travis. This article focused on the question:What if the MU protests were based on lies? In the article, Travis originally said there’s no evidence of the swastika drawn in feces, but later he updated the story to include the police report. We reached out to Department of Residential Life Director Frankie Minor for more information, and he sent us to MU spokesman Christian Basi, who provided the police report. MUPD filed the report about an incident that occurred on Oct. 24. The report describes the incident as "vandalism." At the end of the report an officer provides a narrative of what he saw when he entered the restroom of Gateway Hall. "I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces," the report reads. You can see the entire report here. We also looked at media reports about the incident. The Columbia Missourian, The Maneater, Columbia Daily Tribune, KOMU and others reported Oct. 30 that at 2 a.m. on Oct. 24, staff members in the Department of Residential Life found a swastika drawn in feces in the bathroom of Gateway Hall. Residence Hall Association President Billy Donley released a statement critical of Residential Life’s response. He found out via a flier in the hall. This tweet was posted on the evening of Oct. 29. We will not stay silent. Read the statement below from @RHAPresident pic.twitter.com/xJbPT1oIrI— RHA Mizzou (@RHAMizzou) October 30, 2015 On Nov. 20, after this story was initially published, Kinder spokesman Jay Eastlick contacted us to say, "The lieutenant governor misspoke based on information" from "two sources that later updated the information. At the time the police report was made public, the lieutenant governor realized it was a real incident that happened, and he stopped referring to it as a potential hoax. "There was no intention to purposefully mislead. He based it on information he had at the time." Our ruling Kinder made his "zero fact" statement 19 days after the swastika was discovered, and 12 days after its discovery was reported by multiple news outlets, including the Missourian, The Columbia Daily Tribune, the Jefferson City News Tribune, the Associated Press and every local television station in the Columbia-Jefferson City market. These stories were based on information supplied by the MU Police Department and the MU News Bureau. On Nov. 6, then-Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin issued a letter condemning the swastika and other forms of hate speech. His response was also widely reported. The sources Kinder cites updated their articles on Nov. 12 to include the police report. Although Kinder’s spokesman said the lieutenant governor stopped saying there was no evidence of a swastika after those two websites updated their stories, the majority of local news sources reported its existence based statements from named MU officials.

pomt-12723	"Man pardoned by Obama three months ago arrested for murder."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/06/undergroundnewsreportcom/report-man-pardoned-obama-being-arrested-murder-fa/	The author of a contrived news story about a man being arrested for killing his girlfriend after being pardoned by President Barack Obama says he made it up to show how easily people believe fake news. "Man pardoned by Obama 3 months ago arrested for murder," read the headline on a Feb. 28, 2017, story on UndergroundNewsReport.com. Facebook flagged the story as being potentially false as part of its efforts to fight fake news in users’ feeds. The story has been shared on Facebook more than 23,000 times since being posted less than a week ago. The tale has wound up on other websites since then. The post claims a Gainesville, Fla., man named James G. Winters was arrested for killing girlfriend Joanna Walker and leaving her body in a car trunk in Orlando. Winters, it says, was pardoned by Obama just 94 days ago, freeing him from a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges. These details are fake, although as in many fake news stories, there are some real roots to the premise. Obama granted 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons, the most of any president since Harry Truman. Many of these criminals were nonviolent drug offenders serving exceptionally long sentences under strict federal guidelines from decades ago. Obama had made easing these punishments a campaign promise, and had sought to aid hundreds of people who slipped through the cracks under sentencing revisions created through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Part of Obama’s actions included granting pardons and sentence commutations. (We wrote an entire story about it, which you can read here.) One story circulated by Obama detractors was of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who in 2016 was charged with killing a woman and her two children in Columbus, Ohio. Callahan had been freed under changes in the 2010 law, which Obama supported and signed. Callahan’s case is pending. But Winters hadn’t been freed by Obama, either by pardon or commutation. There is no James Winters on the list of 1,927 prisoners affected by executive action. The photo on the story is of Avery Draughty, a California man convicted of killing his neighbor in 2016. A closer look at the story UndergroundNewsReport.com shows that the site purposely writes outlandish stories to trick readers. The site contains a disclaimer that says all articles "are fiction, and presumably fake news." There also is a link at the end of the story that redirects readers to an explanation that the website’s owner had created it to see if he could fool readers, specifically supporters of President Donald Trump. The article said the writer circulated his fake stories on "Trump fan groups" to see if they would take the bait. "To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally," the author wrote. "It seemed that there wasn’t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience." When we contacted him via email, the writer identified himself as James McDaniel, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen living in Costa Rica. (The site is privately registered in Scottsdale, Ariz.) "I admit I kind of stumbled into this on accident just playing around and didn't really expect to get any attention at first," McDaniel wrote. "People proved to be far more gullible than I previously thought." This claim rates Pants On Fire!

pomt-10217	McCain supports tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/08/joe-biden/its-not-quite-that-simple/	Ah, the catchphrase. It sounds so simple and so outrageous. "Tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas." Democrats use the line frequently, and vice presidential nominee Joe Biden offered a version of it to attack John McCain during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention: "Millions of Americans have seen their jobs go offshore, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there," Biden said. The way Biden says it, it sounds like McCain wants to offer a special tax break for companies to move jobs offshore. Right? That's not quite how it works. So what is Biden talking about? Bear with us here, because this requires a quick explanation of the international corporate tax system. U.S.-based corporations are required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes on all of their profits, no matter where in the world those profits are earned. Companies operating overseas pay taxes to foreign countries. Then, if the amount they paid is less than what they would have owed on domestic profits, they pay the remainder to the United States. For example, if a company earns $1 million in Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, it pays $125,000 to Ireland. Then, because the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, the company would owe an additional $225,000 to the United States. (This example is deliberately oversimplified, and U.S. companies often have tax breaks that reduce their real tax rates below 35 percent.) But there's a catch. The company only pays that $225,000 when it brings the profits back to the United States. If the profits remain overseas, the company gets to defer taxation indefinitely. Deferral is a powerful incentive, and the ability to pay taxes later on income earned now is what makes 401(k) plans so attractive to individuals. Deferral also helps U.S. companies compete overseas, because they don't immediately face higher taxes than their foreign-based competitors. However, Democrats argue, that ability to defer taxes encourages companies to locate jobs overseas and keep their profits there, and that's a logical argument. Of course, there are plenty of nontax reasons why companies might operate internationally, such as cheaper labor, access to foreign markets and proximity to raw materials. Got all that? So let's come back to Biden's statement: What does McCain believe? In a recent campaign ad, the Obama campaign refers to a 2004 Senate vote on the issue. Sixty senators, including McCain and eight Democrats, voted to kill a proposal that would have required companies to pay taxes when they import goods produced in their foreign factories. The measure would have limited, though not eliminated the tax deferral. During his presidential campaign, McCain has taken a different approach to international taxes. He argues that the current tax system puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage, and has proposed lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who advises McCain on economic policy, argued that there is no tax break for companies to move jobs overseas. "If the tax rate were lowered on businesses in this country, businesses would bring money back," she said on ABC. "The reason they cannot bring money back is because the tax rate is so high." As a side note, Obama has not been clear about what limits he would place on deferral of income earned overseas. In a recent conference call with reporters, campaign economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said the magnitude or length of deferral could be curtailed, but the campaign has not released a detailed plan. Does John McCain support tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas? Not really. He supports retaining a long-standing principle of the U.S. tax system that encourages some companies to move operations overseas. The world is far more complicated than Biden's catchphrase makes it seem, and that makes his argument Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-09-08T00:00:00	2008-08-27	['None']

pomt-13893	"As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ‘voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.’ "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-quotes-bernie-sanders-half-true-claim/	Donald Trump made a grab for blue collar Democrats by citing the anti-trade, anti-Hillary Clinton rhetoric of Clinton’s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. For his latest attack, he borrowed Sanders’ own words. "As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ‘voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs,’ " Trump said in a speech about the economy delivered outside a recycling plant in western Pennsylvania. The presumptive Republican nominee quoted Sanders accurately (barring the Trumpian flourish emphasizing "millions"). But Sanders’ original claim, which we investigated, wasn’t without faults. Clinton has largely supported free trade, though her position is more nuanced than Trump and Sanders suggest, she The notion that "millions, millions of jobs" have been lost because of trade, however, is more debatable. Clinton’s position on free trade Sanders is consistently anti-free trade, and Trump has been outspoken in disapproval of deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans Pacific Partnership. Clinton’s views, however, seem to depend on the content of each agreement. Overall, Trump and Sanders have a point that she’s supported more trade deals than she’s opposed. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably of the NAFTA, signed by President Bill Clinton. The deal, she wrote in her 2003 memoir Living History, "would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization." During her 2000 Senate bid to represent New York, Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China. Out of the 10 trade deals that came up for a vote when she was in the Senate, Clinton said yes to six, no to two, and skipped the votes on two (though she had given her vocal support). She also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. She was in favor of a deal with Jordan because of its "internationally recognized enforceable labor standards," she explained in 2005, but she considered the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement "a step backward." As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on several trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea (out of concern for American carmakers), Colombia (because of labor rights abuses) and Panama (whose National Assembly president was a U.S. fugitive). She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail, praising the country for its "very strong labor and environmental protections." As secretary of state in the pro-trade administration of President Barack Obama, Clinton walked back her opposition to three deals from her 2008 run and helped negotiate them. As a presidential candidate in 2016, she flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Year Trade deal Clinton’s position 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement Supported in 1990s, against in 2007 2002 Trade Act of 2002* Voted against** 2003 Chile-United States Voted for 2003 Singapore-United States Voted for 2004 Australia-United States Voted for 2004 Morocco-United States Voted for 2005 Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Voted against 2005 Bahrain-United States Voted for*** 2006 Oman-United States Voted for 2007 Peru-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2007 2007 Jordan-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2005 2011 Panama-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2011 Colombia-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2011 South Korea-United States Against in 2007, supported in 2010 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership Supported in 2010, against in 2015 * This deal is not included in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of free trade agreements, but contains many free trade provisions. ** This is a vote for "fast track authority" — allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters. *** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote. Employment impact unclear The jury is still out on the impact of trade deals on employment, even after decades of debate. On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a 2003 report would kill an unspecified number of jobs. The liberal Economic Policy Institute, which Trump cited, has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over 800,000 jobs, and the South Korean deal cost about 60,000. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China. Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. And in a recent fact-check, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. Analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals. Our ruling Trump said, "As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ‘for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.’ " He accurately recasted Sanders’ words, but that doesn’t make the attack any more correct. Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn’t vote but did vouch for them. As for subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs. Trump’s claim is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-29T11:57:17	2016-06-28	['Bernie_Sanders']

pomt-09473	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson "compared a former vice president to a vampire ... and compared America's health care system to the Holocaust."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/02/republican-party-florida/gop-says-alan-grayson-likens-dick-cheney-vampire-a/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, is a provocateur. He claimed Republicans' approach to health care was to urge people to "die quickly." Many Democrats love him because he's so blunt. And now, many Republicans love him -- because he's so blunt. On Feb. 26, 2010, the state Republican Party criticized a Grayson fundraiser that included Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank.The headline: "You Are Cordially Invited to a Night of Shameless Promotion, Crude Remarks and Drug Busts with Congressmen Alan Grayson and Barney Frank." In the release, RPOF spokeswoman Katie Betta makes a series of claims against Grayson. For this fact-check, we'll examine two. Betta said Grayson "compared a former vice president to a vampire ... and compared America's health care system to the Holocaust." "Over the last two years Alan Grayson has certainly made a name for himself in our nation’s capital, but instead of being recognized for his work for the people of Florida, he stands out as a quirky, irreverent embarrassment to his constituents and to the entire state of Florida,” Betta said. Let's take the vampire claim first. Betta is referencing an Oct. 22, 2009, interview Grayson had with Chris Matthews on MSNBC. At the end of the interview -- which is about health care -- Matthews brings up that former Vice President Dick Cheney had complained that President Barack Obama was dithering. That prompted this exchange (video attached here). GRAYSON: "Well, my response is -- and, by the way, I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he's talking. But my response is this. He's just angry because the president doesn't shoot old men in the face. By the way, when he was done speaking, did he just then turn into a bat and fly away?" MATTHEWS: "Oh, God, we've got to keep it level here. Let me ask you this. Don't you have any Republican friends?" GRAYSON: "Some of my best friends are Republicans." While Grayson doesn't ever use the word "vampire," he says that Cheney has "blood that drips from his teeth," and that he can "turn into a bat and fly away." We've seen enough cheesy horror films to know what he was going for there. As for the claim that Grayson compared the health care system to the Holocaust, Florida Republicans point to remarks Grayson made on the House floor during the health care debate. You might recall, Republicans asked that Grayson apologize after accusing Republicans of wanting people to "die quickly." Here was part of that apology. (Video here.) "Well, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize to the dead, and here's why. According to this study, 'Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,' which was published two weeks ago, 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. So I call upon the Democratic members of the House. I call upon the Republican members of the House. I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America, for the sake of those dying people and their families. I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America." By capitalizing the "H" in their press release, state Republicans are claiming Grayson compared America's health care system to the killing of European Jews and others during World War II. But, based on how he said it, Grayson is most likely using the word with a small "h," which is not specific to the World War II genocide. In our view, the two uses have different meanings. The World War II "Holocaust" conveys a deliberate, horrific killing because of religion. While the uncapitalized "holocaust" is a broader term. State Republicans got it right when they say Grayson has compared a former vice president to a vampire, but it's a stretch for their press release to liken American's health care system to the Holocaust of World War II. So we rate their statement Mostly True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-03-02T15:34:14	2010-02-26	['United_States', 'Alan_Grayson']

pomt-10321	"Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/30/votevetsorg/no-fresh-evidence-of-what-mccain-would-do/	A new television advertisement by a veterans group has harsh words for Sen. John McCain, saying he doesn't believe in freedom when it comes to Iraqis. The ad by VoteVets.org, which the group unveiled on July 23, 2008 and set to air on CNN and MSNBC, features a man identified as "Brandon Woods, Iraq War Veteran." "What do we fight for in Iraq?" he says, staring solemnly into the camera. "I have some idea." "I fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And freedom means that when the Iraqi people and their prime minister ask us to make a plan to leave, we do. But Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes." "That's not what freedom means. That's not what we fought for," Woods concludes. "Senator, I thought you would know better." We have chosen to check the ad's most provocative claim, that McCain would "occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes." We should start by noting that the United States and the United Nations do not consider the current U.S. presence in Iraq an "occupation" — in their view the occupation ended in June 2004 when the United States and its coalition powers handed authority to an Iraqi government. "After 2004, the Security Council ceased to regard the situation on the ground as an occupation," said U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq. "The secretary [general] went along with that." VoteVets.org said it accepts that the current situation is not an occupation. But the group said it would become one again if the Iraqi government asked us to leave and we refused. And they said McCain has indicated he would not withdraw even if the Iraqis asked us to. We'll buy the first part of that. If the United States continues, against the will of the Iraq government, operating out of any significant number of the 30 or so major military bases it currently has in Iraq, that would constitute the sort of control and authority over Iraqi territory required to meet the dictionary definition — and international law definition — of an occupation. That leaves us with the question of whether McCain really would leave forces in Iraq against the wishes of the Iraqi government. In 2004, McCain said he would do nothing of the kind. "What would or should we do if, in the post-June 30 period, a so-called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave, even if we are unhappy with the security situation there?" Peter Peterson, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank, asked him . "Well, if that scenario evolves, then I think it's obvious that we would have to leave," McCain replied. There was little chance of that happening at the time. Lately though, the situation has changed. Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, have expressed support for a withdrawal timetable such as the 16-month one that Sen. Barack Obama has advocated. "Obama's remarks that — if he takes office — in 16 months he would withdraw the forces, we think that this period could increase or decrease a little, but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in Iraq," Maliki said in a July 19 interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel, according to a New York Times translation . Confronted with this new development, McCain continued to defer to the Iraqis in some respects, saying, "I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should — or horizons for withdrawal. But they have to be based on conditions on the ground." But what if the Iraqis decide they want us out regardless of conditions on the ground? Would McCain still withdraw? CNN's Wolf Blitzer recently pressed him on just that point. "If you were president and Nuri al-Maliki is still the elected prime minister of Iraq, and he says he wants all U.S. troops out, what do you do?" Blitzer asked McCain on July 27, 2008. "Well, first of all, I know Prime Minister Maliki rather well," McCain replied. "I know that he is a politician, and I know that they are looking at upcoming elections. I know that he knows and every — and the other leaders know there that it has to be condition-based, any withdrawals — which, we will withdraw. We have succeeded. The surge has succeeded. And we're on the road to victory. And we will be out of there. And we may have a residual presence of some kind, as I've always said, but the fact is, the surge has succeeded. … So I can assure you that Prime Minister Maliki understands that conditions have to be kept. ... we're not going to go down that road (of unconditional withdrawal)." "What — but if Maliki persists?" Blitzer said. "You're president, and he says he wants U.S. troops out and he wants them out, let's say, in a year or two years or 16 months, or whatever, what do you do? Do you just — do you listen to the prime minister?" "He won't," McCain said. "He won't. He won't, because he —" "How do you know? How do you know? How do you know that?" Blitzer interjected. "— knows that it has to be condition-based," McCain continued. "Because I know him, and I know him very well. And I know the other leaders. And I know — I've been there eight times, as you know. And I know them very, very well." "Why do you think he said that 16 months is basically a pretty good timetable?" Blitzer asked. "He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground," McCain said. So rather than answering the question directly, as he did in 2004, McCain did not accept the premise that the Iraqi government might want the United States out regardless of security conditions. Instead, he said Maliki had made his timetable dependent on conditions on the ground. We were not able to find any such qualification by Maliki — in his public comments he has not been specific about the sort of timetable he wants. The McCain campaign did not respond to our request to provide evidence for McCain's characterization of Maliki's position. But we're not fact-checking McCain here (we do plenty of that elsewhere). We're fact-checking VoteVets. And to support its claim, the group pointed us to instances such as the Blitzer interview, where McCain insisted that both he and Maliki want a conditions-based withdrawal. VoteVets made the point that McCain dodged the question of what he would do if Maliki wanted an unconditional withdrawal. And he did. But McCain dodging the question is not the same as him saying he would leave U.S. forces in Iraq regardless of what Iraqis wanted. Politicians often dodge hypothetical questions, and they have all kinds of reasons for doing so. The only clear statement from McCain on what he would do if Iraqis tried to kick us out — as far as we could find — was when he said, "It's obvious we would have to leave." It's noteworthy that McCain won't answer the question these days. We understand VoteVets' concern. But the group doesn't have enough ammunition for its claim that McCain "would occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes." The only solid evidence — stale as it may be, having come in 2004 — indicates otherwise. So we find the claim to be False.	None	VoteVets.org	None	None	None	2008-07-30T00:00:00	2008-07-23	['Iraq']

pomt-05768	"Every time we put a ballot issue on, it costs a million dollars."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/29/jon-husted/jon-husted-says-statewide-ballot-issues-each-cost-/	Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions last year to put a new state elections law, House Bill 194, on the ballot to let voters decide whether to repeal it. The referendum on House Bill 194 is slated for the Nov. 6 election. But GOP lawmakers who supported the bill are now interested in repealing it in the General Assembly, which would nullify the referendum. Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio’s elections chief, also has said he favors repealing the bill. Husted, a Republican, told a political forum hosted by Associated Press, that repealing the law would help prevent voter confusion and could also save taxpayer money. "Every time we put a ballot issue on, it costs a million dollars, essentially, to do that," he said. The referendum on HB 194 – if lawmakers do not repeal the law – would be the second voter referendum in Ohio in two years. Voters in November overturned Senate Bill 5, an overhaul of the state’s laws covering collective bargaining for public workers. That law raised objections from Democrats and labor groups. Its repeal breathed new life into the referendum process as a way to obstruct the agenda of GOP lawmakers who control the General Assembly. With the HB 194 referendum scheduled for November, and more possible in the future, PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into Husted’s claim about the cost. First, we should note that not all statewide ballot issues are voter referendums. Last year, for example, two proposed constitutional amendments were issues on the November ballot. Husted’s words reference ballot issues, in a broader sense, but when he made this claim it was part of a discussion specifically about the upcoming referendum on HB 194. We called Husted’s office and a spokesman said the million-dollar price tag is due to the state’s responsibility to educate the public about the law on the ballot. "To ensure all voters have a chance to familiarize themselves with the issues, Ohio’s constitution requires the secretary of state to place issues appearing on the ballot, in their entirety, in newspapers once a week during the three weeks preceding the election," Husted spokesman Matt McClellan said in an e-mail. McClellan said it cost $2.1 million to meet the requirement last year, when the SB 5 referendum and two proposed constitutional amendments appeared on the November ballot. The newspaper ads to educate the public were massive – 60 pages of newsprint that were copied about 5 million times and disseminated in newspapers across the state. McClellan said the SB 5 referendum accounted for 57 of the advertisement’s 60 pages because the entire 302-page law had to be printed. HB 194 would make several changes to elections law, including restricting early voting opportunities. Democrats have called it a "voter suppression" bill. It also is a massive text and would require 50 pages of newsprint for the public notice, McClellan said. Based on the per page cost of last November’s newsprint advertisement, we were able to determine a potential cost of a referendum on HB 194 and the cost of the SB 5 referendum. Each of the 5 million newspaper ads distributed across the state last fall were 60 pages. That’s a total of about 300 million pages. The total cost of those ads was $2.11 million, meaning each page cost between 0.7 and 0.8 cents. First, let’s nail down the cost of the SB 5 referendum. Reprinting the entire law and providing other required information, such as arguments for and against the law, required 57 of the 60 pages. The other two ballot issues needed only three pages of the ad. Based on the per-page cost, the other two ballot issues together cost slightly more than $105,000. That means the SB 5 referendum cost the secretary of state’s office more than $2 million. McClellan said reprinting HB 194 will require 50 pages of newsprint. Since the constitution requires all ballot issues be placed in newspapers across the state, we can assume the state would have to pay for another 5 million copies – the same number of ads it had to buy for last year’s ballot issues. So that means 250 million pages would be needed. At 0.7 cents per page, the total comes to about $1.75 million. We checked our math with the secretary of state’s office and McClellan said it reached the same conclusion. Where does that leave us? Husted’s claim is partially accurate. He made his comment while specifically talking about the referendum for HB 194 and his underlying point here was that referendums cost the state a lot of money. He stated a figure of $1 million for each issue, and the cost of advertising the SB 5 referendum and the estimated cost for HB 194 each exceed that figure. But Husted specifically said "ballot issue," which on its face would include more than just referendums to repeal legislation. And he presented the $1 million figure as a rule of thumb, which it is not. The cost of the advertisements will vary, depending on how many pages it takes to print the language needed to educate the voters about the issues. In the case of the SB 5 referendum, that required 57 pages because the law to be repealed had to be reprinted. That length is In contrast, though, to the $105,000 price tag for the two other statewide ballot issues last November. That is important information needed to fully evaluate Husted’s claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Half True.	None	Jon Husted	None	None	None	2012-02-29T06:00:00	2012-01-26	['None']

pomt-14222	"But for immigrants, we would have a contracting population..."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/18/don-beyer/don-beyer-wrongly-says-us-population-would-be-shri/	In the immigration debate, U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, says he’s "just amazed" that Republican don't think of the country's employment needs. "But for immigration, we would have a contracting population, and a contracting population means a contracting economy," he said during an April 12 radio interview with Bill Press, a liberal talk show host who broadcasts from Washington. "So where are the workers going to come from 10 years from now, 15 years from now, but for healthy immigration policies?" Beyer asked. He said immigration critics "don’t think - not even just long-term, but short-term - about the employee needs this country has." What caught our attention is the congressman’s claim that the U.S. population would be falling without immigration. We wondered if he’s right. Thomas Scanlon, Beyer’s director of communications, pointed us to a study released by the Pew Research Center in September. It examined U.S. immigration trends since 1965 and offered projections through 2065. But the Pew study - citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau - undercuts much of Beyer’s claim. It says, "If no immigrants had entered the country after 1965, when the U.S. population numbered 193 million, the nation’s population still would have grown - to 252 million people by 2015, rather than 324 million." In other words, the U.S. population grew by 131 million -- or 68 percent -- during the past 50 years. Without documented and undocumented immigrants and their descendants, Pew says the population would have increased 59 million - or 31 percent. Moving forward, Pew projects the U.S. population to expand from 324 million last year to 441 million in 2065 - a 36 percent increase. With no immigration after 2015, Pew says the population still would grow but only to 338 million in 2065. That would be a 4 percent increase over 50 years. Here’s another way to look at it: Pew predicts that 88 percent of the nation’s population growth during the next 50 years will be linked "to future immigrants and their descendants." That’s a big surge from the past 50 years, when "the arrival of new immigrants and the births of their children and grandchildren account for 55 percent of the population increase," according to Pew. There’s one more finding in Pew’s projections that should be considered. Let’s go back to Pew’s projection that if immigration ended in 2015, the U.S. population would expand from last year’s 324 million million to 338 million in 2065. All of that growth and more would occur by 2045, according to Pew, when the population would peak at 343 million. During the next 20 years, the population would decrease by 5 million. In other words, Pew projects that after 2045 all of the U.S. population growth - which factors births, deaths and migration in and out of the country - will be attributable to the latest two generations of immigrants and their children. . Our ruling Beyer said, "But for immigrants, we would have a contracting population." A Pew study cited by Beyer’s office doesn’t support the congressman’s claim. It shows that the U.S. population would have expanded by about half of its 68 percent growth during the past 50 years if no immigration had taken place. Looking ahead, Pew projects that 88 percent of the nation’s growth during the next 50 years will come from new immigrants, their children and grandchildren. But starting in 2045, the report says, all of the net growth will come from immigrants. Beyer’s statement, in the present tense, wrongly suggests that without immigrants the U.S. population now would be in decline. But some context needs to be added. His statement came while he was talking about the need for immigrants to fill U.S. jobs "10 years from now, 15 years from now." In the future - say, 30 years from now - the Pew projections point to Beyer being right. But not now, or in 10 or 15 years. So we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-05366	Says challenger Dominic Chavez is a "Rick Perry Republican" lobbyist.	false	/texas/statements/2012/may/09/bill-spelman/bill-spelman-says-dominic-chavez-rick-perry-republ/	In a mailer we spotted May 8, 2012, Austin City Council member Bill Spelman urges recipients not to be fooled by a challenger. "Republican lobbyist Dominic ‘Dom’ Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican," Spelman says, also asking whether "we really want" Chavez to "push a Rick Perry agenda for Austin" on the council. Chavez works for a state agency guided by a board of Perry appointees. Is he also a Republican lobbyist and Perry man? Spelman’s campaign consultant, David Butts, told us by telephone that Chavez once registered with the state as a lobbyist for the Real Estate Council of Austin, whose mission includes advocacy for the commercial real estate industry. It’s not a Republican Party group. Reminded too that the mailer does not say Chavez used to be a lobbyist, Butts said: "Once a lobbyist, always a lobbyist." We wondered how to define a Perry Republican, speculating that might be signaled by regular or hefty campaign contributions to Perry, participation in his campaigns as a staff member or volunteer or maybe through an appointment to a board. Research showed that Chavez does not qualify on any of those grounds. As backup for Spelman’s claim, Butts said Chavez has mostly voted in Republican primaries and he suspects Chavez voted for Perry’s 2010 re-election. Also, he said, Chavez’s comments as a staff spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, entrusted with coordinating programs offered by state colleges and universities, show he’s aligned with the long-time governor. Armed with Butts’ offerings, we turned to Chavez, who told us he was previously a lobbyist for a non-partisan group while he has voted in both party primaries. "I don’t call myself a Republican," Chavez said. "I have voted for Democrats and Republicans. I would consider myself a fiscal conservative and Independent." Chavez told us in a telephone interview that he registered as a lobbyist at the Texas Ethics Commission to represent the real estate council in the 2005 legislative session, and also lobbied for the council at the city and Travis County government while working in its government affairs section in 2001-02 and from 2003 to 2007, when he went to work for the coordinating board, where he is now the senior external relations director. A Chavez filing on the ethics commission’s website confirms termination of his lobbyist registration covering 2005, while another document there lists Chavez as a lobbyist from Jan. 26, 2005 through the end of that year. Neither one specifies who he represented, but the address written on the form is the real estate council’s downtown address. By telephone, real estate council official Nancy McDonald confirmed that Chavez lobbied city government for the group. She said the group did not endorse gubernatorial candidates through his time there and did not endorse Austin City Council candidates either. Next, we verified Chavez’s primary voting history. A word: Texas has open primaries, meaning any voter may participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, though once a voter joins a primary, they cannot vote in the other party’s runoffs. Unlike some other states, too, Texas does not require a voter to register their political affiliation. So individuals may vote in one primary or the other without explanation. Chavez said that he voted in Travis County’s 2002 Democratic primary and voted in the 2006, 2008 and 2010 Republican primaries. He said he did not vote in any 2004 primary. That information matched what Butts told us and also a check of voting records on our behalf by Austin political consultant Jeff Smith, who said Chavez registered to vote in the county in 2001. Chavez later told us said he previously voted in California elections. Calling himself a "strategic voter," Chavez said he voted in the 2002 Democratic primary to support a Travis County commissioner, Karen Sonleitner, and voted in the 2006 Republican primary to back a Texas House hopeful with a focus on veterans issues, Bill Welch. Similarly, Chavez said, he voted in the 2010 GOP primary to support a friend seeking a House seat, Paul Workman. He said he could not recall why he voted in the 2008 Republican primary but remembers voting for the Republican presidential nominee, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, that November. He said he has not decided if he’s voting in a 2012 primary. Chavez has not been a Perry campaign donor, according to a search of campaign finance reports on the ethics commission website, nor has he given a great deal to anyone. The search indicates that Chavez ponied up less than $260 from mid-2004 through early 2012, spread among a Republican House candidate and four political entities not tied to either party. Welch fielded a $37.36 contribution from Chavez on Oct. 4, 2006; the Building Owners and Managers Association of Austin political action committee fielded $100 on Aug. 3, 2004; and the Small Business PAC took in $104, in two Chavez donations, in May 2006. Finally, Chavez paid $16 to the Northwest Austin Republican Women on April 2, 2012, which Chavez told us paid for lunch one day. Chavez, a former Army reservist, volunteered one Perry link; he and Perry posed for a photo when the governor visited Texas troops in Iraq. Sending us the 2009 photo, Chavez wrote: "We were all proud Texans and he was our governor taking time to visit troops in Iraq. No one cared about political party or politics for an event like this." Chavez said too he has not always voted for Perry. He said he could not remember who he voted for in the 2002 election won by Perry. But in November 2006, he said, he voted for Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who ran against Perry as an Independent after winning state office as a Republican. Chavez said he voted for Perry in November 2010, but is unsure if he supported him while casting his ballot in that year’s contested GOP gubernatorial primary. "I’m not even sure I voted" on the offices at the top of the primary ballot, he said. Butts also offered May 2012 messages from the Williamson County and Travis County Republican parties mentioning Chavez’s council candidacy and articles in which Chavez was quoted on behalf of the coordinating board. Williamson County’s Republican Party invited members to attend a May 3 social hour. The posting says Chavez and two other local candidates had confirmed plans to be there and two other council candidates, not identified, had been invited. Butts told us Spelman was not invited. Bill Fairbrother, who chairs the Williamson County GOP, said in a telephone interview that he heard before the event that Chavez is "Republican-friendly," though he did not verify that. Informed that Chavez had voted in three of the last four Republican primaries, Fairbrother said that pattern for anyone would suggest he or she "leans Republican," though he said some Republicans would say it takes voting in four or five consecutive GOP primaries to cement that. The message from Rosemary Edwards, who chairs the Travis County GOP, urges recipients to vote for Chavez and challengers for two other council seats. Her message calls the three the "more conservative" candidates. Andy Hogue, a party spokesman, told us by telephone that the message went out about May 6, 2012. Hogue pointed us to Roger Borgelt, the county party’s vice chairman, who told us by phone that he doesn’t consider Chavez a Republican partly because he has not been a local Republican precinct chair, election judge or the like. Borgelt also parted with Fairbrother’s "leans Republican" analysis, saying he would want to know more about a person before concluding they fit in that barrel. The news articles show Chavez talking about Perry and higher education; one quotes Chavez talking about an executive order from Perry announcing a partnership between the state and the online Western Governors University. Another story, in the August 28, 2011 Daily Campus, Southern Methodist University’s student newspaper, quotes Chavez, again on behalf of the agency, saying that Texas had made "great strides" with a greater share of residents enrolled in college, including more minority students, and more students proving ready for college, based on test scores. Also offered by Butts: A Jan. 27, 2012, news article published in the Austin American-Statesman quoting Chavez as an agency spokesman pointing out Perry’s call for Texas universities to develop $10,000 degree programs. Our ruling Chavez voted in the three latest GOP primaries. He voted for Perry in the 2010 general election, he says, though he also says he preferred another gubernatorial candidate in 2006. Keeping in mind that no one in Texas has to register a political affiliation, it’s reasonable to speculate about his partisan leaning, but there’s no certainty in that. And he calls himself an Independent. Chavez mentions Perry in his state job, as Spelman’s camp points out. But it strikes us a stretch to presume that someone who speaks for an agency and references the governor’s initiatives or positions is automatically a Perry acolyte. If that were so, then every spokesman or spokeswoman for every agency could be judged the same. That’s unshown. We can see why someone might suspect Chavez of being a Republican and maybe even a Perry fan. But we see no proof. Finally, Chavez once lobbied for a non-partisan group and not Republicans, contrary to Spelman’s statement, which also leaves the inaccurate impression that Chavez is a lobbyist now. It’s been years since he lobbied. We rate Spelman’s claim as False.	None	Bill Spelman	None	None	None	2012-05-09T17:23:27	2012-05-08	['None']
pomt-07658	Texans eat more catfish than residents of all other states combined.	false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/12/glenn-hegar/glenn-hegar-says-texas-leads-all-other-states-comb/	It seemed a tad(pole) fishy when state Sen. Glenn Hegar, R-Katy, recently said Texans eat more catfish than residents of other states, by a whopping margin. His Feb. 26 op-ed column in the Austin American-Statesman says: "Texans love their catfish, batter-fried, blackened, or grilled. In fact, Texans eat more catfish than all the other states combined." Hungering for back-up for Hegar’s boast, we reached his chief of staff, Lisa Craven. She attributed it to--we kid not--the Catfish Institute, a Mississippi-based entity devoted to raising "consumer awareness of the positive qualities of U.S. farm-raised catfish," according to information on its website. Catfish farming is big in Hegar’s district, and he’s proposed legislation requiring restaurants to disclose if they are serving catfish imported from other countries. In an interview, institute spokesman Jeff McCord told us the institute commissioned a 2005 catfish consumption study concluding that Texans consume more catfish than residents of four other southern states combined. The study concluded the residents of Texas then consumed nearly 109 million pounds of catfish a year. That’s more than the residents of Alabama (30 million), Arkansas (18 million), Louisiana (28 million) and Mississippi (18 million) combined (94 million pounds). But more than all the other 49 states? McCord said the institute did not look into that. McCord said the study was conducted by Market Research Institute, a nationally recognized firm, in May and June 2005. "The research focused on the states with the highest per-capita sales of U.S. farm-raised catfish," McCord said. "In each state, the researchers contacted and obtained data from seafood purchasing agents for seafood stores, supermarkets, catfish restaurants and other restaurants and came up with the aggregate numbers." No denying it, 109 million pounds is a lot of fish. Yet Texas has a lot more people than those other catfish-crazy states. We wondered how much of the tasty ictalurids -- which happen to be the catfish native to North America -- the average Texan consumes. So we divided the state estimates from the study by each state’s 2005 population as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Turns out that Texans consumed nearly 5 pounds per person, while residents of each of the other states averaged more than 6 pounds each. We circled back to Craven, who said Hegar fact-checked his article with the Catfish Institute, whose spokesman, McCord, later called the Texas-most reference a "minor overstatement." Finally, we contacted David Harvey, an agricultural economist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, and asked him about state-by-state catfish consumption. No such information is available, Harvey said, speculating that’s because it would require fish processors here and abroad to say where they’re sending their fish and the processors don't want to share such details. Not only do Texans not eat more catfish than the whole rest of the country, they ate less, per person, than residents in four other southern states as of 2005. Even by Texas bragging standards, Hegar’s statement smacks as a memorable fish tale. We rate it False.	None	Glenn Hegar	None	None	None	2011-03-12T06:00:00	2011-02-26	['None']
pomt-09156	Once the U.S. government signs a U.N. treaty on conventional arms, "all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/09/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-un-treaty-would-force-us-ban-con/	A chain e-mail making the rounds warns that President Barack Obama's administration is pursuing a United Nations treaty that would be the "first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States." Given the controversial nature of both gun-rights policy and United States sovereignty, we decided to do a fact-check. Here are excerpts from the version of the e-mail forwarded to us by a reader, with original capitalization and syntax intact: "While you were watching the oil spill, the New York failed terrorist bombing and other critical crises, Hillary Clinton signed the small arms treaty with the UN. "OBAMA FINDS LEGAL WAY AROUND THE 2ND AMENDMENT AND USES IT. IF THIS PASSES, THERE could BE WAR.... "On Wednesday the Obama administration took its first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States. The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.... The laws are designed and intended to lead to the complete ban and confiscation of all firearms.... "We will wake up one morning and find that the United States has signed a treaty that prohibits firearm and ammunition manufacturers from selling to the public. We will wake up another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that prohibits any transfer of firearm ownership. And then, we will wake up yet another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that requires US citizens to deliver any firearm they own to the local government collection and destruction center or face imprisonment. This has happened in other countries, past and present! THIS IS NOT A JOKE NOR A FALSE WARNING." There's a lot to digest here, but we'll start by explaining what treaty the e-mail is referring to. Though the e-mail calls it the "small arms treaty," it's been referred to in official U.N. documents as the Arms Trade Treaty. In 2006, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution that established a path toward a "comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms." Backers argued that a treaty would safeguard international peace and security by curbing the international flow of weapons -- especially to ''make it more difficult for guerrilla movements, insurgents and irresponsible governments'' to obtain small arms, in the words of Mark Leon Goldberg, who writes for the liberal magazine the American Prospect and blogs for the publication UN Dispatch. The United States has not always fully supported the process. The administration of George W. Bush voted against resolutions supporting it in the General Assembly, arguing that nation-by-nation safeguards are superior to international agreements. Gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association also opposed participation in the treaty. But in October 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the Obama administration was open to negotiating a treaty, as long as the final text was arrived at by consensus -- a process that would effectively give every participating nation a veto. "Consensus is needed to ensure the widest possible support for the treaty and to avoid loopholes in the treaty that can be exploited by those wishing to export arms irresponsibly," Clinton said in a statement. That announcement disappointed some backers of the treaty, who said giving every nation a veto would effectively water down the substance of the agreement while also producing major procedural hurdles. But gun-rights advocates were unhappy for a different reason, saying that rejoining the talks could open the United States to one day having to adjust its own gun laws to mirror those in the new international standards. John Bolton, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under Bush, echoed the arguments of the chain e-mail when he told the Washington Post after Clinton's announcement that "this has little or nothing to do with the international trade in conventional arms. This will strengthen the hand of a government that wants to regulate private ownership of firearms." No final treaty text exists yet. As a result, it's impossible to say definitively that the final version of the treaty will, or will not, impinge upon domestic gun rights in the U.S. Also, the e-mail is incorrect that the treaty would be operative once it is signed. Rather, it would become operative once it is signed and the Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds margin. (For that matter, the e-mail is also wrong to say that the Secretary of State has signed it -- that hasn't happened yet.) But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the final treaty did include provisions that ran counter to the Second Amendment of the Constitution -- the one that protects "the right of the people to keep and bear arms." And let's assume that an administration was actually bold enough to sign that treaty, and that the U.S. Senate mustered the two-thirds vote required to ratify it, even though doing so would inspire a popular backlash among Americans who believe strongly in gun rights. Even if all of that happened, a half-dozen constitutional and international law experts we spoke to agreed that there is solid Supreme Court precedent guaranteeing that those provisions could not be enforced domestically. This fail-safe mechanism is the 1957 Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert. In that case, the majority ruled, among other things, that if a provision of a U.S.-ratified treaty were to run counter to the U.S. Constitution, it could not be enforced. The majority wrote that the Supreme Court had "repeatedly taken the position that an act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument." Our experts -- including scholars from across the ideological spectrum -- added that Reid v. Covert has attracted little dissent in subsequent years, so they consider it a strong bulwark against the kinds of threats envisioned by the author of the chain e-mail. "No treaty can validly abridge a constitutionally-protected individual right," said Kal Raustiala, a UCLA law professor. "That issue was decided long ago. So the scenario laid out here is simply not accurate." We found wide agreement that a "complete ban and confiscation" of guns, as the e-mail darkly put it, is not in the cards anytime soon. But some of our experts added that over a much longer period, a U.N. treaty could indirectly shape the course of U.S. gun control policy. This could happen if new standards set by an international treaty begin to influence how courts in the U.S. interpret the Second Amendment. The legal positions of other countries have occasionally been cited in court decisions, as recently as May 17, 2010, when the Supreme Court decided in Graham v. Florida that it's unconstitutional to sentence a juvenile offender to life in prison without parole for a crime other than homicide. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority that "there is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in continuing to impose life without parole sentences on juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over. This observation does not control our decision. The judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. But 'the climate of international opinion concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment' is also 'not irrelevant.'" It's possible to imagine the Supreme Court at some future date using an international gun control standard as one piece of evidence when writing a majority opinion on the Second Amendment, though that's hardly a foregone conclusion. "Over the really long term, do (gun-rights advocates) have something to worry about? The answer is absolutely yes," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. "It's smart for the NRA to be mobilized on an international level." But even scholars who agree with this position make clear a difference between the e-mail's claims, which they consider overheated or worse, and something that could, theoretically, happen many years from now. Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said that "while this is a serious long-term problem, it is not a matter of gun confiscation tomorrow," as the e-mail suggests. The possible long-term evolution of how the Second Amendment is interpreted "points in the same general direction as this e-mail," Bromund said. "But the difference between what is going on and the claims (it makes) are considerable." Ultimately, then, it's possible -- if a treaty is passed, and if Supreme Court justices use the treaty as a foundation for overturning longstanding interpretations of the Second Amendment -- for the treaty to influence U.S. gun laws. But it is simply not true that, in the e-mail's words, "once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments." Rather, in the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that banned guns and required their confiscation from ordinary Americans, a longstanding Supreme Court precedent would make those provisions unenforceable within the United States. So we rule the e-mail False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-06-09T18:58:23	2010-06-03	['United_States', 'United_Nations']

pomt-09250	Royalties for oil and other energy sources are the "second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/06/darrell-issa/issa-says-oil-royalties-trail-only-taxes-generalti/	The major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on a low-profile federal office and how it manages offshore oil leases. In a May 4, 2010, interview with MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., suggested that there may be a conflict of interest between the government's reliance on revenue from oil leases and its need to be a tough regulator. He focused on the Minerals Management Service, an office within the Interior Department that handles royalties, rents and other revenues from oil, natural gas and coal on federal land or in federal waters. "MMS can't be all things to all people," said Issa, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. "It should come out from underneath the Department of Interior. It should be like the IRS, responsible for revenue generation and for reporting. And the Department of Interior needs to be very, very diligent in protecting our wildlife, our wetlands, and all of our natural resources." Issa added, "I think it's a unique conflict of interest when you're dealing with two critical areas, the safety to the environment and the revenue. This is the second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS. So it's very clear, the stakes are high. This is an organization that brings in enough revenue to pale by comparison any procurement officer" at the Defense Department. We won't take a position on Issa's larger points about how well MMS is protecting the interests of the American taxpayer or whether a conflict of interest exists, since those are matters of opinion. But we do think it's worthwhile looking at whether Issa's right that the money flowing into MMS represents the second-largest stream of federal income behind tax revenue collected by the Internal Revenue Service. First, let's look at how much money MMS brings in. For the most recent year -- 2009 -- MMS says it received $7.6 billion in combined royalties for oil, natural gas and coal, plus roughly $2.3 billion more in other revenues, for a total of $9.9 billion. Because of accounting quirks, figuring out which other non-IRS revenue streams are bigger than that is trickier, but we did find a number of revenue sources collected by agencies other than IRS that seemed to qualify: • Deposit of earnings from the Federal Reserve System (deposited by the Fed): $34.3 billion • Alcohol and tobacco taxes (collected by the Treasury Deptartment's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau): $22.7 billion • Customs duties (collected by Customs and Border Protection): $21.3 billion • Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insurance premiums and recoveries (collected by the FDIC): $20.5 billion • Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund (collected by the Commerce Department): $16.7 billion • Energy sales by the Tennessee Valley Authority (collected by TVA): $11.1 billion This would rank MMS no higher than eighth among entities generating revenue for the government. Some experts we talked to suggested a few other revenue sources, but others disagreed, so we've erred on the side of caution and left them out of our rankings. These include stamps and other fees collected by the U.S. Postal Service ($69 billion) and Medicare premiums, which are withheld from checks cut by the Social Security Administration ($57 billion). Because the volatile pricetag of oil can affect the size of the government's lease revenues, we also looked at MMS figures for 2008, when oil prices were at historical highs. In 2008, MMS collected a substantially larger amount -- $24.1 billion. But that was still exceeded by two other revenue streams beyond the IRS -- $33.6 billion from the Fed and $26 billion in customs duties collected by CBP. So while MMS ranked higher in 2008 -- fourth rather than eighth -- it still wasn't as high as the second-place Issa ascribed to it. Just to cover our bases, we also checked to see whether mineral revenues have grown as a share of federal receipts in recent years. As expected, they reached their peak in 2008 with just under 1 percent of federal receipts. But other than that year, the percentage has bounced around in a pretty narrow range since 2001, between 0.31 percent and 0.53 percent. A spokesman for Issa, Frederick R. Hill, argued forcefully that Issa was on solid ground. One point Hill made is that Issa "was referring to net, not gross, revenues that MMS contributes to the federal budget." In other words, Issa was pointing out that MMS delivered the federal government's second-largest haul of income after substracting operational costs. In our view, that kind of calculation refers to what economists consider "profit," rather than "revenues," which is the word that Issa clearly used. Still, we decided to see what the numbers were when calculated under those rules. According to the Treasury Department, the operational costs for MMS in 2009 were $163 million. So, the margin at MMS was indeed extremely high -- about 98 percent after expenses -- and the net amount collected was about $9.7 billion. It's true that TVA's operational costs wiped out essentially all of its $11.1 billion in energy sales. But several of the other agencies on our list produced margins and revenues that were just as impressive as MMS's. (While budget quirks make it tricky to craft fair comparisons, we'll do our best. ) Operational expenses at the Fed were $367 million, meaning a 99 percent margin and almost $34 billion collected for the government. Meanwhile, it cost $99 million to run the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau, producing a 99 percent margin and $22 billion collected. The costs of collecting trade duties is complicated, since duty collection is only one part of the job done by CBP, a $12 billion agency. We made an estimate by combining the budget lines for CBP's administrative operations and its "border security inspections and trade facilitation at ports of entry" -- an amount that worked out to $3.9 billion in 2009. That would make CBP's margin 82 percent and its total collections $17.4 billion. Even if that cost estimate is low, it's still comfortably above the amount MMS contributed. Another point Hill made was that some of the other revenue producers did not generate income for general government use but rather to foot the bill for specific uses. On that he's correct -- for instance, the FDIC uses its money to insure banks, and much of the television money is earmarked for digital converter box coupons and interoperable communications equipment grants for first-responders. But a large chunk of MMS's money is spoken for as well. By statute, portions must be distributed to neighboring states, conservation trust funds and Indian tribes. Only about $5.7 billion actually made it to the federal treasury for general purposes in 2009 -- an amount that, if we were to use it instead of the $9.9 billion figure, would push MMS even further down the list of revenue producers for the federal government. We'll grant Issa that this is a complicated fact to hash out during a rapid-fire interview, and we think any error he made in offering this factoid doesn't necessarily undermine his broader argument. We'd go so far as to suggest that Issa would have been perfectly on target if he'd simply said that MMS is "one of the largest" revenue sources to the federal government after the IRS. But he added more specificity than the facts justify. So we rate his statement False.	None	Darrell Issa	None	None	None	2010-05-06T14:59:58	2010-05-04	['None']
pomt-09471	"He (Obama) has done several things well. Most of those things are places where he changed his view from where he had during the campaign. So, for instance, he's left our troops in Iraq and they're being more successful there. He boosted our effort in Afghanistan, which is the right course to take. He did not close Guantanamo, thank heavens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/02/mitt-romney/romney-claims-obamas-actions-iraq-afghanistan-and-/	In his recently released book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney unloads on President Barack Obama. So on the Today Show on March 2, 2010, host Matt Lauer opened up his interview of Romney by asking if Obama has done anything right in the last year. "No question about it," Romney said. "He's done several things well. Most of those things are places where he changed his view from where he had during the campaign. So, for instance, he's left our troops in Iraq, and they're being more successful there. He boosted our effort in Afghanistan, which is the right course to take. He did not close Guantanamo, thank heavens." That's about as backhanded a compliment as you can give. Romney says the things Obama has done right are essentially all things he has changed position on since the presidential campaign. Has he? We'll tackle these one by one. First: Troop levels in Iraq Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for Romney, noted that during the campaign, Obama routinely claimed the controversial troop surge in Iraq was a failure. For example, in a July 17, 2007, interview with USA Today, Obama said, "Here's my view on the situation. There are two indisputable facts, and then there's a choice. Fact No. 1: The surge is not working. It has not changed the dynamics on the ground. It has put more U.S. troops at risk. It has not strengthened the Iraqi government. It has not quelled the antagonism between the various factions, and it has not lessened the strength of the insurgency." But Obama never said he would immediately pull all of the U.S. troops out of Iraq. To the contrary, Obama said in that very same interview that he would withdraw troops "in a gradual fashion." As for how quickly the troops should leave, Obama's campaign Web site said: "Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, for example, Obama said, "As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed." Obama also stressed repeatedly that he would strongly consider the recommendations of his commanders on the ground before removing any troops. So that was Obama's position in the campaign. Now, what has he done as president? As it turns out, the drawdown of troops actually began before Obama took office. President George W. Bush began to reduce troop levels in June 2008, a full six months before Obama was sworn in. But Obama has continued on that path of reducing troop levels. When Obama took office, the troop level in Iraq was about 137,000. It has steadily declined to its current level of 96,000, said Maj. Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the Department of Defense. In a formal announcement of a new Iraq strategy at Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps base in North Carolina, on Feb. 27, 2009, Obama said the United States will remove all combat troops from Iraq by Aug. 31, 2010. Obama said he planned to keep 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel in Iraq through 2011 for the purpose of "training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain nonsectarian; conducting targeted counterterrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq." Not only is the plan to remove combat troops on schedule, it's actually ahead of schedule, U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno said at a Pentagon press conference on Feb. 22, 2010. "The original plan had us to be at about 115,000 today, and right now we're at 96(,000)," Odierno said. "So we're about 20,000 ahead of where we thought we would be when we originally built the plan, and that's based on what we've seen and what we think we need." Michael O'Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said that with regard to Obama's stance on Iraq, he would "tend to agree with Gov. Romney to an extent -- though even here, it must be acknowledged, the plan that Obama inherited (and yes we're still on target) reduces forces reasonably fast. So in that regard, President Bush adopted a plan at the end of his presidency that pushed for fairly fast troop reductions -- not as fast as Obama proposed, but faster than had been expected. In other words, while Obama did change his thinking, the situation also evolved and made Obama's plan appear less radical and less different from Bush's than it once had." When Romney said Obama had changed positions from his campaign because he's "left our troops in Iraq, and they're being more successful there," it presumes that Obama said in the campaign that he would immediately remove combat troops, or that he would remove them faster than he has. We don't think that's backed up in Obama's campaign statements. The repeated mantra of Obama's campaign regarding Iraq was largely that he would initiate a drawdown of combat forces in Iraq within about 16 months. The plan to remove forces by the end of August is a couple of months past that deadline, but it's awfully close. And now, Gen. Odierno says the withdrawal plan is even a little ahead of schedule. We think it's unfair to suggest that Obama's actions as president radically depart from his position during the campaign. Second: Boosting the effort in Afghanistan To back up Romney's claim that Obama has changed his view on Afghanistan, Romney's spokesman Fehrnstrom pointed to a quote Obama gave to McClatchy News Service on July 26, 2008. "I'm not here to lay out a comprehensive military strategy," Obama said regarding Afghanistan. "That's the job of our commanders on the ground. I can tell you what our strategic goals should be. They should be relatively modest. We shouldn't want to take over the country. We should want to get out of there as quickly as we can and help the Afghans govern themselves and provide for their own security." We note that the quote continues: "Our critical goal should be to make sure that the Taliban and al-Qaida are routed and that they cannot project threats against us from that region. And to do that, I think we need more troops." As a candidate, Obama promised to send "at least" two additional brigades to Afghanistan. And he repeatedly said during the campaign that Afghanistan required more troops and attention than it was receiving from the Bush administration. He said the United States "had taken our eye off the ball" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan. At one point, the Obama campaign even mocked the McCain campaign for following Obama's lead on increasing troop levels in Afghanistan. Shortly after becoming president, Obama did, indeed, order that two additional brigades be sent to Afghanistan. And then on Dec. 1, 2009, Obama ordered an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. In January 2009, the troop level in Afghanistan was 34,000. Today, it's 78,000. Yes, Obama once said that strategic goals in Afghanistan should be "relatively modest," but to say that Obama's orders for more troops as president is a change in position from his campaign stance ignores Obama's many statements that more troops were needed and that greater focus needed to be placed on Afghanistan. "Obama had always pledged to do more, and now he has tripled forces relative to what President Bush had in place at the end of 2008," O'Hanlon said. Third: Closing Guantanamo Here, Romney's spokesman Fehrnstrom pointed to an executive order Obama signed on his second day in office, directing the Central Intelligence Agency to shut what remains of its network of secret prisons and ordering the closing of the Guantánamo detention camp in Cuba within a year. Soon after, however, Obama's plan began to meet resistance, most notably from members of his own party who stripped millions of dollars to shutter the facility from a war funding bill. Finding a place to put the more than 200 detainees has remained an ongoing political struggle. The self-imposed year deadline came and went, and the facility is still very much open. So is this a departure from Obama's campaign stance, as Romney said? Actually no. During the campaign, Obama never talked about a one-year timeline. He only said he would close the facility. The one-year timeline surfaced after Obama was sworn in as president. And the Obama administration certainly has made progress toward its ultimate goal of closing Guantanamo. On Oct. 15, 2009, the House of Representatives voted to allow some prisoners there to be temporarily transferred to the United States for prosecution. And the Obama administration has identified a prison in Thomson, Ill., that it hopes to acquire and renovate for detainees now at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Officials are working out details for funding the plan. The Senate seems amenable to the idea; in November, the Senate rejected a measure to restrict funds for the facility. There's still a long way to go before the facility is closed, but we think Obama has made enough progress that we have rated his campaign promise to close the facility In the Works. So to sum up, while Romney offered backhanded praise for Obama's actions with regard to troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the failure to close Guantanamo, Romeny said those were all issues on which Obama changed his view from the campaign. We don't find that's accurate in any of the cases. In fact, Obama has not strayed very far from the views he expressed during the campaign. We rule Romney's statement False.

pomt-07149	An amendment inserted by lawmakers into the state budget "exempts scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/14/wisconsin-humane-society/wisconsin-humane-society-says-state-budget-amendme/	When key state legislators approved a multifaceted amendment to cut the budget and make other high-profile changes to the University of Wisconsin System on June 3, 2011, little attention was paid to item number 27. Labeled "Liability Protections for Scientific Researchers," the amendment dealt with changes in the state statute regarding "crimes against animals." About a week later, the Wisconsin Humane Society urged its supporters to protest the move, which university researchers said was necessary to protect vital research from the chilling effect of possible lawsuits or criminal prosecutions urged by animal-rights activists. In a news release on June 13, 2011, the Humane Society said the state legislation would "exempt scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws." "Wisconsin law already exempts bona fide scientific researchers from the statutes prohibiting animal mistreatment … and poisoning," the group’s executive director Anne Reed wrote. "The budget bill amendment is broader and would exempt researchers from the entirety of Chapter 951, the criminal laws relating to animal cruelty." That’s a provocative claim about an apparently major change in state law -- and one that was inserted without public hearing or discussion into a lengthy budget bill. That’s right up our alley. First, a bit of background about the legislation. It grew, in part, out of university concerns about legal liability for researchers in the wake of criminal investigations into the use of sheep and mice in experiments, said Eric Sandgren, director of the UW Research Animal Resources Center. For three decades, UW-Madison used sheep in U.S. Navy-funded experiments related to decompression sickness in divers, Sandgren said. The sheep are euthanized at the end of the experiments. In 2009, Dane County District Attorney Brian Blanchard found that UW-Madison researchers violated the crimes against animals law. He declined to prosecute, saying it was not intentional or negligent. In 2010, the Alliance for Animals and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) went to court seeking criminal charges against UW officials in connection with 26 sheep that died as a result of decompression experiments, the Madison Capital Times reported. In that case, a Madison special prosecutor appointed by a judge in May 2011 determined university employees broke no laws, but he "scolded university officials for not having a better system in place for keeping track of state and federal laws," the Capital Times reported. All right, let’s examine the proposed changes. To back up her claim that the budget amendment would exempt researchers from the whole criminal statute, Reed pointed to the proposed amendment approved on June 3 by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. The committee did the preliminary work on the budget, which then went to the Assembly and Senate. The bill markup document creates a new section in Chapter 951, the criminal statute that deals with dognapping, decompression, instigation of fights between animals, nutrition for confined animals and other acts. Under the amendment, the statute would read: "This chapter does not apply to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation at an educational or research institution or to an animal that is being used for research or experimentation that is regulated under (federal laws)." The change, as proposed, affects state criminal prohibitions on animal cruelty written into the statutes decades ago. That sounds sweeping, and, indeed, it is accurate to say that the amendment would exempt university researchers from the state statute providing criminal penalties for animal cruelty, Sandgren said. Sandgren defends the proposal and says it will not lead to more abuse. He points to a federal law, the Animal Welfare Act, that is enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture. That law, another federal law, and UW’s own ethical standards, are enough to keep research within legal standards, Sandgren and other supporters of the change contend. One co-sponsor of the multifaceted budget amendment for the university system, Rep. Patricia Strachota (R-West Bend), said a coalition of bioscience researchers sought the liability protection. A Medical College of Wisconsin spokesman said the members of the statewide coalition addressing the issue are: BioForward, Covance, the Medical College of Wisconsin, UW Health, UW Madison, UW System, Wisconsin Alumni Association, and Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. The proposed change "removes the cloud of criminal prosecutions" for bona fide researchers, said Medical College spokesman Richard Katschke. Reed says that is one cause for concern, among several. She said the federal law was not as meaningful, because local district attorneys would be more inclined to listen to complaints than federal authorities. "That’s why we have state statutes," Reed said. Reed also pointed out a potential loophole in the amendment language. While the intent of the budget amendment appeared to be to exempt only bona fide research at educational/research institutions, we found the actual language in the bill markup does not make that distinction. Strachota said legislators were planning to clean up the language to make it clear that only public educational institutions would be exempt. One more issue before we take stock. Sandgren took issue with the wording of a Humane Society e-mail alert to its supporters that said the proposed change means researchers "can do anything without worrying about any legal protections for animals at all." That e-mail alert did not make it explicitly clear, Reed acknowledged, that the society was talking about state legal protections. But the news release published by the group, as well as its website, covered that point. How does it all stack up? The Wisconsin Humane Society says a proposed state statute change will exempt researchers from all the state’s criminal prohibitions against animal cruelty. There’s disagreement about the real-world impact of the change, but the exemption itself is clear. The disagreement is related to federal laws and ethical standards, which would not be affected -- and were not mentioned by the group. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06179	Says with Jon Corzine, "it's the first time, I think, in history where a former Senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/14/pat-roberts/pat-roberts-claims-jon-corzine-first-former-senato/	One lawmaker claims Jon Corzine made history this week on Capitol Hill. But not by choice. The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to compel Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to testify Tuesday about the collapse of MF Global, the investment firm he headed. Sen. Pat Roberts, the committee’s ranking member, said subpoenaing Corzine was an unprecedented measure. "It's the first time, I think, in history where a former senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues," Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said in an interview on Fox Business News on Dec. 6, when the Senate committee voted to compel Corzine to testify. During last week’s vote, Roberts said that "based on consultations with the Senate historian’s office, it is also unclear if any former member of the Senate has been compelled to testify before a Senate committee. It is our understanding that such action could be a first." We checked with the Senate historian’s office and found that, as far as they know, Roberts is right. Former senators have been forced to testify before a House committee, but Corzine is the first former senator known to be subpoenaed by a Senate committee. Corzine served as the chairman and CEO of MF Global, which went bankrupt this fall. During the company’s collapse, as much as $1.2 billion in client money disappeared. Katherine Scott, an assistant historian at the U.S. Senate Historical Office, noted limits to definitively identifying former senators subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees. "Subpoena documents are kept with committee files at the National Archives. Hearing transcripts were not methodically collected prior to the early 20th century," she said in an email. However, the Senate historian’s office found one instance where two former senators were forced to testify before a House committee. In 1908, Matthew Butler of South Carolina and Marion Butler of North Carolina were subpoenaed and testified before a House committee investigating the lobbying tactics of the Electric Boat Company of New Jersey and their predecessors, the Holland Boat Company. The two former senators, who were not related, denied any wrongdoing in their work with the companies, which built submarines, and no charges were brought against the former lawmakers. So that’s an example of former senators being forced to testify before a House committee. But as far as the U.S. Senate Historical Office knows, Corzine is the first senator subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee. But Terry Madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said Corzine won’t be the last. "The Senate to be sure is very precedent driven--so once this precedent has been established, you can bet it won't be the last time it will happen," he said. But he also noted that the MF Global issue is "unusually salient because of the heightened interest in the actions of the investment community in general and Wall Street in particular." Our ruling Roberts claimed that Jon Corzine is the first former senator to be "subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues." Corzine is the first senator to be compelled to testify before Congress in more than 100 years. And as far as Senate historian’s office knows, he’s the first to be subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee. Based on that information, we rate Roberts’ statement True.

pomt-05103	"Austin is the biggest city in America with a Tier One research university (UT-Austin) but without a medical school."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/29/austin-fund-quality-healthcare/austin-group-says-austin-biggest-city-america-tier/	A group that wants the University of Texas to have an Austin-based medical school floated a three-part claim in a mailer we spotted June 20, 2012: "Austin is the biggest city in America with a Tier One research university (UT-Austin) but without a medical school." We know UT is a premier research university. And Austin lacks a medical school within its city limits. We also know that the Texas A&M University Health Science Center College of Medicine provides clinical training to third- and fourth-year medical students out of Round Rock, just north of Austin. We asked the Austin Fund for Quality Healthcare to flesh out its claim. Spokeswoman Monica Walters Crowley pointed us to results from the 2010 U.S. census indicating that among the nation’s "most populous" places that year, Austin, with 790,390 residents, ranked 14th. By email, Crowley said that among the 13 more populous places -- including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, Indianapolis and San Francisco -- only San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville, Fla., lacked medical schools, and neither city is home to a "Tier One" university. We checked all the bigger cities against information posted online by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which lists 137 accredited U.S. medical schools. And per the association’s list, San Jose and Jacksonville are the only cities more populous than Austin and lacking a medical school. By our count, 11 of 13 cities more populous than Austin account for more than 20 medical schools. Crowley said that neither San Jose nor Jacksonville is home to a "Tier One" research university. And what defines a "Tier One" research university? In her email, Crowley pointed out the 61 member schools of the Association of American Universities, which says it chooses members "based on the high quality of programs of academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education in a number of fields, as well as general recognition that a university is outstanding by reason of the excellence of its research and education programs." From Texas, AAU members include UT, Texas A&M University and Rice University. In a telephone interview, though, AAU spokesman Barry Toiv said that in exploring how to define "Tier One" universities, he would defer to a list of 108 doctorate-granting universities with "very high research" activity as designated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which traces its classification of colleges and universities to work by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. No universities in Jacksonville or San Jose showed up either among the AAU’s members or on the Carnegie list, which also revealed no cities bigger than Austin with a high-research university and lacking a medical school. (From Texas, UT, Texas A&M, Rice and the University of Houston are among the high-research institutions.) Finally, we wondered if this uniquely Austin claim holds up if we go beyond the city limits and compare the greater Austin area to similar, more sprawling areas, taking into account institutions in bedroom communities just outside each city’s immediate boundaries. Drawing from the Census Bureau website, we pulled down 2011 population rankings of the country’s biggest metropolitan statistical areas. By this measure, the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area ranked 34th that year, with nearly 1.8 million residents. When we asked Crowley about this broader comparison, she replied that the punch line remains the same. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area is "still the largest that has an AAU-listed, Tier 1 research university and that lacks a four-year medical school," she said by email. "The only MSAs larger than us without four-year medical schools are Las Vegas and Charlotte, and neither has a Tier 1 research university designation." That checked out — so long as the Texas A&M program at Round Rock is overlooked. It is not a "four-year medical school" as Crowley said, and instead serves 80 third- and fourth-year medical students. According to a May 20, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, A&M officials hope to expand its offerings on that campus to students in all four years of medical school, though how soon that happens remains unclear. If those hopes gel, there will stands to be a full-fledged medical school in the greater Austin area. Crowley agreed Texas A&M would like to eventually have a stand-alone medical school. She noted too by email that third- and fourth-year students enrolled at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston are receiving clinical training at Austin’s University Medical Center Brackenridge, "but that does not mean that there is a medical school in Austin." By telephone, Adrienne Lallo, spokeswoman for the Seton Health Care Family, which operates Brackenridge and other Central Texas hospitals, said students from UTMB and residents from UT Southwestern Medical School in Dallas train in Austin. Our ruling The claim that Austin is the biggest U.S. city home to a top-flight research university but lacking a medical school holds up. Still, Texas A&M hopes to make its nearby medical college into a full-fledged medical school. That information is missing from the statement, which we rate Mostly True.

pomt-11900	Says Tampa Bay Lightning hockey player J.T. Brown was "fired after raising fist during national anthem."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/23/blog-posting/fake-news-tampa-bay-lightning-fires-black-player-f/	We can’t say exactly how many living, breathing people believed the article that the Tampa Bay Lightning fired hockey forward J.T. Brown, but whether it was humans or bots, they shared the story more than 20,000 times. That was enough to flag it on Facebook’s fake news list. A website called Conservative7.com ran a story with the headline, "Black hockey player fired after raising fist during national anthem," on Oct. 10. It was a copy and paste job from a site called FreedomJunkshun.com, which first ran the story on Oct. 9. FreedomJunkshun.com is part of a group of sites run by liberal trolls who write absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservatives. The site runs the disclaimer that it "uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth." The warning goes on to say, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." That nuance got lost in translation. According to the story, "J.T. Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the ‘hate our troops’ bandwagon and made a ‘black power’ fist," as the national anthem played before a game. The result was swift, the article continued. The team owner, "Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown." What’s true here is that Brown did raise his fist before a Sept. 28 game against the Florida Panthers. Beyond that, the article is pure invention. Brown told the Tampa Bay Times that after a lot of discussion with friends in the military, teammates and coaches, he "wanted to show my support for the root of the protest, talking about police brutality and inequality." During the game, the Lightning released a statement, "The Tampa Bay Lightning celebrate the moment before every game when we can unite as a community, paying homage to a flag that is representative of our nation and those who have sacrificed. At the same time, we respect our players and individual choices they may make on social and political issues." In another bit of fantasy, the team owner is Jeff Vinik, not Burt Lancaster, a name more tied to Hollywood than hockey. Lastly, we checked the team roster . Brown is still on it. Brown was a healthy scratch for the Lightning’s last game, Saturday against Pittsburgh. Brown hasn't played since Oct. 7. But that likely has more to do with him being the 12th/13th forward on a team that has typically played just 11. Brown has said that he will not continue his protest, "I am done raising my fist during the national anthem. I am now using this support, opportunity and platform to call out everyone who agreed or disagreed with me to help by sharing suggestions, continuing respectful conversations and looking for ways that they, too, can make a difference in the community." Our ruling A fake news site said the Tampa Bay Lightning fired Brown, an African-American player, after he raised his fist during the national anthem. Brown did raise his fist, but he wasn’t fired. The story originated with a site that says it presents fiction as truth. The people who shared that article and the other websites that copied it ignored that warning.

pomt-04272	Says that "Tennessee law requires that schools receive half of proceeds -- $31 million per year" -- from a half-cent increase in the Shelby County sales tax.	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/04/stand-children-tennessee/schools-must-get-half-proceeds-county-sales-tax-in/	Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children. We've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True). In this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase. Stand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board. Opponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax. Stand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. "Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids" reads one line, and another claims the revenue "will make our schools better." Both are clearly opinions. Stand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K "promise," and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it. Stand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools. That's the claim we are examining here. When we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, "Distribution of revenue" under the "The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act."Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute. It deals with the local option sales tax and very plainly states that "one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed." It also says that the the proceeds can be pledged "to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness" but doing so requires the approval of the local school board. Estimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23 million is expected to flow to Memphis. One core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate. Opposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns. Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation. Our ruling There is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters. On one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools. The statute is definitive and the claim is True.

pomt-07959	Says the Defense Department shrink-wrapped $10.8 billion in American money, loaded it on 175 pallets and put it on a transport plane to Iraq where they passed out $100 bills and no one has any receipts.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-shrink-wrapped-cash-iraq-/	Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich blasts the Iraq war every chance he gets. With Republicans promising budget cuts now that they’ve taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, it’s not surprising what’s at the top of Kucinich’s list of potential trims. "To meet your stated purpose of protecting American taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse, it is essential that you examine the Department of Defense and money wasted during unnecessary wars," Kucinich said in a Jan. 4 letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican. Kucinich has also taken to television to make his case for Defense Department cuts. He alleged outrageous abuses during a Jan. 6 interview with Fox News anchor Jon Scott. "Listen, when you can have a Defense Department that can shrink wrap $10.8 billion in American money, load it on 175 pallets and put it on a, on a transport plane and ship it to Iraq where they pass out $100 bills and no one has any receipts, when you know that kind of waste is going on, . . . we have concerns in this country that we have to start taking care of, and it's important that we track the misspending that's going on through the Department of Defense so that we can keep that money for the things we need at home," Kucinich said. We thought it would be worth investigating Kucinich’s claim that the Pentagon loaded billions of shrink-wrapped U.S. dollars onto transport planes and flew them to Iraq, where these $100 bills were dispensed out without receipts. Kucinich spokesman Nathan White said his boss’ claim stemmed from a February 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing conducted by the committee’s then-chairman, Henry Waxman of California, which examined massive shipments of U.S. currency to Iraq as part of the war effort. A transcript of that hearing indicates the money at issue consisted of nearly $12 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve (not the Defense Department) sent to Iraq on C-130 cargo planes, mainly in shrink-wrapped packages of $100 bills, between May 2003 and June 2004. The money wasn’t U.S. tax dollars – it came from Iraqi oil sales that were put in a development fund for the Iraqi people. It was sent in cash because no banks or financial system existed in Iraq immediately after the U.S. occupation. Some of the money was used to stabilize the country by launching large public works programs to create jobs. Much of it was given to Iraqi ministries to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi civil servants who hadn’t had a paycheck since before the war. Although the Iraqi ministries lacked good payroll records, former Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer told the committee that delaying their payments until better records were available would have been "demoralizing and unfair" to millions of Iraqi families, and "might well have exacerbated danger to the American soldiers on the ground." "Under Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government had been by far the country’s largest employer, providing about four out of five of all jobs," Bremer testified. "But for several months, since before the war, millions of Iraqi families had not received money owed them for civil service, salaries or pensions." Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who was charged with auditing money sent to Iraq for reconstruction, told the committee that more should have been done to track how the money was spent. His auditors said nearly $9 billion was improperly accounted for. In a recent interview, he stressed that his findings didn’t mean all that money was used improperly, although his office found cases of graft that totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. He said 44 people have been convicted of crimes uncovered by his office. "There were weak controls that made the money susceptible to waste and abuse," said Bowen. "The money was given to these interim Iraqi ministries who spent it and used it as they chose. The fact that it was Iraqi money didn’t in any way diminish our duty to make sure we carried out our fiduciary responsibilities. It was not well managed and not well accounted for." Bowen’s office released an audit last year that found inadequate accounting for $8.7 billion of another $9.1 billion in subsequent shipments of Iraqi cash that the Defense Department sent to Iraq after January 2004. It found several cases of bribery, fraud and money laundering by U.S. officials that resulted in eight criminal convictions and $7.8 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution payments, the report said. Kucinich’s spokesman did not respond to questions asking why Kucinich told Fox that $10.8 billion was at issue, when $12 billion was the amount discussed by Waxman’s committee. Bowen said he wasn’t familiar with any cases where $10.8 billion were shipped to Iraq on 175 pallets, as Kucinich claimed, though he applauded Kucinich’s advocacy for effective Iraq oversight. "He is one of the reasons why the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has been able to succeed in the last seven years of work," Bowen said of Kucinich. Kucinich is off-base in his tally of dollars sent to Iraq. He is correct, though, that it was shipped mainly as shrink-wrapped bundles of $100 bills and that the U.S. shipped immense amounts of cash to Iraq without properly overseeing its disposition. More significantly, the money he cited in his example was from Iraqi oil sales and belonged to the Iraqi people. That’s a critical fact that could easily give the listener a different impression. Pentagon spending may be a legitimate place to look for budget cuts, but money misspent from this source could not be used "for the things we need at home." For these reasons, we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08730	Charlie Crist's "personal approval numbers are plummeting."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/01/steven-schale/top-democrat-operative-claims-charlie-crists-poll-/	The man who ran President Barack Obama's successful presidential campaign in Florida has crunched the numbers in the state's high-profile U.S. Senate race and come up with a bold prediction: Charlie Crist, the state's governor and a no-party candidate, will not win. In a blog post published Aug. 31, 2010, Democratic operative Steven Schale said Marco Rubio is amassing enough of the Republican vote to keep Crist out of the U.S. Senate. But that's not Crist's biggest hurdle, Schale wrote. "The bigger problem is (Crist) is falling into the same place as many other long time office holders: his personal approval numbers are plummeting," wrote Schale, who is supporting but not working for Democrat Kendrick Meek. "He no longer has that deep well of cross party lines personal support built up that allows him to transcend normal political divides. Instead, he now has to block and tackle like everyone else. In this political environment, absent some significant and unfortunate event that would thrust him back into the spotlight, the odds of him finding 15-20 points of political approval in the next nine weeks are slim, at best." Schale's message has been spread by both Democrats and Republicans on the Internet. We wanted to see if it was true. Are Crist's personal approval ratings plummeting? Looking at the polls Pollsters measure Crist's performance two ways -- his job approval rating (approve or disapprove) and his personal favorable rating (favorable or unfavorable). The website Pollster.com accumulates the polls of several organizations, plots their results on a graph, and keeps a rolling average. It has tracked Crist's personal favorable rating since October 2008 and his job approval numbers since September 2008. This is the polling site Schale sent to us to back up his claim. A crude examination of responses to both questions shows that Crist is receiving less support. Take a look at both Pollster.com graphs. About 60 percent of voters approved of Crist's job performance in September 2008. The percentage remained relatively unchanged until June 2009 when Crist's job approval rating began to decline. Polls bottomed out at a little over 50 percent in February 2010, before rebounding slightly. The most recent polls have Crist's approval number closer to 55 percent with disapproval numbers in the high 30s or low 40s, depending on the specific poll. (If you click on the poll below, you'll go to Pollster.com, where you can create graphs by individual polling group). Crist's favorable/unfavorable rating has fewer poll samples to examine. The Pollster.com aggregation shows a slow, but steady decline since October 2008. Polls in late 2008 had Crist's favorables in the high 60s where most polls now put Crist's favorable rating in the low to mid 50s. We're not sure either result constitutes plummeting. In fact, opinions of Crist haven't really changed that much in eight months, according to the Pollster.com trend lines. Merriam-Webster defines plummet as to fall perpendicularly or to drop sharply and abruptly. That said, a more detailed examination of the polls that make up Pollster.com shows a bigger problem with making generalizations about the data. Quinnipiac, for instance, has polled Crist's favorable rating 12 times since late 2008. Crist peaked at 68 percent favorable in a February 2009 Q poll before dropping to 48 percent favorable in early April 2010. But his favorable rating has in fact rebounded some, and sits at 53 percent according to Quinnipiac's most recent poll. What happened between the bottom in April and now? Crist left the Republican Party. Quinnipiac's job approval ratings mirror the same pattern -- started in 2008 at 61 percent, bottomed out in April 2010 at 49 percent, but rebounded to 56 percent by August. That's just a 5 percentage point drop -- from a poll with a 3 percent margin of error -- in almost two years. In both cases Crist's numbers are lower than were they were two years ago, but also higher than they were four months ago. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, a group that polls nationwide, said Crist's personal numbers are very strong. "A 56 percent job approval rating, in this economy, for a sitting governor, is very good," said Brown, who then launched into a comparison with Ohio Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. Strickland, who is running for re-election, has a job approval rating around 41 percent, with more people disapproving of his time in office. And more people have an unfavorable opinion of him than a favorable one. "Here's my point. If Charlie Crist is getting more Democrats than Kendrick Meek, Charlie Crist is very likely to be the next senator from Florida," Brown said. "And he is (getting more Democrats) in our latest poll." Now take the Rasmussen polls, which show big swings in favorable/unfavorable ratings of Crist. In March 2010, Crist had a 49 percent favorable rating, and a 48 percent unfavorable rating. In Rasmussen's last poll in July, his numbers had dramatically improved. Rasmussen reported a favorable rating of 69 percent, Crist's highest rating in any poll since October 2008 and the highest ever rating for Crist in a Rasmussen poll. For the record, the same Rasmussen poll had Rubio slightly ahead of Crist in a three-way Senate race, with Meek a distant third. Ipsos, which conducted polling for the St. Petersburg Times, Miami Herald, Bay News 9 and Central Florida News 13, in May and August, said Crist's job approval rating has remained steady at a little over 50 percent. That "is pretty decent considering the amount of time he's been in office and his decision to leave his party," said Julia Clark with Ipsos. In its poll, Ipsos also asked voters whether Crist's decision to leave the Republican Party and run as an independent made people more or less likely to vote for him. About one in five, 22 percent, say it made them more likely to vote for him, and the same proportion, 21 percent, say it made them less likely to vote for him. Half, 49 percent, say it hasn't changed their view. Our ruling Bottom line, polls are numbers and depending on what poll you're looking at and what time period you're examining, you can reach different but defendable positions. Rasmussen had Crist's job approval rating at nearly 70 percent in July, the second highest it's ever been. Quinnipiac polled Crist's job approval rating down 5 percentage points since 2008. The polling group found that Crist's favorable rating, meanwhile, dropped a total of 20 points from 2008 to 2009, before bouncing back. Schale said Crist's personal approval numbers are "plummeting." Pollster.com's tracking of several polls starting in October 2008 shows that Crist's favorable rating has declined among voters from around 70 percent, to between 50 and 55 percent. But Crist's position in voters' minds hasn't changed all that much for most of 2010, and even has rebounded a little in some polls, according to the same figures. His job approval ratings, meanwhile, haven't changed all that much in nearly two years. And pollsters say his numbers remain solid. We rate Schale's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13287	"Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-confuses-eatn-park-its-famous-smiley-/	Like many candidates, Donald Trump has spent some parts of his campaign stopping by local food institutions in the places where he’s stumping. That means he got a cheesesteak from Geno’s in Philly and, true to Western PA form, he went to get a Smiley Cookie (yes, that’s the name of something, and it’s trademarked) while he was outside Pittsburgh this week. After Trump left town, a post appeared on his Facebook page: "Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy [Giuliani]." However, the popular chain of diners headquartered in Homestead outside Pittsburgh is actually not called Smiley Cookie, despite its most famous food offering. No, the chain is actually called "Eat’n Park." Sure, this isn’t about foreign or domestic policy. But it’s important to Pennsylvania, so we decided to check Trump’s claim of swinging by a place called "Smiley Cookie." The GOP presidential nominee held a rally at Ambridge Area High School about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh Monday, his first since coming under fire following the release of audio from 2005 of Trump’s using offensive language referring to women. Local TV station WPXI reported that after the rally had wrapped up, Trump and members of his campaign traveled to Moon Township, where they stopped at an Eat’n Park. Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top ally of the presidential nominee, reportedly bought a dozen Smiley Cookies while there. According to Eat’n Park’s corporate website, the establishment was founded in 1949 "as the first Pittsburgh-area drive-in with carhops." Today, it’s more like just a diner, but it has more than 65 locations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. The restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the most famous part is the bakery, where employees whip up pies, cakes and, of course, hand-frosted Smiley Cookies that are given to children who eat at the restaurant. They’re also available for purchase. Eat’n Park has been doling out the Smiley Cookies for the last 30 years, and the restaurant itself has become a western Pennsylvania institution of sorts, as it’s one of the only 24-hour joints still around. Some on social media reacted harshly to Trump’s mix-up, while others were more understanding. The Smiley Cookie is the most iconic part of Eat’n Park. Eat’n Park Hospitality Group and the Trump campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Our ruling Donald Trump posted on Facebook that he "Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy." We’ll leave deciding whether or not the cookies can be considered "great" to you. But this place is not called Smiley Cookie. It’s called Eat’n Park. And it has been called that for 67 years. The mix-up’s understandable, though, and Trump did purchase the Smiley Cookies in question. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/55743655-7a4a-4186-84f8-2fe48eadaa6d	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-11T10:59:16	2016-10-10	['None']
pomt-06913	"The average 401(k) in America of a person who's 60 years old is under $100,000."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/24/gina-raimondo/ri-treasurer-raimondo-says-60-year-olds-401ks-typi/	General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been leading the drive to overhaul the retirement system for public employees -- with its $7.3-billion unfunded liability -- but has rebuffed calls from some critics to scrap the pension plan altogether. During an appearance on the July 10 edition of 10 News Conference, when reporter Jim Taricani asked her about the sustainability of the current system, she pointed out that without a pension program, most people are ill-equipped to deal with the financial challenge of retirement. The state's pension program, she said, "is clearly crushing the state with a debt we can't afford and that's why we have to fix it. It really is a crisis. Having said that, the average 401(k) in America of a person who's 60 years old is under $100,000, so that isn't retirement security either. I think we can maintain an element of defined benefit, an old-fashioned pension plan, but design it in a way that is sustainable and affordable." We wondered whether that's the real average for a typical 60-year-old with a 401(k). When we asked about the source of her comment, Raimondo's office sent us a lot of material on 401(k)s in general, but none of it was specific to 60-year-olds. As we looked for other data, we realized this would be a complex issue to analyze -- partly because of the difference between average and median. But we’ll get to that. For starters, some perspective: even having $100,000 in retirement savings isn't a lot. We did a quick calculation on Fidelity Investment's retirement planning website. Sixty-year-old workers making $50,000 a year who have $100,000 in a 401(k) will only have about half the money they need when they retire, even with Social Security and even if they're aggressively investing in stocks, the market stays strong and they're putting the maximum amount into their retirement savings plan. (For a 60-year-old, the maximum annual contribution limit is $22,000.) Michael Ryan, a former president of the Rhode Island Society of the Financial Planning Association, said retirees should only tap about 4 to 6 percent of their savings per year if they want their money to last. "A hundred thousand dollars is going to generate $4,000 to $6,000 a year," he said. "That's not an overwhelming amount of money to have saved for retirement, unfortunately." It's also important to talk about how 401(k) savings trends are often characterized. If you look at some data, it appears that the treasurer is wrong because the average account balance among people in their late 50s and early 60s is well above $100,000. For example, Fidelity Investments, which handles 401(k) plans for about 11 million people and bills itself as "the nation's No. 1 provider of workplace retirement savings plans," reports that during the first quarter of this year, the average balance for their 401(k) customers age 60 to 64 was $126,200, above the $100,000 cited by Raimondo. The nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, which has a database of 20.7 million 401(k) participants, reported that in 2009, the average balance for people in their 60s was $162,522. So, at first, it appears Raimondo is wrong because the correct amount seems to be considerably higher than $100,000. But Raimondo was talking about a typical individual who has a 401(k) plan, specifically a typical 60-year-old. For the typical 401(k) saver, the average is the wrong statistic to cite. A small number of people investing aggressively can skew the average upward. More relevant is the median balance -- how much the individual in the middle of the spectrum has saved. And that's a very, very different number. Consider the EBRI data for all age groups. While the average account balance at the end of 2009 was $59,381, the median amount -- representing how much was in the account of a typical 401(k) holder -- was just $17,794. So what are the numbers for 60-year-olds? Fidelity said that the median savings accumulated as of March 31 was $45,300 for ages 60 to 64. (Several people we spoke with emphasized that the median isn't the most accurate number either because it fails to account for people who have changed jobs in recent years and may have, as a result, taken 401(k) savings from past employment and rolled them over into IRAs. As a result, the actual amount saved by a typical worker can be significantly higher than the median numbers would suggest.) Alicia Munnell, a professor of management sciences at Boston College and coauthor of "Coming Up Short: The Challenge of 401(k) Plans," sent us to the Survey of Consumer Finances, done in 2007 by the Federal Reserve System, which tried to take IRA savings into account. That survey was before the recession but Munnell said the markets have rebounded enough that those numbers probably apply today. (The next SCF isn't due until next year.) That data, analyzed by Boston College's Center for Retirement Research, also suggests that Raimondo was overly optimistic. The typical 55- to 65-year-old had $78,000 set aside for retirement, but that included individual retirement accounts created when people leave a job and roll their 401(k) savings into an IRA. If you only look at the 401(k) savings, the typical 60ish person has about $60,000. "If someone is saying that people don't have a lot of money in these plans, that's right," said Munnell. Munnell, and others we interviewed, said they knew of no specific data on 60-year-olds. Raimondo's office cited Munnell's report on the Federal Reserve numbers when we asked for data to support the treasurer's claim. In summary, Raimondo said that "the average 401(k) in America of a person who's 60 years old is under $100,000." Her spokeswoman, Joy Fox, argued that because the savings rate is under $100,000, Raimondo’s statement would be True, even if the actual number was tens of thousands lower. Fox also said Raimondo's larger point is that "given how little the average 401(k) was worth, the defined contribution system did not provide retirement security" for state workers who, in the treasurer's words, "at the end of a hardworking career . . . ought to have security in retirement." That larger point is well taken. Give Raimondo points for not overstating the problem. But all the evidence we could find involving that age group suggests that the average account holder has saved about $60,000 or less in their 401(k)s, which is the plan the treasurer cited. For that reason, we believe her statement is "accurate but needs clarification or additional information," the definition of Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11326	"Pope Francis cancels the Bible and proposes to create a new book."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/11/everyday-devotional/its-fake-news-pope-cancelled-bible/	Has Pope Francis said that it’s time to ditch the Bible? Nope -- he still thinks the Bible is the good book. "Pope Francis cancels the Bible and proposes to create a new book," said a headline on the Everyday Devotional website, which says it reports the latest Christian news around the world. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. While the story that followed the headline warned against changing the Bible, it didn’t contain any information showing that Francis cancelled the Bible. The headline is the same as one about a week earlier by There Is News, which stated that Francis announced, "The Bible is totally outdated and needs a radical change, so The Bible is officially cancelled." The story said that a new book will replace the Bible, and one of the names under consideration is "Biblia 2000." There is News identifies itself as a humor website. Pope Francis has made a series of controversial statements about religion and social issues, but there is no evidence that he called for cancelling the Bible. In fact, in 2017, Francis called on people to consult the Bible as often as they look at their cell phones. "What would happen if we treated the Bible like we do our mobile phones? If we turned around to retrieve it when we forgot it? If we carried it with us always, even a small pocket version? If we read God’s messages in the Bible like we read messages on the mobile phone?" That sounds like a leader devoted to the Bible. We rate this statement Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Everyday Devotional	None	None	None	2018-04-11T14:25:44	2018-04-09	['None']
pomt-00871	Under legislation that has cleared the Georgia House, some children who are "legal refugees" could obtain state scholarships to attend private schools.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/13/associated-press/true-legislation-would-open-scholarship-program-le/	Georgia opened the door to private school vouchers in 2007, with a law aimed at parents who felt their disabled children weren’t being adequately served in public school. In the 2013-2014 school year, the families of about 3,400 disabled students received taxpayer-funded vouchers to help pay their children’s tuition to private schools. The vouchers, or scholarships, vary in amount based on the severity of the disability. The maximum last year was $12,803, just shy of what’s reported as the average tuition at private schools dedicated to teaching special needs students. Public school groups have been generally opposed to this program and the much costlier private-school tax credit. They argue that both programs undercut public education, a claim that supporters deny. The special needs scholarships are for students with disabilities, such as autism, blindness or a behavioral disorder. But an observant PolitiFact reader ealier this week saw House Bill 296, called PolitiFact and asked if it meant a major change to the special needs scholarship program was afoot. "It looks like the program is no longer just about helping handicapped kids," she said. "It looks like they want to give out scholarships so immigrant children who can’t speak English can attend private school. Can that be right?" PolitiFact Georgia decided to investigate. We found a five-paragraph story about the bill by The Associated Press. We also reached out to the authors of House Bill 296, which is pending in the Georgia General Assembly and would amend the special needs scholarship law. We heard back from the bill’s chief sponsor, state Rep. Randy Nix, R-LaGrange, who told us an estimated 700 school-age legal refugees could qualify under the legislation for scholarships to attend private school. "They are legal, and Georgia is obligated to educate them," Nix said. The highest concentrations of these students are in metro Atlanta, mainly in the Clarkston area of DeKalb County, he said. These students "create a significant problem for their schools," Nix said. "This bill is good for those schools that are struggling to deal with these students," he said. "It will be better for all concerned for them to attend a school which creates a learning environment more geared and welcoming to their unique needs." To qualify for a scholarship, a student will have to meet the definition of legal refugee under Title I of the Immigration and Nationalization Act, said Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education. The student will be required to have an I-94 clearance, with a refugee admission stamp, and be "limited-English proficient as defined in 20 U.S.C. Section 7801." Unlike other students in the special needs scholarship program, qualifying refugees will not be required to have individual education plans (IEPs) nor will they be required to attend public school in the prior school year. The original champions of the special needs scholarship program expressed surprise about the new bill when contacted Thursday by PolitiFact. "There is no school choice program in the country related to refugees," the Friedman Foundation for Education Choice, the legacy foundation of Nobel economist and school choice founder Milton Friedman, said in a statement. "We instead believe the one-year requirement to enroll in a public school to earn a scholarship should be removed for special needs students," said Susan Meyers, a spokeswoman for the organization."This effort argues in favor of a voucher for all children. If a child needs a different school, he or she should be able to choose no matter what their personal circumstances." The bill overwhelmingly passed the Georgia House on Monday and moves to the state Senate for consideration. The measure, which also would require approval of the governor to become law, "pays attention to some often-overlooked children – exceptional education students who are either children of immigrants or those learning to speak English," said Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators (PAGE). "That by itself is a positive since our legislators do not often look kindly on such students," Callahan said. He said the current group of political leaders are championing these students as "part of their not-very-hidden efforts to splinter the public schools via defunding and diversion of funding, ie. vouchers posing as ‘scholarships." "The irony is that across the nation schools of choice -- charters, magnets, etc. -- are frequently criticized for either not accepting these types of students because they are labor intensive and more costly to educate … or for accepting them but forcing them out eventually. So I guess it is a mixed blessing." Angela Palm, policy director for the Georgia School Boards Association, said she isn't sure of the goal. "From a state policy statement, it makes little sense to single out one group of limited English proficient as being eligible for this unless they are trying to make sure a public benefit is not being given to an illegal immigrant," Palm said. Currently, K-12 schools don't check a student's immigration status. But this bill requires that scholarship candidates prove they meet the definition of legal refugee under Title i provision. School boards generally oppose vouchers because they allow public money to go to private schools without the same transparency and accountability required when public money goes to public schools, Palm said. Gov. Nathan Deal has taken issue with the number of refugees in Georgia. Last July, he fired off a blistering letter to President Barack Obama, saying he was shocked to learn that federal authorities had transferred 1,154 unaccompanied immigrant children to the care of sponsors living in Georgia. The children were placed in Georgia early in the year by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement as the Obama administration grappled with a surge of Central American children illegally crossing the southwest border. Our conclusion: Legislation has cleared the Georgia House that would expand the list of students eligible for a private school scholarship program created in 2007. The scholarships are now offered in varying amounts to students with disabilities. The bill would open the program to about 700 legal refugees who are not proficient in English. We rate the statement True.	None	The Associated Press	None	None	None	2015-03-13T00:00:00	2015-03-09	['None']
pomt-02861	"On (the federal minimum wage of) $7.75, you can’t even make half the poverty level."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/15/jim-mcdermott/rep-jim-mcdermott-says-minimum-wage-job-doesnt-get/	A recent Gallup poll showed that an overwhelming 76 percent of Americans want the minimum wage increased to $9. There hasn’t been a minimum wage increase in four years, and the prospect of an increase -- particularly in the Republican-controlled House -- looks dim. But that hasn’t stopped advocates of a higher minimum wage from making their case. In a recent interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said that at its current level, the minimum wage is inadequate for making an acceptable living. "The minimum wage at the federal level has been frozen for four years at $7.75," he said on Nov. 12, 2013. "In the state of Washington, we’ve raised it to $9.15 and people there took it in their own hands and said, let’s go to $15 because people have gotten fed up with Washington, D.C. They don’t expect a thing to come out of Congress. … On $7.75 you can’t even make half the poverty level. You’ve got to have two jobs. You have to work 80 hours a week." We wondered: Is it true that if you are paid $7.75 an hour, "you can't even make half the poverty level?" First off, we need to correct one aspect of McDermott’s claim.While he’s right that the federal minimum wage has been static for the past four years, it’s $7.25 an hour, not $7.75. But because he was specific about the dollar amount, we’ll use that to make our calculations. If you earned $7.75 an hour for 40 hours a week and 52 weeks a year, you would earn $16,120. For this to be less than half the poverty level, the poverty level would have to be at least $32,240. Is the poverty level that high? For most households, no. The federal poverty level is actually a matrix of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold. The poverty level only exceeds $32,240 for families with at least seven people -- say, two parents and five children, or one parent and six children. (For a seven-person household, an income of $35,610 is right at the poverty level.) If we were to use the actual minimum wage of $7.25, the yearly income would be less than half of poverty for a six-person family, rather than seven. It’s worth noting that seven-person households are a small fraction of all households. According to the Census Bureau, only 9 percent of households have even three children, and the number with five (or six, if it's a single-parent household) is even smaller. Extrapolating from 2006 data, we estimate that about 2 percent of households have at least five children. So, McDermott’s claim would be wrong for 98 percent of households. And this may even understate how wrong he is. Under the federal Earned Income Tax Credit -- which provides a refundable tax credit to working people with low incomes -- a poverty-level household with two adults and two children would be eligible for $5,372 in tax credits, noted Michael Wiseman, a professor of public policy and economics at George Washington University. That would make McDermott’s scenario even more far-fetched. A spokeswoman for McDermott acknowledged that he "misspoke," both about the amount of the federal minimum wage and about how far that wage would go. "The point he was trying to make was that the current minimum wage is nowhere close to a livable wage," said spokeswoman Amber Macdonald. Our ruling McDermott said that "on (the federal minimum wage of) $7.75, you can’t even make half the poverty level." He’s wrong about what the federal minimum wage is -- it’s $7.25. And for about 98 percent of households, he’s wrong that a year of working at that wage rate wouldn’t even get you to half of the poverty level. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13444	McGinty previously told a local community newspaper in her native Philadelphia that she 'has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the 'T' part of the state' outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/sep/16/pat-toomey/philly-newspapers-mistake-leads-false-pat-toomey-c/	Senate candidate Pat Toomey has agreed to four debates, but the locations are an issue to his campaign. Earlier this week, it called out opponent Katie McGinty for the lack of debates in Central Pennsylvania and suggested she is avoiding the area out of fear. The insinuation, the Toomey press release explained, had to do with a comment she made to theJewish Exponent: "McGinty previously told a local community newspaper in her native Philadelphia that she ‘has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the ‘T’ part of the state’ outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh." Not exactly what you want to say for a part of the state that includes a few million people. But did McGinty really say that to the Jewish Exponent? We need to go back a few months to tackle this fact check. On March 30, an article about McGinty’s candidacy ran in the Exponent, headlined "McGinty holds a strong ‘Jewish’ identity." The article mostly featured McGinty’s beliefs about America’s relationship with Israel and some memories of her growing up in Northeast Philly. Per the conservative-leaning Washington Free Beacon, the article first contained a paraphrase of her thoughts on Central Pennsylvania voters in a quote about the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel: "It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected," said McGinty, who has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds. "I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived." But on April 4 the article was corrected. Again according to the Free Beacon, the segment of the article was changed to read, "It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected," said McGinty, who has found people in the "T" part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds are unaware of BDS’ dangers. "I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived." It was later corrected the same day to include only the quote and no paraphrase about people in Central Pennsylvania. Joshua Runyan, editor-in-chief of the Exponent, said the McGinty campaign contacted the paper and claimed McGinty never said anything similar to what she was paraphrased as saying in the article. He said he listened the recording of the interview and concluded nothing in the conversation could justify what was paraphrased in the article and his reporter, Jon Marks, had made a mistake. "Quite frankly," Runyan said, "I’m surprised that it’s still an issue because she did not say it." The correction wasn’t made until after Republican Congressman Joe Pitts wrote McGinty a letter on April 4 condemning the comment. McGinty’s campaign said it approached the Exponent once it became aware of the comment. The timing rankled Toomey’s campaign, which pointed out McGinty shared the article on Twitter on April 1, days before the correction was made. "The easiest way to solve this problem is for McGinty to release the audio from her interview," said Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey’s campaign. "She has refused." McGinty’s campaign said it does not have a recording of the interview. But after this article was first published Free Beacon reporter Brent Scher shared an email exchange with a McGinty campaign aide saying she recorded the interview and had re-listened to the conversation between McGinty and the Exponent reporter. Runyan declined to share a recording of the interview saying the Exponent has a policy of not releasing audio of interviews to other organizations. Our Ruling Pat Toomey’s campaign circulated a press release earlier this week claiming Katie McGinty told theJewish Exponent she found "an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state’ outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh." But the newspaper corrected the article to remove the paraphrase attributed to McGinty several months ago, after the McGinty campaign complained. The paper’s editor, Joshua Runyan, said the recording revealed McGinty had made no such comment. Toomey’s campaign wants the recording released and considers the timing of the correction fishy, given McGinty tweeted the article after it was first published and the Exponent’s correction wasn’t made until after Republican politicians called out McGinty for the comment. The tape of the interview, unfortunately, was not made available by the Exponent, and the McGinty campaign said it doesn’t have a recording. Because of the correction from the Exponent and the editor’s claim McGinty said nothing to justify the original comment, there is no proof McGinty said anything about finding an alarming amount of misinformed people in Central Pennsylvania. We rule the claim False.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2016-09-16T10:43:33	2016-09-13	['Philadelphia', 'Pittsburgh']
pomt-04262	"Revenues are 15 percent of GDP — it’s still in the range of the lowest it’s ever been."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/12/saxby-chambliss/senator-says-urges-plan-avoid-fiscal-cliff/	Now that we know President Barack Obama will serve a second term in the White House, elected officials and others have focused their attention on an issue that could hurt the wallets of most Americans. Unless Obama and congressional leaders strike a deal on the budget by the end of the year, a series of automatic tax hikes and budget cuts would occur. "Sequestration" is the official term, but it’s commonly known as the "fiscal cliff." U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., has been talking about the issue for months to anyone willing to listen. For about two years, he’s been part of a small bipartisan team of senators working on a long-term solution to put the federal budget on solid financial footing. A recent interview in The Washington Post raised our eyebrows for several reasons. One thing he said prompted us to pull out the Truth-O-Meter. "There is no silver bullet to this problem. You’ve got to have reductions in spending, you’ve got to have entitlement reform, you’ve got to have tax reform. Revenues are 15 percent of GDP — it’s still in the range of the lowest it’s ever been," Chambliss said. GDP stands for gross domestic product. We wondered whether the senator was correct about federal revenue and whether it is close to the lowest it has ever been. The federal government collects about 80 percent of its revenue from income taxes. Corporate income taxes account for about 10 percent. The rest comes from estate and gift taxes and other sources. The federal government currently collects about $2 trillion a year and spends about $3 trillion. As you can see, there’s a problem. If Congress cannot find a solution that prevents the "fiscal cliff," a payroll tax cut pushed through by the Obama administration would end, meaning most Americans would see their paychecks decline by 2 percent. The Alternative Minimum Tax would be applied to an estimated 26 million U.S. households, raising taxes by an average of $3,700. There would be a 9 percent cut in Defense Department spending and a 2 percent cut to Medicare providers. Although some experts believe Washington lawmakers will find a last-minute solution to avoid stepping off the cliff, Chambliss is worried. He warned that if Congress and the White House don’t reach a solution to start reducing the nation’s budget deficit, the U.S. could become like Greece, which is desperately trying to avoid bankruptcy, and "[y]ou could see riots in the streets." Chambliss spokeswoman Lauren Claffey pointed to federal budget data to back up the senator’s claim. The White House Office of Management and Budget keeps annual figures dating to 1930 on revenue as a percentage of GDP. The federal government currently manages its finances on a 12-month fiscal year schedule that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. The most recent completed data was for fiscal year 2011, which began Oct. 1, 2010, and ended Sept. 30, 2011. During that period, federal revenue was 15.4 percent of GDP. For the fiscal year that just ended, it’s estimated to be 15.8 percent. For fiscal year 2013, the White House estimates it will rise to 17.8 percent. The expected increase is a result of the end of tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, projections for a stronger economy, tax increases resulting from the 2010 health care law and other factors, said Curtis Dubay, a senior tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank based in Washington. Since fiscal year 2009, which began in the final months of George W. Bush’s presidency, revenue has been in the 15 percent range. The last time it was that low was 1949 and 1950. Before 1943, federal revenue was no higher than 13 percent. "[R]evenue is within the lowest range it has been for the past 70 years," Claffey said via email. Dubay said federal revenue, and spending, grew exponentially during World War II and as pre-war New Deal programs became implemented. Thus, he said, you can’t make the comparison of revenue collected before the war. "The role of the federal government changed so much," he said. "You can’t compare the federal government prior to World War II. It did different things." Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, agreed that "World War II was a watershed moment" for the federal budget, particularly in defense spending. He noted that the federal government didn’t collect taxes on Social Security benefits until that time, which was 1937. Williams also pointed out some of the other major changes in government spending and revenue requirements, such as Great Society initiatives like Medicare, enacted in the 1960s. To summarize, Chambliss said federal revenue is in the range of the lowest it’s ever been. Since that type of data has been recorded by the federal government, the only time it’s been lower for a period longer than now was before World War II. We still believe that bit of context is necessary to fully examine the senator’s claim. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2012-11-12T06:00:00	2012-11-08	['None']
pomt-04029	Says "the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception … have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates."	false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-jurisdictions-strictest-gun-laws-hav/	Crime statistics prove that gun control laws don’t work, according to Texas’ junior U.S. senator, Ted Cruz, who has made several such statements since his January 2013 swearing-in. Cruz, a Republican, declared such a pattern in a Senate hearing Jan. 30, 2013. Earlier, he said in a Jan. 7, 2013, PBS "Newshour" interview: "If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates." Is that so? PolitiFact checked a similar statement in February 2011, when National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre said that "violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the right to carry (firearms for personal protection) is lower than in areas that prevent it." LaPierre’s claim was rated False. After looking at information from interest groups, a federal research center and the FBI, PolitiFact concluded, "We don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other." Crime and correlation We asked Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton for backup on the senator’s statement. He emailed us links to news stories, commentary pieces and research. The material most directly related to the Cruz claim -- that stricter laws coincide with higher murder/crime rates -- boiled down to: Descriptions from conservative writer John Lott and the National Rifle Association’s lobbying arm (the NRA Institute for Legislative Action) of rising homicide rates in Chicago and Washington, D.C., after those locales banned handguns. An undated commentary piece from the conservative American Civil Rights Union that described a review in the Spring 2007 issue of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy. The review looked at results of various studies and described individual cases of European countries with high gun ownership/low murder rates and vice versa. A description from an NRA-ILA fact-sheet of increased violent crime/burglaries and robberies in two other Illinois cities, Oak Park and Evanston, after they banned handguns. A Feb. 12, 2012, critique from NRA-ILA of the 2011 scorecard issued by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, saying that Brady gave high rankings (based on the presence of certain gun control laws) to states where crime rates were high. A Dec. 16, 2012, Washington Post opinion column that said handgun crime doubled in Britain after a ban and confiscations and that homicides declined slightly in Australia after a 1996 ban on semiautomatic rifles and semiautomatic and pump-action shotguns. An undated (London) Daily Mail news story describing a study of 17 countries that included the U.S. The study concluded that in 1999, citizens of Britain and Australia were most likely to be violent crime victims. By phone, Rushton singled out research by Lott, an economist and author of "More Guns, Less Crime," which concluded that crime rates dropped in U.S. states and counties after "right to carry" laws were passed. PolitiFact mentioned Lott’s work in its LaPierre fact-check, but also noted it had been contradicted by other research, such as a 2004 review in which the National Research Council of the National Academies of science, engineering and medicine concluded data available at the time did not show any "link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime." Cruz’s materials covered a range of "jurisdictions" from local to international, but gave limited or case-by-case evidence rather than comprehensive or across-the-board comparisons. They also illustrated a significant issue regarding such claims: Plenty of gun/crime research is out there, but with so many variables that comparisons are difficult. One example: A Dec. 14, 2012, Washington Post blog entry said economist Richard Florida found that "states with tighter gun-control laws appear to have fewer gun-related deaths." Sounds like it disproves Cruz’s claim, right? Well, but: Cruz specified crime and murder rates; Florida’s basis was the rate of firearm deaths (not limited to crime, thus including suicides and accidents). Cruz and the Post both talked about tight gun laws, but Cruz’s claim was not specific (Rushton later said he meant gun bans) while Florida identified states as "stricter" if they had any one of three specific gun laws (assault weapon ban, trigger lock law or safe storage requirement). In other words, gun/crime data can be used to construct statements that appear to prove diametrically opposed points. Another big caveat: Just because two conditions crop up together (i.e., they correlate) doesn’t mean one caused the other. Many firearms studies and news stories we reviewed included a statement to that effect -- and then went ahead and plunked down the stats together anyway. And all that’s before you get to the issue of whether political bias has affected the research. State by state Cruz’s claim is bold: Strict laws "almost without exception" correlate with the "highest" crime and murder rates, he said. Seeking a common-sense way to test that, we compared state-by-state FBI crime statistics, as PolitiFact did in 2011. State laws cover a lot of territory, because local gun laws can’t be stricter than state laws in most of the U.S., according to the NRA-ILA and Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck, who spoke with us via email. To determine states which had the tightest gun laws, we looked at three tallies: one each from the NRA and two gun-control advocacy groups, the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Kleck pointed us to the NRA’s "Compendium of State Firearms Laws," which showed 11 states with four or more restrictions as of July 9, 2010. Nine of those made the Top Ten on Brady’s 2011 gun-law scorecard and the Law Center’s list of "10 states with the strongest gun laws." The nine: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. We charted crime and murder rates per 100,000 residents for those states using the FBI’s most recent complete Uniform Crime Reports: 2011. Crime rate: Hawaii had the highest crime rate of the nine states, coming in at 17th place overall, and New York the lowest, 47th. The average ranking for all nine states was 33rd place, reflecting the fact that most were in the bottom half. Murder rate: The nine states’ average position was 28th, with Maryland having the highest rate among them (fourth nationwide) and Rhode Island and Hawaii having the country’s lowest murder rates (49th and 50th, respectively). The FBI discourages using its crime report data to create rankings, and in any case our method here is flawed. Kleck and Lott described for us how a "cross-sectional" study like this -- checking many places at one point in time -- misses history that might be relevant; for example, information on whether local crime was already high or low before a gun law passed. City rates, global rates Looking at states also excludes two Cruz-proferred examples: Washington, D.C., and Chicago. National Public Radio reporter Carrie Johnson summarized those situations in a Jan. 18, 2013, broadcast: "There were two places in the country ... that still had sweeping bans on handguns. They were Chicago and Washington, D.C. But the Supreme Court in a pair of cases in 2008 and 2010 threw out those sweeping bans, so no more outright bans on handgun ownership in these places, but still some pretty tight restrictions. It's worth noting … homicide rates for D.C. are at record or near-record lows as of 2012, but Chicago had a sharp spike in murders last year." We took the U.S. Census’ 25 largest cities as of July 1, 2011, and looked at their 2011 FBI statistics. Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Memphis, Tenn., each had higher murder rates than D.C. and Chicago. Crime rates did not compare as neatly, because Chicago’s data for rape (and thus for total violent crime) are excluded for reporting differences. Though property crime rate isn’t a perfect substitute in a discussion about guns and the law, we checked anyway and found that D.C. had the 12th and Chicago the 14th highest property crime rates among the 25 biggest cities. Going from the micro level to the macro: International comparisons are tricky because many factors vary, from data collection methods to countries’ cultural backgrounds. Laws aren’t uniform either, said Sarah Parker, a co-author of the annual Small Arms Study compiled by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. By email, Parker named a few countries with some of the strictest gun controls: Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom. We checked United Nations homicide rates for 2008 in 187 countries, which ranged from 61.3 murders per 100,000 citizens in Honduras down to zero murders in Palau, Iceland and Monaco. Among the "strict" nations that Parker suggested, four were low (UK, 1.3 murders per 100,000; Australia, 1.2; Japan, 0.5; Singapore, 0.4) and one was high -- 10th overall, in fact (South Africa, 36.8). Our ruling Cruz said that "almost without exception," locales with the tightest gun laws have the highest crime and murder rates. This point might hold for some places. However, we found multiple exceptions -- among cities, states and nations -- making this claim False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-02-01T06:00:00	2013-01-07	['None']
pomt-13249	Says Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold "continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/18/brad-schneider/schneider-claim-about-dold-gun-stand-omits-key-fac/	As the race for Illinois’ 10th District seat enters its home stretch, the debate over gun control remains one of the central issues between Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold and Democratic challenger Brad Schneider. On Sept. 16, Schneider tweeted a request for supporters to sign a petition asking Dold to stop blocking a vote on gun safety legislation. On Sept. 27, Schneider's campaign announced that the petition had gained more than 600 signatures. In the text of the petition, Schneider's campaign wrote: "Republican Bob Dold refuses to sign a Congressional petition that would force Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on commonsense gun safety legislation. Instead, Dold continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list." Let’s unpack that a little bit. ‘No fly, no buy’ At the heart of this claim is the debate surrounding the so-called "No Fly, No Buy" bill, officially known as H.R. 1076. As its title suggests, the bill aims to ban the sale of firearms to people who are on the FBI terrorist watchlist. First introduced in February 2015, the bill has been stalled in Congress since December 2015. Democrats have been using various procedural methods to try to move the bill forward. Schneider said Dold has refused to sign a congressional petition that would force a vote on H.R. 1076 and "continues to side with… the NRA" in obstructing the bill. We found that claim curious because Dold is one of the co-sponsors of H.R. 1076 and he has received an "F" rating from the National Rifle Association for his voting record on gun rights. The petition to force a vote on it currently has 181 signatures, which is 37 short of the required 218. It is true that Dold did not sign the petition. Democrats also have used "orders for the previous question" and motions to recommit to try and bring the bill to the floor. Put simply, an "order for the previous question" is a vote on whether or not to change the agenda and consider alternate legislation. A "motion to recommit with instructions forthwith" allows a member of the minority to add an amendment to a piece of legislation just before a vote. Schneider’s campaign offers a list of 25 instances when the Democrats presented either an order for a previous question or a motion to recommit to bring H.R. 1076 to the floor. (Since they first sent us the list, there have been an additional three orders for a previous question). The campaign points out that in each of these instances, Dold sided with the "Republican leadership and the NRA" in order to block consideration of H.R. 1076. We looked at each of the 25 instances cited by Schneider’s campaign, and indeed Dold’s voting record was not in favor of bringing H.R. 1076 to the floor for consideration. However, that is not the full story. Dold’s gun control record Dold, who is facing Schneider for the third consecutive time, said Schneider was distorting his record. "While we have all grown accustomed to the shameless lies from Brad Schneider and his campaign, Brad's incredibly dishonest attacks against my record of championing common-sense gun legislation are sadly another example of the worst kind of politics that the 10th District and the American people are completely tired of." Dold is referring to his record in co-sponsoring the Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, as well as his co-sponsorship of the aforementioned H.R. 1076. He has also spoken on the House floor in favor of reducing gun violence following the Orlando shooting this past summer. Since part of the claim said Dold was siding with the National Rifle Association, we also looked at the gun lobby’s report card and found Dold received an "F," a grade the NRA uses to label those they consider a "true enemy of gun owner’s rights." Schneider also has got an "F" rating. However, Schneider spokesman Steven Kirsch, while acknowledging Dold’s co-sponsorship of H.R. 1076, said, "Democrats are using every tool available to try to force a vote on gun safety legislation. But instead of taking action in favor of the legislation he claims to support, Congressman Bob Dold sides time and time again with his Republican Party to prevent even having a vote. … Until Dold shows he is willing to take action alongside those fighting to a get a vote on this critical legislation instead of continuing to side with his party, his words of support remain just that – words." Some additional caveats Neither orders for previous questions nor motions to recommit are as clear cut as they first seem. Both Republicans and Democrats, when they are in the minority, claim that previous questions have "substantive policy implications." At the same time, both call out the opposing majority party for claiming that previous questions are purely procedural votes. So which is it? We asked Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School. He confirmed that this can be tricky: "You can't separate procedure and substance, so the votes usually are good proxies for someone's substantive stance, BUT it can be very, very difficult to untangle exactly what the substantive consequences of a particular vote are. ... Basically, without getting deep into the weeds of a particular series of votes, you can't really say definitively what the substantive implications of a vote were." Similar statements have been made about motions to recommit. In a 2012 interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Donald Wolfensberger, who currently is a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and served as a key Republican staffer in the 1990s, said "both parties, when in the minority, have used (motions to recommit) to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage. It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy." Our ruling Dold has not signed the discharge petition for the "No Fly, No Buy" bill, and his voting record (as demonstrated through previous questions and motions to recommit) has not helped to progress a vote on the bill. However, there are additional details worth considering that the claim does not mention. Dold is a co-sponsor of the "No Fly, No Buy" bill itself, and his past record has caused the NRA to label him a "true enemy of gun owner’s rights." There also is some ambiguity on the intention behind procedural maneuvers. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information.

pomt-00148	Voting for "any Democrat" gets you "socialism ... undefended open borders ... immediate tax increases ... 100 percent government-run health care ..."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/24/future45/democrat-not-socialism-tax-increase-open-borders/	A new national ad sponsored by Future 45, a pro-President Donald Trump Super PAC, claims that voting for any Democrat will result in chaos. "The screaming. The violence. The smears. And death threats. The far left moving to socialism. Undefended open borders. Immediate tax increases. 100 percent government-run health care. The booming economy, stopped. Nancy Pelosi, back in power. Gridlock. And then, impeachment. Is that really what you want? Voting for any Democrat gets you all of that." The sweeping statements, paired with images of protests and a burning flag, are intended to frighten. But the ad distorts the platforms of most Democratic candidates running in the 2018 election. "This is wild and over-the-top exaggeration and hyperbole," said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "Outlandish is the nicest way of putting it." Future 45 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ‘Moving to socialism’ Republicans have used the socialist label to attack Democrats over policies for decades. It has become a common, but still false, motif during the 2018 midterms. Running for U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Rick Scott called Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson, a socialist: We rated that Pants on Fire. We rated as False a claim from Republican Ron DeSantis that Andrew Gillum has a "far left socialist platform" akin to Venezuela. The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is fond of communism also rated False. The narrowest definition of socialism is where the state owns all the means of production, said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. That’s not what any Democrat is running on. When Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez use the term, they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with potentially higher tax rates to pay for them. That resonates with the systems in place in Canada or Europe; not Venezuela or Cuba. Even the programs that may be labeled as socialist carry broad support, like Social Security, "which has secured bipartisan support for over 70 years," Gamarra said. "100 percent government-run health care" This attack is misleading because Medicare for All doesn’t call for a fully government-run health care system. It’s a gross exaggeration to claim all Democrats support the measure. Medicare for All is the most fundamental change to the health insurance system among the proposals put forth by Democrats in Congress, according to Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Sanders’ bill has 16 Democratic co-sponsors and similar legislation in the House has 123 co-sponsors. But Peter Dreier, a political theorist at Occidental College, said Medicare for All does not fit the bill of socialism. "In Medicare for All, private providers, private doctors, nurses and hospitals will provide the health care," Dreier said. "The government will provide the insurance, which is what Medicare is now." Other senators have introduced similar, though less sweeping, bills to provide a Medicare buy-in through the marketplace or for older individuals who have not yet hit 65. "Immediate tax increases" There are no "immediate" tax increases on the horizon. Most Democrats have called for changing or repealing parts of last year's tax cut. In March, Senate Democrats unveiled a plan to finance infrastructure projects by rolling back parts of the law. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Bill Nelson of Florida presented the blueprint. The plan calls for increased taxes for corporations and the rich as well as cutting the carried interest loophole that benefits some money managers, while repealing or reforming the cap on state and local tax deductions (which would be a cut). But the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere soon. "Whoever wins control in November, there is still Republican President Trump in the White House," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "So even in the unlikely event that both chambers flip to Democrats, they won't be able to do anything ‘immediate’ regarding taxes." "Undefended open borders" Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, but no one has called for immigrants to freely cross the border. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but others talk of restructuring or a new focus. Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi have called for reforms to ICE. In July, we found six additional Democrats in the House and Senate who have said they want to "abolish," "dismantle" or replace ICE. Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, said he planned to introduce legislation to abolish ICE, because the Trump administration had "so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively." But that’s hardly all Democrats, and it’s not a call for open borders. "I don’t support open borders, I don’t know any Democrat who supports open borders," Pocan said in a June 30 Twitter video. "In fact, ICE doesn’t operate at the borders. The Customs and Border Protection operates at the borders. So anyone who says that, is either ill-informed or outright lying." Our ruling Future 45 said voting for "any Democrat" gets you "socialism ... undefended open borders ... immediate tax increases ... 100% government run health care ..." The Democratic Party is a tent that houses a wide variety of views. Some candidates are self-proclaimed socialists, but even their platforms don’t fit the narrow definition of traditional socialism. Some, not all, support expansions of Medicare, but that would not qualify as 100 percent government-run health care. These and other policies may raise taxes, but immediate tax increases are unlikely under a Republican president. The tax increases on the table mostly target the rich and corporations. And finally, Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of ICE, but no candidate has called for undefended open borders. The ad cherry-picks extreme positions and suggests all Democrats support them. That is false and ridiculous. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-07081	"Since June 2009, about 48 percent of all the jobs created in America were in Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/26/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-accounted-48-percent-us-jobs/	In an unannounced June 14 appearance on the Fox News Channel, Texas Gov. Rick Perry strolled through another celebration of the state’s economy. His 35-second cameo shows host Glenn Beck and Perry, who is not introduced, walking from a chalkboard past the camera as Beck asks: "How many jobs did you create, percentage, during the recession?" Perry replies: "Since June 2009, about 48 percent of all the jobs created in America were in Texas. Come add to it." "Thank you; would love to," says Beck, whose show is leaving Fox. After Perry walked off camera, Beck imitated Star Wars’ Obi-Wan Kenobi, waving his hand across his face and saying: "I have no idea who that man was. That’s not the candidate you were looking for." We recognize that job-gain boasts can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-08 were in Texas. We rated that False because it was based on statistics from the 14 states in which job gains outnumbered job losses, and disregarded any jobs created in the other 36 states where losses outnumbered gains. Per the governor’s recent claim, his office and the Texas Workforce Commission each attributed the 48 percent figure to research touted by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve. The Fed compared the number of jobs in Texas and the nation in April 2011 to the number of jobs in June 2009, the month marked by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the end of the recession that started in December 2007. Workforce commission spokesman Mark Lavergne forwarded a June 14 email from Jerrod Vaughan, an assistant to Richard Fisher, president and ceo of the Dallas Fed, elaborating on Fisher’s recently telling the Wall Street Journal that Texas accounted for 37 percent of post-recession net job gains nationally, by one calculation, or 45 percent by another. The Journal article says the Texas economy has averaged 3.3 percent annual growth over the last two decades, compared with 2.6 percent for the nation over all. Vaughan’s email says that when the Dallas Fed compared its internally adjusted Texas employment totals to national survey employment figures, the Texas share of the whole was 47.8 percent--hence, we see, the figure Perry gave Beck. Pia Orrenius, a senior economist at the Dallas Fed, told us the calculation came from subtracting the number of Texas jobs in June 2009 (10,287,000) from the jobs as of April 2011 (10,524,000) and determining the 237,000 increase accounted for nearly 48 percent of the 496,000 jobs gained nationally over that period. She said the national job figures were drawn from the federal government’s national payroll surveys. Then again, Orrenius suggested the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. "Long before Rick Perry" became governor, she said, "we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month." She listed as favorable factors the state’s range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Experts we contacted agreed Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth, though they stressed there are various ways to arrive at the state’s share of the nation’s rebound. Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, initially advised by email that by the bureau’s count, Texas had 265,300 more jobs in April 2011 than in June 2009. Using the Dallas Fed’s equation, this suggests Texas accounted for about 54 percent of the nation’s net job growth over the period. Why the difference: The Dallas Fed checks the bureau’s monthly employment estimates against employers’ unemployment compensation tax filings once a quarter; the bureau only does so annually. Abbot said, though, she prefers to judge "recoveries thus far" by comparing specific state or U.S. current employment levels with their peak employment prior to the recession. Texas, she said, has nearly recovered all the jobs lost in the recession. Its nearly 10.6 million jobs as of April ran 0.9 percent below its August 2008 peak employment level of more than 10.6 million jobs. In contrast, Abbot said, the U.S. employment of 131 million in May 2011 fell 5 percent below the peak U.S. employment of nearly 138 million in January 2008. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy for the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called the Fed’s comparison fair, but said he’s skeptical every time a leader touts economic gains when it’s unclear how they stoked the gains. "Reporters should ask the governor specifically what policies he put in place to create the much-better employment growth," Edward said, adding that he sees as a negative move changes in business taxation Perry signed into law in 2006 to help cover cuts in school property taxes. Likewise, Bob Lerman, a fellow in labor and social policy at The Urban Institute in Washington saw no flaw in the Fed’s calculation. But at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, researcher Kathryn Edwards called Perry’s statement misleading because the Fed’s research reflects only the 31 states with net job gains over the post-recession period. Jobs were created in the other states, Edwards pointed out, though more jobs were lost. It would be accurate, she said, to say Texas accounted for 27 percent of jobs gained in states with net job gains. For the same reason, Lee McPheters, an economist at Arizona State University, said the Fed’s statistical comparison is misleading. McPheters wondered too why the cited comparison starts in June 2009 when the actual national low point in terms of employment was February 2010, because employment keeps falling after a recession ends. Applying the Fed’s methodology to the the later time frame, Texas accounted for only 18 percent of the jobs created from February 2010 into April 2011, he said. Finally, we consulted Bernard Weinstein, an economist at Southern Methodist University familiar with the state’s economic ups and downs. "One can quibble over the numbers as well as the methodologies and time frames used to calculate Texas' job gains," Weinstein said by email. The big picture, he said, is that Texas has fared better than other big states since the recession and indeed over the past 20 years, for reasons including, he said, "enlightened" leadership, demographics and the resurgent energy sector. Our take:The strength of the Texas economy, compared to many other states, isn’t in dispute. However, there are many ways to slice and dice employment statistics. The calculations behind the 48-percent boast may cover a less meaningful time frame while not weighing any jobs created in states with net job losses. Mark Perry’s statement Half True.

pomt-14178	Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, "which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-hazy-claim-researchers-cant-study/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a firm stance on marijuana legalization yet — she wants to see more research first. But there are some challenges to getting that research, she said. At an ABC town hall April 21, Clinton told audience member Evan Nison, a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws board member, what she would do as president to address the marijuana legalization debate. "I've said I want to move marijuana off of Schedule I, which you understand means that you can't do any research about it," she said. "You can't do anything, and I think that's wrong. We have enough anecdotal evidence, as you well know being a member of the NORML Board, about what marijuana can do for medical conditions, easing pain. And we need to be doing research on it because I am 100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana. But I want to know what the evidence is." The 1970 Controlled Substances Act classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category that includes drugs with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This puts marijuana in the same class as heroin and ecstasy and a notch higher than meth and cocaine. We wondered if Clinton was correct that marijuana’s Schedule I classification means scientists can’t research it. (Hat-tip to our buds at FactCheck.org who looked at her claim first.) We talked to some scientists who do, in fact, research marijuana. The regulatory hoops make their work challenging but not impossible. Stuck in the weeds The government doesn’t ban scientific research on Schedule I drugs like marijuana. In 2015, the National Institutes of Health put approximately $111 million into 281 research projects studying cannabinoids, which are chemical compounds found in marijuana. (Not all of these studies actually involve giving marijuana to human subjects.) But the government has tried to make it harder to study marijuana and other drugs it has historically considered dangerous and without medical use, for fear that the drugs could be stolen or fall into the wrong hands, said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in federal marijuana policy. "Marijuana has always been treated most unique among scheduled drugs in ways that made it even harder to study," especially in terms of acquiring plants for the research, Hudak told PolitiFact. As a result, in many states where medical marijuana is legal, doctors and policymakers have to base their practices on limited science, Hudak and co-author Grace Wallack wrote in a Brookings report. He cited research that found Schedule I designations discourage scientists from trying to study these drugs. To conduct marijuana research, researchers have to submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has to license the research site and the investigating scientist. If a scientist wanted to conduct three studies on a non-Schedule I drug in three different labs, he or she could get an umbrella approval for this project. But to conduct a similar set of studies on a Schedule I drug such as marijuana, the researcher would have to get approval for each individual site and investigator, said Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego. Until about a year ago, a Public Health Service committee also had to review privately funded projects, in a process almost identical to the FDA review. But President Barack Obama’s administration did away with that requirement. Grant, whose lab has completed seven studies on medical uses for cannabis, said that before this revision, it could take between six and 18 months to get all the necessary government approvals to start a study. Now, it takes a little less time. The supply of federally approved marijuana plants is another major barrier. If researchers want to use the marijuana plant, there is only one source: the University of Mississippi, which contracts with the National Institute of Drug Abuse to grow marijuana for research purposes. So researchers can only get however much marijuana the facility is able to produce, and they’re subject to the facility’s timeline. The program has good intentions in providing drugs that might otherwise be difficult to work with, and they can control the chemical makeup of the plant, said Christine Rabinak, a pharmacy and neuroscience professor at Wayne State University. But there are some concerns about how well the government’s supply matches the kind of marijuana that is currently commercially available for medicinal purposes. "I think we are going to be limited on what research can be conducted in the United States with other strains of cannabis because of these federal barriers," she said. Some researchers, including Rabinak, use synthetic versions of chemical compounds found in marijuana, which she said are much easier to acquire than the plant itself. Grant said that if the government were to reschedule marijuana to a lower classification, there would likely be more marijuana research because the project review process would be so much easier. It would especially open up opportunities for scientists who might not have the time or resources to spend months waiting for federal approval under the current rules. Hudak’s Brookings paper concluded that rescheduling marijuana would remove one hurdle for researchers, while also recommending lifting the federal government’s control over growing marijuana plants for research and reforming licensing requirements, among other policy changes. While Clinton’ statement is incorrect, there’s some truth to her larger point that current policy makes it hard to research marijuana, Grant said. "It does not mean the studies cannot be done or that the federal government is consciously trying to block the studies," he said. "It’s just a complicated process." Our ruling Clinton said marijuana is a Schedule I drug, "which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it." It’s hard to research marijuana, especially using plants (as opposed to synthetic versions) in studies involving human subjects. There are many regulatory hoops scientists have to navigate, and the government has a single-source monopoly on marijuana plants to be used for research. All of this makes setting up a marijuana experiment a lengthy and daunting process. However, there are scientists currently studying marijuana, and federal funding supports some of these experiments. Clinton’s statement gives the impression that the government bans marijuana research flat-out, and that’s not the case. Her statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f405fae1-1167-4866-ab01-2ec18b3c3f7f	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-26T15:54:25	2016-04-21	['None']

pomt-03748	"In the last two years, I have supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts. Dr. Gingrey has presented zero."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/09/paul-broun/broun-takes-rivals-record-proposed-cuts/	Timing is everything in politics. So U.S. Rep. Paul Broun didn’t take long to distinguish himself from a new candidate in what could be the most interesting statewide political primary in Georgia in years. Broun, an Athens Republican, was speaking to the University of Georgia College Republicans on March 27 when he was asked about the campaign for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Saxby Chambliss. That same day, U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Republican from Marietta, announced he was entering the 2014 race for the Senate seat. On the surface, it seems there are few differences between the two candidates. Both men are medical doctors. Both are fierce critics of President Barack Obama’s policies. But Broun told the students there is at least one difference between him and Gingrey. "In the last two years, I have supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts. Dr. Gingrey has presented zero," Broun said, according to the Red & Black newspaper. "I have the record, and I have the will to say ‘no’ to the out of control spending. There’s a big difference between the two of us and anybody else who will get in this race." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out if Broun was correct about what he’s done -- and what he said Gingrey has not done. First, let’s look at Broun’s proposed cuts. The congressman has introduced several dozen amendments in the past two years to curb federal spending, records show. Some of those include legislation in June 2012 to eliminate funding for the Transportation Security Administration that Broun said would save the federal government slightly more than $5 billion. A year earlier, Broun proposed legislation that would cut $940 million in grant funding. He’s proposed cutting the Energy Department’s Office of Science account by $820 million, and reducing the federal government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children by about $600 million. None of those pieces of legislation passed. Broun also has tried several times to introduce legislation to take away funding for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known to most as Obamacare. The federal government’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has concluded the health care law will cost at least $251 billion by 2019. The agency calculated the estimated cost of expanding health care coverage, $828 billion, and subtracted that number by what it believes will be a savings of $577 billion through Medicare, Medicaid and other reforms. Broun has suggested replacing the federal health care law with what he calls the "OPTION Act," a plan he says will give Americans complete control of their health care. By considering Broun’s efforts to repeal the health care law alone, the congressman is on the money about the first part of his claim. Now, let’s look at whether he’s correct about Gingrey not proposing any cuts. We asked Broun’s team for details. Broun was referring to the House appropriations and re-authorization processes, explained Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti. The House Appropriations Committee only accepts legislation on federal discretionary spending from committee members. Discretionary spending -- which excludes iconic programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounts for about 40 percent of the federal budget. Like Broun, Gingrey is not a member of the committee. However, Gingrey can offer amendments to resolutions that are proposed. And he can introduce his own resolutions to the entire House of Representatives. Gingrey’s team sent us a few examples of cuts that Gingrey authored in resolutions since 2011. In January 2011 and January 2013, Gingrey introduced the Federal Employee Accountability Act, which would remove guidelines that allow federal employees to conduct union activities during official work hours. Gingrey argued it would save $1.3 billion over 10 years. Gingrey has pitched the idea a few times in recent years. In 2011, Gingrey presented a bill, the State Flexibility Act, which he argued would give states more financial wiggle room and save money. Gingrey argued at the time that 8 million more Americans were projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years. PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim Half True. Gingrey also has proposed a resolution called the Congressional Budget Accountability Act. The bill would return all funds remaining in congressional office budgets at the end of a calendar year to the Treasury Department to reduce the deficit. We asked Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint if he thought Broun’s assertion about Gingrey was correct. "If (Broun is) saying it’s zero, it’s not true," said Swint, who’s been following Gingrey for years. Our conclusion: Broun said in the last two years, he has supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts, while Gingrey has presented zero. We believe the first part of Broun’s claim was on the money. But the second part needs more context to be fully understood. Although Gingrey is not a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he has proposed legislation aimed at cutting discretionary spending. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-10709	"I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/27/fred-thompson/hes-right-on/	At first, one might wonder: How can former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson claim "a 100 percent pro-life voting record" when the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest and most prominent antiabortion advocacy group, graded him at only 33 percent during his last term in Congress? And 77 percent the term before that? And 87 percent in the term before that? The answer is in the details. As a senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002, Thompson's voting record indeed shows he compiled a perfect record on voting against abortion rights, cloning and certain research that many antiabortion advocates find objectionable. He voted against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion. Several times, he voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the woman -- not her health - is at stake. He supported a ban on abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion. So what's with the middling marks from the National Right to Life Committee's grade, then? The Washington-based group, which boasts 3,000 chapters in all 50 states, ranks members of Congress each year on their votes. But Thompson was docked not for his votes on so-called "life issues;" instead, he lost points for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that sought to limit the contributions or advertising of outside interest groups. Many advocacy organizations opposed these reforms because they feared they'd lose influence in Congress. In 1995, he also supported a welfare reform bill the group opposed, said David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life. But on matters dearest to their members' hearts, Thompson is right on, O'Steen said. He also voted with the group against cloning and fetal tissue research, and for limits on how federal funding could be used for family planning activities abroad, his voting record shows. In fact, the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed him for president. "It's very fair for him to say that on every bill that came forward, he cast a pro-life vote," O'Steen said. "I think he's fairly characterizing this. He's got a very pro-life record, and that was a big part of our endorsement –- it's not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid." The ad, which aired first in Iowa, then nationally on Fox News, is designed to help Thompson set himself apart from his chief Republican rivals, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in the race for the GOP nomination. Romney says he now opposes abortion; when he ran for governor, he said he was in favor of abortion rights. Giuliani publicly supports abortion rights. By contrast, Thompson's commitment in public life to the policies espoused by antiabortion groups has never wavered. We find his claim True.

pomt-00511	Says South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley "is an immigrant."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/24/ann-coulter/ann-coulters-pants-fire-claim-sc-gov-nikki-haley-i/	Conservative pundit Ann Coulter thinks talk of removing the Confederate flag from Southern statehouses, including South Carolina, is nonsense. To Coulter, that makes Republicans who support the movement nonsensical. Coulter, however, spouted her own bit of nonsense in trying to defend her position. On the Fox Business show Kennedy June 23, Coulter was asked about the ongoing flag debate. "Where are you from?" host Kennedy (the former MTV veejay) asked Coulter. Coulter said she’s from Connecticut. "Do you have a geographic ... Do you have a horse in this race either way? Do you consider yourself a Northerner?" "Oh, you mean the Southern thing?" Coulter responded. "Well, I'm a student of American history ... I’d really like to like Nikki Haley, since she is a Republican. On the other hand, she is an immigrant and does not understand America's history." Coulter got one part of Haley’s background right. Yep, she’s a Republican. But she’s not an immigrant. She was born in South Carolina. "Born in Bamberg, the daughter of Indian immigrants, Gov. Haley’s first job was keeping the books for her family’s clothing store -- at the age of 13," reads the website of the South Carolina office of the governor. Bamberg, S.C., is a small city with a population of less than 4,000 people. You may not have heard of it. But it is definitely in the United States. The New York Times described Haley’s time growing up in Bamberg in a 2010 profile and her life as the American-born child of an Indian Sikh family. When Haley was about 5, she was disqualified from the Little Miss Bamberg pageant along with her sister because "the judges of the contest, one that crowned one black queen and one white queen, were … flummoxed" by the sisters. "(People in my hometown) didn’t know much about the Indian culture, and we didn’t know much about how to teach it to them," Haley, who was Nimrata Randhawa, said during an interview with Vogue. Haley went on to receive an accounting degree from Clemson University, and then returned to Bamberg to work in her family’s store again. With her help, the store turned "into a multimillion-dollar business." Then, in 2003, a speech by Hillary Clinton inspired Haley to run for state Legislature. "She said there will be all of these reasons that people tell you you can’t do it. She said that there’s only one reason for you to do it, and it’s because you know it’s the right thing. I walked out of there thinking, I’ve got to do this," Haley said to Vogue. The next year, Haley was elected to represent Lexington County in South Carolina’s House of Representatives. On Jan. 12, 2011, Haley was sworn in as governor. She visited India as part of a trade mission in 2014. Prior to that, Haley said the last time she visited the country was when she was two years old. PunditFact reached out to the publisher of Coulter’s latest book Adios, America but did not hear back. Coulter, for the record, describes herself as being of Scottish descent and traces part of her family's roots to "Puritan nonconformists who came to America in 1633." She seemed to defend her remarks in a post of Twitter. Our ruling Coulter said Haley is an immigrant and went on to suggest that Haley doesn't understand American history because she is less-American than others (namely, Coulter). Haley was born in South Carolina, and is no more an immigrant than Coulter, who describes herself of Scottish descent. We rate Coulter’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00278	Says Bill Nelson "skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/01/rick-scott/fact-checking-gov-rick-scotts-attack-sen-bill-nels/	Gov. Rick Scott portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as an "empty chair" who often skips meetings on the important topic of security. "Nelson skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security," said a TV ad from Scott’s campaign. "National security! Bill Nelson doesn’t write laws — he doesn’t even show up." The ad refers to Nelson’s tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Nelson is defending his seat in a close battle with Scott. Attacks for missed hearings are common. But these attacks omit several caveats about committee attendance. "I have never been one that put much stock in the ‘attendance’ statistics to measure a senator's work" on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Arnold Punaro, who served as the committee's Democratic staff director from 1983 to 1997. Senate Armed Committee meetings Scott’s campaign published a spreadsheet showing that between 2001 and 2018, Nelson missed 45 percent (or 284 out of 636) of Senate Armed Service Committee hearings. (He wasn’t on the committee in 2011-12.) The campaign said it counted full committee hearings and subcommittees on which Nelson served and was expected to attend. Nelson’s attendance varied with each two-year congressional session, ranging from 44 percent in 2005-06 to 76 percent for the current 2017-18 session. Scott’s campaign pulled attendance records from the Senate Armed Services Committee website and the Government Printing Office. However, attendance isn’t published for closed or classified hearings. Since there aren’t public attendance records for all types of hearings, that means we don’t get the full picture of Nelson’s service on the committee. Dan McLaughlin, Nelson’s spokesman, said by his count Nelson attended 104 of 126 Armed Services hearings, informal meetings, sessions and briefings — including more than two dozen that were closed or classified — in 2017-18. PolitiFact can’t verify the Nelson campaign’s figures since that includes meetings that lack a public attendance record. The limits of sheer attendance Experts on Congress agreed that a straight-up attendance record doesn’t tell us much. "A hearing about a national security threat, for example, is much more significant than routine budget hearings the (committee) holds every fiscal year," said Georgetown University professor Joshua Huder, who studies Congress. It is common for senators, who serve on multiple committees and subcommittees, to miss hearings. Sometimes, multiple committees will hold hearings at the same time, forcing the senator to split their time or prioritize one hearing over another. Roll Call, a Washington publication that regularly covers Congress, wrote in 2014 that unless the senator wields the gavel, he or she may only show up for five minutes, or when it is their turn to ask questions "The results include guffaw-inducing scenes where even senior lawmakers enter the wrong hearing room, misidentify a witness and question the wrong person on the other side of the dais," Roll Call wrote. Our ruling Scott said Nelson "skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security." The Scott campaign’s data for Nelson’s 16 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee shows he missed 284 hearings out of 636. However, this omits that for some types of hearings there is no publicly available attendance record. This count is not perfect. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-09195	Florida ranks "45th out of 50 states'' for its regulatory climate for business.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/may/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-has-high-regulatory-burden/	Rick Scott, a former health care executive who's running in Florida's Republican gubernatorial primary, took aim at the state's business climate in a May 25, 2010, campaign event with young Republicans in Tampa. "We're 45th out of 50 states'' for regulatory climate for business, Scott said in a speech. "It's ridiculous the regulation we have in this state. It impacts job growth." That's a pretty specific charge, suggesting that the state is overregulated. So we decided to track it down and see if it was supported. As it turns out, there are at least three recent rankings of the 50 states by their regulatory climate for business, and one of them indeed has Florida in 45th place. That one is the "U.S. Economic Freedom Index: 2008 Report," produced roughly every five years by the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank based in San Francisco. The Scott campaign confirmed that this was the study he was citing. The authors of the study ranked the 50 states in each of five areas: fiscal policy, regulatory policy, judicial climate toward business, the size of government and "welfare spending." In the regulatory category, Florida ranked 45th, just as Scott said it did. (The Sunshine State fared better in the other four categories; overall, its ranking was 28th.) But the other two rankings of regulatory climate had happier news for Florida businesses. One study, "Freedom in the 50 States: An Index of Personal and Economic Freedom," was published in February 2009 by the Mercatus Center, a free-market program at George Mason University in Arlington, Va. The categories in the Mercatus study were fiscal policy, regulatory policy, personal freedom and economic freedom, which were combined into an overall ranking. In the regulatory category, Florida ranked 19th. (In the overall category, Florida ranked 22nd.) The other study, by Forbes magazine in 2008, ranked "the Best States for Business," by business costs, labor policy, regulatory environment, economic climate, growth prospects and "quality of life." In the regulatory ranking, Florida ranked 22nd. Overall, Florida fared the best it did in any of the three studies: 8th highest in the nation. So we have three studies. How did they come up with such different results? The quick answer is that they used a different mix of statistics when calculating each state's regulatory climate. There are some similarities. Forbes' study, for instance, used PRI's rating as one factor in its regulatory calculation. And the PRI and Mercatus studies have a number of statistics in common, such as minimum wage levels, labor union laws and the state's worker compensation system. But PRI and Mercatus also use some divergent factors. Mercatus, unlike PRI, includes utility deregulation, health insurance mandates, land-use restrictions, liability system quality and eminent domain laws. By contrast, PRI uses a more extensive list of occupational licensing and continuing-education requirements, covering everything from auctioneers and acupuncturists to embalmers and opticians. PRI also factors in gun control policy, school choice and seat belt laws, which Mercatus included in a category separate from regulatory policy. We asked Jason Sorens, the political scientist at the State University of New York at Buffalo who co-authored the Mercatus report, why the studies came up with such divergent rankings. He said that even with the difference in statistical factors, he was surprised at the wide difference in scores. Sorens suggested that the variation could have stemmed from two factors included in the PRI study but not the Mercatus study -- procurement rules (such as mandates for state government to buy American-made products, recycled products and alternative fuels) and environmental protection standards (such as standards for indoor air quality, pesticides, mercury, lead, "children's environmental health," asbestos and other toxic compounds). It's possible that Florida's laws in these areas, or perhaps in other areas measured only by the PRI study, are more stringent than those in other states, Sorens said. It's important to note that all three studies were produced by groups with free-market, pro-business orientations, and their selection of inputs inherently reflects value judgments that not all Floridians will agree with. Certainly labor union members will not appreciate having "right to work" laws counted as a plus, and environmentalists (even those who are fiscally conservative) will likely chafe at the prospect of a state being marked down for strong wetlands-protection and endangered-species laws. Finally, lots of Floridians could take issue with whether it's desirable (or even valid) to include gun-control laws and seat belt laws (as PRI does) or smoking restrictions (as Mercatus does) in a calculation of a business-climate study. In other words, many Floridians may see benefits in some of the government regulations that count as demerits in these studies, and might well prefer, on balance, to live in a state that ranks poorly on these regulatory lists. That said, we won't take sides on the question of whether state regulation is a positive or a negative. Rather, we'll focus only on the narrower question of whether Scott portrayed the data accurately. Is there a single, "correct" ranking? We don't think so. Even though the three studies produced different results using different inputs, the authors of the Forbes and Mercatus studies told PolitiFact that they respect the PRI study and its methodology. With that kind of endorsement, we'll stipulate that there's no "right" score for Florida -- just three different estimates. So if the three separate rankings are more or less equivalent, then Scott's statement is not incorrect -- but it's also not complete. He has cited the least favorable ranking, while two other studies rated Florida substantially higher. If Scott had said, "According to one study, Florida ranks 45th out of 50 states'' for regulatory climate for business, he would have been 100 percent accurate. As it is, his statement is technically correct, but gives an incomplete impression about the extent of Florida's regulatory climate. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-03135	Under Mayor Angel Taveras "Providence’s bond rating was downgraded from A to BBB, two steps above junk-bond status."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/15/american-leadhership-pac/under-mayor-angel-taveras-providences-bond-rating-/	In July, political consultant Kate Coyne-McCoy registered a new super PAC with a mission, among other things, to boost the potential candidacy of Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo for governor. It is called American LeadHERship PAC. A super PAC is a political action committee registered with the Federal Election Commission that is allowed to spend an unlimited sum in support of or in opposition to candidates for elective office. In contrast with a traditional political action committee, a super PAC may not contribute directly to a campaign or coordinate activity with a candidate. Raimondo is expected to seek the Democratic nomination in next year’s primary election, and a potential rival for the nomination is Providence Mayor Angel Taveras. Based on the assumption that he will run, Rhode Islander Coyne-McCoy posted on the website for American LeadHERship some disparaging information about Taveras. After Taveras took office as mayor in January 2011, Coyne-McCoy pointed out, Providence’s credit rating was downgraded to "two steps above junk-bond status" by Fitch Ratings. When a government or business with questionable credit borrows money by selling a bond, the certificate is called a "junk bond." Asked what she is implying by listing that as a bullet point on her website, Coyne-McCoy responded, "I’m just repeating a fact. He was the leader of the city when the downgrade occurred." And why bring it up? "Because I don’t believe Angel Taveras is as good a leader as Gina Raimondo," she said. Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, two of the nation’s three major credit-rating agencies, announced in March 2011 sharp downgrades of Providence’s primary bond ratings, leaving the city two and three notches from junk-bond status, respectively. Fitch said it was concerned about whether the city could generate sufficient cash to pay its bills through the end of the 2010-11 fiscal year. The third agency, Moody’s Investors Service, was more gentle, knocking the city down to an A3 on Moody’s rating scale, higher than the other two agencies All three downgrades occurred about two months after Taveras took the oath of office -- and only after a committee of financial experts empaneled by Taveras found and disclosed that the city had a $110-million structural deficit. (A structural deficit is a built-in long-term gap between revenue and expenses.) The structural deficit, equal to one-sixth the size of the budget and aggravated by a depleted rainy day fund, was inherited from Taveras’ predecessor, David N. Cicilline. In his final months in office, as he was campaigning for his current seat in Congress, Cicilline declared that the city was in "excellent financial condition" -- an assessment that he apologized for after winning his new political office. The new mayor took office midway through a fiscal year in which the city had not yet adopted a budget. But few residents perceived a huge problem, in part because no more than six months earlier the city had been enjoying decent credit ratings of A1, A and AA- from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, respectively. Anticipating a financial struggle, Taveras appointed the panel of experts eight days into his tenure, and it revealed the depth of the crisis. The new mayor declared the situation a "Category 5 fiscal hurricane" and took a series of steps that have virtually erased the $110-million structural deficit. Among them: he persuaded police and firefighter unions and public safety retirees to make wage and benefit concessions; tax-exempt universities and hospitals agreed to pay the city more money in lieu of taxes; and the city revamped the system of retirement and medical care benefits. In May 2012, Providence slipped another notch in Standard & Poor’s rankings, to two notches above junk bond status. So is Taveras to blame for the poor credit ratings, as Coyne-McCoy seems to imply? As the structural deficit was being eliminated, the agencies have had positive things to say about city management. For example, Fitch said in 2012 and 2013 that progress on the deficit was "impressive" and "notable." In December 2012, Moody’s declared Providence’s money-saving pension reform "a precedent that other struggling Rhode Island cities and towns can follow." On Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2013, Standard & Poor’s affirmed its BBB rating, two notches above junk bond status. But the agency also revised its outlook for Providence from "negative" to "stable." Our ruling American LeadHERship is accurate in noting that one of three bond-rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, downgraded Providence’s bond rating to two notches above junk-bond status in March 2011. Although not noted on the PAC’s website, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings also were lowered, but at that point were less negative than Fitch. Coyne-McCoy, well-schooled in Rhode Island politics, knows perfectly well that Taveras inherited the deficit from the previous mayor, who lied about the city’s financial condition. And she does not mention that the new mayor took immediate actions to improve Providence’s finances -- actions that have been praised, including by the bond-rating agencies. The judges realize that she may not consider Taveras as good a leader as Raimondo, but the statement she posted on American LeadHERship is reminiscent of Cicilline’s comments about the city’s financial condition. Because it leaves out important details and takes things out of context, the judges rule Half True.

pomt-03078	Under economic sanctions, "now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/27/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-under-sanctions-iran-suffering-3/	An Iranian president says he’s ready to resolve the nation’s nuclear standoff with the West — what gives? Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich gives at least partial credit to economic pain orchestrated by the United States and international allies. While the United States must still be "very cautious," he said on ABC’s This Week, "one of the big lessons here is that economic sanctions do seem to work. "Right now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment," he told a roundtable including CNN’s Newt Gingrich, ABC’s Jonathan Karl and PBS’ Gwen Ifill. "I mean this nation is hurting and our economic sanctions, because we've been patient with them, because we have actually rounded up almost every other nation to support us, have had a huge impact." Is Iran suffering such high inflation and unemployment under economic sanctions? Tumbling oil exports Now, economic sanctions are nothing new for Iran, which has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. But the pressure has been rising. Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report by Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Iran’s government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop has been driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers. Iran also lost access to the international banking system. The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Iran’s currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession that’s driving up unemployment. Has that meant "30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment," as Reich told ABC viewers? There’s not a simple answer. Inflation estimates range from 30 percent to 70 percent. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development don’t have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment. Still, Reich’s in range. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reich’s numbers "seem reasonable." Here’s how the Congressional Research Service put it in June: Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts. Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher. Reich pointed us to news articles from the Associated Press and energy news site OilPrice.com — which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty. The Associated Press reported in June inflation "over 30 percent," though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the country found that unemployment rate "impossible to believe," and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the same day.) So "reasonable" seems like a fair assessment for Reich’s numbers. We should also note there’s not universal agreement on the size of sanctions’ role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Iran’s fiscal management. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports. "The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment," he said. Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacific’s McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact "it's likely to be a much more complicated picture." Our ruling Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, "now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation" and "20 percent unemployment." Iran’s own statistics aren’t widely trusted and international organizations don’t have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It’s worth noting that Iran’s economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, there’s good evidence they’ve had a "huge impact," as Reich said. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Robert Reich	None	None	None	2013-09-27T17:22:59	2013-09-22	['Iran']

pomt-13942	"A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/20/clay-aiken/clay-aiken-said-despite-orlando-tragedy-gays-flori/	As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. "A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay," Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, "the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination. Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination." Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. "Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation," Pultz said in an email. "Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate," he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, "A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay." That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law. However, 19 Florida cities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections. We rate Aiken’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369	None	Clay Aiken	None	None	None	2016-06-20T12:30:47	2016-06-12	['None']

pomt-14703	"When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things  —  including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/07/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-us-didnt-address-cybersecurity-/	Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina recently took President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to task on the issue of cybersecurity, via a column posted on Medium. She said Obama and Clinton have left the United States "woefully uprepared for cyberterrorism." Fiorina said cybersecurity is "a critical piece of our strategy to defeat ISIS and restore American leadership in the world." She made a number of assertions in that column; here we’ll look at one she made about the United States’ efforts to prevent cyber attacks from China. "When we held recent economic dialogues with China," Fiorina wrote, "we agreed on over 100 different things —  including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity." China has been implicated in past data breaches, including perhaps the most far-reaching hacking incident so far, which accessed a large cache of sensitive personal data held by the federal Office of Personnel Management. Campaign spokeswoman Anna Epstein told us that Fiorina was referring to a news release in which the White House summarized 127 areas of agreement reached in June 2015 at the Strategic & Economic Dialogue, a periodic summit between high-level representatives of the United States and China. Fiorina has a point that none of the 127 items on that list explicitly addressed cybersecurity. However, her argument is weaker if one looks beyond that list of 127 items: Fiorina ignored a subsequent agreement between the United States and China that dealt directly with cybersecurity. But let’s start with the summit. In their public addresses at the summit’s opening, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew each said that cybersecurity was an important issue for U.S.-China relations, and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang agreed in his speech. The cybersecurity discussion -- a thorny one -- apparently did not lead to an agreement by the end of the summit, though experts told PolitiFact it may have been covered within the 127-point list by point 4, which confirmed the existence of "candid, constructive discussions between the two sides on strategic security issues." The biggest problem with Fiorina’s claim, though, is that it fails to account for significant developments later in 2015. The most important of these is an agreement on cybersecurity between the United States and China announced in September. That came almost three months before Fiorina posted her column. On Sept. 24 and 25, Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China for a state visit. During that visit, the two leaders announced an agreement on cybersecurity. Here are some of the key elements the two countries agreed on: • Cooperation on investigating malicious cyber-activities coming from their territory; • A pledge not to conduct or knowingly support cyber-theft of confidential business information to aid companies or industries; • Efforts to promote international consensus on norms for state behavior in cyberspace; • Creation of a "high-level joint dialogue" on cybercrime with regular meetings, as well as a "hotline" to prevent the escalation of issues. "This was important, because China accepted that states should not conduct cyber espionage against commercial entities to create competitive advantage," said Adam Segal, senior fellow for China studies and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. And there have been notable developments since then, Segal has written: "There was positive follow up in the first round of cyber talks between the Department of Homeland Security and Chinese Ministry of Public Security in December 2015" when the two sides "agreed on guidelines for requesting assistance on cybercrime or other malicious cyber activities, as well as to conduct ‘tabletop exercises’ in spring 2016 and to define procedures for use of the hotline." In addition, since Xi’s visit, the White House has worked to advance cybersecurity policies with other countries. A similar agreement between the United Kingdom and China has been struck, and there are indications that Germany would sign a "no cyber theft" deal with Beijing in 2016, Segal wrote. Meanwhile, during the G-20 summit in November 2015, the White House announced that the leaders in attendance reached a notable consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace, including pledges not to "conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property." It’s worth noting that experts acknowledge significant difficulties in enforcing cybersecurity agreements. "Just three weeks after the agreement, cybersecurity companies reported new attacks on pharmaceutical companies," Segal wrote. Our ruling Fiorina said, "When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things — including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity." One document listing agreements struck during a June 2015 U.S.-China summit supports Fiorina’s point, but citing that one document is a case of extreme cherry-picking. Three months later -- and three months before Fiorina published her article -- the United States and China struck a significant cybersecurity agreement, and since then, the countries have taken steps to implement the agreement and forge cybersecurity agreements with other nations. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08252	"Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/12/michael-murphy/milwaukee-alderman-michael-murphy-says-mequon-and-/	Where in America is the gap largest between the haves and have-nots? Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy says it’s right here, in southeastern Wisconsin. At a Nov. 5, 2010, Common Council meeting, the chairman of the council’s Finance & Personnel committee said he fears there will be cuts in shared revenue that the state gives to cities. If there are, Murphy said, he hoped they would adhere to the shared revenue formula, which takes into account the higher level of poverty in Milwaukee versus cities such as Mequon. Then Murphy declared: "Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country." Mequon is well known to be one of Milwaukee’s most well-to-do neighbors. And for years Milwaukee has ranked among the nation’s most impoverished cities -- a ranking reconfirmed by U.S. Census data released in September. But in a nation filled with poor cities and wealthy suburbs, is the largest chasm really between Milwaukee and Mequon? Murphy, a 21-year alderman not known for hyperbole, cited U.S. census figures to back up his statement: Based on the most recent data, 31.9 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000 and 1.9 percent of Mequon families did. That’s a gap of 30 percentage points. When asked about his statement by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Murphy said: "I can’t imagine there’s anywhere in the country that beats that." Not the strongest start when it comes to research methodology. "If I’m wrong," Murphy added, "I’ll be happy." OK. Let’s find out. Murphy told us he was referring to big cities and suburbs that share a border. That’s an unconventional way to look at it -- for instance, it includes Mequon, in Ozaukee County, but not River Hills in Milwaukee County. But we’ll start there. For the numbers, Murphy used 2009 figures for Milwaukee and 2006-2008 numbers for Mequon -- cities its size are not updated as frequently as Milwaukee. We can make a better comparison -- between Milwaukee and Mequon, and between other U.S. cities and their suburbs -- by using 2006-2008 census figures for all of them. Those figures show 27.5 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000. That means the gap between Milwaukee and Mequon was 25.6 percentage points. That’s our marker, as we look at other communities. We didn’t look at every major U.S. city and its suburbs. But with just a few checks -- focusing on cities near Milwaukee on the income scale -- we found two city-suburb combinations that had larger income gaps. In Cleveland, 36.2 percent of families had incomes of less than $25,000. In neighboring Shaker Heights, the figure was 7.8 percent. That’s a gap of 28.4 percentage points. In Hartford, Conn., 41.4 percent of families had incomes of less than $25,000. In neighboring West Hartford, the figure was 4.8 percent, for a gap of 36.6 percentage points. There may well be others with a greater disparity, but we stopped there. Meanwhile, what about other suburbs in the Milwaukee area -- those that don’t necessarily share a border with Milwaukee? For communities with a population under 20,000, the most recent figures for families with an income of less than $25,000 are from the 2000 census. Using those numbers, we looked at each community in Milwaukee, Ozaukee and Waukesha counties. In Milwaukee, 31.9 percent of families earned less than $25,000 and in Mequon the figure was 3.7 percent. But the gap was even larger between Milwaukee and six other suburbs, all in Waukesha County: Chenequa (3.3 percent), North Prairie (3.2 percent), Town of Delafield (3.2 percent), Wales (3 percent), Genesee (2.8 percent) and Merton (2.7 percent). Of course, Murphy was making a national comparison. And the approach he used was just one way of looking at income disparity in a region. In an October 2010 study, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researcher Lois Quinn looked at 55 metropolitan areas and what percentage of the poor residents in each -- those with income below the federal poverty level -- lived in the major city. For Milwaukee, 73.2 percent of the area’s poor residents were in the city. In contrast, Lincoln, Neb., was home to 94 percent of that metro area’s poor. Several others, based on the data available, also had higher percentages. Using a different measure, median income, a 2010 study by the Brookings Institution also cited Milwaukee as among the metro areas with high city-suburb income disparity -- but again not the highest. In Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit, the gap in median income between the city and its suburbs reached nearly $30,000 in 2008, the study said. But the gap reached $40,000 between two Connecticut cities -- Hartford and Bridgeport -- and their suburbs. To be sure, the city’s poverty rate is among the highest in the nation -- a stubborn statistic that has defied efforts by policymakers and politicians to change it. But in neither measure was the city’s disparity gap at the top. OK, enough numbers. What do they show us? In making a point about how state shared revenue should be distributed to cities, Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy said the largest income disparity in the country is between Milwaukee and Mequon. While comprehensive studies have ranked Milwaukee near the top in income disparity, Murphy went too far in lining Milwaukee up against neighboring Mequon. With just a little checking, we found two city-suburb combinations that have a larger disparity. Murphy said he’d be happy if proven wrong, since that would mean Milwaukee doesn’t have the worst income disparity. Put a smile on your face, alderman: We rate your statement False.

"Let’s start with the premise that Rhode Island already has one of the 10 strictest [gun laws] amongst all the states," the Cranston Democrat told The Journal. "...An assault weapons ban? Tell me how that helps anybody." Yes, let’s start with that premise. In fact, let’s focus on it. Is Rhode Island among 10 U.S. states with the most stringent controls on guns? We called Mattiello’s spokesman and asked him to find out where the speaker’s information came from. Meanwhile, we looked around on our own. It didn’t take long to find something known as the "Gun Law State Scorecard." Maintained by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the scorecard ranks Rhode Island No. 9 based on the strength of its gun laws. We found another ranking, also compiled in 2015, from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, another organization that supports stronger gun laws. The campaign is named, in part, after the late Jim Brady, a White House press secretary who was shot and disabled when a Texas man attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. One of the Brady Campaign’s web sites, CrimAdvisor.com, is a spoof on TripAdvisor. "Plan your perfect getaway," it says, on a web page that identifies the 10 most attractive states for getting a gun. Rhode Island is listed among the 10 least gun-friendly states with a ranking of No. 8. The law center, which was Mattiello’s primary source, was established in San Francisco after a 1993 shooting that killed eight and wounded six. The shooting, which took place at a law firm, led Bay area lawyers to create an organization that campaigned for a federal ban on assault weapons. Later, it focused on supporting state and local gun regulation in California. In 2015, the center worked on a variety of projects to support stronger gun laws across the country. And each year, the center analyzes state gun laws and grades each state on the "strength" of its regulations. Strength isn’t always the same thing as strictness, but it’s fair to say there are more gun restrictions in states that get the best grades. In 2015, Rhode Island’s grade of B+ gave it a ranking of No. 9 on the scorecard, just behind Illinois and just ahead of Delaware. A spokesman for the law center, Garrett McDonough, told us that he wouldn’t have used the word "strictest," but the center’s data does support Mattiello’s statement. "Our position would be that that statement is accurate," he said. "We don’t like to use the word strict because it makes it sound like it’s a prohibition or a restriction of people’s rights," he said. Other studies show that Rhode Island competes well in other statistics valued by supporters of gun control. One of them, the per capita rate for gun deaths, is low. Also, by a per capita measure, incidents of guns purchased in Rhode Island and then used in crimes out of state are low. Rhode Island’s per capita rate in this category was the sixth lowest in the country, according to a Washington Post analysis of gun trace data provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Our ruling The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence is an outspoken advocate for gun control laws. And its legal experts rate Rhode Island among states with the strongest gun-control laws. The statement is True.	None	Nicholas Mattiello	None	None	None	2016-01-10T00:00:00	2016-01-03	['None']
pomt-12690	A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office "confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/14/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-partially-accurate-claim-republican-rep/	Big headlines on March 13, 2017 confirmed what many on the left had feared about the Republicans' proposal for replacing Obamacare: The American Health Care Act, as the plan is known, would increase the number of uninsured by 24 million by 2026. That projection was made in a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a gold-standard source for government information. But people on the right were ready with a response. In a statement issued the same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan began by making this claim: "This report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums." What we found is: It doesn’t, and then it does. And there’s more to the story. The report Let’s start off by making it clear that the Wisconsin Republican’s reference is to what is known as the individual or "nongroup" market -- that is, the roughly 7 percent of Americans who buy health insurance on their own because they aren’t covered by an employer or a program such as Medicaid. Here’s what the report says for those people: Increases: In 2018 and 2019, average premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. That’s mainly because the penalties under Obamacare for not getting insurance would be eliminated, "inducing fewer comparatively healthy people to sign up." Decreases: Premiums would start to drop in 2020. And by 2026, the premiums, on average, would be 10 percent lower than they would have been under Obamacare. That’s expected for several reasons: The GOP legislation would provide grants to states that could be used to reduce premiums; the bill would eliminate a requirement for insurers to offer plans covering certain percentages of health care expenses; and a younger mix of enrollees. While on average premiums are expected to eventually be 10 percent lower, the impact on different groups of people would be wide ranging. Under Obamacare, a 64-year-old can generally be charged premiums that cost up to three times as much as those offered to a 21-year-old. But under the GOP bill, it would be five times as much, unless a state chose otherwise. So, by 2026, premiums are projected to be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old — but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old. Some examples, for a people who earn $26,500 per year in 2026: The annual premium for a 21-year-old would be $5,100 under Obamacare, but only $3,900 under the GOP plan. For a 64-year-old, the premiums would be $15,300 under Obamacare vs $19,500 under the GOP plan. Finally, it’s important to look beyond what premiums will do. The report points out that compared to Obamacare, the GOP plan would require insurance plans to cover a lower percentage of total costs -- the insurance plans would have a lower "actuarial value," so lower premiums would be buying less coverage. For example, a person’s deductible is expected to be higher than under Obamacare. Our rating Ryan says a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office "confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums." His reference is to people who buy health insurance on their own, rather than getting it from an employer or a government program such as Medicaid -- and how the Republicans’ American Health Care Act compares to the existing Affordable Care Act. For those people, the report expects average premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019, but by 2026 would be 10 percent lower. And the report also says that out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles, would tend to be higher than under Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-07172	"The average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/10/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-average-unemployed-worker-has-be/	In a recent column, Paul Krugman of the New York Times tried to put into context how bad the current job market is. "The latest economic data have dashed any hope of a quick end to America’s job drought, which has already gone on so long that the average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks," he wrote. We wondered if he was right. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that is the official source of employment statistics. BLS publishes statistics for "average weeks unemployed" for unemployed workers. For the most recent month available, May 2011, the figure was 39.7 weeks -- just as Krugman had said. We should note that BLS also publishes a second statistic that measures a similar concept -- "median weeks unemployed." The terms "median" and "average" refer to different ways of determining what is a typical case. Statisticians arrive at a "median" by listing all of the numbers by size and then locating the one at the exact midpoint of the list. Half of all examples on the list will be bigger than the median, and half will be smaller. By contrast, an average is determined by adding up all of the numbers on that list and dividing by the total number of items on the list. As it turns out, the "median weeks unemployed" statistic produces a number that’s quite different. The median unemployed worker was out of work for 22 weeks in May 2011 -- a little more than half of the average length of unemployment. This result likely happened because there were a modest number of people with very, very long unemployment spells, as well as a much larger number who had relatively short periods of unemployment. The small number with very long unemployment spells ended up boosting the average duration without moving the median very much. But does this difference matter in analyzing the accuracy of Krugman’s statement? Not much. For starters, Krugman’s underlying point -- that long-term unemployment is a serious problem right now -- remains true regardless of which measure you use. The "average weeks unemployment" figure hit a record high in May, while the "median weeks unemployed" figure hit its fourth-highest level ever. In fact, prior to the current recession, the average had only surpassed 20 weeks for several months in the early 1980s. And the median only broke into double digits during two prior recessions. Both of these benchmarks are only half the levels we’re seeing today. Also, the difference between average and median weeks unemployed has been more or less steady over the years -- pretty close to the same two-to-one ratio we see today. So today’s divergence between the two statistics is nothing unusual by historical standards. So, Krugman could have used a similar statistic that’s shows a much shorter duration for unemployment. But he was careful in his wording, referring to the "average unemployed American" rather than, say, the "typical unemployed American." And the two statistics tend to move in tandem, so we don’t think that either one is inherently better for describing the situation. We think he’s on safe ground using the 39.7 weeks figure, so we rate his statement True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2011-06-10T16:47:47	2011-06-09	['United_States']

pomt-05979	"While Romney was a director of the Damon Corporation, the company was defrauding Medicare of millions."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/23/afscme/was-mitt-romney-director-company-charged-medicare-/	A full head of hair on Mitt Romney’s head disappears as he morphs into a very bald, smiling Rick Scott. It’s an ad from AFSCME, a public workers union, that seeks to equate the Republican presidential candidate with Scott, the current governor of Florida. Scott’s approval numbers have been among the lowest in the country is recent months. "What kind of businessman is Mitt Romney?" the ad asks. "While Romney was a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions. Prosecutors called it ‘corporate greed run amok.’ The company was fined $100 million. But Romney himself made a fortune. Corporate greed … Medicare fraud. Sound familiar?" We’ve written frequently about Scott’s time running hospital chain Columbia/HCA and its troubles surrounding Medicare (You can read up on it here.) Here, we’re checking the ad’s initial claim, that while Romney was "a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions." Romney’s ties to a company charged with Medicare fraud haven’t been discussed much lately, but it’s old news to people in Massachusetts. The Boston media investigated the facts of the case when Romney ran for governor in 2002 and won. It’s also addressed in The Real Romney, a new biography by reporters with the Boston Globe. The story begins in 1989, when Romney was the head of Bain Capital, a private equity firm that specialized in buying troubled companies, turning them around, and then selling them for a profit. That year, Bain bought Damon Corp., a medical testing company based in Needham, Mass. Bain took the company public in 1991, and Romney served on the company’s board of directors. In 1993, Bain orchestrated a sale of the company to Corning Inc., getting a handsome return on its investment and earning Romney himself $473,000, according to The Real Romney. After the sale, Corning closed the main facility in Needham, laying off 115 people. In October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was providing doctors with forms that didn’t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren’t necessary, according to the Globe’s summary of the government’s case. The overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. "This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced. Romney was never implicated in the case. His role became an issue later, in 2002, when he ran for governor. Romney claimed that he helped uncover the fraud, but Globe reporting put that claim into question. The Globe reported that court records showed fraudulent activity occurred under Bain’s watch, and that prosecutors gave the credit to Corning for stopping the fraud. Aides later said Romney’s remarks that he helped uncover the fraud were misunderstood. We asked the campaign for comment, but we didn’t hear back. In The Real Romney, authors Michael Kranish and Scott Helman note that Romney seemed to have two views about what happened at Damon. "On the one hand, he said he hadn’t known what was going on at Damon; on the other, he said he’d helped to put a stop to practices later found to be fraudulent. One thing that looked good at Damon was the bottom line for Bain. In the end, it was a profitable deal for both the firm and Romney, however tainted by legal troubles and layoffs it may have been." Our ruling The ad claims that, "While Romney was a director of the Damon Corporation, the company was defrauding Medicare of millions." That's true, but Romney was never implicated personally with the fraudulent activity at the company, and it was one of many companies with which Bain was involved. It’s also difficult to assess whether Romney knew about the fraud or should have known, and what he did to stop it. So the statement is correct but leaves out context. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2012-01-23T17:35:04	2012-01-20	['None']
pomt-05650	"Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/21/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-90-percent-us-workers-are-emp/	Small businesses are such an integral part of the U.S. economy that, at least according to one congressman, nearly all American workers have jobs at companies with fewer than 100 employees. U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that statistic during a Feb. 23 debate against U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman at Passaic County Community College in Paterson. The two Democrats will face off on June 5 for their party’s nomination to represent the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District. The Pascrell campaign on March 3 posted video clips of the debate on the campaign’s YouTube channel, including one in which the congressman discussed his commitment to helping small businesses. "And what I am saying to you is that I have an obligation and a responsibility as a congressman to find ways to help small business," Pascrell told the crowd. "Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Pascrell’s claim is way off, because such companies employed about 35 percent of U.S. workers in 2009, according to business statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is the second time in less than two months that we’ve debunked one of Pascrell’s statistics on small businesses. In February, we gave him a False for claiming 62 percent of small businesses closed during the past five years because of health care bills. Let's explain his latest misstatement about workers at companies with fewer than 100 employees. In 2009, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed 40,128,249 workers, according to the census bureau. That’s about 35 percent of the 114,509,626 workers included in the census data. Those statistics exclude certain industries and most government employees, but are considered the "standard reference source for small business statistics," according to the census bureau. Pascrell campaign spokesman Sean Darcy acknowledged that the congressman "misspoke" and said he meant to say "businesses with fewer than 500 employees represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms." That statistic is accurate. According to the census bureau, of the 5,767,306 employer firms in 2009, 5,749,797 had fewer than 500 employees. Those businesses with fewer than 500 employees employed about half of the nation’s workforce included in the census data. Before we get to our ruling, it’s worth noting that the Pascrell campaign later made the video private on its YouTube channel. So, if you go looking for it now, it’s not there. Darcy told us the video was originally marked public by mistake. He provided this explanation in an e-mail: "We have a number of videos on that youtube channel marked private. We use it as a vehicle for the campaign to all view content without having to be in the same location. It is a common practice. "We have a huge amount of public content on-line on our pascrell for congress facebook page and our pascrell web pages and have been using these sites as a vehicle to get the campaign's message out. Not sure how you came across the one video that was on there in error but, essentially, you found a staff mistake." Our ruling In a Feb. 23 debate with Congressman Steve Rothman, Pascrell claimed: "Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that." But according to the U.S. Census Bureau, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed about 35 percent of American workers in 2009.

pomt-11434	Says "PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids" that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, "you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving."	true	/texas/statements/2018/mar/15/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-parents-ptas-kids-chaos-shooters/	Potentially fatal guidance for children has been conveyed to parents at PTA meetings while Congress avoids acting against guns used in school shootings, U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke told voters. At a Feb. 24, 2018, stop in Waco, the El Paso congressman said: "How" effed up "is it that PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids what they are supposed to do when some guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom – and you know what the message is today for those little third-graders and fourth-graders, and fifth graders – and I’m the father of a fifth-grader, a fourth-grader and a first-grader? The message today is you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving." O’Rourke went on: "And when the question is asked, how in the hell is that going to save my 7-year-old, or my 11-year-old, or my 9-year-old, they say, well, it might not, but what it will do is it’ll buy some more time for the other kids in the class. It will take 10 seconds if no one does anything and they’re slaughtered like sheep. It’ll take 20 seconds if there’s movement and activity and chaos in the classroom, and yes, most kids will die, but maybe two or three are able to escape through an open door in the midst of that chaos." O'Rourke, who subsequently won the Democratic nomination to face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November 2018, ranks among House sponsors of legislation to bar the future manufacture, sale or possession of 200-plus firearms including the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which was first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle. As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of the rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to the style of weapon as a "modern sporting rifle." O’Rourke camp cites Facebook post We inquired into O’Rourke’s basis for saying parents are taught at PTA meetings to coach their kids to create chaos when a shooter walks in. By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 14, 2018, Facebook post by Lisa Guthrie, who describes herself on Facebook as a resident of Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, Wash. Guthrie’s post says: "At a recent PTA meeting, we brought in some of the police officers who work closely with our school district to talk about ALICE, which is their approach to handling active shooter situations." ALICE stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate, a response to campus intruders developed by the Ohio-based ALICE Training Institute. Guthrie’s post continues: "One part of it is that if the shooter does enter the room where kids are at, the kids are told to run around, yell loudly, throw things like books or wads of paper, etc. Just be a distraction. At first I was like, really? You think a shooter armed with a machine gun is going to confront Samantha armed with a book and just say oh, never mind, I won't kill her? And then it punched me in the gut: If she's face to face with a shooter, she's going to die regardless. The goal will be for her and her classmates to make their deaths take 20 seconds rather than 10. That's 10 more seconds for other kids to run, 10 more seconds for first responders to get to the scene and take out the shooter. A lot of lives can be saved in 10 seconds... "Just to be clear," Guthrie’s post says, "this is the current state of affairs: We live in a country where kindergartners learn how to maximize the number of lives they can save as they're being massacred." Institute emphasizes actions to distract classroom intruders We tried to message Guthrie on Facebook and didn’t hear back. But separately Shannon Parthemer, a spokeswoman for the Lake Washington School District, which serves students from Redmond, east of Seattle, confirmed by email that district officials have worked with law officers to train staff and students with ALICE trainings offered to parents "so they can better understand what ALICE is and how its principles can help increase odds of survival and minimize the loss of life in the event of an aggressive intruder." Schools hold ALICE drills, Parthemer said, with lessons modified based on kids’ ages. "For example, young students (like kindergarteners), do ‘listening drills,’" Parthemer said. "These drills ask them to listen to the instructions of their teacher for a set period of time. This is a principle that would be important in the event of a true active shooter situation." At least once a year, she wrote, "our staff do an ALICE table-top exercise that allows them to talk through an active-shooter situation and determine what actions to take." Then again, Parthemer wrote, "these elements are not taught in the manner characterized" by O’Rourke. Asked to elaborate, Parthemer stressed that the guidance that children distract an intruder comprises only part of the ALICE training. In elementary schools, Parthemer said, students "are told to listen to their teacher and follow what the teacher asks them to do – lockdown, counter, evacuate, etc." Parthemer otherwise connected us to Liz Hedreen, president of the Lake Washington PTSA Council, who responded by email that she didn’t attend a meeting like the one described in the Facebook post; the district, Hedreen said, has 41 PTSA chapters "and each one runs their own meetings, so I don't have specific knowledge about what topics they have covered." Hedreen said, though, she’d heard a presentation about ALICE training at PTSA meetings at a local high school. Hedreen also pointed out a February 2018 district communication to parents mentioning the ALICE trainings. What the ALICE Institute says The institute says on its website that its training sessions "increase your children’s and employees’ odds of survival during a violent intruder event. ALICE Training," the institute says, "goes beyond lockdown methods by providing individuals with a new set of skills that will greatly increase their odds of survival during an active shooter situation." An institute video presents founder Greg Crane, a former police officer, saying that locking down a classroom can be viable strategy when a shooter enters a campus. "But it can’t be the only response," Crane says. "It is completely inadequate to teach people to only be passive and static when a determined attacker has decided they are his next victims." Crane elaborates: "There are no guarantees in life and we cannot guarantee that nobody will be hurt in a planned determined attack. But we do guarantee that by doing something instead of nothing, you will greatly increase the chances of your survival." Another video shows students and school employees acting out what they’d do if an armed intruder entered their high school. The narrator says that after alerting others via the school’s intercom system, students start to evacuate. Next, a teacher is seen telling students: "Guys, you need to grab some books. If the intruder walks in, we have to throw them at him." The narrator says that when an intruder enters the classroom, throwing books and desks and yelling and "even charging the intruder gives yourself and your students a better chance to survive." Next, students throw books at a classroom intruder before rushing him and driving him to the floor: SOURCE: "ALICE Training," ALICE Training Institute, posted to YouTube Oct. 14, 2014 In another video, a teacher reads an institute book for children, "I’m Not Scared, I’m Prepared!" In the book, the teacher drills students to follow her directions if a dangerous person enters the school. The teacher says students should look around and pick up something "easy to throw," such as a shoe, a block of wood, TV remote, paperback book, video game "or even a plastic goat." The teacher tells students to throw the items at the intruder before running zig-zag out of the school while waving hands and making strange noises. ALICE leader: Training about preparation We separately connected by phone with Crane, who lives in Texas. Nationally, Crane told us, the institute has touched down in every state with 3,700-plus districts having taken ALICE trainings and it wouldn’t surprise him that parents have learned of the institute’s guidance at PTA meetings, perhaps through presentations by local police. "It’s all about preparation," Crane said. "We have a choice to make. We can teach them to be passive and static or we can teach them to help themselves." Disrupting or interrupting a shooter, Crane said, drives down his accuracy. "If I can keep him from accurately targeting me, his miss rate goes up," Crane said. Crane noted too that a 2013 federal guide for schools states that if an active shooter enters a school, teachers and administrators have options other than locking down classrooms. The publication states: "There are three basic options: run, hide, or fight. You can run away from the shooter, seek a secure place where you can hide and/or deny the shooter access, or incapacitate the shooter to survive and protect others from harm." It goes on: "As the situation develops, it is possible that students and staff will need to use more than one option. During an active shooter situation, staff will rarely have all of the information they need to make a fully informed decision about which option is best. While they should follow the plan and any instructions given during an incident, often they will have to rely on their own judgment to decide which option will best protect lives." The guide also says: "If neither running nor hiding is a safe option, as a last resort when confronted by the shooter, adults in immediate danger should consider trying to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter by using aggressive force and items in their environment, such as fire extinguishers, and chairs." Texas PTA not pressing for ALICE trainings Crane told us that 20-plus Texas districts have participated in ALICE trainings. Earlier, when we asked the Texas PTA about whether meetings in Texas have talked up the ALICE approach, Kirk Ward, the group’s executive director, replied by email: "Texas PTA has not organized or given direction for such meetings and trainings." Our search of the Nexis news database led us to confirm that a Texas district held an ALICE training over two days in August 2017. A June 2017 news story in the Cleburne Times-Review described the Keene district signing up for ALICE training. That story quoted the district’s police chief, Ronny Potts, saying that in an ALICE training he’d attended, he learned that when teachers and students hide underneath their desks, they are "sitting ducks." "With this ALICE training," Potts told the newspaper, "we're wanting to give the kids their own opportunity to make decisions to do what they think is the right thing to do." We got a phone update from Potts, who told us that by December 2017, employees at every district school had been trained in ALICE and, he said, the district had purchased 100 of the ALICE books intended for young children. "I’ve never been a big fan of waiting for your demise under a desk," Potts said. Disrupting a shooter, he said, weakens his focus. "What we’re trying to do is increase survivability." Our ruling O’Rourke said "PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids" that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, "you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving." O’Rourke accurately described one part of the ALICE training employed in school districts including at least one in Texas and another in Washington state.

pomt-15143	"In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/01/eric-bolling/fox-news-bolling-misstates-tie-between-gun-laws-an/	The murders of two television journalists in Virginia renewed the debate about gun control in America. On Fox News’ The Five, panelist Juan Williams said he feels more threatened by the number of guns on the street in New York and Washington, D.C., than he does by the militant Muslim group ISIS. Show co-host Eric Bolling shot back, "In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence." We decided to see if Bolling had his facts straight. We couldn’t find proof that he did, and neither Bolling nor Fox News got back to us to show otherwise. There is no hard and fast yardstick to compare gun laws across nations, but there are some rough indicators. The United States is unusual in framing gun ownership as a right, so at the most basic legal level, most countries begin from a more restrictive starting point. There’s helpful data on gun regulation in other countries from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. According to the group’s 2011 small arms survey, personal protection is not a sufficient reason to own a weapon in Australia and the United Kingdom. In fact, in the United Kingdom, the 1996 slayings of 16 school children in Scotland led to a ban on private handguns. Japan also bans handguns. Canada requires all would-be gun owners to get a license to own a gun. They must pass a background check and complete a safety course. If they then go and buy a weapon, they must register it. They can buy a gun for personal protection, but they must show that they face an imminent threat and that police protection is not good enough. In a previous fact-check, a researcher at the study center in Geneva told us that Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have some of the strictest gun regulations. Comparing gun violence The studies we found measured gun violence in terms of the rate of firearm-related homicides. By that standard, America ranks worst among every country of comparable economic status. David Hemenway at Harvard’s School of Public Health has looked at gun deaths across nations. "If we look at high-income countries, the weakest gun control laws are in the United States, and we have by far the most gun violence," Hemenway said. "At the other extreme are the U.K. and Japan, which have the strongest gun laws, and they have among the lowest levels of gun violence." The World Bank provides a list of high-income countries. Based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and reporting by the Guardian, America does top the list for the rate of murder by gun fire with a rate of 2.97 deaths per 100,000. Chile comes next, but Chile is not on the list of wealthy nations with strict gun laws. (The full list is here.) In the wealthy group with strict laws, the data undercut Bolling’s claim. Country Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population United States 2.97 Canada 0.51 Australia 0.14 United Kingdom 0.07 Japan 0.01 Source: UNODC, Guardian For the countries that have tougher gun laws but lower wealth than the United States, South Africa has a higher rate of gun violence, 17.03 deaths per 100,000, and Singapore has a lower rate, .02 deaths per 100,000. Our ruling Bolling said that countries with tougher gun laws have more gun violence. The data show that among countries more like America economically, nations with stricter regulation have much lower rates of gun-related homicides. South Africa has tougher laws but is much poorer, and it is the only exception. Bolling described a pattern that does not exist. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05624	Says he and President Barack Obama have the same position on gay marriage.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/25/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-he-and-obama-have-same-vie/	When it comes to marriage equality, Gov. Chris Christie’s position is clear: he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. In this regard, Christie said during a Feb. 23 appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program that he and President Barack Obama are like-minded. Christie, a Republican, and Obama, a Democrat, agreeing on an issue that has divided people across the nation? Not exactly, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The governor and the president agree on some issues related to same-sex marriage – but not all. Let’s review what both leaders have said about gay marriage. Christie opposes same-sex marriage and on Feb. 17 conditionally vetoed a Legislature bill legalizing it. In 2008, prior to the presidential election, Obama said marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Since then, he has said is viewpoint is "evolving," according to numerous published reports. In vetoing the Legislature’s bill, Christie suggested a referendum this November on gay marriage. Obama has opposed referenda on same-sex marriage, most recently legislation in North Carolina that would define marriage as between one man and one woman. So what do the governor and president have in common? Both have said they support strengthening states’ civil union laws. But unlike Christie, Obama has not answered directly whether he supports same-sex marriage. White House spokesman Brandon Lepow referred us to past remarks made by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney when we sought comment on Christie’s statement. "The President has long opposed … divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples," Carney said in January. Christie has the same view, according to an e-mail from his spokesman Michael Drewniak. "The Governor has proposed a strengthening of civil unions to ensure that those rights are appropriately enforced and administered under the law. The Governor has never spoken to the legislature’s qualifications to decide the issue one way or the other; he said what he would do with legislation if it was passed and did so (conditional veto), because it was against his beliefs. He said an issue of such magnitude and importance deserved to be put in the hands of the people, as a pathway for those who support same sex marriage to achieve it – if it was supported by a majority of voters. None of this is news, it’s been said multiple times by the Governor." But given their differing view on same-sex marriage referenda, Christie might have taken too far his claim of a similar view as Obama when program host Joe Scarborough asked, "Is there any space on your position on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's?" "Not that I'm aware of," Christie responded. Others disagree with the governor. "President Obama has taken a strong position opposing state efforts to put the rights of minorities up for a popular vote -- including most recently in North Carolina -- and the President is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination against LGBT Americans under federal law, like the so-called 'Defense of Marriage' Act," University of Pennsylvania law professor Tobias Barrington Wolff said in an e-mail. Wolff also was an adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign on issues affecting the gay community. Ned Flaherty, a Boston-based project manager for Marriage Equality USA, criticized Christie for going against the Legislature's vote, vetoing the bill and suggesting a referendum be held. "He’s turning to people in the business of having a pulse on the public and saying, ‘I don’t believe you,’" Flaherty said. Our ruling During a recent television interview Christie said he and Obama shared the same views on gay marriage. That’s true to a point – both leaders say they support civil unions and oppose discriminating against same-sex couples. But that’s where the similarities end. Christie supports a public vote in New Jersey on allowing same-sex marriage; Obama opposes such referenda. Christie opposes same-sex marriage. The president won’t answer the question directly.

pomt-04100	"I sponsored the amendment that expanded the hours of early voting so that people who have irregular work schedules could vote."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/15/don-gaetz/don-gaetz-says-he-backed-proposal-expand-early-vot/	Amid criticism of new Florida voting laws that were widely blamed for long lines at the polls, Florida Senate President Don Gaetz said he’s willing to revisit the rules during the upcoming legislative session. Gaetz voted for the controversial 2011 law, which among other things cut the number of early voting days from 14 to eight. Gaetz, a Niceville Republican, is not yet convinced the state needs to expand the number of early voting days, but he’s quick to point out that it is because of him that the state expanded daily early voting hours in the 2011 bill. "I sponsored the amendment that expanded the hours of early voting so that people who have irregular work schedules could vote," Gaetz said in a Jan. 11, 2013, editorial board interview with the Orlando Sentinel. "And I said if that amendment didn't pass, I would join the Democrats in resisting the proposal to limit the number of days of early voting." Let’s rewind the clock. Is Gaetz correctly characterizing the past? First, a refresher: The sweeping elections overhaul pushed by Republicans included a number of new restrictions on voter registration, political committees, the date of the presidential preference primary and, yeah, early voting. Before Gov. Rick Scott signed HB 1355 into law, early voting started 15 days ahead of an election and ended two days prior. Supervisors were required to provide voters with eight hours of early voting on weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as well as a total of eight hours during each of the two weekends. Voting on the Sunday before an election was popular among African-Americans who hosted "souls to the polls" drives. All told, supervisors had to provide 96 hours for early voting. The new law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight. Republicans said they thought the changes would save money, but Democrats accused them of trying to suppress the vote of liberal and minority voters, who prefer early voting. The new law also meant an end to the "souls to the polls" rallies on the Sunday before the election. The new law came with new restrictions for voting hours, too. Instead of eight hours of early voting per weekday, the law called for a minimum of six hours a day and a maximum of 12 hours a day. * * * Now we’ll examine what Gaetz had to do with it. Gaetz spokeswoman Katherine Betta directed us to this amendment introduced by Gaetz and the sponsor of the proposed elections overhaul, Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, on May 5, 2011. The amendment did three main things: It required local election supervisors to tell the Department of State 30 days in advance the hours and address of each early voting site; it reduced the number of days for early voting, as we have already explained; and it set the daily number of hours for early voting between six and 12 hours. The latter action is key to our fact-check. Gaetz said he introduced the amendment to give more consideration to teachers and military members who populate his former Panhandle district and may have unusual working hours. Voting days of 12 hours would mean voting would be available outside of the traditional 9-to-5 workday. Senate Republicans said they thought reducing early voting days would save money, but a few elections supervisors warned that 12-hour days might actually lead to higher overtime costs. According to news accounts, Gaetz said Republicans did not want to "dramatically reduce early voting." At one point during the legislative process, the number of early voting days was reduced all the way down to five. Republicans fended off Democratic attempts to restore the number of early voting days back to 14. Gaetz’s amendment, which offered eight early voting days, was adopted by the Senate and included in the final version of the bill that Scott signed. * * * Now we will address the claim that Gaetz offered the amendment as a compromise and threatened to join Democrats against the measure without it. We checked with the Senate’s former minority leader, Nan Rich, D-Weston, who said she had not heard about that. "I never recalled him saying he was going to stand with the Democrats," she said. "All I know is how he voted." We looked for comments Gaetz may have made on the Senate floor but didn't find any. In an interview, Gaetz said he did not remember exactly when and where he said he would side with the Democrats without the amendment. He ruled out saying it on the Senate floor or to members of the opposing party, though. "I may have said it in committee, I said it to my staff and I said it to the president," Gaetz said, referring to his Senate president predecessor, Mike Haridopolos. Some Republican leaders in the Senate wanted to cut the number of early voting days to eight without expanding hours to make up for lost time, said Diaz de la Portilla in an interview with us. He said he never witnessed Gaetz saying he would cross party lines over the early voting amendment, but "I know there were conversations." PolitiFact Florida has previously disproved the claim that the number of hours are the same. Under the new law, local supervisors may do a maximum of 96 hours. But they may also offer fewer than that. Gaetz declined to tell us what kind of changes, if any, he wants to consider in the upcoming legislative session, though he said he could see allowing for more early voting locations. He wants to wait for the findings of a special committee on ethics and elections headed by Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, before calling for across-the-board changes for every county, he said. "My attitude is that as we speak, Sen. (Jack) Latvala is conducting a hearing with election supervisors to try to find out what were the reasons that there were difficulties in some places," Gaetz told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Back to our mission: Gaetz’s editorial board comments that he sponsored the amendment that expanded hours for early voting and threatened to join Democrats in opposition if leaders did not agree to it. We cannot prove or disprove his claim that he threatened to side with Democrats. For this reason, we’re not rating this part of his statement. Gaetz did introduced the amendment that permitted more hours for early voting. But his amendment empowered supervisors to provide up to 12 hours of early voting a day. It was not an automatic expansion, and supervisors could actually choose to offer less time than the old law. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03564	Says it's "estimated that 300 babies a year are sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect; it is the most common birth defect in America."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/may/21/robert-deuell/bob-deuell-says-about-300-infants-leave-hospital-e/	State Sen. Bob Deuell, a Republican physician from Greenville, won Senate approval of a proposal that would have Texas join states that have a mandatory screening test for newborn Texans after telling colleagues: "It is estimated that 300 babies a year are sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect. It is the most common birth defect in America." Senators on May 13, 2013, agreed to name the proposed act after several infants who died young and sent the revised House Bill 740 back to the House, which later agreed with the changes and sent the final proposal to Gov. Rick Perry. The measure defines congenital heart disease as "an abnormality in the structure or function of the heart that exists at birth, causes severe, life-threatening symptoms, and requires medical intervention within the first few hours, days, or months of life." We wondered about the number of U.S. babies sent home with such a defect unrecognized and if it is the country’s most common birth defect. Deuell aide Scot Kibbe referred us to Kevin Cruser, chief of staff to Rep. Myra Crownover, the legislation’s primary author, who said information disseminated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports the senator’s claim. Cruser pointed out a CDC web page including a link to the abstract of a 2002 research paper gauging variations in the incidence of congenital heart disease based on reviewing 62 studies published after 1955. The CDC page says that about 18 of every 10,000 babies annually born in the United States have "critical congenital heart defects," also known as critical congenital heart disease, usually requiring surgery or interventions involving a catheter in the first year of life. Such defects can potentially be detected, according to CDC, using a test that determines the amount of oxygen and the baby’s pulse rate; the Texas legislation would mandate it. More from the CDC web page: "Some babies born with a heart defect appear healthy at first and can be sent home with their families before their heart defect is detected. It is estimated that about 300 infants with an unrecognized" congenital heart defect "are discharged each year from newborn nurseries in the United States. These babies are at risk of having serious complications within the first few days or weeks of life and often require emergency care." The mention of 300 is accompanied by a footnote indicating it came from a 2007 research paper, which was based on a review of hospital discharge records for infants in New Jersey born from 1999 to 2004, with the purpose of identifying newborns who were sent home as normal newborns only to be admitted later with diagnoses of congenital heart defects, according to an online summary. The study’s lead author was Tajwar Aamir, a physician then employed by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, whose spokeswoman, Donna Leusner, emailed us a copy. The researchers’ review of more than 670,000 births ultimately suggested that 47 babies--or some 7 per 100,000--had gone home from the hospital with what proved to be a delayed diagnosis of a critical congenital heart defect that might have been detected with the "pulse oximetry" test, though the study also said that on average, there were seven to eight newborns a year "who met the case definition of delayed diagnosis of a critical" congenital heart defect "after medical chart review." In addition, the authors aired a higher figure for unrecognized heart defects: "This study validates the estimate of 9 in 100,000 births on screening newborn infants for critical congenital heart defects as the number of newborns missed by fetal ultrasound and discharge examination that might be identified by a screening program," the researchers wrote. "The average delay in diagnosis was approximately six weeks," the study says, and about 40 percent of the infants ended up in the emergency room. The study did not say that nationally, 300 newborns a year leave the hospital with undiagnosed heart defects, so we sought more expertise. By email, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute told us through spokesman Curtis Carey that heart defects are the nation’s leading birth defect. And according to institute experts, who he did not identify, the 7-in-100,000 unrecognized heart defects identified in the New Jersey study would reasonably fuel the conclusion that nationally, about 280 babies go home each year with "missed or delayed" diagnoses of heart defects, though that ratio is likely low because the study may have underestimated the number of unrecognized conditions by reaching conclusions based on hospital paperwork alone. In a telephone interview, Richard Olney, medical officer for CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, said the 300 figure has been extrapolated from the New Jersey study, given that 4 million babies a year are born in the U.S. Olney called the 300 figure a "rough estimate," adding that researchers are trying to update the calculation based on data from more states. Olney said the other part of the senator's statement--that heart defects are the No. 1 birth defect--holds up. Some 3 percent of U.S. babies are born with some kind of defect, he said, counting 1 percent of babies with a heart condition. "We’re trying to find the causes. In many cases, we don’t really know the causes," Olney said. Our ruling Deuell said 300 babies a year "are sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect; it is the most common birth defect in America." The 300 figure lacks a bit of clarification; it draws loosely from a one-state study published in 2007. Also, additional research is in the works. But the No. 1 status of heart defects is confirmed by the federal government. We rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Robert Deuell	None	None	None	2013-05-21T12:23:08	2013-05-13	['United_States']
pomt-10792	"Rural schools enroll 40 percent of American children, but receive only 22 percent of federal education funding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/10/john-edwards/not-the-funding-gap-he-claims/	Former Sen. John Edwards says he cares passionately about rural schools. He is, in fact, a product of them. Felt like a "hick" as the first member of his poor family to go to college. And Edwards wants to do more for rural schools, to give more children like him the chance to have experiences like his. But this statement, made during his education platform speech, falls flat on fact. One need only to look at the very sources his campaign cites as his supporting documents — the National Education Association and the National Center for Education Statistics — to see that the former vice presidential candidate and his team read the headlines, but not the details. The NEA actually says on its Web site that rural — and small — schools account for 40 percent of the nation's public school students. In an e-mail, a spokesman for the NEA said rural schools alone enroll about 20 percent of the nation's students. That fits with the National Center for Education Statistics breakdown of figures in a June 2007 report. That report shows that rural schools account for 31 percent of the nation's schools and enroll 21.3 percent of the nation's students. Those schools get 18 percent of all federal funding, not 22 percent, the NCES report further shows. That's actually lower than what Edwards said, but since the enrollment is half of what Edwards claimed, the big disparity he was seeking to illustrate just isn't there. Using sources provided by his own campaign, we rate this Edwards statement to be "False."	None	John Edwards	None	None	None	2007-10-10T00:00:00	2007-09-21	['United_States']
pomt-01760	Says John Cornyn dodged the draft during the Vietnam War.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jul/31/david-alameel/david-alameels-claim-john-cornyn-dodged-his-draft-/	David Alameel, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee in Texas, told delegates to his party’s convention that he joined the military when his Republican foe, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, was ducking the Vietnam War. Alameel, a wealthy investor, said in June 2014: "My wife and I struggled. There were times when we couldn’t even afford to buy milk for our baby. … So I joined the military at a time in the early 1970s when John Cornyn decided to dodge his draft simply to go to college." A day earlier, according to a news blog post by Jonathan Tilove of the Austin American-Statesman, Alameel told the party’s veterans caucus: "I served and Cornyn refused to serve. He sent a letter, `I can’t serve because I'm simply going to go to college.’" Draft dodger – the term conjures up images of Americans unwilling to serve their country and sneaking off to Canada or faking injuries or pulling strings to avoid military service. Then again, according to a 1993 book on the draft by George Q. Flynn, more than 2 million college-going men put off being drafted in the era by seeking and receiving student deferments from the government that legally sheltered them as long as they stayed in school and kept up grades. Cornyn, who received his bachelor’s degree from San Antonio’s Trinity University in 1973, has said he was among them. Alameel declines to elaborate Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn’s campaign, asked us to review Alameel’s claim. For starters, we asked Alameel, who served in the Army in 1974-77, how he reached his assessment. Sergio Cantu, an Alameel spokesman, said by email the campaign would discuss "Cornyn’s draft dodging at the appropriate time." Earlier, Cornyn’s campaign said he had a student deferment in his Trinity years, according to a July 4, 2014, Statesman news story. How the draft worked PolitiFact New Jersey said in a 2013 fact-check the draft was in place for young men from August 1964 through December 1972. In the end, some 25 percent of the 6 million men who served during the Vietnam conflict were draftees, Flynn said in his book. Generally, men who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, a Selective Service System spokesman advised. A local draft board decided whether to grant any requested waiver. "For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments," Pat Schuback of the Selective Service System said. "If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment." Another factor emerged. Flynn wrote that President Richard Nixon, with congressional approval, launched an annual lottery in November 1969 that was pitched as randomizing which men were most likely to be called up through the draft. Cornyn’s draft status Cornyn has previously said he landed a low draft lottery number, 28, which meant he was likely to be called up, according to a Sept. 29, 2002, Associated Press news story. According to a Selective Service System web page, that number went to every man with Cornyn’s birth date, Feb. 2, 1952. After that August 1971 lottery, anyone with a lottery number of 95 or lower and who was classified as available for military service was called to report for possible induction, the page says. But Cornyn, on the verge of his junior year at Trinity, wasn’t classified as available for service. In 2002, he said he’d sought a student deferment. "I thought college was important," Cornyn said, "and I think certainly I would have been willing to go if we had continued to have a draft at the end of my college deferment." To our inquiries, Selective Service emailed us a form showing Cornyn, listing his occupation as a Trinity student, registered for the draft as he turned 18 in February 1970. We also fielded an undated Selective Service roster with handwritten entries for Cornyn and more than 25 other draft registrants showing how each man was annually classified by the government. The Cornyn entry on the roster states he initially fielded a 2-S (student) deferment on April 15, 1970 and that status was renewed in October 1970 and November 1971, or about three months after he drew his lottery number. According to the document, though, Cornyn was classified as 1-A, or available immediately for military service, on Nov. 17, 1972 before being classified as 2-S afresh on Jan. 18, 1973, a few months before he fielded his degree. Meantime, Nixon, who sought an all-volunteer Army, had announced in June 1972 that no more draftees would be sent to Vietnam, Flynn wrote in his book. Did Cornyn dodge draft? After the Democratic convention, Alameel told the Statesman he had a copy of Cornyn’s letter (which Alameel did not make public) saying he couldn’t serve because he was going to college. Alameel said the letter was the standard student deferment request. "That’s the standard definition of dodging the draft — `I want a deferment, and I want to go to college’ — and then he never went back," Alameel said. "He didn’t say, `Give me four years, and I’ll come back and serve.’ "I don’t know how else to define that," Alameel said. Alameel’s definition of a draft dodger isn’t generally embraced. Schuback previously told PolitiFact New Jersey a draft dodger isn’t someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service. "A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft)," he said. We reached out to historian Michael S. Foley, author of a book on draft resistance during the Vietnam War. By email, Foley said that before the draft lottery began, seeking and receiving a student deferment was "totally legal and millions of men did it. That’s not draft dodging, certainly not in the way that emigrating to Canada or faking a physical/mental ailment or getting an influential father to pull strings with the draft board would be considered draft dodging." On the other hand, Foley said, if "you believe that every draft-age man should have made himself available for service during the Vietnam War, then that means 20+ million men were draft dodgers -- a pretty extreme view." Foley also viewed the documents we’d fielded touching on Cornyn’s Selective Service history. He then wondered, by email, how Cornyn could have still not been drafted despite getting a low lottery number. We asked Selective Service about that. By email, Schuback provided the agency’s summary of changes in regulations after Nixon signed a September 1971 act into law described in Flynn’s book as giving the president the discretion to phase out student deferments. According to the summary, men who had qualified for a student deferment in the regular 1970-71 school year would "be able to obtain deferments" going forward at least "until they graduate." Cornyn (who got his lottery number after that school year) fit that description, according to the documents we received. The summary went on to say men not qualified for a student deferment in 1970-71 would not be qualified to get one going forward. Our ruling Alameel said Cornyn "dodged" the draft during the Vietnam War. This claim puts no stock in Cornyn registering for the draft and qualifying for student deferments, which many men eligible for service took. These men weren’t draft dodgers in the conventional sense of that term; none fled the country or the like. A government document even suggests Cornyn was briefly classified as available for immediate service. Alameel offered nothing but mention of Cornyn seeking a deferment as the basis of his claim which, all told, we find factually unsupported and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04670	"We've got 7.2 percent unemployment (in Ohio), but when you include the folks who have stopped looking for work, it's actually over 10 percent."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/07/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-ohios-jobless-rate-would-top-10-p/	Ohio's employment picture has improved since the 2010 midterm elections. It's a positive development that, with a presidential election approaching, becomes something of a double-edged political sword. Gov. John Kasich likes to talk about the state's job growth and lowered unemployment rate on his watch -- though an improving economy is also considered a favorable indicator for President Obama, a Democrat. Sen. Rob Portman, who chairs Mitt Romney’s campaign in Ohio, faced the dilemma of addressing it on Fox News when host Sean Hannity noted how "the economy has improved since John Kasich has been governor." Portman replied that Kasich has done a good job, but is "still facing the headwinds from Washington." Unemployment is still relatively higher than what Ohio is used to, he said. "I mean, you look at it compared to, you know, where we've been in the past. We've got 7.2 percent unemployment, but when you include the folks who have stopped looking for work, it's actually over 10 percent." Portman said something similar about the national jobless rate early this year. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim as Half True. We asked his office to back up his statement about Ohio. His staff cited the same national data that it provided for his earlier statement. It relies on calculations for the labor force participation rate. Here’s how it works: The figure, calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the percentage of the population age 16 or older that is either employed or actively looking for a job. People in the military and medical or penal institutions are excluded. The general unemployment rate does not count people who have stopped looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. According to the BLS, labor force participation has fallen from 66 percent of the population to 63.7 percent since December 2007. That indicates many workers have dropped out of the labor force. If the percentage were still at 66 percent, the labor force -- about 155 million people in July -- would be about 5.6 million people larger, Portman's office said. "It’s reasonable to assume that these people would be working if they could (there is no other reason for the labor force participation rate to suddenly drop so much)." Adding those people back into the labor force would raise the number of unemployed from 12.8 million to 18.4 million people, Portman’s office said, because there wouldn’t automatically be additional jobs for them. As a result, unemployment would be about 11.5 percent -- well above the 10 percent cited. But there’s a catch. That's a national number. On Fox, Portman was talking about Ohio. We did the math for Ohio, using the most recent figures from the BLS. Those figures, for July, show a labor force participation rate of 63.8 percent and a total population of about 9.04 million, for a labor force of about 5.77 million persons. A participation rate of 66 percent would mean a larger Ohio labor force -- abouit 5.97 million -- and adding in the difference to the 417,937 unemployed persons in the state would show an unemployment rate of 10.3 percent -- over 10 percent, as Portman said. The other problem with that calculation, though, is determining how much of the decline in the labor force participation rate is actually recession-related. A January report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated about a third of the decline in labor participation between 2007 and the second half of 2011 reflected factors other than the recession, such as the aging of the Baby Boom generation into retirement. A research paper produced in March by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago attributes just under half of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2000 to shifting demographics that include retiring baby boomers and a decline in teens working. Retirement, disability, going to school or caring for household members are common reasons people give for not looking for jobs, according to researchers at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank who drew on federal data. A BLS economist declined to assess Portman’s calculations for our previous fact check, but did say that BLS would never assume that the extra people added to the workforce in a higher labor force participation rate would all be unemployed. He also noted that his agency tracks the number of people outside the workforce who say they want a job. Those individuals must have searched for work during the past year, but not the month before they were surveyed. Using that tracking, the BLS itself offers alternative measures of unemployment in addition to the official unemployment rate. One, the "U-4" unemployment rate, adds "discouraged workers" to the jobless rate. Those are people who have looked for work in the past 12 months but are not currently looking, for the specific reason that they believe no jobs were available for them. In Ohio, the U-4 rate from the third quarter of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012 averaged 8.3 percent. Another measure, the "U-5" rate, further adds "marginally attached" workers, who have looked for jobs in the past year but are not currently looking and could have cited any other reason for not looking. Ohio's most recent U-5 rate was 9.2 percent. The broadest category, "U-6," additionally counts people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. Ohio's latest U-6 rate was 14 percent. Portman's assertion is partly accurate. Nobody disputes his contention that the recession elevated the number of Ohioans who want jobs but are not seeking to be part of the workforce, and the state's official unemployment rate would be higher if those people were included. But there is no consensus on how to find the best alternative number. Portman was a little high on Ohio’s jobless rate for the BLS categories that include, in his words, "folks who have stopped looking for work," but he was in the ballpark. The U-5 rate puts it at 9.2 percent, and he said "over 10 percent." His figure was actually low for the broadest measure, but that includes people working part-time (less than 35 hours per week) for economic reasons. Those are important details that help to assess his claim and give it context.. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates as Half True.

pomt-12234	Says his job approval poll numbers are "not bad" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/donald-trump/trumps-false-claim-his-presidential-approval-ratin/	Six months into his presidency, Donald Trump is putting a positive spin on the latest round of public polling on his job performance. "The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!" Trump tweeted Sunday morning, July 16. The ABC News/Washington Post poll actually showed Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent — not almost 40 percent, as the president stated. We decided to fact-check Trump’s claim that his approval rating is "not bad at this time" by comparing his numbers to those of other presidents at the six-month mark. How does Trump’s approval rating compare to other presidents? Since the middle of the 20th century, pollsters have been systematically tracking responses to the question: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way (president’s name) is handling his job as president?" As a result, a modern-day president’s performance can be tracked against that of historical predecessors as far back as Harry Truman. So what to make Trump’s claim that his six-month approval rating is "not bad"? Before turning to that question, an important caveat is that a widely cited average of Trump approval rating polls by Real Clear Politics does show Trump’s rating hovering around 40 percent. But the focus of this fact-check is on the ABC News/Washington Post poll, because that’s the one Trump singled out in his tweet. According to Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post polling data, the average six-month presidential approval rating is around 62 percent — well above Trump’s approval rating of 36 percent. The results look even bleaker when Trump’s numbers are placed side-by-side with other presidents. According to data compiled by ABC News, Trump has the worst approval rating in the last seven decades compared to other presidents at roughly the same period in their presidency. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The second worst approval rating is that of President Gerald Ford, at 39 percent. Trump’s net approval rating (percent approval minus disapproval) of -22 percent is also a historic low since presidential polling of this kind began. Only two other presidents — Bill Clinton and Ford — had negative net approval ratings at this point in their tenure. "Politicians always want to claim they are doing well in the polls," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. "But Donald Trump’s claim that his ratings are ‘not bad’ compared to other president’s doesn’t square with available historical data, which shows his approval rating below all presidents for whom we have data at this point in their presidencies." Our ruling Trump said his six-month approval poll numbers are "not bad" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency. Not bad isn’t a scientific term, but by any sober measure Trump is performing relatively worse compared to his contemporaries, as well as any president since World War II. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10118	Under John McCain's health care plan, people get a $5,000 tax credit to buy a $12,000 health care policy, and "that's a loss for you."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/15/barack-obama/a-major-distortion-on-mccains-policy/	In the final presidential debate, Barack Obama attacked John McCain's health care policy as a net loss for workers. He was referring to a McCain proposal to repeal the traditional exemption on employer-provided insurance in exchange for a tax credit that will encourage workers to seek their own insurance. The credit would be $2,500 per person, or $5,000 for couples. In the debate, Obama got some things right about McCain's policy. Critics of McCain's policy do indeed worry that it will discourage employers from offering health care without lowering premiums for everyone. But Obama oversimplified drastically when he said, "By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you." To explain why this statement is problematic, let's get into more details about McCain's policy. Most Americans who have health insurance, about 71 percent, get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Typically, the employer pays at least half, and often more. Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is considered compensation and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers. McCain wants to encourage greater competition for health insurance as a way to reduce premiums. His idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives. So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own. It's a complex switcheroo, but there's ample evidence to show that the plan would be a wash for most workers. Keep in mind the current benefit is not worth $12,000, which is the cost of the average family plan; the benefit is the taxes on the part of that $12,000 that the employer pays. So if the employer picks up $8,000 of a $12,000 policy, the current benefit is the taxes a worker would pay on $8,000. The McCain campaign says only workers with "gold-plated" health programs would do worse with the new credit. An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms that: "In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today’s tax exemption. The gains are much smaller for higher-income people." Obama's numbers are wrong. McCain's health plan does not replace a $12,000 policy with a $5,000 credit. It replaces the taxes on part of that amount with a tax credit. We rate Obama's statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-15T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['None']

The article, which appears on the Goldwater, claims that Carole Paladino, a 72-year-old recently deceased New Jersey woman, "had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a ‘probable witness’ against the Clinton Foundation." The conspiracy website exploited the real death of Paladino and her husband. She was not set to testify against the Clinton Foundation. Facebook flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Multiple news outlets reported on the explosion at the Paladino home on July 7, 2018. Authorities did not suspect foul play as the cause, the reports said, but a gas leak instead. The website didn’t care about that, choosing instead to build a conspiratorial narrative built on Paladino’s contribution to a report that supposedly led to all New Jersey schools being forced to buy EpiPens. She was a retired school nurse. The website further embeds itself into false news territory by deeming this the fifth death in its "Clinton body count series." We’ve debunked similar claims about the Clintons getting involved in shady business and plotting to kill others before.

pomt-07965	"It is estimated that every $100 million spent on construction generates 3,000 new jobs."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/22/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-claims-his-4-billion-transportat/	Gov. Bob McDonnell has been pitching his $4 billion transportation plan as a vehicle that will deliver thousands of new jobs to Virgina. "It is estimated that every $100 million spent on construction generates 3,000 new jobs," McDonnell, a Republican, said in his State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 12. We kicked the tires on the governor’s claim. A spokesman for the governor steered us to a 2007 report by the Federal Highway Administration that examined the effect of road construction on jobs. The paper updated similar studies from 1997 and 2005. The FHWA says highway spending can create three types of jobs. There are construction jobs where people work directly on a road project or work to produce materials like the concrete, signs and guardrails. You also have supporting jobs, such as at a firm that makes sheet steel and sells it to the company that makes guardrails. And finally there are "induced" positions, which the FHWA says "includes all of the jobs supported by consumer expenditures resulting from wages" in the other two categories. For example, when the road builder and the guardrail maker go to lunch, the money they spend helps keep the waiter and chef employed, meaning their jobs are partially supported by wages earned from road construction. The report says $100 million in spending supports 1,030 construction jobs, 467.5 support industry jobs and 1,509.4 induced jobs. Add those figures up and you get 3,006.9 jobs. But, as TBD.com reporter Kevin Robillard pointed out when he examined the claim, the FHWA report has caveats. Some highway projects require spending to purchase right-of-way for new lanes or ramps, meaning there is less money available to spend on those construction workers. The FHWA says the average Federal-aid highway project has historically used 7 percent of its funds for land purchases. Those purchases would reduce the jobs created to 2,780 for each $100 million spent. And while the road crews would be working in Virginia, if any supplies came from outside of Virginia, then the state’s spending would be supporting jobs elsewhere. There is also no guarantee that the support industries or induced jobs will hire in the expected proportion. We called Bill Hecox, spokesman for the FHWA, to talk about the report. He warned us the employment figures "can change daily, or at least seasonally, because they vary with labor and material prices." Hecox said the FHWA has been down this road recently as reporters and politicians asked the agency to determine how many jobs were created by federal stimulus spending. The answers, he said, were really hard to come by because the seasonal nature of construction jobs and different conditions in each state make each road project unique. The spokesman also noted that spending sometimes has a role in preserving existing jobs rather than creating new ones. But he again warned of the difficulty of precisely calculating the value of the trickle-down spending. "It gets indirect, and how many ripples do you count?" he asked. "Do you count the guy selling bread to the restaurant? The tire company selling tires for the bread truck?" And if the current economic environment has taught us anything, it’s that improved spending and economic performance do not necessarily equal new jobs. American companies are increasingly adept at making do with a smaller number of more efficient workers. At some point might the company making guardrails decide it would rather invest in more efficient machinery and pay some overtime rather than hiring a new shift of workers? The report says that $100 million in spending "supports" 3,000 jobs. That is different from "generated," which was the governor’s term. The FHWA says the jobs figure "includes ‘new jobs’ to the extent unemployed labor is hired; ‘better jobs’ as currently employed workers move into jobs with higher compensation and/or full-time positions; and ‘sustained jobs’ as current employees are retained with the expenditure." These jobs are temporary. Spending $100 million creates 3,000 "person-years," the FHWA says, meaning it can support 3,000 jobs for one year or 1,500 for two years (or any other combination). But unless more money comes along, the positions don’t last. Let's review. McDonnell drew the data from a reputable government source. He used the most recent version of the study in making his claim. But there are several flaws in his conclusion. He wrongly says $100 million in construction "generates 3,000 new jobs." The FHWA says each $100 million block of spending "supported" 3,000 jobs, not created or generated. Much of that $100 million would preserve existing jobs, not create new ones, And of those "supported" jobs, just one-third are directly tied to the construction project. More than half are supposed to stem from trickle-down spending as the wages received by construction or other road-related workers are spent. If the wages get diverted to paying down credit card debt or saving for retirement, that spending is diminished. McDonnell had some rich data in his tank and overshot his exit. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06939	Says President Barack Obama’s "own economists say the stimulus cost $278K per job ‘created.’ "	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/20/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-presidents-economists-say-stim/	In a Twitter post, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst criticized the economic stimulus program that President Barack Obama signed into law two years ago, writing July 5: "What a nightmare! Obama's own economists say the stimulus cost $278K per job 'created.' " Dewhurst’s tweet included a link to a July 3 blog posting on the conservative Weekly Standard’s website headlined: "Obama's Economists: 'Stimulus' Has Cost $278,000 per Job." Earlier the same day, the U.S. House speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio, posted a similar claim linked to the Weekly Standard's blog. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a closer look. The Weekly Standard item cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers stating that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act "saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011." That report also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill's outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion. The $278,000 per job figure doesn't appear in the report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the report's low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars-per-job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000. The blog item contends this statistic "provides further evidence that President Obama's 'stimulus' did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt," and insists that "the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the 'stimulus' and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead." After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were "based on partial information and simply false analysis." Carney noted that the stimulus was "meant to do much more than just create and save jobs; it was also an investment in American infrastructure, education, and industries like clean energy … and investment in the economic future of America's working families." We checked the White House report, and of the $666 billion stimulus total, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; and 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps. The remainder, about 24 percent, was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement, health information technology and research on renewable energy. The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries — as the blog item implies. Lumping all stimulus costs together and classifying the total as salaries produces an inflated figure. Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report's low-end jobs estimate. Had it gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure. Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by the 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A "fact check" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math "satisfyingly simple but highly misleading." "Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output — a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid," the 2009 Associated Press item noted. The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually "has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs." It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs — or 288,000 more than it has now. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data. "It's not that ARRA (the stimulus) is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA's help," Zandi told Talking Points Memo DC. "This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery." The day after the White House responded to the GOP's dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but "rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000." Then again, this clarification doesn't fit with the blogger's earlier claim that taxpayers would have come out ahead if the government had just cut checks to everyone credited with getting a stimulus-tied job. Contrary to Dewhurst's statement, the cited cost-per-job figure was not aired by the Obama administration. At bottom, his statement leaves the misimpression that the money went solely for jobs rather than a range of projects and programs, including tax breaks. We rate his claim False. UPDATE, 4:45 p.m., July 20, 2011: After receiving feedback from a reader, we updated this item with further details about Recovery Act costs through March 2011.

Another side of that coin -- people living in the community on supervision who commit new crimes -- is what riles state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The suburban Milwaukee Republican is running in the 2018 race for the seat held by first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat. Vukmir addressed the issue during an Oct. 12, 2017 interview with conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Touting a bill pending in the Legislature that is aimed at offenders who are on supervision, Vukmir stated: "In 2016, there were 5,570 people who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked." Probation is often used as a blanket term that also includes parole and extended supervision. Taking that into account, Vukmir is partially on target: But the number is an estimate, not an actual count. And the estimate refers to people on probation who have only been charged with another crime -- not convicted, as she suggested. The law, the bill Under current law, if people are suspected of violating a condition of supervision, a state probation-parole agent has discretion on whether to recommend the supervision be revoked. If revocation is recommended and a state administrative law judge agrees, the person goes to prison. Under the plan advanced by Republican lawmakers, if the person on supervision is charged with a new crime, the state would require probation-parole agents to recommend revocation. The state public defender’s office has raised concerns, saying the bill would remove the ability of probation-parole agents to review cases based on individual circumstances. There is also concern about a change in the burden of proof: A person on supervision charged with a new crime could be sent to prison based on probable cause -- the standard for charging a crime -- rather than based on guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for a criminal conviction. The number As for the number part of Vukmir’s claim, it comes from a memo on the bill from the state Department of Corrections. The department estimates that in fiscal year 2016, which ran from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, there were 5,570 people on supervision who were charged with a new crime but were not revoked. The department said it made the estimate based on data from the Circuit Court Access Program (CCAP) on the number of people on supervision who were charged with a new crime during that one-year period. The memo said the department also assumes that if it had recommended revocation in those 5,570 cases, revocation would be approved for half of them, and the cost to the state prison system would be about $149 million per year. Our rating Vukmir says that in 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin "who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked." Vukmir’s probation reference appeared to include people who are on other forms of community supervision -- parole and extended supervision. Her claim is partially on target, but goes too far. The 5,570 figure is a state Department of Corrections estimate, not an actual count. And, importantly, it is for the number of people charged with a crime, not convicted.

pomt-00994	Says a "lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’"	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/feb/06/miscellany-blue/liberal-blog-says-nh-lawmaker-targets-planned-pare/	Funding for Planned Parenthood has become a divisive issue in New Hampshire over the past few years. Republicans have repeatedly tried to redirect taxpayer money away from family planning services because the funds go to organizations that also perform abortions. The group at the center of these debates is Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which bills itself as the largest reproductive health care provider in the region. And this year is no different. A recent headline in a liberal blog caught our eye: "Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’" It appeared on the liberal Miscellany Blue website. We’re not checking whether it’s accurate for Groen to say abortions are equivalent to "cutting children into small pieces," in this fact check. Instead we’ll look at the history of the bill and whether any state legislators uttered those words. The article points to State Rep. Warren Groen, a Rochester Republican, as both the sponsor of a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and the source of the quote. At the time the blog post was written, author William Tucker says, Groen was identified as the sole sponsor on a legislative services request. The full bill has since been written and posted online as HB 677. It’s now co-sponsored with Republican Rep. Richard Gordon of East Kingston. Neither current bill -- titled "an act prohibiting the use of public funds for abortion services" -- nor an earlier version introduced in 2011 target a specific, named group. Instead, they would affect all health care providers that also offer abortion services. The bill suggests that taxpayer dollars going to these groups indirectly subsidize abortions by paying for "administrative costs, overhead, employee salaries, rent, utilities, and various other expenses," and seeks to ban such funding. Of the affected providers, Planned Parenthood is by far the biggest. For 2014-15, it received $737,586 from state contracts, while the Concord Feminist Health Center received $73,218 and the Joan G. Lovering Health Center in Greenland received $89,214. It’s important to note that the state already bars direct public funding for abortions through Medicaid except in case of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. Groen’s bill specifically targets funding for other health services provided by Planned Parenthood and similar agencies. The blog headline is close to accurate, but it oversimplifies somewhat. The measure targets all abortion providers in the state, not just Planned Parenthood. And what about the "cutting children into small pieces" quote? It comes from a Feb. 9, 2011, Concord Monitor article about a legislative hearing on the earlier version of Groen’s bill. In the article, Groen is quoted as saying: "I'm amazed the only way we can find to deliver social services is by spending money on an organization whose specialty is cutting children into small pieces." Tucker says he highlighted that four-year-old quote because it referenced Planned Parenthood specifically, and because it was made in the context of a formal hearing. Groen’s latest bill hasn’t yet come up in the House. Groen is a longtime abortion opponent, and he’s been outspoken in his views. He has made similar statements recently, too. In the Dec. 20, 2014, Concord Monitor, for example, he’s quoted as saying: "Imagine how poverty-stricken the state has to be, when in order for women to get health care they have to reach out to an organization that kills babies for a living?" Reached by phone, Groen said the quote that ran in the Monitor in 2011 sounded "pretty accurate to me," and the quote that ran in the paper in 2014 was not exact but "reasonably accurate." He also criticized the news media’s focus on Planned Parenthood in the debate. Groen, referring to Planned Parenthood, said "they have all the money," suggesting the group was trying to turn his bill into an attack on them. "Every reporter wants to talk about Planned Parenthood," he said. "That’s very interesting.". We’ll note that abortions account for a small fraction of the of the overall health care services provided by Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. According to the group, its New Hampshire clinics were visited 22,283 times in 2013. Medical personnel at the clinics performed 1,573 abortions that year, accounting for about 7 percent of all visits. For reference, the clinics did 2,979 breast exams and 1,859 cervical cancer tests over the same timespan. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England only performs first- and early-second-trimester abortions. None would be considered late-term abortions, a type often highlighted by critics of the procedure, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Frizzell. State-level numbers for the number and type of abortions performed in New Hampshire aren’t available from the federal government, as the state does not report them. The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit spun off from Planned Parenthood, reports that 3,200 abortions were performed in the state in 2011. Our ruling A headline in the liberal blog Miscellany Blue declared, "Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’ " Groen’s proposal doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, but the effect of the bill would be to strip it, and other similar groups, of state funding. Meanwhile, Groen did make the statement about the group "cutting children into small pieces" four years ago, and he’s made similar declarations recently. We aren’t rating the substance of Groen’s accusations, but the headline summarizing what Groen said and what he’s proposing in the bill are generally accurate, so we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-15224	"Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/ben-carson/carson-says-usprotection-promises-led-ukraine-give/	Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson might be a superb neurosurgeon, but how well that has prepared him for the White House was one of the questions tested in the first GOP debate. Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Carson whether he would have used military force against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after there was convincing evidence that Syrian forces had used chemical weapons on its own people. Carson didn’t answer the question directly. Rather, he said reductions in America’s military forces have curtailed its options. He segued from that into the charge that America’s stature on the world scene has suffered. "Our friends can't trust us anymore," Carson said. "You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons." In this fact-check, we will look at whether Carson has his history straight. Was Ukraine a nuclear state? And did it give up its nukes with assurances that the United States would protect it? The answer to the first question is: not really. As for promised protections, the signed documents tell us that America pledged not to attack Ukraine, and that’s quite different from a promise to defend it. Ukraine, nuclear weapons and the end of the Soviet Union The 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union generated enormous concern over the fate of the nuclear arsenal it had spread across three states that were newly independent -- Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- as well as in Russia itself. During the first six months of 1992, Moscow was quick to retrieve all of its tactical, or short-range, nukes. Corralling the strategic weapons, such as intercontinental missiles and bomber-based warheads, was trickier. Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to dismantle or return what they had. But Ukraine looked at the roughly 1,900 warheads on its soil and began seeking something in exchange before it gave them up. Brian Finlay, a specialist in nonproliferation at the Stimson Center, a military-focused think tank in Washington, told us there was actually never any question that Ukraine would eventually relinquish those weapons. "They had announced that they would become a non-nuclear weapon state even before their declaration of independence," Finlay said. "Essentially, it was something that they traded off in order to encourage international recognition." According to a report by Steven Pifer, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine between 1998 and 2000, Ukraine wanted Russia to promise to respect its sovereignty and its borders, a promise that Russia made but has since broken. But just as important, Ukraine wanted money. The highly-enriched uranium in the warheads was valuable, plus Ukraine wanted somebody else to cover the costs of dismantling the silos and other infrastructure. And Ukraine knew that going non-nuclear would open the door to better ties with the West. Ukraine couldn’t launch a single missile While Carson called Ukraine a nuclear-armed state, Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact that there’s a big difference between housing a bunch of warheads and being able to fire them. "The Ukrainians did not, repeat not, ever have the ability to launch these weapons — which is what would have made them a nuclear power, as Carson claimed," Bunn said. "As you might imagine, command and control arrangements for intercontinental nuclear missiles are done very carefully, with an eye on security and making sure that nobody other than the authorized people can launch these things. There are codes and so on that are needed. Even when you’re the officer sitting in the launch control center, launching the thing can’t be done without relevant commands, unlock codes, etc. from above." Bunn said the Ukrainians were trying to figure out how to gain control of the weapons, but they never did. The only way they could be used was if the governments in Moscow and Kiev agreed to do so. Not only did Moscow hold the launch codes, but its troops had removed the firing systems on every warhead that was kept in storage in Ukraine. The deal that de-nuked Ukraine It took a series of agreements to finally clear the way for Ukraine to get rid of the weapons it held. Early in 1994, the United States agreed to provide money through the Nunn-Lugar program to dismantle Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure. Russia agreed to write down the debts Ukraine owed. In December 1994, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances. Pifer described in his report how Washington wanted security assurances that avoided creating broad guarantees. "State Department lawyers thus took careful interest in the actual language, in order to keep the commitments of a political nature," Pifer wrote. "U.S. officials also continually used the term ‘assurances’ instead of ‘guarantees,’ as the latter implied a deeper, even legally-binding commitment of the kind that the United States extended to its NATO allies." The agreement stated that the United States, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom reaffirm certain commitments: To respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. To refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine To seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. Pifer writes that American diplomats went so far as to make sure that the Russians and Ukrainians understood specifically that the English meaning of "assurance" was not the same as a "guarantee." In short, the United States never promised to protect Ukraine. All it did was promise not to attack it. Our ruling Carson said Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state and that it gave up those arms with the understanding that the United States would protect it. While it is true that about 1,900 nuclear warheads were on Ukrainian soil, experts make it clear that Ukraine merely possessed the weapons and had no ability to use them. Meanwhile, the security agreements struck after the fall of the USSR specifically avoided committing the United States to protecting Ukraine, instead committing not to attack the newly created independent nation. We rate this claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-08-07T17:14:57	2015-08-06	['Ukraine']
pomt-00892	"Research performed by economists has shown no consistent, positive impact on jobs, income or tax revenues arising from stadiums or sports franchises."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/07/steven-frias/ri-gop-official-steven-frias-says-research-finds-n/	Debate has begun over a proposal by the new owners of the Pawtucket Red Sox to move the team to Providence, where they want to build a new riverfront stadium. The project is still in the planning phase, but the owners have said they intend to ask for some financial support from the state and the city, including possibly getting the state-owned land for the stadium for free. But would a new stadium be worth the price tag? Rhode Island’s Republican National Committeeman Steve Frias says no. In a Feb. 24, 2015 commentary in The Providence Journal, he said giving away the valuable land, which was freed up by the relocation of Route 195, would be a mistake. "Research performed by economists has shown no consistent, positive impact on jobs, income or tax revenues arising from stadiums or sports franchises," Frias argued. We thought that claim was worth checking out. When we contacted him, he immediately referred us to a 2008 summary of research in the field by economists Dennis Coates of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Brad Humphreys of West Virginia University. The authors reviewed more than 40 academic studies, spanning nearly two decades, that examined public subsidies for professional sports teams. Their findings were clear. "There now exists almost 20 years of research on the economic impact of professional sports franchises and facilities on the local economy," they wrote, reporting that studies published in peer-reviewed economic journals show there is "almost no evidence that professional sports franchises and facilities have a measurable economic impact on the economy." And that's for major-league teams. In this case, we're talking about a minor league team, said Humphreys when we contacted him by phone. For example, he and Coates found no difference in economic impact between the years when teams were playing their regular schedules and five time periods when they didn't, due to strikes. And in a subsequent analysis, they found that having postseason games did not affect real per-person income in a city. Money may shift from one part of the economy to another, but there's no net benefit. The evidence is overwhelming, Coates and Humphreys wrote. "Economists reach the nearly unanimous conclusion that ‘tangible’ economic benefits generated by professional sports facilities and franchises are very small; clearly far smaller than stadium advocates suggest and smaller than the size of the subsidies." They also noted that in 2005, when a random group of economists was asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, "Local and state governments in the U.S. should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises," 28 percent agreed and 58 percent strongly agreed. That's a whopping 86 percent. Only 5 percent disagreed. There are special-interest reports that claim an economic benefit and contend that every dollar invested in a sports franchise generates a specific amount of money, Humphreys said, but those are never published in reputable journals because "you can make them say whatever you want them to say" by tinkering with the assumptions that influence how the numbers are crunched. We posed the question to other experts, including Rick Eckstein, professor of sociology at Villanova University and author of "Public Dollars, Private Stadiums: The Battle over Building Sports Stadiums." "There are absolutely no publicly subsidized stadiums and arenas that generate enough direct or indirect tax increases to balance the initial (and ongoing) public outlay," he said in an email. "In fact, some research suggests that sports stadiums actually decrease economic activity and tax revenue in areas where they are built," said Eckstein. "However, strategically placed stadiums and arenas can sometimes ride existing redevelopment trends, but they are never the cause of these trends." Coates and Humphreys said there are several reasons to explain a lack of economic benefit. In many cases -- and this would be particularly true in Rhode Island -- the state would simply be transferring the economic activity from one city to another. And even if more people went to see the Sox in a new stadium, when people spend to go to a ballgame, "local entertainment spending on sports increases and local entertainment spending on other activities like movies, bowling, etc. decreases." There are other costs people need to weigh, they wrote. "For every individual who derives enjoyment from the presence of the sports franchises in the community, there are likely to be other individuals who are uninterested in sports or even resent being taxed to subsidize an activity they have no use for." And the money used to subsidize a move might be better spent "for other public projects with higher social rates of return than a stadium" such as construction and maintenance projects, or even reducing taxes. Supporters of public support for professional sports teams often point to intangible benefits, such as boosting civic pride. But that argument is beyond the scope of this item. So here's the box score. Steven Frias said, "Research performed by economists has shown no consistent, positive impact on jobs, income or tax revenues arising from stadiums or sports franchises." It appears that he belted this one out of the park. We rate his claim True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-12608	Of "30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/03/patrick-gallivan/how-does-new-york-treat-16-and-17-year-olds-crimin/	New York remains one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. Some Albany lawmakers want all of them treated as children in Family Court instead. They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations. They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders. Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offender as a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating. State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults. "When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,"Gallivan said at a news conference. "Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. So, I would make an argument that we are already treating them differently." Is Gallivan right on the numbers? A commission's report The senator’s data comes from a 2014 report by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s Commission on Youth, Public Safety, and Justice. The commission convened to make recommendations on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison. That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000 resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013. Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing. In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year. Some 1,808 cases, about 5 percent, resulted in a jail sentence for lesser convictions. Defendants in the remaining cases were either found not guilty or received different sentences like probation or a fine. Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court. More recent data There were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016. Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction. Some 3,802 resulted in a youthful offender adjudication. The state said 581 cases, or 2.4 percent of all cases, resulted in a state prison sentence, while 1,072 cases resulted in a local jail sentence. Our ruling Gallivan, a former Erie County sheriff and captain in the State Police, said of "30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison." State data shows close to 96 percent of cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants did not result in a criminal conviction last year. Only 2.4 percent of these cases received sentences to state prison. That drops to less than 1.5 percent if you exclude youth offender adjudications. The state says both categories of offenders should be included in sentencing data. Gallivan is slightly off on the numbers, but his claim that few of these cases result in a conviction - and even fewer receive a state prison sentence - is correct. His statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Patrick Gallivan	None	None	None	2017-04-03T07:44:42	2017-03-27	['None']

pomt-00181	Says Beto O'Rourke "voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/oct/19/ted-cruz/did-beto-orourke-vote-10-tax-barrel-oil/	During their second televised debate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said that U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke voted in favor of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil. The comment was among many heated remarks the two exchanged three weeks before the midterm elections. About 11 minutes into the debate, WFAA-TV reporter Jason Whitely asked Cruz, R-Texas, about climate change. Whitely said Cruz is "clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence" to support the concept of human-caused climate change. Whitely noted that ExxonMobil says "the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action." He asked Cruz, "So, what do you tell Texas companies who think this really is a problem?" Cruz replied, "Of course the climate is changing. "The climate has been changing from the dawn of time. The climate will change as long as we have a planet Earth. I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers. I believe in science." Cruz ended his answer by saying Democrats are using climate change as a way to expand government power and control. "That has led, for example, Congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful to the people of Texas," Cruz said. "For example, Congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas. That would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas." O'Rourke denied the claim. "This is what you can expect over the course of this debate," O’Rourke said. "Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. That's why the president called him ‘Lyin’ Ted’, and it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true." We tracked Cruz’s claim back to 2016, when President Barack Obama proposed "more than $300 billion worth of investments over the next decade in mass transit, high-speed rail, self-driving cars, and other transportation approaches designed to reduce carbon emissions and congestion" and a $10 tax to support its funding, according to Politico. Republicans in Congress introduced a resolution condemning the proposal. Cruz’s campaign pointed to the language of that resolution to support the senator’s claim and later shared a link to an October 9, 2018, article from The Dallas Morning News about the claim. The Dallas Morning News article fact-checked O’Rourke’s and Cruz’s positions but didn’t say who was correct. The resolution states that "Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress finds that — (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the United States — (A) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (B) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil." The document concludes with the sense of Congress, which was "(1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and 2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production." That language is verbatim what House Concurrent Resolution 112 states. On the House floor, Republicans said funding should come from specific user fees and not a gas tax, that Obama's proposal would increase the cost of living for Americans and instead of talking about climate change, Congress should focus on improving economic conditions in the country, according to a list of actions compiled by C-SPAN. Democrats defended the proposal as a way to fight climate change and invest in infrastructure, and at least a solution on the table that can move the discussion forward. Democrats also criticized Republicans for not wanting to tackle climate change. O’Rourke voted against the resolution, but it passed mostly with Republican support. Cruz never got the chance to vote on it, though, because after it passed out of the House, the Senate received the resolution on June 13, 2016, referred it to the Senate Finance Committee and took no further action, according to Congress’ online bill tracker. Obama backed away from the plan and didn’t include it in his budget proposal. Congress’ online glossary defines a concurrent resolution as a "form of legislative measure used for the regulation of business within both chambers of Congress, not for proposing changes in law" and doesn’t require the president’s signature. In other words, the resolution condemning the oil barrel tax would not have had the force of law. We asked O’Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans for an explanation of the congressman’s vote. Evans said O’Rourke didn’t vote in favor of a tax and pointed to the same Dallas Morning News article Cruz’s team referenced. "As (The Dallas Morning News) points out, ’Legislation to enact a federal per-barrel oil tax hasn't even come up for a vote in the House since O'Rourke was elected in 2012,’" he said in an October 17, 2018, email. "Similarly, legislation that would enact a $10 a barrel tax on Texas produced oil has not come before Congress." Evans added that "the resolution in question was not a vote on imposing such a tax, much less did it mention anything about oil produced in Texas." "Beto voted against a non-binding resolution that voiced opposition to a proposal by President Obama to fund infrastructure investments," he said. "The proposal itself was never voted on. But put another way, had the resolution Senator Cruz names failed to pass the House, it still would not have enacted such a tax. There was no outcome from that resolution that would have imposed ‘a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas.’ Because, as I mentioned earlier, legislation to do that has not come before Congress." Our ruling: Cruz said O’Rourke voted in favor of a $10 tax on every barrel of oil. O'Rourke didn't vote in favor of a $10 tax. He voted against condemning a proposal to do that, one that wasn't even up for consideration in his chamber or the Senate. Also, despite Cruz’s suggestion, nothing about the proposal was directed specifically at Texas. Cruz’s claim thus has an element of truth but is otherwise off the mark. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2018-10-19T17:53:07	2018-10-16	['Texas']
pomt-05913	"Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/01/barack-obama/president-obama-says-master-lock-has-brought-back-/	President Barack Obama hailed the return of manufacturing jobs that had been shipped overseas during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 24, 2012. The president discussed companies that have brought back production after labor problems in China, economic issues and higher shipping rates added to costs. Obama said: "We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore. But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive." He added: "A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity." Master Lock hasn’t had this much publicity since it ran those "Tough Under Fire" Super Bowl ads showing their product surviving a sharpshooter’s bullet. Those ads ran for 20 years, starting in the mid-1970s. So what’s the latest at the company’s huge central city plant? The lock maker, a division of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., was founded in Milwaukee in 1921. Fifteen years ago, Master Lock had about 1,154 workers at its Milwaukee plant, 2600 N. 32nd Street, a sprawling facility that’s been described as the size of seven football fields. That year, Master Lock announced that it would begin importing locks from China, a move that began a string of large job reductions in Milwaukee. Two years later, the company announced that it would open a lock assembly factory in Nogales, Mexico. Because of the outsourcing and competition from those cheaper locks made elsewhere, employment in the Milwaukee plant fell to about 270 employees in 2003, the company said. The cost advantages of overseas production began to decline in the late 2000s. By the end of 2010, the company said, several dozen jobs were moved back to Milwaukee. Employment grew to 379, news reports said. In early 2011, company executives used the "full capacity" description of production in a Journal Sentinel story about the return of the outsourced jobs. That message returned at a White House meeting in January 2012, and again in the State of the Union address. The White House meeting was a "in-sourcing" forum. At that event, the president singled out Master Lock for praise. The company says employment in Milwaukee is now 412. Master Lock still operates factories in China and Mexico. So what does it mean when the company and Obama say that the plant is operating at "full capacity"? After all, there are nearly 750 fewer people working there than 15 years ago. Without providing specifics or revenue figures, Master Lock said in a written statement that the Milwaukee plant is a far different operation than it was in 1997. "The Milwaukee plant is producing parts and components at a much higher volume than in 1997, reflecting our regained market share and Master Lock's overall revenue growth, which is approximately double 1997 revenues," the company said. "Moreover, Milwaukee-made production is now being sold directly to Master Lock customers in China, reflecting its new competitiveness. Master Lock said it decided to "re-size and convert Milwaukee into a more automated and highly efficient manufacturer of parts and components regardless of final assembly destination." Such "lean manufacturing" efforts have paid off for many companies, said Nick Hayes, a partner with FiveTwelve Group Ltd., a business research and consulting firm in Milwaukee. Manufacturers can become far more efficient by using automation, high-tech equipment and streamlining the way they move supplies and inventory around a factory, he said. Hayes offered an example of a factory he worked with that adopted lean manufacturing. The company downsized from a 60,000 square foot factory and 100 workers to one that was two-thirds smaller, with half the work force. Production increased 10-fold. "The question I would have for Master Lock is how primitive were they before?" Hayes said. Consumer demand for the product is another critical factor, he said. And Master Lock indicated that sales had increased. Without providing specifics, Master Lock said it hoped to continue to add jobs in Milwaukee. "We plan to invest in the plant this year to add capacity as we in-source more work. We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers." Our conclusion Obama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. That’s the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and they’ve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation. We rate Obama’s statement True.

pomt-12286	When he was Milwaukee County executive, "eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/30/scott-walker/milwaukee-county-executive-scott-walker-didnt-hold/	Wisconsin Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan say they believe Republican Gov. Scott Walker will run again for president, even though his 2016 candidacy was short lived. And Walker, eying a run for a third term as governor in 2018, continues to stake out positions that draw praise from conservatives around the country, such as aiming to make Wisconsin the first state to drug test Medicaid recipients. Walker even touts his record as Milwaukee County executive, the job he held previously. He did so in a June 5, 2017 interview with Jerry Bader, a conservative radio talk show host in Green Bay, saying: "Eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year." It’s true that Walker never proposed to increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and that he tried, with vetoes, to stave off levy increases approved by the County Board of Supervisors. But saying he "pushed through budgets" suggests he was successful, when in fact he largely was not: In eight of Walker’s nine years as county executive, the levy increased. Let’s take a look. Walker’s evidence Walker proposed nine county budgets, for 2003 through 2011, before taking office as governor in January 2011. Working with a left-leaning County Board, typically there was a tug-of-war in which Walker tended toward lower property taxes and less spending, while the board would aim for more. Often there were Walker vetoes and veto overrides by the board. To back Walker’s claim, his staff pointed us to figures from the Milwaukee County budget archive. For his first two budgets, for 2003 and 2004, Walker proposed a property tax levy lower than what the County Board had adopted the previous year. But for both budgets, the County Board adopted levies higher than what Walker proposed. Ultimately, the levy rose in 2003 and dropped in 2004. Then a routine developed: 1. Walker would propose for his new budget a levy that was the same amount as the previous year’s levy. 2. The County Board would override Walker vetoes and adopt a budget that included a levy higher than what Walker proposed. 3. Walker would use that increased levy as his proposed levy for the next year’s budget. For example: Walker’s proposed levy of $225.9 million for 2006 was exactly the same as the levy that the County Board had adopted for 2005. But the levy that the board approved for 2006 was higher -- $232.6 million. And that was the levy Walker then made in his budget proposal for 2007. Here are the figures for the county budgets during Walker’s tenure: Year Recommended property tax levy and change up or down from previous adopted levy Adopted property tax levy $ and change up or down from previous adopted levy 2002 218.7,734,713 2003 218,708,524 ↓ 219,494.183 ↑ 2004 219,425,702 ↓ 219,436.418 ↓ 2005 219.416,093 ↓ 225,883,651 ↑ 2006 225,883,651 -- 232,592,517 ↑ 2007 232,592,517 -- 241,047,846 ↑ 2008 $241,047,846 -- $249,889,950 ↑ 2009 $249,889,950 -- $257,637,284 ↑ 2010 $257,637,284 -- $263,264,740 ↑ 2011 $262,264,740 -- $269,554,701 ↑ As we noted, Walker frequently used his veto in an attempt to freeze the property tax levy. For example, he vetoed all of the increase in tax levy spending that the County Board added in the 2011 budget. But the board overrode the vetoes. Our rating Walker says that when he was Milwaukee County executive, "eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year." It was actually nine straight years that Walker proposed budgets that did not increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected. But, to say he "pushed through budgets" that did not increase the levy is wrong. In eight of the nine years, the budgets adopted by the County Board -- over Walker’s vetoes -- raised the levy. And each year, Walker would use that increased levy as his proposal for the next year’s budget. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-15032	Says Scott Walker "said he wouldn't touch" the state civil service system but now supports overhauling it.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/02/jon-erpenbach/did-scott-walker-say-he-wouldnt-touch-wisconsins-c/	Anyone who thought Gov. Scott Walker would ease back into his day job might have been surprised when, three days after dropping his bid for the presidency, he threw his support behind yet another reform aimed at public employees: An overhaul of Wisconsin’s civil service system, which was created more than a century ago to eliminate patronage and cronyism in most state government positions. The Republican governor's announcement drew quick denunciations from state employee unions and Democratic lawmakers such as state Sen. Jon Erpenbach of suburban Madison. "He said he wouldn't touch the system, and now he's blowing it up," Erpenbach said in a Sept. 25, 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. Leaving aside the "blowing it up" characterization, both Erpenbach and Walker would agree that the measure the governor supports would make significant changes to the civil service system. The question is: Did Walker at some point say, as Erpenbach claims, that he wouldn’t make any changes to the system? Civil service origins, proposed changes The state’s first civil service law was passed in 1885, establishing a merit system for Milwaukee's police and fire departments, according to a legal article on the state’s court system website. Ten years later, the Legislature passed a law forbidding bribery and other corrupt practices in state and local government. Then in 1905, under Gov. Robert M. La Follette, a law creating the civil service system was adopted, with the original slogan of: "The best shall serve the state." The law created merit-based hiring as well as just-cause termination for virtually all state government jobs. More specifically: Recruitment "must be an active, continuous process that is conducted in a manner that ensures a diverse, highly qualified group of applicants." Hiring and promotions "must be made only according to merit and fitness, which is generally ascertained by competitive examination." And procedures are in place for employees to file grievances and to have those complaints heard. As for the scope of the new proposal, there is fierce debate about whether it would change the core principles of the system. Erpenbach has described the proposal as "throwing away a merit based system and moving back to the days of political patronage appointments," while Walker has said "the civil service protections that are at the heart of the principle" would remain intact, with "no change to merit-based hiring." The proposal would, among other things: Drop the exams that job candidates for state government are often required to take in favor of a résumé system. Define "just cause" for firing employees to make it clear that the state could immediately dismiss employees for showing up to work drunk, being physically violent, engaging in sexual harassment, stealing taxpayer goods or not showing up to work for three days in a year with no notification. Shorten the appeals process by more than half for employees being disciplined or fired. Put in place a single employee discipline system across nearly all state agencies "Wouldn’t touch" What Walker has said about his intentions for state employees has been an issue going back to before Act 10, the 2011 law that repealed most collective bargaining for most public employees. In February 2011, as daily protests drew thousands to the State Capitol, Walker claimed he had campaigned on the provisions of Act 10. We rated that statement False. He did not go public with even the bare-bones of his multi-faceted plans to sharply curb collective bargaining rights. But other statements Walker made led some to believe the governor was saying he wouldn’t touch the civil service system -- even if his statements never made such a promise. On a number of occasions in February 2011, as if to reassure state workers outraged by Act 10, Walker said union contracts weren't needed because the civil service law would protect public employees from political favoritism or retribution. And he made a point to say that Act 10 would not change civil service protections. Two examples: On "Fox News Sunday," Walker said: "There is no state that has a better civil service system in terms of protections. That does not change in this. Worker rights will be maintained even after our bill passes." In a televised address that has become known as his "fireside chat," the governor said: "It’s important to remember that many of the rights we’re talking about don’t come directly from collective bargaining. They come from the civil service system here in Wisconsin. That law was passed in 1905, long before collective bargaining, and it will continue long after our plan is approved." But saying that Act 10 would not change the civil service system is not the same as pledging not to make any changes to the system. And Erpenbach did not cite any such statements from Walker to us. Indeed, there have been signs that changes would be made. In June 2014, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that in recent months, Walker administration officials had said multiple times they weren't looking to change the civil service system. For instance, then-Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch insisted they were not considering any changes to the core principles of civil service. And a spokeswoman for Walker's Department of Administration said at the time that Walker had no interest in changing civil servants’ protections. But the Journal Sentinel also reported that records it had obtained showed there had been early-stage discussions about removing red tape that slows hiring for state jobs. And the next month, Walker didn’t directly respond to a request from the Journal Sentinel when asked if he favored changing current civil service protections. Our rating Erpenbach said Walker "said he wouldn't touch" the state civil service system but now supports overhauling it. In arguing for Act 10, which repealed most collective bargaining rights for most public employees, Walker repeatedly cited the strength of employee protections in Wisconsin’s civil service system, and said his 2011 law wouldn’t change the protections. That led some to believe Walker wouldn’t try to change the civil service system. But we found no evidence that Walker made such a pledge, and there have been indications in the past year that he might seek changes. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. More on public employees Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says every general City of Milwaukee employee "pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not." Mostly True. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga says the University of Wisconsin System "is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin." Mostly True. Walker says Wisconsin's pension system is the "only one fully funded in the country." Mostly True.	None	Jon Erpenbach	None	None	None	2015-10-02T11:15:00	2015-09-25	['None']

pomt-03929	Without a Medicaid expansion, 275,000 more Ohioans could be getting their primary care in emergency rooms, costing "everybody a lot of money."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/21/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-expanding-medicaid-would-help/	Gov. John Kasich remains opposed to the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law known as Obamacare. But Kasich's proposed two-year state budget endorses the expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal health program for certain poor and disabled people, that is one of the legislation's key elements. He made an impassioned case for the expansion in his State of the State address on Tuesday. He said it will guarantee that Ohio tax dollars return to Ohio to pay for it, and that it will deliver basic primary health care to the poor.The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for three years, decreasing to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. "We don't want 275,000 Ohioans getting their primary care in an emergency room," Kasich said in announcing the plan. "It is not sustainable, it doesn't work, it is not humane and it costs everybody a lot of money -- and more than just the cost of the visit." PolitiFact Ohio wondered what supported the statement. We were given background by the Governor’s Office of Health Transformation, which was created by executive order two years ago. Kasich's figure of 275,000 is based on expanding Medicaid coverage to adults making $15,415 or less per year -- 138 percent of the federal poverty line -- which the U.S. Supreme Court made optional for states in its health care decision last June. Ohio currently covers adults with dependents at up to 90 percent of the federal poverty level and doesn't cover childless adults. Ohio Medicaid estimated the net change in enrollment would be an increase of 274,753 -- about 275,000 -- using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the federal Census Bureau. As for cost, the governor's office pointed to uncompensated care -- the cost of services provided to the uninsured that the uninsured do not pay for themselves. Those services, the health office said, typically are in hospital emergency departments. Those departments are required to provide care, even if an individual lacks the ability to pay, and end up being used as primary care outlets in non-emergency situations, at a higher cost than care from more appropriate providers. Uncompensated care accounts for 2.8 percent of all health care spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Urban Institute, and it raises private insurance premiums by up to 1.7 percent. Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation reported the same figures. It’s a matter of opinion how significant the impact of uncompensated care is on the cost of private insurance. Regardless, the impact would be almost certain to increase without an expansion of Medicaid: Hospitals are reimbursed some of the costs of uncompensated care through the federal Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program, a subsidy that will be scaled back starting in 2014. Where does that leave Kasich’s statement? He was correct in stating that according to his administration’s calculations, the Medicaid expansion would cover 275,000 Ohioans whose primary health care might otherwise be provided in emergency rooms, at a higher cost. Whether that higher expense "costs everybody a lot of money" is largely a matter of how "a lot" is defined. Since uncompensated care represents a relatively small percentage of health care spending, Kasich could be accused of a bit of exaggeration. With that clarification, we rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2013-02-21T16:59:57	2013-02-04	['Ohio']
pomt-07594	"About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/25/joseph-mcnamara/rep-mcnamara-says-30-percent-rhode-island-youth-22/	Obesity is a heavy topic. Too many extra pounds add to our risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, sleep disturbances and a host of other problems. Research shows that, as a nation, we are getting fatter. That's more than a problem just for people who are overweight. When obesity levels rise and the population becomes less healthy, it drives up health costs, which affect all of us. But is it really true that more than 1 in 5 Rhode Islanders and nearly one-third of our teens and preteens aren't just overweight, they're obese? That was the contention of Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, when he introduced bills requiring restaurants to provide more nutrition information in hopes of combating the problem. "About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese," he is quoted as saying in a legislative news release. Obesity is determined by your body-mass index, a number that's cumbersome to calculate, in part because it's often defined in metric units, which is one reason why many people don't know what their BMI is. (To calculate your BMI, take your weight in pounds and multiply it by 703. Next, convert your height to inches and multiply that number by itself. So if you’re 65 inches tall, multiply 65 by 65 to get 4,225. Then, you take the weight number and divide it by the height number, you get your BMI. Alternatively, you can go online at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ and have the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute do the calculation for you.) If your body-mass index is 25 or higher, you're overweight. If the number is 30 or higher, you're obese. In easier-to-understand terms, a 5-feet-2-inches tall, 164-pound person is obese. So is a 6-footer who weighs 221 pounds. When we called McNamara's office to find out if that many Rhode Islanders really score 30 or more, we were directed to an online report from Eliza Lawson of the Health Department's Initiative for a Healthy Weight. Lawson, in turn, said McNamara's numbers are supported by reports based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The state-by-state rankings compiled in 2009 by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation show that Rhode Island has an adult obesity rate of 21.7 percent, which would round up to the 22 percent cited by McNamara. The 2009 report also offers statistics for children age 10-17. That's where we found a Rhode Island number of 30.1 percent, matching McNamara’s number. But there's one big problem. That 30.1 percent figure isn’t for obese children. It includes all overweight children. To get the correct number for obese children, we went to the 2010 version of the report, which shows that the obesity rate for Rhode Island's youth, based on a 2007 survey, is much lower than McNamara states -- 14.4 percent. So how does Rhode Island rank? As adults, we have one of the lowest obesity rates in the United States. In the 2009 report, we were 48th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia; only Connecticut, Massachusetts and Colorado had lower obesity rates. In 2010, our obesity rate rose by 1.2 percentage points and we moved to 45th. Rhode Island's teens and preteens ranked 28th, essentially at the national average. (The adult percentages have a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points. The childhood percentages, because the numbers are small, have a larger margin of error: plus or minus 3.2 points.) When we told McNamara that the data showed a much lower rate among children than he had cited, he produced a copy of an "Eat Smart, Move More" newsletter that gives the 30-percent figure. But that newsletter incorrectly quotes a 2010 Rhode Island Department of Health report, which had the correct figures on overweight and obesity. In summary, McNamara's assessment of adult obesity in Rhode Island is correct, if a bit outdated, and he fails to note that Rhode Island ranks as healthier than a large majority of other states. But his statistic on childhood obesity is way off - roughly half of what he said it was. Thus, we rate his statement as Half True.

Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being a "Democrat-lite" candidate who agrees all-too-often with Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. "Donald can't criticize her policies," Cruz said May 1, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press. "You know why? Because he supports them. Donald and Hillary, they're flipsides of the same coin. They've both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power. So Donald can't criticize Hillary Clinton on Planned Parenthood, because he agrees with her. They both say it's terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding." Cruz has been a vocal supporter of stripping the health organization of its $500 million in government funding since an anti-abortion group released secretly filmed footage purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit. Courts have not found evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Do Trump and Clinton, respective frontrunners of the Republican and Democratic primaries, agree about maintaining taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood? There’s no question about Clinton’s support for Planned Parenthood. Throughout the campaign, she has frequently attacked Republicans’ pledge to defund the organization. And Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in July, its first-ever presidential primary endorsement. "I am not only against defunding Planned Parenthood, but I would like to see Planned Parenthood even get more funding," Clinton told Fusion in January. Trump’s position is more nuanced. Regarding abortion generally, Trump has several times raised both Republicans’ and Democrats’ eyebrows by changing position. Today, Trump says he’s anti-abortion. As it pertains to taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, Trump has been fairly consistent since October 2015. He has said Congress should stop providing the group with federal funding full stop as long as they provide abortions. Here’s a sampling of Trump’s comments on the subject: Aug. 4, 2015: Trump said defunding Planned Parenthood would be worth a government shutdown. When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would support this kind of legislative maneuver, Trump said, "I would." Aug. 11, 2015: Trump backtracked to say he might consider funding for Planned Parenthood services other than abortion. "I would look at the good aspects of it, and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good for women," he said. "The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded." This is the closest quote we found to support Cruz’s position. We should note a piece of longstanding legislative language called the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or protecting the mother’s health. So technically, federal funding does not support Planned Parenthood’s abortion services. But people who would like to see Planned Parenthood defunded argue that the money is fungible, so any money the organization receives from the federal government frees up other funds to spend on abortions. Oct. 18, 2015: Trump wouldn’t say outright if he would be willing to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. But he said, "Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded. I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible." Feb. 13, 2016: Trump and Cruz sparred over Planned Parenthood directly at a South Carolina debate. "Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood," Cruz said. "And Donald has this weird pattern — when you point to his own record he screams, 'Liar, liar, liar.'" "Where did I support it?" asked Trump. "Where did I support it?" "You said Planned Parenthood does wonderful things," Cruz said. "It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion," Trump said. "There are wonderful things having to do with women's health, but not when it comes to abortion." Cruz's campaign pointed us to this exchange as an example of Trump being unwilling to say he would cut off all funding. Feb. 18, 2016: Trump said he respects some of the work Planned Parenthood does for women’s health, but their abortion practices should prevent them from getting funding. "I said defund. I didn't say pay. I said I have a lot of respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women," he said, but they should not receive tax dollars, "not while they do abortions." Feb. 22, 2016: Trump continued the same narrative. "Planned Parenthood does a lot of good jobs, a really good job in a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it." March 1, 2016: Even more of the same. "Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood," he said. "But we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I've said it loud and clear." So to recap: Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood seems to be that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, even though he respects some of the other work they do for women’s health. Our ruling Cruz said both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton say Planned Parenthood is "terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding." Trump and Clinton seem to agree that Planned Parenthood does some positive work as it pertains to things like cancer prevention, and Trump has described that work as "wonderful." However, Clinton supports their abortion services, and Trump does not. He thinks Planned Parenthood should not receive taxpayer dollars as long as they provide abortions. Clinton, on the other hand, has said Planned Parenthood should receive even more funding than it does now.

pomt-05617	Since Florida passed the "stand your ground" law in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/26/christopher-l-smith/sen-chris-smith-claimed-deaths-due-self-defense-fl/	The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., has reopened debate about the state’s "stand your ground" law. One of the arguments we’ve heard from lawmakers wanting to change the 2005 law is that deaths due to self-defense are up dramatically since "stand your ground" passed. The law -- approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005 -- allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, wants to rewrite the law because he fears its protections are too broad. Smith wants to change the law so that it only applies in cases that take place in a home, car or at work. He also wants to prohibit the use of "stand your ground" in cases where the shooter has provoked a confrontation, Smith said in a March 21 press release sent by the Senate Democratic office. "This law has been a double-edged sword," said Smith, who was the House Democratic leader in 2005 when "stand your ground" passed. Smith voted against the law. "Stand your ground’ appears to be giving suspects better protections from arrest and prosecution than increased security measures for the citizens the law was originally intended to protect. This needs to be dramatically changed. … We can’t keep turning a blind eye to the number of lives this law has claimed." According to the press release, Smith noted that "since the law’s passage, deaths due to self defense have jumped over 250 percent." That’s a significant increase worth checking out. As we do in cases like this, we’ll first check the numbers and then check to see if "stand your ground" is to blame as Smith suggests. The statistic The "stand your ground" statute states that "a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." Smith’s office and the Senate Democratic office pointed to news stories -- a 2010 article in the Tampa Bay Times and a March 20, 2012, report on CBS 4 -- about the number of "justifiable homicides," since the "stand your ground" law passed in 2005. We contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement directly for data on justifiable homicides from 2000-10 and through the first half of 2011. FDLE uses this definition of justifiable homicides when collecting data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting: "The killing of the perpetrator of a serious criminal offense either by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty or by a private citizen, during the commission of a serious criminal offense." FDLE’s manual explains that the label is based on an investigating officer’s findings -- not on the actions by a prosecutor or court. The FBI’s UCR handbook explains that a storekeeper shooting a gunman attempting a robbery is a justifiable homicide. But if two men playing cards get into an argument in which the first man attacked the second with a broken bottle and the second man shot his attacker claiming self-defense, that should not be reported as justifiable homicide. FDLE’s data is based on information reported by police departments -- that reporting is voluntary but nearly all the agencies comply, FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg said. The data refers to how police labeled the homicide -- not charging decisions by prosecutors or court outcomes. FDLE compiles the data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, a national source of crime statistics. Here’s a breakdown by calendar year and whether the person acting in self-defense was a civilian or a law enforcement officer: Calendar Year Justifiable homicide by civilian Justifiable homicide by police Total 2000 12 20 32 2001 12 21 33 2002 12 23 35 2003 16 16 32 2004 8 23 31 2005 18 25 43 2006 12 21 33 2007 42 60 102 2008 41 52 93 2009 45 60 105 2010 40 56 96 First half of 2011 16 33 49 From 2000-04 -- the five full years before "stand your ground" took effect -- law enforcement agencies in Florida reported an average of 12 justifiable homicides a year committed by civilians. From 2006-10 -- the first five full years after "stand your ground" became law -- law enforcement agencies reported an average of 36 justifiable homicides committed by civilians. Average to average, the number of justifiable homicides by civilians is now three times higher than it was in the years before 2005. That’s an increase of 200 percent. (We excluded 2005 from this calculation because the law went into effect part way through the year.) Is ‘stand your ground’ to blame? So Smith is a little high in his estimate using FDLE data. Next, we wondered whether the 2005 law is the reason justifiable homicides among civilians are up. Experts we contacted didn’t agree whether there is a simple cause and effect. Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, has researched how the FBI and police departments define justifiable homicide. Criminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said. "I don’t believe anything triples.…Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events," Kleck said. "It’s possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. … Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don’t think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies." Bill Eddins, state attorney in Florida’s 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn’t conclude if there is a correlation between the "stand your ground" law and the increase in justifiable homicides. Although our overall crime rate has trended downward, "the random violence seems to be increasing to me," Eddins said. To determine the effect of the "stand your ground" law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the "stand your ground" statute contributed to that resolution, he said. "There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can’t reach it." Nancy Daniels, a public defender in the 2nd Circuit and president of the Florida Public Defender Association, said that she thinks there is a clear correlation between the "stand your ground" law and increase in justifiable homicide cases. "The types of incidents involved in ‘stand your ground’ cases have always been with us, but some now are found to be justifiable," she said in an email. "And who knows how many people have been emboldened to think violence is justified just because of the new law?" Dennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a former police officer in Polk County, said that determining correlation between the numbers and the law would require examining the cases and seeing how often elements from the "stand your ground" law were raised. Without examining the numbers or the cases themselves, Kenney said it’s "highly likely" that there is a correlation. And Kenney, who was critical of the law, predicted: "After all the publicity the current case is getting you would expect it to go up much more." David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys based in Washington, said the increase in reported justifiable homicides could be the result of any number of factors -- including overall crime or population growth. Our ruling Smith said that since "stand your ground" passed in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent. When we calculated the average for five years before the law passed and five years after it passed, we found an increase of 200 percent. That’s short of Smith’s claim, though the numbers largerly support the idea that self-defense deaths have increased since 2005. As for whether "stand your ground" is the reason self-defense deaths are up, experts either disagree or say it’s difficult to determine without examining the specifics of each case.

Studies conducted primarily in the US have shown that coronary calcium scans are able to identify heart disease in patients, with the resulting calcium "scores" having been found to correlate with future cardiovascular events. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand describes the test as a "robust" way to estimate future risk of cardiac events. By contrast, the sub-committee of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council responsible for new and emerging technologies cautions that calcium scoring for predicting heart disease "is of unproven clinical benefit or utility". The sub-committee raised concerns about the radiation dose involved (the equivalent of 50 chest x-rays per scan) as well as the impact on downstream tests and treatments. Cardiologists contacted by Fact Check agreed the test was better at predicting heart attacks than traditional blood pressure or cholesterol checks, but were hesitant to back the test as strongly as Dr Walker.

pomt-04518	Ben Unger supported a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/03/promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi/did-ben-unger-want-stick-15-percent-tax-hike-senio/	PolitiFact Oregon knows there are a handful of legislative races that could determine which party controls the Oregon House in 2013. House District 29 in Washington County is one of them. The Promote Oregon Leadership PAC, which is the campaign arm of House Republicans, put out a mailer targeting Democrat Ben Unger, a political consultant who grew up in Cornelius and is challenging incumbent Rep. Katie Eyre, R-Hillsboro. The mailer urges voters to ask the candidate these three questions should they spot him on their doorstep: Why did he hand out anti-Nike literature while at University of Oregon? Why did he work for candidates who supported early release of violent criminals? And this: "Why did you support a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors?" Sources are in footnotes. We’ll dispatch with the first two questions quickly so we can delve into the third, which is really the first question on this mailer and the one that tickles our fancy. Honestly, hitting up poor seniors on fixed incomes? How could he? We followed up on the sources cited and figured out rather quickly that Unger circulated anti-Nike literature back in 1997 when he was vice president of the university’s student government, as part of a global effort to protest the company’s labor practices in overseas factories. (College students do that kind of thing.) As for working "for candidates who supported early release for violent criminals?" Unger ran the campaign for Oregon Senate Democrats, whose candidates backed compromise prison legislation to help close the state budget. An analysis by The Oregonian discovered that a loophole resulted in the early release of hundreds of violent offenders. It was unintended, Democrats say. We’re not sure that qualifies as active support. And now back to the claim about property taxes and seniors. We looked up the citation and found … a news story about Portland Public Schools pushing two tax measures on the May 2011 ballot. In case you don’t remember, voters approved the operating levy, and just barely killed the construction bond measure. From the article: But if voters say yes to both tax increases -- one for school construction and renovation, the other for school operations -- property tax bills inside the district, already among the highest in the metro area, will rise more than 15 percent in a single year. That's daunting, even to some people who consider themselves supporters of schools. Now, for full disclosure, the two school measures would not have accounted for the entire increase, because property taxes increase three percent every year, which is how the reporter got to the "more than 15 percent in a single year." Some people may think those percentage points matter, but we think that’s picayune. The more important question is how is Unger involved? As a political consultant, he managed the campaigns for both the schools bond measure and the operating levy. It’s fair to say he supported the measures and thought it was OK to ask for the money. But is it fair to single out seniors? Nick Smith, spokesman for the House Republican caucus, said absolutely. "It's clear to us, at least, that senior citizens are affected most by such large increases in these taxes," Smith wrote. "Voters need to know about Unger's past political work, and his support for tax increases that are especially harmful to Oregonians who are vulnerable." We applaud House Republicans for looking out for the elderly, but we’re not buying it. The property tax increases would have applied just as well to wealthy people, young people, middle-aged people and lower-income working people, people who like cats, people who hate children, and so on. Look, we know this is standard campaigning. Take a candidate’s position on an issue and weed out the context so you end up with something like Unger supported "a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors," as if he wanted to single out old folks for additional taxes. To us, the statement is missing important details that voters should have. But then, the mailers wouldn’t be as fun, would they? We find the statement Half True: partially accurate, but missing important details.

pomt-00273	"Christine Blasey Ford claims that she called a friend on her cell phone after the ‘attack’ in or around 1982."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/02/top-stories-usa/no-christine-blasey-ford-didnt-say-she-used-cell-p/	Social media platforms have been overwhelmed by posts about Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony alleging a sexual assault by then 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh, who is now a nominee for the Supreme Court. Here’s one that is eye-catching -- but wrong. A reader found it on the Facebook page for Top Stories USA, a hyper-partisan website with such recent headlines as, "Loud-mouthed Woman Who Confronted Flake In Elevator Was A Soros Funded Hit Job!" "Hillary Thinks She’s A Star – TANKS ‘Murphy Brown’ Ratings Just By Showing Her Face," and "Watch Lindsey Graham’s EPIC Democrat Butt-Kicking at Kavanaugh’s Hearing." The Facebook post, dated Sept. 29, featured an image that said, "Christine Blasey Ford claims that she called a friend on her cell phone after the ‘attack’ in or around 1982. The first cell phone was sold for $3,995 in March of 1984." (The claim is accompanied by the image of an ancient-looking Motorola cell phone.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com However, we found no evidence that Ford ever made that claim. (We did not hear back from Top Stories USA. A spokeswoman for Ford referred us to a fact-check by Snopes.com) The claim of a cell phone call does not appear in the Washington Post’s original story on Sept. 16, 2018, in which Ford went public with her claim. "Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband," the article noted. Ford elaborated on her recollections during in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, 2018. After the alleged attack by Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, she testified: "I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me. "Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. … Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience." Neither of these accounts mentions a cell phone call. On questioning from Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor retained by the Republican Judiciary Committee majority to question Ford and Kavanaugh, Ford said she did not recall how she got home. Mitchell: "You've described this as being near the country club, wherever this house was, is that right?" Ford: "I would describe it as it's somewhere between my house and the country club in that vicinity that's shown in your picture. And the country club is about 20 -- a 20-minute drive from my parents' home." Mitchell: "A 20-minute drive. And, of course, I've marked (it on a map) as the crow flies." Ford: "Yes." Mitchell: "Would it be fair to say that somebody drove you somewhere, either to the party or home from the party?" Ford: "Correct." Michell: "OK. Has anyone come forward to say to you, 'Hey, remember, I was the one that drove you home?'" Ford: "No." In her official post-testimony report, Mitchell noted some concern about this aspect of Ford’s recollection. "Given that this all took place before cell phones, arranging a ride home would not have been easy," Mitchell wrote. "Indeed, she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did, or that she called anyone else thereafter." But while Mitchell mentions cell phones in this context, Ford did not. (And Mitchell’s report is dated Sept. 30, so it could not have been a source for the meme posted on Sept. 29.) For the record, the meme does appear to be correct about the price of a Motorola DynaTAC 8000X in 1984. The meme "plagiarized the introductory paragraph of an article about the first handheld cell phone published by Mashable back in 2014," Snopes reported. Our ruling A Top Stories USA post on Facebook said, "Christine Blasey Ford claims that she called a friend on her cell phone after the ‘attack’ in or around 1982. The first cell phone was sold for $3,995 in March of 1984." Ford never said anything about using a cell phone after the alleged attack. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08372	Says Glenn Nye voted "in lock step with Nancy Pelosi" 83 percent of the time.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/25/scott-rigell/nye-voted-lockstep-nancy-pelosi-83-percent/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has become a popular villain for Republican candidates who have been trying to link her to their Democratic opponents. Case in point: a recent TV ad titled "Her Congressman" from Scott Rigell, the Republican candidate for Congress in Virginia’s 2nd District, criticizing the voting record of Rep. Glenn Nye, the Democratic incumbent. "Nye voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi, even on the wasteful stimulus bill," the ad says. "Nye votes with Pelosi 83 percent of the time. Glenn Nye is her congressman, not ours." The National Republican Congressional Committee makes a similar claim in a TV ad, taking aim at Nye for supporting the economic stimulus package and other Democratic legislation. It says, "Glenn Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time." PolitiFact has checked similar claims in other states and found they often exaggerated the correlation with Pelosi, so we decided to take a closer look. Asked for the source for the claim, both Rigell’s campaign and the NRCC cited a Washington Post voting database. We took a look at the database and quickly discovered the campaigns had blurred the details: Nye has voted with his party 82.5 percent of the time since he took office in 2009. But his rate of voting with Pelosi is actually significantly lower -- just 66 percent. The Washington Post says its database shows "the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members" -- not the correlation with a particular party leader. The average party loyalty is 90.6 percent for all House members and 92.2 percent for the 263 Democratic members. But contrary to the implication of the ad, Nye is actually ninth from the bottom for party loyalty among Democrats and Republicans. That indicates he has one of the most independent records. Comparing the voting records of a member of Congress and a House speaker can be misleading because the speaker rarely votes. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted 94 times since the start of 2009, while Nye has cast 1,551 votes. "That is just a tradition for speakers -- they often don't vote," Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly told PolitiFact. "She votes on some bills, not all." Of the 91 times when they both voted on matters other than the routine roll call, Nye cast differing votes 31 times. That means they voted together 66 percent of the time. And it’s important to note that Nye and Pelosi differed on health care reform, the signature issue for the Democrats. Nye voted against it, and has touted that vote in his campaign. And before voting with fellow Democrats to pass the economic stimulus bill in February 2009, Nye voted twice with Republicans to delay action on the plan, saying he wanted more time and more tax cuts. So let’s take stock of the facts. Rigell’s ad says Nye "voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi." But the facts don’t support such a strong claim. It is incorrect for Rigell to say Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time. That is the percentage for his votes with his party. The actual number with Pelosi is significantly lower -- 66 percent. And both measurements show he is one of the more independent Democrats. Only eight House members have lower party loyalty percentages. It’s become a popular Republican tactic to link Democrats with Pelosi, but in this case, the voting records don’t justify the charge.

pomt-04169	Says Texas has the 15th largest economy in the world.	true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/18/texas-petition/secession-petition-says-texas-has-15th-largest-eco/	When numerous petitions to secede popped up on the White House’s website after President Barack Obama was re-elected, one drew a Texas-sized share of attention. Drawing tens of thousands of signatures within days, the petition written by "Micah H" made national news. Among its claims: Texas "is the 15th largest economy in the world." We decided to check that claim and a related one from Texas pro-secession candidate Larry Kilgore, who said the Texas economy is 30 percent larger than Australia’s. That's False. The petition’s author was quickly identified in news reports, including a Nov. 14, 2012, story in The Shorthorn, the University of Texas-Arlington’s campus paper, as Micah Hurd, a Marine Corps veteran enrolled at the university. Hurd told CBS-TV, Channel 11, of Dallas in a Nov. 14 interview that he wrote the petition in five minutes, not anticipating it would make news. We did not reach Hurd about the basis of his Texas ranking. Plowing ahead, we touched base with the Texas state comptroller’s office, which calculates each year how Texas would rank globally if it were a nation. Spokesman RJ DeSilva emailed us the comptroller’s most recent chart, drawing on early-2011 figures for gross domestic product in U.S. dollars from economic forecasting firm IHS Global Insight and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the statistical branch of the U.S. Commerce Department. He also sent the final 2011 GDP for Texas, which was almost the same as the preliminary amount; both rounded off to $1.3 trillion. GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within a country. The comptroller’s chart showed that if Texas were a nation (in early 2011), its $1.3 trillion GDP would have ranked 14th -- just below Australia’s $1.5 trillion and above Mexico’s $1.2 trillion. Separately, bureau spokesman Thomas Dail told us by phone that finding nations’ 2011 GDP calculated with current prices in U.S. dollars would allow us to make a "conceptually consistent" comparison with his agency’s calculation of Texas GDP. Dail helped us generate such a chart on the International Monetary Fund website. It looked pretty similar to the comptroller’s figures, and again, Texas ranked 14th, between Australia and Mexico. Finally, on another suggestion from Dail, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that comprises 34 countries. Spokesman Matthias Rumpf told us his organization didn’t have Texas data for 2011, but "the claim about the relative size of Texas' GDP does not seem out of proportion." He created a spreadsheet for us showing 2008 and 2009 GDPs adjusted for "purchasing power parity," which eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities. Rumpf’s spreadsheet included nations and U.S. regions -- specifically, he said, "GDP for the larger OECD countries, other large economies (some big countries are missing) and large regions in the OECD," given in U.S. dollars. In 2008 and 2009, Texas ranked 14th, falling between Canada and Turkey. However, the charts showed that if California had been a country, too, it would have come in 10th and bumped Texas to 15th in both years. Note to self: Do not secede at same time California does. It’s all an academic exercise, anyway, because secession would change a number of economic factors. Trade agreements, national defense and the postal service leap to mind. And then there’s the labor-force productivity issue raised by Austin American-Statesman humor columnist John Kelso: Would we all have to work on the Fourth of July? Our ruling Hurd’s petition claimed that Texas is the 15th largest economy in the world. By a reasonable measure, Texas’ GDP would rank it 14th among nations. We rate the statement as True.

pomt-06888	Says "over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came" from Wisconsin.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/28/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-republican-party-says-more-than-half-nat/	Gov. Scott Walker says he is focused like a laser beam on job creation. He’s promised that Wisconsin will create 250,000 private sector jobs during his four year term. So when a monthly report showed a sharp increase in the number of jobs in June 2011 -- an estimated net increase of 12,900 jobs, or 9,500 if you just consider the private sector -- it got some attention. What’s more, a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics report released earlier in July showed there had been only 18,000 jobs created nationwide in June. (To be sure, the news was not all rosy in the state report: It showed the unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent in June, from 7.4 percent in May.) Walker celebrated the Wisconsin jobs numbers on July 21, 2011, with this tweet: "In June, there were 18,000 net new jobs in America. In WI, there were 9,500 net new jobs! most since 9/2003." Walker made a similar comparison in an interview: "To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state." Many others echoed the basic message of Walker’s tweet, often adding their own spin. And that’s where numbers -- or at least the use of them -- started to go bad. The state Republican Party issued a news release with this statement: "Today, we learned that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state." Three days later, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) said: "The labor (department) report that came out last week had 18,000 jobs created in the country. But half of them were in Wisconsin, so we must be doing something right." Variations of the statement were made by others, including the conservative MacIver Institute, Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), and state Reps. Michelle Litjens (R-Vinland), Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) and Joan Ballweg (R-Markesan). That’s a lot of echoes. But is what’s being shouted accurate? That is, is the state-national comparison a valid one? We started by looking at the other state-by-state reports, released by the federal government at the same time Wisconsin’s numbers were issued. Wisconsin wasn’t at the top. That claim belonged to Texas, with an increase of 32,000 jobs. Numerous other states showed larger job gains than Wisconsin. For instance, California was up 28,800, and our neighbor Minnesota topped Wisconsin with an increase of 13,200 jobs. Obviously, those add up to more than 18,000 jobs added in the country in June. Indeed, if you were to tally all the state reports -- accounting for those with increases and decreases -- you’d wind up with a net monthly increase of 64,900 jobs -- not the originally discussed 18,000. And half of them would have been created in Texas. So, could Texas Gov. Rick Perry accurately claim his state accounted for twice the total of all the jobs created in the nation? That’s illogical at best. What’s going on here? In short, Walker, the state GOP and the others touting the national numbers are making a flawed comparison. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does separate national and state-by-state studies, each with different parameters and margins of error. The agency says it’s wrong to mix the two estimates -- a warning included as a footnote on the documents themselves. Here’s how they put it: "State estimation procedures are designed to produce accurate data for each individual state. (The bureau) independently develops the national employment series and does not force state estimates to sum to national totals nor vice versa. "Because each state series is subject to larger sampling and nonsampling errors than the national series, summing them cumulates individual state levels errors and can cause significant distortions at an aggregate level. Due to these statistical limitations, (the bureau) does not compile a ‘sum of states’ employment series and cautions users that such a series is subject to a relatively large and volatile error structure." In short, the bureau says you can’t accurately use the individual state jobs reports to make a national comparison. Or even shorter: Don’t do it. Walker addressed the flawed comparisons a few days after the jobs report was released, during a July 26, 2011 appearance in Wausau. "We made it very clear at our announcement that (our number) was not half of all the jobs out there, though it is an interesting parallel," Walker said. In looking back at the various statements, some clearly went further than others -- and further than Walker’s original tweet. Many of the strongest comparisons seem to take the lead from the state GOP, which claimed "over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from our state." As the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes, it is wrong to combine the two sets of numbers to reach this conclusion. After all, by that approach Minnesota, California and Texas could all say the same as the state GOP, which would lead to at least four halves and, apparently, two wholes. This item isn’t on whether the jobs news was good -- clearly it was -- but on how it was presented. We rate the state GOP claim False.

pomt-08064	"We continue to see these isolated incidents of people trying to vote five, six times a day."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/23/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-state-sen-scott-fitzgerald-says-some-peo/	Wisconsin Republicans have long pushed unsuccessfully for a photo identification requirement at the polls, citing the need to guard against voter fraud. So it was not a surprise when the incoming Senate majority leader, Republican Scott Fitzgerald, told reporters a photo ID bill would be the first introduced in 2011. But a recent Fitzgerald statement in defense of photo ID, made to a Green Bay journalist, was an eyebrow raiser. A Green Bay Press-Gazette editorial on Dec. 9, 2010 quoted Fitzgerald saying: "We continue to see these isolated incidents of people trying to vote five, six times a day; people voting based on some sort of fraudulent documentation that's offered…People think it's important they have open, good, solid, free elections." Fitzgerald’s allegation that people are voting up five or six times in one election is one we have not heard before. Is that really going on? We turned to Fitzgerald’s office, where spokesman Andrew Welhouse couldn’t cite a specific case. Instead, he said there might be cases in other states. But those cases, an anonymous allegation in Oregon and a claim in Alabama, have not been proved. As for Wisconsin, Welhouse mentioned the episode in the 2000 presidential election when a Marquette University student claimed he voted four times. But he said Fitzgerald was not necessarily referring to that -- though he offered that it’s the "strongest case." Finally, Welhouse referenced a Milwaukee Police Department report on the 2004 elections in the city of Milwaukee -- an election plagued by vote-count discrepancies, documented by the Journal Sentinel, and allegations of voter-registration fraud. Let’s pause for some context. Wisconsin’s system, which does not require voter ID and allows same-day registration, is one of the most open in the country. Supporters say this helps Wisconsin consistently rank among the states with the highest voter turnout. Critics say that leaves the system more vulnerable to fraud. Republicans have pushed photo ID as a solution, but Democrats say its overkill and could discourage voting. We are not analyzing that argument here. Additionally, law enforcement officials say cases of fraud are easier to establish than to prosecute. That is, they may identify suspicious cases, but not be able to determine who was responsible. Thus, measures based on how many cases of fraud are ultimately prosecuted, or lead to convictions, give only a partial picture of what may be happening. Conversely, investigators emphasize that in many cases where documents show an irregularity, the problem turns out not to be multiple voting but routine recording errors by clerks. This item is not aimed at establishing how much or how little fraud there is. Rather, it is looking strictly at Fitzgerald’s statement about people who attempt to vote five or six times. Let’s look first at the 2000 incident involving the MU student, since Fitzgerald is hanging his hat mostly on that -- to the degree he has evidence to hang his hat on. The episode, which drew national media attention, started on campus after scores of students responding to a Marquette Tribune survey claimed they had voted at least twice. One student’s name emerged: Rob Bosworth, 18, told reporters for the Journal Sentinel that he voted four times at the same polling place in Milwaukee. But Bosworth’s claims did not hold up when examined by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. And after a five-week investigation, the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office found no evidence supporting it. Bosworth, who had gained national publicity, later recanted his story. The DA’s inquiry examined voting records for hundreds of MU students and found no double voting. McCann concluded that the student survey had drawn "apparently unfounded, spoof responses." No one was charged. Another piece of evidence cited by Welhouse was the Milwaukee Police Department report on the flawed 2004 election. It outlined absentee ballots never counted and poll workers allowing people clearly from outside the city to vote in Milwaukee. Police investigators, though, found almost no evidence supporting the GOP’s claims of double voting and invalid addresses in that election. There are, however, well-documented if isolated instances of double-voting -- or alleged double voting -- in Wisconsin. Perhaps most memorably, Donovan Riley, a retired attorney running for state Senate, voted in Chicago and in Wisconsin in the 2000 presidential election. He was convicted in 2006. More recently, a Milwaukee couple, Herb and Suzanne Gunka, were charged with voting by absentee ballot and at a polling place in the 2008 presidential election. They have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial; Herb Gunka says he voted on election day because he feared that his absentee ballot was not being counted. Currently, investigators in Minnesota and Wisconsin are checking into possible cross-state double voting from 2008. And a task force set up by local, state and federal officials in 2008 has filed double-voting allegations in two cases, including the Gunka case. Most of the election-fraud cases charged in recent years involve voting by felons who are ineligible, or voter-registration fraud by groups, officials say. Not cases where individuals voted repeatedly, which is what Fitzgerald focused on. To make sure we weren’t missing any cases of people voting more than twice, we talked to 10 state, county and local elections officials, and law enforcement officers at the local and federal level. None of the officials reported a case of voting more than two times. They said they couldn’t be totally sure that a local case had escaped their attention, but Reid Magney, a spokesman for the state office overseeing elections, said it was extremely unlikely. In Fitzgerald’s home base, Juneau in Dodge County, election official Jane Fude said vote fraud was not a problem in a small town. "We know who you are, where you live, where your parents live and what time you got home last night," Fude said. It’s too early to say what fraud cases may emerge from the fall 2010 elections because records are still being checked, officials said. Time to decide. In trying to bolster the case for photo ID, the state Senate’s top Republican asserted that people have voted five to six times in the same election. His office couldn’t provide any evidence -- from Wisconsin or elsewhere -- to back that up. The one Wisconsin episode they mention as a possibility, the Marquette student, was disproved after extensive investigation. Election officials are unaware of anything on the level of serial voting that Fitzgerald refers to. And we were unable to turn up such a case in our research. We rate his statement False.

pomt-11308	"I think we're actually ahead" on legalizing marijuana for recreational use in New York state.	false	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/17/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-says-new-york-state-ahead-others-recreationa/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country. But his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that’s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It’s not legal in New York state. Cuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island. "Given what’s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?" NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo. "No, I think we’re actually ahead on it," Cuomo said. "We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason. You have Massachusetts, you have New Jersey talking about it." Earlier this year, Cuomo asked the state Department of Health to study what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York state. The study will reportedly be finished this fall. Some states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. So, what was Cuomo talking about when he said "we’re actually ahead on it?" What Cuomo was saying Cuomo did not mean to say New York state was ahead of other states that already legalized recreational marijuana, a spokesperson said. He meant that the Department of Health study would put New York state ahead of others in responding to the federal government's new position on state marijuana laws. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama-era rule earlier this year that allowed states to legalize marijuana without federal interference. States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision. Context matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position. States with legal marijuana Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana. The state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year. The other states legalized recreational use through ballot referendums. New Jersey and Michigan may be next. New Jersedy Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, supports legalization and wants lawmakers to approve a bill this year. Advocates in Michigan have gathered enough signatures to put legalization on the ballot in November. Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012. New York state, however, is taking steps toward legalization that other states have not. The study from the state Department of Health leaves the option for legalization on the table. New York state marijuana laws Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana. He has called it a "gateway drug." But he supports decriminalizing marijuana -- ending criminal penalties for possessing and using small amounts of the drug. Selling it would still carry a penalty. New York state legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2014. The state’s program has expanded since its inception, allowing more conditions to be treated with the drug and wider access statewide. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state is ahead of other states on legalizing marijuana for recreational use. That’s not true. Nine other states have already legalized recreational marijuana. Other states have also taken steps toward legalization that New York state has not. New Jersey’s governor has called on the legislature to legalize the drug, while voters in Michigan are expected to decide on legalization later this year. We rate his claim False.

pomt-03087	The 2013-’15 state budget backed by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers "left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/26/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/gop-state-leaders-funding-tech-schools-1989-levels/	Soon after students slung backpacks over their shoulders for the start of a new school year, the Wisconsin Democratic Party threw the book at Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature for an "ideological attack on higher education." An article posted Sept. 18, 2013 on the party’s website made a number of charges, including one about the Wisconsin Technical College System. The 2013-’15 state budget, the party declared, "left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels." The 1989 reference would mean state funding for tech schools is the same as it was when the parents of today’s students were on campus. It was a repeat of a claim the party had made before, and a statistic we alluded to in an item in 2012. So, let’s see if the folks on the left are right about the folks on the right. Overall tech school funding The state’s 16 technical colleges serve some 360,000 Wisconsinites per year -- those taking a class here and there as well as those seeking a two-year diploma or other credential. Based on a 2007 study by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, the system has an economic impact of about $7 billion per year. Before we dig into the fact check, it’s important to know that state money makes up a relatively small portion of the tech schools’ overall funding. The technical colleges get their money primarily from three sources, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In 2011-’12, the latest figures available, those three sources accounted for $1.15 billion -- two-thirds ($771.3 million) from property taxes, one-fourth ($279 million) from tuition and fees, and 9 percent ($101.2 million) from the state. Of the $101 million in state money, $83.5 million was unrestricted -- and is known as general state aid -- while the rest was earmarked for certain purposes. So, any reduction in state aid wouldn’t affect the lion’s share of the tech schools’ overall funding. Nevertheless, the claim we’re testing focuses on the state budget and how much of it goes to tech schools. State funding of tech schools To back its claim, the Democratic Party cited a state budget document and legislative testimony that show general state aid -- the unrestricted funds -- was $85 million for the 1988-’89 budget year. Since that time, general state aid to the tech schools has trended upward. It reached $119 million in 2010-’11, the final budget year before Walker took office. But Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, imposed a 30 percent cut -- nearly $72 million over two years -- in general state aid to the tech schools. The tech schools cite a Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimate, however, that they were able to recoup at least 70 percent of the cut. They did so primarily by taking advantage of Walker’s 2011 collective bargaining law and requiring employees to pay more toward their health care and pensions. The Democrats’ claim, however, referred to Walker’s second state budget, for 2013-’15. That budget keeps general state aid to the tech schools at $83.5 million for the first year, but raises it to $88.5 million the second year. So, the current budget provides an average of $86 million per year in general state aid to the technical colleges -- virtually the same as the $85 million in 1989. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson took issue with the measure singled out by the Democrats, saying all state aid -- not just the unrestricted general aid portion -- should be considered. Total state aid is $108 million in the first year of the current budget and $113 million in the second, exceeding total state aid of $93.5 million in 1989. Budget experts we spoke to said either measure -- total state aid cited by Walker’s office or the general aid portion cited by the Democrats -- is valid. Of course, neither takes inflation into account. Had general state aid kept pace with inflation over the years, the $85 million allocated in 1989 would have been $160 million in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index calculator. Our rating The Wisconsin Democratic Party said the current, 2013-’15 state budget adopted by Walker and Republican lawmakers "left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels." That’s correct for the unrestricted general aid portion of state funding, which is the part the Republicans dramatically cut in the previous state budget. However, total state aid in the current budget is higher than it was in 1989. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11924	Says Stacey Evans "voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/oct/17/stacey-abrams/school-voucher-claim-ga-gov-race-leaves-out-import/	As public school advocates, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans have both taken a firm stance against privatized public education and especially school vouchers. But at a recent forum featuring the two candidates, Abrams accused Evans of voting for vouchers when she was a state representative. "You voted for vouchers. You didn’t vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning," Abrams said on Oct. 2. Abrams later said she was referring to Evans’ involvement with a bill about the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization. The program began in 2008, three years before Evans held a seat in Georgia’s General Assembly. Back then, the Student Scholarship Organization bill established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions. Abrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program. Evans did vote for an early version of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had provisions that improved the program’s transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so Evans voted against the bill. Evans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organization’s status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign shared its opinion on Facebook that the funds in the program are "vouchers by another name." Our ruling Abrams said Evans "voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning." Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program. Some aspects of Abrams’ statement are wrong. Evans wasn’t in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped. Over the years, there’s been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgia’s Supreme Court ruled that the "voucher" label did not apply. Abrams' claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10343	"There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/16/john-mccain/27-states-mandate-equitable-coverage/	Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and now campaign adviser to Sen. John McCain, grabbed news headlines July 7, 2008, when she said: "There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication. Those women would like a choice." Her comments came during a discussion of consumer-driven health plans in a breakfast meeting with reporters in Washington, D.C. Problem is, she's wrong to say that's the case with "many" plans. A study by the Guttmacher Institute in 2002 found that 86 percent of employer-purchased insurance plans covered a full range of contraceptive methods, up dramatically over the previous decade. One reason is that 27 states have passed laws requiring fully-insured employer health insurance plans that cover prescription drugs to provide "equitable" coverage for contraceptives. In short, if an employer is going to offer prescription drugs, contraceptives have to be among the options. A spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group that represents 1,300 health insurance companies, had no specific data but said both birth control and Viagra tend to be covered by its members' plans. Aetna, one of the nation's largest commercial insurers, said even its most restrictive drug plan includes generic oral contraceptives. Viagra, meanwhile, is only available from Aetna if an employer buys a separate rider for the company's policy. The wild cards here — and the reason Fiorina is right in some cases — are large companies that are self-insured, paying claims directly. These employers define their own benefit plans and are regulated by federal, not state laws. One such employer is Union Pacific Railroad, based in Omaha, Neb., which was sued for denying coverage for contraceptives while providing drugs to treat male erectile dysfunction. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's ruling and determined that the railroad's policy did not discriminate against female employees. Abortion rights groups have been working since 1997 on passage of federal legislation to expand equity for contraceptives to all employers' plans. McCain voted against such legislation in 2003 and again in 2005. According to NARAL, the abortion-rights advocacy group, McCain has voted against family planning 22 times. McCain has opposed insurance mandates on the grounds that they make health plans more expensive. Two days after Fiorina made her statement, McCain ducked the issue in comments to reporters aboard his campaign bus in Portsmouth, Ohio. "I certainly don't want to discuss that issue,'' he said. Planned Parenthood is using McCain's response with the Viagra vs. birth control issue, as captured on a YouTube video, in ads now running in six states. See it here. Back to Fiorina's statement that "there are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication." Efforts to force employers to cover birth control have failed in Congress, but state mandates and employee pressure force most companies to make such coverage available. We rule this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09867	Stimulus tax cuts "began showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/05/barack-obama/obama-flubs-number-households-indiana-during-speec/	When President Barack Obama gave a speech on the economy in Wakarusa, Ind., on Aug. 5, 2009, one of his statements raised the eyebrows of one alert PolitiFact reader. Obama, touting an element of his stimulus package, said that a tax cut “began showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago.” That struck our reader as odd because the Census Bureau pegs Indiana’s population at 6.3 million, of which one quarter are under 18. What’s the likelihood that the remaining 4.8 million Indiana adults each constitute their own household? Not likely at all. When we asked the Indiana Department of Revenue how many tax returns are filed annually in the state, they said the number is around 3.2 million, and that includes both joint filers and individuals. So clearly Obama was wrong. A White House official confirmed for us that it was a goof, pure and simple. A staffer mistakenly used the number of households in Illinois in Obama's speech, 4.8 million, instead of Indiana, which is 2.4 million. So there aren't as many Hoosier households as Obama claimed, and he earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-08-05T17:44:11	2009-08-05	['Indiana']

pomt-00121	"I'm not taking any corporate PAC money."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/28/kathy-manning/beto-orourke-nc-democrat-kathy-manning-claims-no-c/	The campaign for a U.S. House seat representing parts of Greensboro and surrounding areas has frequently focused on money: Who’s getting the most outside funding, and who is or isn’t beholden to special interests. The two main candidates are Republican incumbent Ted Budd and Democratic challenger Kathy Manning. In a recent debate they sparred once again over the questions of money and influence. Manning criticized Budd for taking thousands of dollars from special interest groups, but Budd defended himself, saying: "If anybody wants to support me, that’s great." Manning retorted that she will act differently if elected. "When a corporation or corporate special interest makes a campaign contribution, they do it because they’re looking for you to support legislation that will help (its) bottom line," Manning said in the debate. "That’s why I’m not taking any corporate PAC money. I don’t want to be beholden to corporations. I want to go to Washington to fight for the people of our district." She reiterated that talking point in her closing statement, saying, "I haven’t taken a dime of corporate PAC money because I want to represent the people." Manning is technically correct that she doesn’t take money from corporate PACs. But her claim ignores the fact that — like nearly all politicians — her donor list is full of CEOs, lobbyists, real estate developers and other corporate bigwigs. She also takes money from other types of non-corporate PACs, some of which are funded by corporate PACs and other business interests. "She’s got a lot of money from unions," said Sarah Bryner, the research director for campaign finance watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics. "Lots of PAC money. Just not what most of us would consider corporate PAC money." Many types of PACs Corporate PACs are one of three different types of political action committees (the others are labor PACs and political PACs) that can give directly to candidates. There are also super PACs, which can’t give to candidates but can spend money on their behalf. The Manning-Budd race has drawn more than $3 million in outside spending so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in addition to the nearly $5 million the candidates have raised. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics on its website OpenSecrets.org shows Manning’s $2.9 million in fundraising includes more than $180,000 from PACs as of Oct. 16. Budd’s $1.8 million in fundraising includes nearly $800,000 from PACs in that same period. For both candidates, their single largest donor is a political PAC. Bryner said donations like this make it hard for candidates to truly say their campaigns are free from corporate influence, since political PACs are often funded by corporate PACs or other corporate interests. For instance Manning took $10,000 from the New Democrat Coalition, a pro-business Democratic PAC that gets much of its funding from donors in industries like defense contracting, pharmaceuticals, insurance, energy and health care. And it’s far from the only PAC with business connections. "If you take money from a political party, that money may have come from a corporation," Bryner said. And then there’s the fact that corporate PACs are not funded from corporate revenues at all. It’s illegal for businesses to give money directly to candidates. Instead, corporate PACs are funded voluntarily by employees of the corporation. For that reason, Joseph Albanese, a researcher at the pro-PAC group Institute for Free Speech, wrote in March that it’s misleading and unfair for candidates to imply that taking money from corporate PACs is inherently worse than taking money from people who work for that company. "This is essentially equivalent to saying that donations from anyone who works for a corporation are a corrupting influence on our democracy," Albanese wrote. Manning’s big donors As one example, Manning has not taken any money directly from the PAC run by Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and other tech companies. That’s perhaps not too surprising; earlier this summer the magazine The Atlantic reported that "most nonincumbents don’t receive any corporate PAC donations." Manning has, however, taken money from at least three political PACs (the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, BRIDGE PAC and AmeriPAC) that are funded in part by the Alphabet PAC. Manning has also taken money from Alphabet employees, including $10,800 from the CEO (and his wife) of an urban development company Alphabet owns called Sidewalk Labs. "The idea that by rejecting corporate PAC money — which by the way is also money from people — that you’re rejecting corporate influence, is a little silly," Bryner said. The list of Manning’s most generous donors contains a lot of corporate bigwigs. The maximum donation a couple can give is $10,800, and some of the couples giving that amount include: ▪ Daniel Doctoroff and his wife Alisa. Daniel Doctoroff is the CEO of Sidewalk Labs. ▪ Kay Hagan and her husband Charles. Kay Hagan is a former U.S. senator and bank executive, and Charles Hagan is a Greensboro attorney. ▪ Doug Baker and his wife Julie. Doug Baker is the CEO of EcoLab, a Minnesota chemical company that owns the North Carolina cleaning supply company Swisher Hygiene. ▪ Seth Klarman and his wife Beth. Seth Klarman is the CEO of Baupost Group, one of the world’s biggest hedge funds. ▪ Bobby Long and his wife Kathryn. Bobby Long is a prominent Greensboro businessman who’s involved with the investment firm Granville Capitol, whose CEO Steve Hassenfelt also gave Manning $5,400. ▪ Norman Samet and his wife Sylvia. Norman Samet is the former leader of both the Triad and High Point chambers of commerce and owns a construction and development company, Samet Corp. A growing trend Despite the difficulties in avoiding corporate influence in elections, many politicians like Manning have recently been pledging to not take money from corporate PACs. Some of the politicians making similar claims have been urged on by End Citizens United, a PAC that is dedicated to opposing super PACs and corporate influence in politics. End Citizens United endorsed Manning and donated $8,500 to her campaign, writing: "Voters are fed up with the way Washington does business, and they’re demanding reform. By rejecting corporate PAC money, Kathy is taking bold steps to address the problem before she even gets to Congress." Perhaps the most notable member of this trend is Democratic Texas Senate challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke, who has raised a whopping $60 million in his attempt to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, has done so without any corporate PAC money. But for similar reasons as laid out in this fact-check, PolitiFact previously ruled O’Rouke’s 2017 claim about avoiding corporate cash as Half True. Our ruling Kathy Manning said "I’m not taking any corporate PAC money. I don’t want to be beholden to corporations." Manning is technically correct that she hasn’t taken any corporate PAC money. But she has taken money from other PACs, including from non-corporate PACs that are funded by corporate PACs. Furthermore, what Manning fails to mention is that corporate PACs are not funded by corporations themselves, but rather by the employees of those corporations. And she has taken plenty of money from employees of large corporations, including the CEOs of companies in industries like investment banking, real estate, chemicals and tech.

pomt-14281	"Many just call him 'Lyin' Ted.' ... His TV ad about John Kasich? Lie! Stations had to pull it off the air."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/06/new-day-america/john-kasichs-super-pac-slams-ted-cruz-tv-ad-cruzs-/	Businessman Donald Trump may have called Sen. Ted Cruz "Lyin' Ted," but a political action committee supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich has picked up the moniker in an attack ad against Cruz. "Many just call him 'Lyin' Ted,' " the ad begins, as Cruz's nose begins to grow, curving around his head and neck. "His TV ad about John Kasich? Lie! Stations had to pull it off the air. If Ted Cruz's mouth is moving, he's lying." We wanted details about an ad that was allegedly so wrong it had to be pulled. Our nosiness uncovered an important point: The ad that was pulled wasn't Cruz's ad. The super PAC that attacks Cruz as a liar is New Day for America, based in Kasich's home state. Spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp said its ad is attacking an anti-Kasich ad released by another super PAC, Trusted Leadership, which supports Cruz. The pulled ad, released March 29, shows side-by-side images of Kasich and George Soros, a liberal billionaire investor who is backing Hillary Clinton. Soros is reviled among conservatives the way the Koch brothers are disparaged by liberals. The image on the screen shows side-by-side photos of Soros and Kasich with the words, "Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros." Simultaneously, the announcer says, "Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling (Kasich's) super PAC." PolitiFact Ohio ruled that ad False, because Soros has not given any money to Kasich or his super PAC, and the "working side by side" reference is tenuous. It refers to one donor who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000 and another who is the former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management and started his own hedge fund with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. New Day complained about the Trusted Leadership commercial to the Wisconsin television stations that aired it, saying that unlike ads from the candidates themselves, stations have no obligation to run false or misleading super PAC ads. At least four stations pulled it, according to New Day, which provided supporting correspondence. (Trusted Leadership subsequently replaced the anti-Kasich spot with a revised ad that took out the words "Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros," and used "Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros cronies" instead.) There is, however, a larger problem with New Day's claim that this was another of Ted Cruz's "lies." Neither Cruz nor his campaign were responsible for the deceptive ad. It was the super PAC that supports him. That's a big distinction. Under federal law, the Cruz super PAC is not allowed to coordinate with Cruz or his campaign, or vice versa, and no one has put forward any evidence of that here. (There's a lot of suspicion that this barrier to coordination is more of a screen door than a wall. A campaign can easily see what the candidate's super PAC is doing publicly, and vice versa. So no illegal consultation is necessary to get them both on the same page, making it look like coordination.) Despite that legal separation, the New Day commercial specifically blames Cruz, giving him the ever-elongating nose and stating that if Cruz's lips are moving, he's lying. That makes New Day's TV commercial as misleading as the TV commercial it's complaining about. File this under "irony." And on the Truth-O-Meter, we rate it False.

pomt-06243	The Affordable Care Act is "not the law of the land."	false	/florida/statements/2011/dec/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-obamacare-not-law-land/	Gov. Rick Scott, who has led Florida's opposition to the federal Affordable Care Act, offered justification for refusing millions of dollars in grants to implement the health care law: "It's not the law of the land." His declaration to the Palm Beach Post editorial board on Nov. 17, 2011, prompted the paper to ask experts. And we wondered: Is that true? The Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, faces review by the U.S. Supreme Court after federal judges offered different opinions about whether some parts of the law violate the U.S. Constitution. That will stretch into next year. Meanwhile, most states are working to implement the law, which takes effect in stages through January 2015. But not Florida. Florida refused grants to roll out the complex 10-part statute when a Florida district court judge ruled it unconstitutional in January 2011, even though the same judge said the law should continue to be implemented as long as his ruling was quickly appealed (which it was). Scott's administration has turned away grants applied for under Gov. Charlie Crist, such as $2 million for Medicare outreach, $500,000 for an elder affairs counseling and assistance program, $1 million to help consumers monitor health care premiums in the state and $1 million to plan a health care exchange, according to the Governor's Office. Then it turned away larger sums, such as the first installment of more than $30 million to help keep disabled seniors out of nursing homes. Just how much has it turned away? The Governor's Office doesn't keep a tally, spokesman Lane Wright said. What Scott said We asked for an audio recording of Scott's discussion with the Palm Beach Post editorial board. Here's how that part of the conversation unfolded: Randy Schultz, the paper's editorial page editor, noted that Florida had not worked to implement Obama's health care law, then asked: "Will you implement the law if the Supreme Court upholds all or part of it?" Scott replied: "If it's the law of the land, we'll be ready." Post editorial writer Rhonda Swan commented that the state has rejected millions in federal grants designed to help the state prepare. So, she asked, how would the governor pay for implementation? "It's my job, if it's the law of the country, to be ready when it's the law," Scott said. "... When it's the law of the land, we'll implement the law." "Where will you find the money?" Swan asked. "It'll be part of our budget," Scott said. Swan continued to press, finally asking: "Why not take the money that the federal government is offering now so you can be prepared?" "Because it's not the law of the land," Scott said. "I don't believe it'll ever become the law of the land." Legal views While some judges have found the law to be unconstitutional, none has told states to stop implementing it. Most of the more than 30 cases challenging the law have been dismissed, are awaiting arguments or — in four cases, according to the Justice Department — upheld the law. While some judges have found the law to be unconstitutional, none have told states to stop implementing it. Instead, they've encouraged the Supreme Court to settle the issue. One subject of constitutional controversy is the law's requirement that people purchase health insurance or pay a penalty — known as the "individual mandate" — which starts in 2014. A Virginia judge who struck down just the individual mandate in December 2010 didn't freeze implementation of the law. An appeals court overturned his decision, anyway, and the Supreme Court has been asked to review the case. In the most significant challenge to the law, which was filed by Florida, 25 other states, two individuals and the National Federation of Independent Businesses, a district court judge found parts of the law unconstitutional, including the individual mandate. Judge Roger Vinson concluded the mandate couldn't be severed from the legislation, and so struck down the whole law in January 2011. But he said states could continue implementing it as the appeals process moved forward. The appeals court also found the individual mandate unconstitutional, but said that it could be struck down alone, preserving the rest of the law. The Supreme Court has agreed to review the case. Meanwhile, Scott says the health care law is "not the law of the land." That interpretation didn't sit well with Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law who has closely followed legal wrangling over the Affordable Care Act. Unless it's declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, it is "the law of the land," he told PolitiFact. "This is the law -- it's been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president," Jost said. That's also the position of the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services. "Legal challenges are nothing new, but they don't change the status of a law," said spokeswoman Erin Shields. So, what did the governor mean? Spokesman Lane Wright said that beyond constitutional questions about the health care law, its most significant and expensive provisions don't take effect until 2014. Those include an expansion of Medicaid, the mandate that individuals purchase health insurance and a requirement for states to set up health insurance exchanges to make coverage available to people who don't get it through their employers. "None of those are in effect right now and, hence, are not the law of the land," Wright said. Of course, many provisions of the law are in effect. There's already a 50 percent discount for name-brand drugs in the Medicare "doughnut hole." Young adults can get insurance coverage through their parents. Insurance companies can't go back and search for a technical error on an application to deny payment for services once someone gets sick. Small businesses qualify for tax credits to help them provide health benefits to workers. New insurance plans must offer free preventive care. That's just a partial list of elements of the law in effect last year. Meanwhile, does the governor really mean to argue that he's turning away money to prepare for provisions of the law to go into effect because they haven't yet gone into effect? Randy Barnett, a Georgetown law professor involved in the Supreme Court challenge to the health care law, offered another interpretation of Scott's statement. The governor took an oath to support the Constitution. So he might take the stance that the law, "though properly enacted, is contrary to the Constitution and therefore not a valid and binding law," Barnett said. So Jost -- a law professor who considers the health care law constitutional -- finds Scott's statement "ridiculous." But Barnett -- who considers it unconstitutional -- suggests Scott has a point. Does one represent the settled legal view? We asked Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has argued 35 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. (He's also publicly debated the constitutionality of the health care law and worked as an adviser to the Justice Department at the time the law passed.) "Of course the Affordable Care Act is the 'law of the land,' " he said. "It is completely settled that, although public officials and citizens generally are entitled to have and to express their own opinions that a duly enacted federal statute like the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution, unless and until the United States Supreme Court upholds that view, the rule of law requires that the Affordable Care Act be enforced unless repealed. ... "We would not have a functioning system of government if officials could take the law into their own hands whenever they held the view that Congress had exceeded its authority." Our ruling Scott said he's refusing federal grant money to implement the Affordable Care Act in Florida "because it's not the law of the land." Some federal judges have found parts of the law to be unconstitutional and several more say it's fine. But more importantly, none have asked that the law not be implemented as they wait for the U.S. Supreme Court to offer the final word. While one legal expert suggests the governor can unilaterally refuse to enforce a law he finds unconstitutional, other experts tell us it's generally settled that once a statute's been enacted, it's the "law of the land" until the Supreme Court or Congress says it's not. The Governor's Office argues the law's not "the law of the land," because several significant provisions haven't yet taken effect. But that misses the point. It's telling that the governor has resisted implementing all parts of the law, not just those slated to take effect later or that have raised constitutional questions. Scott can argue it's not a good idea, but it's incorrect for him to claim it's not the law. We rate his statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-12-01T14:14:00	2011-11-17	['None']

The re-deployment of French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle into the conflict in November pushed the number of French aircraft involved over 40, outnumbering Australia's aircraft contribution five to one. The French carrier has 3,500 personnel on board to support operations, whilst Australia has only 400 personnel assigned to its Air Task Group, although Australia also has around 600 personnel at Al Minhad who may be important to the mission but have not been counted as part of the total. Furthermore, air sorties and strikes are difficult to compare due to the ambiguous nature of the wording used by different countries, as well as different reporting dates. Whilst Australia has been and still is making a substantial contribution to the US-led coalition, experts contacted by Fact Check agree that France has now overtaken Australia, which puts Australia third at best.

pomt-04939	"The voting public had no say" in the Atlanta region’s proposed transportation project list.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/28/lights-liberty/public-input-transportation-project-list-disputed/	A group of metro Atlanta residents recently hit the road -- literally -- to publicize its opposition to a 1 percent sales tax to help fund dozens of transportation projects across the region. They drove around I-285 with their vehicles decorated to signify their disapproval of the proposed tax. Many of the reasons the group, Lights for Liberty, opposes the tax have been well-documented. But there was one claim on the list we hadn’t seen much of before. Voters will decide the tax in a Tuesday referendum after a hard-fought campaign by supporters and opponents. . "The tax proceeds will be spent to complete a project list in which the voting public had no say," Lights for Liberty said in a press release. No say, you say? PolitiFact Georgia took a ride on the information superhighway to see if the group’s claim is correct. We were particularly curious about this one since we rated True a statement several months ago that 200,000 residents had a chance "to identify projects they preferred." The Georgia General Assembly voted in 2010 to allow a voter referendum this year that gives citizens the choice to increase the sales tax for projects that proponents believe will reduce traffic congestion. State officials and transportation planners in a 10-county region that encompasses and surrounds Atlanta came up with hundreds of ideas. Those 10 counties are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. A regional "roundtable" of 21 elected officials was charged with winnowing the wish list to a final list of projects that could realistically be paid for during the 10 years the tax is scheduled to be in effect. The elected officials included the head of each of the 10 county governments, a mayor from each of those counties and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. Atlanta lies in both Fulton and DeKalb counties. In October 2011, 18 of those 21 officials present unanimously approved the list of more than 150 projects. A few months before that vote, in June 2011, roundtable staff held a telephone town hall meeting in each of the 10 counties. An estimated 1.3 million area residents were called (there are slightly more than 3 million adults in the region) and encouraged to ask questions. About 134,000 participated in the town hall meetings and were asked a specific question concerning transportation in their county. In September 2011, roundtable officials held meetings in each county where maps of the proposed projects were shown. Attendees were able to take a survey about the projects and talk to the staff. Afterward, an hour-long question-and-answer session was held between the public and staff. The Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network pointed out these and other efforts to engage the public when we fact-checked their claim that 200,000 people have the opportunity to identify projects they preferred. Lights for Liberty is a grassroots group with about a dozen members. A Lights for Liberty member said he was aware of the outreach, but still believed the claim in the group’s press release is on target that the public had no say in completing the project list. "Maybe, there was an attempt to talk to the people, but the people weren’t really involved in this," said Billy Wise, who lives in Gwinnett County and describes himself as a taxpayer advocate. Wise argues there has been no cost-benefit analysis of the projects. He has decried the lack of public input in the referendum. Wise said telephone town hall meetings aren’t the best method to get public input from people who are busy raising a family and working and have had little time to digest the proposed sales tax. "The guy out there mowing his lawn would absolutely have no clue (about the tax) and I think a lot of that happened here," he said. "I’ve been a phone screener and I’ve gotten a lot of ‘What?’ or people hanging up." In Cobb County, leaders hit the brakes on plans for a light rail line from the Cumberland area to the MARTA Arts Center station in Atlanta after residents, tea party activists and others voiced their opposition to the idea. Meanwhile, many south DeKalb County residents have literally begged for a rail line to the Stonecrest area, with no success. Wise makes an interesting argument that average voters haven’t had a fair shot at weighing in on a list that was approved by 18 elected officials.

pomt-11392	"Florida passes bill legalizing recreational use of marijuana."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/26/abc-news-us/recycled-fake-news-story-claims-florida-has-become/	An Internet hoax wrongly claims that Florida has become the next state to legalize recreational marijuana. "Florida passes bill legalizing recreational use of marijuana" read the headline on ABC News-US.com, a hoax site using the same logo as the real ABC News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that Florida lawmakers passed a bill to legalize medical and recreational marijuana in order to boost the economy and create jobs. It claims that the law will be in place before Easter, which is April 1. The article included bogus quotes from Rep. Janet Cruz, a Democrat from Tampa, that the bill would stimulate the economy. Cruz is also quoted noting the economic advantages Colorado has after legalizing recreational marijuana. Those quotes are made up. Karol Molinares, deputy communications director for the Florida House of Representatives’ Democratic Office, said Cruz never said those things. And no marijuana law like this has passed. In fact, the site also posted the same fake story about Wisconsin, even using the same quotes, only changing the names of state representatives. Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment in 2016 allowing for the use of medical marijuana. Lawmakers produced a bill in 2017 to implement rules and regulations, according to the Associated Press. Our ruling A site known to peddle online hoaxes claimed that Florida passed a bill making recreational marijuana legal. But that’s not true. The story was repurposed from a debunked fake story about Wisconsin passing the same fictional legislation. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03182	"The city of Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/03/earl-blumenauer/has-portland-won-more-national-Constitution-contes/	PolitiFact Oregon can’t be everywhere, listening to stray statements crying out to be fact checked, so we rely on colleagues to have their ears up and ready. This one comes to us via The Oregonian’s senior political reporter, from a Portland City Club forum with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Portland. The topic was government surveillance. But lucky you, we’re not checking a statement related to spying. The statement we have is way more fun. During the lunchtime program, Blumenauer did some civic boasting about two high schools in his district that have distinguished themselves in an annual contest hosted by the Center for Civic Education, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in California. "I represent the two teams that alternate the national championships. Last year it was Lincoln, this year it's Grant. Who knows what is going to happen (next) year," he said. "But ladies and gentlemen, the City of Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America." The program is called "We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution Program," and it’s been around since 1987 with its first competition in 1988. High schools compete to display knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and the winning team from each state moves to the finals in Washington, D.C. This year, Grant High School in Northeast Portland placed first in nationals. Last year, Lincoln High School in Southwest Portland won. We asked for a list of winners from the center, and then we did some fancy Excel work -- it’s called cut and paste and sort -- and voila: Results worthy enough for an analysis. We found that four schools have each won First Place in the national championship four times: Lincoln High; East Brunswick High School in East Brunswick, New Jersey; East High School in Denver, Colorado; and Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami, Florida. With Grant High the champion this year, that brings the city of Portland to five First Place finishes, more than any other city in the United States. Blumenauer can proudly claim the distinction. But before we signed off on this fact check, we wanted to make sure of one last angle. Is this the only national Constitution conference? Could there be a rival program that shuts out Portland? We asked the people at the Classroom Law Project, the nonprofit in Oregon that coordinates the state’s We the People program. "None that I know of. I'd say Earl is RIGHT!" wrote Barbara Rost, program director, in an email. PolitiFact Oregon agrees. The statement is True.

pomt-07838	The war in Iraq was a major factor in blowing "the top off the price of oil."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/14/jim-webb/sen-jim-webb-says-iraq-war-major-reason-oil-price-/	Jim Webb campaigned for Senate in 2006 in strong opposition to the war in Iraq, always wearing his deployed son’s combat boots. The Democrat, who announced Feb. 9 that he would not run for re-election, recently discussed the war and its impact on oil prices while questioning James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. "We were worried, and were saying so at the time, that this endeavor would harm the country's economy--that it would blow the top off the price of oil," Webb said during a Feb. 3 hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I recall when the Congress voted to go to war in Iraq, oil was $24 a barrel. It went up to $143. Today, it's about $102." Each trip to the gas pump in recent months has been a stark reminder that oil is more expensive than it used to be. We wondered if the U.S. invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq was a major factor in blowing "the top off the price of oil." Congress authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq on October 11, 2002. On that day, the spot price for a barrel of European Brent crude oil was $28.18, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was $29.36 per barrel that day, according to the EIA. We are relying on the spot price, which refers to the price a trader would pay for an immediate settlement of a trade, rather than prices from futures contracts -- another widely-used method of purchasing oil -- because the EIA keeps exhaustive spot price archives. During November 2002 the spot price of Brent crude fell to and below the $24 per barrel threshold mentioned by Webb. It bottomed at $22.82 on Nov. 14, 2002. WTI crude fell to $25.28 the same week. Brent prices fluctuated above and below $30 per barrel in early 2003, hitting $34.16 the week before the U.S. invasion but falling to $28.00 on March 20, the day U.S. forces began their assault on Iraq. Brent went below $24 per barrel at the end of April 2003 and stayed below $40 until July 2004. Costs trended higher through the rest of 2004 and into 2005, raising up to $66 per barrel. Prices reached as high as $78 per in August 2006, but it wasn’t until the summer and fall of 2007 that oil really took off. The $80 per barrel threshold was breached in September 2007, and in November of that year prices for Brent crude moved above $90. The closing price hit $100 on Feb. 29, 2008. Most of us remember the spring and summer that followed. Crude prices soared higher, and tabs at the pump followed. Brent peaked at $143.95 on July 3, 2008. Two weeks later the price was down to $129.34, and by early-December, as the global economy spiraled deep into a severe recession, prices dived below $40 per barrel. They’ve been climbing since the start of 2009, and Brent nudged above the $100 mark on Feb. 1 as protests in Egypt continued to build. So how does Iraq fit in to this roller coaster? Webb’s comments on oil prices closely mirror those of Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and Nobel Prize winner. In a September 2010 op-ed for The Washington Post, Stiglitz and co-author Linda Bilmes noted the increase in oil prices during the past several years. They wrote that "not only was Iraqi production interrupted, but the instability the war brought to the Middle East dampened investment in the region." The two said the "war’s impact on prices works out to at least $10 per barrel," an estimate they called "still conservative," but up from their 2008 appraisal of a $5 per barrel increase caused by the war. We spoke to David Kreutzer, a research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to ask what drove oil prices so high in recent years. "It is all about supply in the long run," he said. "The war shut down what production Iraq had in the first place and raised shipping costs in the [Persian] Gulf over the short term. But in the long run Iraq is a factor only to the extent it was not producing as high as it could. The insurgency did attack pipelines but growing demand from China and India were the key story." According to the EIA, China used 4.9 million barrels of oil a day in 2001. In 2009, the last year for which data is available, it consumed 8.3 million barrels a day. India’s daily consumption during that time went from 2.2 million barrels to 3.1 million. Global demand went from 77.8 million barrels a day to a peak of 86.0 million in 2007. During 2009 the world used 84.4 million barrels a day. Of that, the United States consumed 18.8 million barrels. In 2001 Iraq was the world’s 12th-largest oil producer, pumping out 2.4 million barrels a day, according to EIA data. That fell to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2003 and hovered near 2.0 million barrels per day from 2004 through 2006. Only in 2008 and 2009 did the country return to its 2001 production levels. The EIA says Iraq has the world’s fourth-largest proven petroleum reserves, trailing Saudi Arabia, Canada and Iran. The group also says "Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast reserves, proven and unknown, have barely been exploited." Charles Ebinger, the director of the Energy Security Initiative at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said rising demand goes beyond China and India, and beyond instability in Iraq. "There is no doubt that the Iraq crisis led to near-term upward movement of prices, particularly after invasion," he said. "But the far more dynamic pressure has been rising demand in Asia. China of course, but also Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan, even Bangladesh." These price increases also came at a time when the global economy was booming, Ebinger noted. The Dow Jones Industrial average peaked above 14,000 in October 2007 and was still above 12,000 as late as June 2008. "The perception was it would continue driving commodity prices up," he said. "China was taking lots and lots of commodities and that was having a psychological impact on the markets as well." So where does that leave us on Webb’s claim that the war in Iraq helped "blow the top off the price of oil?" The government’s energy data collection unit tracked a sharp decrease in Iraqi oil production during the aftermath of the U.S. invasion. And two experts on oil production said the war had a short-term impact on prices. But both also said higher demand in China and other emerging economies, along with a surging global economy before the 2008 recession, were far more important factors. Global demand for oil has increased by 7.6 million barrels a day over the last decade -- more than three time Iraq’s peak output during that period. Webb is correct that the Invasion of Iraq had an effect on oil prices, especially immediately after the invasion. But rising demand from China and other developing nations played a far more important role over the course of the past eight years. We find his statement is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07824	Says Travis County, home to Austin, is the most liberal county in the United States.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/feb/16/tom-delay/tom-delays-calls-travis-count-home-austin-most-lib/	Questioning his Travis County conviction for laundering corporate money to help GOP Texas House candidates, Tom DeLay reminded NBC-TV’s "Today" show Jan. 13 that his trial took place on Republican-unfriendly turf. Asked by NBC’s Matt Lauer about the jury’s motivation, DeLay replied: "Well, first of all, I was tried in the most liberal county in the state of Texas, indeed in the United States." No question, Travis County, where Democratic candidates thrive, where Ann Richards bloomed, where Barack Obama has been welcomed by roaring crowds, is a liberal haven. But most liberal in the land? Seeking back-up information, we reached DeLay’s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman. Garcia said by e-mail that the county’s liberal pre-eminence is a fact reported many times. Indeed, a Nexis search delivered numerous articles linking Travis County" and "most liberal," including about 50 stories mentioning DeLay. A closer look showed Travis County routinely described as the state’s most liberal county, but we didn’t spot anyone but DeLay calling it the most liberal in the nation. Typical: A Nov. 25 news report by The Associated Press on DeLay’s conviction: "DeLay had unsuccessfully tried to get the trial moved out of Austin, the most liberal city in one of the most Republican states." A February 2005 column by the since-deceased conservative commentator Robert Novak refers to then-Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle as an "intense partisan Democrat who is routinely re-elected in Texas's most liberal county." Likewise, a June 2005 article in Congressional Quarterly Weekly quotes Steve Bickerstaff, adjunct professor in the University of Texas School of Law, calling Earle "part of the Democratic mainstream of this county, which is more liberal than elsewhere in the state." We found one instance of a commentator airing doubts about the county’s liberal-ness compared to others nationally. On MSNBC Jan. 13, actor-comedian Sam Seder, a guest host on its left-leaning and now-defunct "Countdown" program, said: "Travis County, where Austin is located, is bluer than most of the state; 64 percent of the residents voted" for Obama for president "in 2008. But calling it the most liberal county in the country might be just a stretch." In a similar vein, we learned that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, recently weighed DeLay’s characterization. In a Jan. 14 post headlined "DeLay’s Spin Cycle," the group noted that greater shares of voters voted for Obama in more than a dozen Texas counties, including Hidalgo (69 percent for Obama), Webb (72 percent), Presidio (71 percent), Zavala (84 percent) and Jim Hogg (74 percent). Nationally, FactCheck.org said, a greater share of voters in many other counties cast ballots for Obama. Next, we noticed a August 2005 study rating the nation’s most liberal and conservative cities based on results of the 2004 presidential election. Detroit was the most liberal, followed by Gary, Indiana, and Berkeley, California, according to the study by the California-based Bay Area Center for Voting Research. Austin ranked as the 93rd-most liberal city. Dallas, the study said, was more liberal, placing 32nd nationally. A Google search brought us to an April 2010 post by The Daily Caller, a conservative Washington-based website that touts its reporting and commentary. The site designated the nation’s 100 counties deemed most friendly to liberals based on factors including the share of votes carried by Democrats John Kerry and Obama, respectively, in 2004 and 2008; percentages of adults with a bachelor’s degree or more as well as in management/professional jobs; the status of same-sex partnerships; strictness of smoking bans; and the number of local Whole Foods stores, referring to the natural-foods’ grocery chain headquartered in Austin. The No. 1 most liberal-friendly county, the Caller said, is California’s San Francisco County; followed by Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of the nation’s capital; Northern California’s Marin County; Colorado’s Boulder County; and New York County, where Obama carried 85 percent of the 2008 vote. Travis County was the 57th most liberal-friendly county. We wondered how Obama fared in the Caller’s 20 most liberal-friendly counties. According to 2008 results posted online by the New York Times, he won greater shares of the vote (ranging from 70 to 90 percent) in 18 counties than he did in Travis County. Finally, we talked to Dick DeGuerin, DeLay’s lawyer, who shared part of an August 2010 poll of Travis County voters by GOP pollster Mike Baselice. According to the results, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points, about one-third identified themselves as liberals and the same portion identified themselves as conservatives. Also, some 60 percent of the 400 respondents had a positive impression of Barack Obama, compared to 35 percent for George W. Bush and 16 percent for DeLay. We wondered how Travis County’s voters compared ideologically to voters in San Francisco County. Benjamin Meyers, a research associate at David Binder Research in San Francisco, shared part of a November poll in the county, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Of 500 respondents, 60 percent said they were registered Democrats, 10 percent said they were registered Republicans and others declined to say or indicated affiliation with another party. Fifty percent of the voters identified themselves as progressive or liberal, 25 percent said they were moderate and 14 percent said they were conservative. Travis County, liberal? Certainly, especially by Texas standards. Most liberal in the country? Not by a long shot. The statement is more than wrong -- it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14261	Polls show "Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump" as her opponent.	true	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/10/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-ted-cruz-supporter-says-hillary-clinton/	With doubts persisting over whether Donald Trump will be able to clinch the Republican presidential nomination on the first ballot, NBC's Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked conservative commentator and Ted Cruz supporter Glenn Beck what he would do if Trump is the nominee. Beck said he would never vote for Trump and instead would probably focus on the strongest House and Senate candidates who "would keep Hillary Clinton at bay because Trump is not going to win the general. If you look at the polls — Todd, and you know this no matter what they say — you look at the polls, Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump." For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Beck is accurately characterizing the national head-to-head polls. As it turns out, he is. Our source is the compilation of national surveys by RealClearPolitics.com. Since a Fox News poll dating back to Feb. 15, Clinton has won every hypothetical head-to-head matchup with the billionaire. And in every case, the winning margin has been larger than the poll's margin of error. The website’s aggregation of the most recent polls gives Clinton a spread of 10.5 percentage points over Trump. The trend has been clear for the past year. If you go back to polls released in May 2015 (before Trump was officially a candidate), Clinton has bested Trump in 51 of 58 matchups. In 43 of those surveys, she's outpolled Trump by a percentage that's greater than the margin of error. Trump has come out on top in only five polls. The last time was in a February USA Today/Suffolk survey, where the two-point spread was within the margin of error. That poll has not been repeated. His winning margin hasn't been greater than the margin of error since a November survey by Fox News. More importantly, Fox's two newest polls, from February and March, both show Clinton winning. The March survey gives her a winning margin of 11 percentage points. One of those five polls, from early September, hasn't been repeated either. Two other surveys released since May 2015 have had him tied with Clinton. The most recent was conducted in early October. But once again, the latest versions of those polls, by Public Policy Polling in late March and CNN/ORC in mid March, have Clinton way ahead. Our ruling The bottom line is every recent poll shows Clinton clearly ahead of Trump. The only polls that favor Trump are old and have mostly been superseded by newer surveys showing that Clinton has pulled ahead. We rate Beck's claim True.

pomt-11421	A Trump administration proposal for the Interior Department "is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/19/ryan-zinke/ryan-zinke-wrong-trump-proposal-would-be-biggest-e/	Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said President Donald Trump’s administration has record-setting plans to invest in federal government landholdings. "The president is a builder and the son of a plumber, as I am," Zinke told the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee. "I look forward to working with the president on restoring America's greatness through a historic investment of our public lands infrastructure. This is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history. Let me repeat that, this is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in the history of this country." Zinke specified that he was referring to the president's budget proposal, which would create a fund to provide "up to $18 billion over 10 years for maintenance and improvements in our national parks, our national wildlife refuges, and Bureau of Indian Education funds." When we took a closer look, we found Zinke’s assertion to be dubious. There is little chance that the Civilian Conservation Corps, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal-era program, will lose its place atop the list of federal programs that have supported public-lands infrastructure. The Trump administration proposal The president’s budget for fiscal year 2019 proposes "a new Public Lands Infrastructure Fund" for repairs and improvements at places such as national parks and wildlife refuges. The administration estimates that increased energy development on federal lands and in federal waters "has the potential to generate up to $18 billion over 10 years for parks and other public lands infrastructure." However, there is no certainty that the idea will win the necessary congressional approval. It’s common for presidential budget proposals to wither on the vine, even when the president has a Congress controlled by his own party. Also, Zinke said "up to $18 billion," meaning that the final amount could be well below that. Generating any money at all to fill the fund’s coffers would require additional energy development from federal lands and waters. New development seems possible in the Trump era. But the number of new projects will depend heavily on international market conditions for oil and gas, which are currently modest by historical standards. Finally, this doesn’t take into account any cuts to public lands infrastructure that emerge from elsewhere in the administration’s budget. Overall, the proposal would cut the Interior Department by 15 percent. For the sake of this fact-check, let’s assume that the federal government is able to come up with enough new drilling projects to spend the full $18 billion on public lands infrastructure and that it avoids any offsetting maintenance cuts from other parts of the budget. Even in that scenario, Zinke’s proposal pales compared to the investments made under the Civilian Conservation Corps. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps circa 1933. (National Archives) How does the CCC cost compare with Trump plan? Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps in the midst of the Great Depression and just over a month after he was inaugurated in 1933. The program paid unmarried men (and only men) between 18 and 25 years of age to do unskilled labor to conserve and develop natural resources on public lands. Workers received room, board and $30 a month, most of which had to be sent back home to the worker’s family. Some received educational services in the camps, with tens of thousands learning to read for the first time. Among the corps’ achievements were the planting of more than 2 billion trees, the construction of more than 125,000 miles of roads and trails, the creation of more than 6 million erosion control structures, the stringing of 89,000 miles of telephone lines, and 6 million work days fighting forest fires. All told, 3.5 million men took part during the program’s nine years of existence, spread over more than 1,000 constantly shifting camps at any given time. "There is no doubt in my mind that the CCC was the most groundbreaking program to ever influence our park system at the local, state, and national levels," said Neil M. Maher, author of the book Nature’s New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement. The corps "basically built the infrastructure of our National Park system." The most frequent estimate of the program’s cost is a cumulative $3 billion in outlays during its nine-year life. From our research, this figure appears to be credible. The CCC’s director wrote in 1939 that it had cost $2 billion; that was two-thirds of the way through the program’s life. And according to a Park Service study, the annual annual cost per CCC enrollee was $1,004 per year. If you assume that the average tenure of the CCC’s 3.5 million workers was about a year, that would produce a cumulative cost around $3 billion. Such calculations "sound right — millions of young men, camps to house them, food and uniforms, and they were paid," said Steven Stoll, an environmental historian at Fordham University. Once you factor in inflation, $3 billion spent in the 1930s would be the equivalent of about $53 billion today — about three times bigger than even the fully funded Trump proposal. The CCC’s investment appears even more massive when viewed as a percentage of federal spending. During the 1930s, when federal outlays were more modest, the CCC’s $3 billion investment accounted for just over 4 percent of all federal outlays that were made over the program’s nine-year period. By contrast, the fully funded Trump proposal would account for somewhere around four ten-thousandths of 1 percent of federal outlays during its 10-year life. Trump administration response Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift pointed out that the CCC "also incorporated state and local land." It’s true that the CCC created more than 700 state parks and upgraded many others, in addition to its efforts on federally owned land. Ultimately, though, the point is moot: Zinke didn’t say the proposal is the largest investment in federal lands infrastructure. He said "public lands infrastructure," and state and local parks count as "public lands." Our ruling Zinke said that a Trump administration proposal for the Interior Department "is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history." It’s far from assured that the maximum figure of $18 billion in the proposal will ever be reached if enacted. Beyond that, though, Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps would amount to $53 billion today, and it accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time.

pomt-01698	"There are only about 10 people in the United States Senate who have any real business experience."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/13/david-perdue/perdue-largely-target-claim-about-businesspeople-s/	Republican David Perdue is hoping to parlay his achievements in corporate America into a six-year term as a U.S. senator from Georgia. At virtually every campaign stop since he announced his candidacy last year, Perdue has stressed his leadership at well-known corporations, including Sara Lee, Reebok and Dollar General. "There are only about 10 people in the United States Senate who have any real business experience," Perdue said during a recent campaign swing through Middle Georgia. "And with my 40-year career, I hope to add some value to the debate of how to break the gridlock between tax increases and spending cuts and get this economy going and put people back to work." Perdue, 64, and Democrat Michelle Nunn, 47, are first-time candidates locked in one of this year’s most closely watched elections. The outcome of the race will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama’s presidency. Libertarian Amanda Swafford is also in the race, which will determine who succeeds retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. PolitiFact Georgia decided to ponder Perdue’s point -- with 100 members in the U.S. Senate, could only one in 10 senators have a background in business? We started with the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Quarterly Roll Call Guide to the New Congress, two sources of detailed information on House and Senate members, including their average age, religion and education. In the 113th Congress, 27 senators identified "business" as their occupation, according to the groups’ data. But it’s more complicated than that. The law was the No. 1 occupation in the Senate (with 55 out of 100), followed by careers in public service and or politics (with 42 members listing that as their occupation), according to the data. Here’s the complication: There were two qualifiers to the data. In responding to a survey by Congressional Quarterly, some members of Congress listed more than one occupation, and members of Congress may not have been practicing their listed profession immediately before they entered Congress. As for Perdue, he is using a number that campaign researchers gleaned by going through the biographies of all 100 senators, said Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman. "The occupational summary information available online was fairly generic and did not describe primary work responsibilities," Dickey said. He said the campaign research zeroed in on senators who worked in the corporate world or had responsibility for a company’s profit and loss margins. "Some of the members’ primary occupations are debatable, which is why we use the language ‘about 10,’ " Dickey said. Perdue isn’t the first candidate to make his business background a key campaign focus. In 2010, businessman Ron Johnson unseated Russ Feingold, a three-term Wisconsin Democrat, in one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the midterms. Political pundits said Johnson capitalized on the electorate’s economic angst with an ad that pointed out that the 100-member Senate had 57 lawyers, including Feingold, but just one accountant and no manufacturers. Johnson, who is an accountant and manufacturer, presented himself as a candidate with know-how to balance a budget and create jobs. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that a candidate promoting himself as a businessman is trying to project the image of someone who is "practical, knows the value of hard work and knows how to balance a budget." "In this particular case, though, I doubt Perdue has any occupational edge over Nunn," Sabato said. "Running a nonprofit requires some of the same skills, and the Points of Light foundation has the added advantage of being tied to a former GOP president -- no doubt one reason why Nunn stresses it." So where does this leave us? Perdue identified "about 10" business people in the Senate. His campaign research was more narrowly focused on people with responsibility for a company’s bottom line. But the overarching theme of Perdue’s statement is correct. Members who are or consider themselves as business people are in the minority in the U.S. Senate. And that’s according to his tally and official records. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-08-13T00:00:00	2014-08-04	['United_States']

An Aug. 29, 2017, post on HoustonChronicle-tv.com said, "Floyd Mayweather Jr. donates a whopping sum of money to Houston after hurricane." Facebook users reported the post as potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news. The link at HoustonChronicle-tv.com redirects to a story on NewsPhd.com, which in turn credits the story to "Houston Chronicles TV." The Internet Archive showed that the story originally was posted at HoustonChronicle-tv.com but has apparently since been changed. The post said the champion boxer was giving $200 million to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, which displaced thousands with high winds and flooding. As of this writing, the death toll has reached 24, according to CNN. "My thoughts and prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Houston," Mayweather is quoted. "My initiative is donating $200m to the entire Houston community to assist and house victims of the devastating flood that has rendered people homeless. The fund is intended to provide shelter, food, clothing and medicines." Facebook users also flagged the same assertion on a couple of other websites. There is no credible report that Mayweather, pictured below, has made a contribution that large. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Mayweather’s name likely became a target for fake news writers after he won a guaranteed $100 million for his Aug. 26 boxing match against MMA fighter Conor McGregor (his share of money from the fight could climb as high as $300 million). HoustonChronicle-tv.com is not the website for a TV news station, or the Houston area’s real newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. It’s a fake news site that we’ve listed on our Fake News Almanac as mimicking a legitimate media outlet. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com While Mayweather does have a foundation that aids and promotes community groups, there has been no news that the foundation or the boxer have given money out specifically for hurricane relief. Another sign the story is fake is that the same unsubstantiated details have been attributed to other boxers. This same story has already been reused, almost word-for-word, to say that boxer Manny Pacquiao gave $50 million to the city for hurricane relief. How or why this post has ended up on other sites is hard to say, but it doesn’t go the distance on our Truth-O-Meter. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-06248	"A part-time Congress with half the pay would still make $38,000 a year more than the average American family."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-members-congress-half-pay/	As part of his "uproot and overhaul Washington" plan, Texas Gov. Rick Perry wants to make Congress look more like the Texas Legislature by transforming it into a "part-time" body whose members hold regular jobs. He also wants to halve member salaries. A day after unveiling the proposals, Perry wrote a letter to U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, saying that "no one can truly believe that Americans are satisfied with business as usual" in the nation’s capital. "A part-time Congress with half the pay would still make $38,000 a year more than the average American family," Perry wrote in the Nov. 16, 2011, letter. "Do you truly oppose lawmakers spending more time in their districts? Is it so important for the Washington power brokers to build their fiefdoms of influence, including providing bailouts to Wall Street while businesses on Main Street are being boarded up every day?" We wondered whether Perry was right that members of Congress would still earn nearly $40,000 more than the average American family if their pay were halved. First, a little background: Perry's letter to Pelosi followed reports that the second-ranking Democrat in the House, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, had criticized Perry's overhaul proposals. According to a Nov. 15, 2011, Washington Post blog post, Hoyer said: "Is this a serious proposal that (Perry's) making for a country that has very high unemployment, whose budget deficit is larger than it's ever been in history, and we have two wars that we're confronting and trying to bring to conclusion? If this is what he thinks is pandering to the tea party, it is not, in my opinion, speaking to the issues that the American public feels are very, very critical to them — jobs being the number-one issue." Perry opened his letter by saying that Hoyer's "outburst" had caused him to wonder whether Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic caucus also opposed "urgent reforms the American people so vehemently demand." Perry closed the letter by inviting Pelosi to debate his proposal with him in Washington — an offer she declined. So, what about Perry's numbers? His campaign did not respond to a request for information to back up his statement. However, the portion of Perry's campaign website devoted to his "overhaul Washington" plan says that the annual salary of members of Congress is $174,000 and that the median household income in the United States is $49,445. With those numbers in hand, we can test Perry's statement that if members of Congress lost half their annual pay, they would still earn $38,000 a year more than the average American family. Half of $174,000 (congressional pay) is $87,000, which is $37,555 more than the household income figure Perry cites. Round up to get to $38,000. Like good fact-checkers, we looked for the source of Perry's figures, starting with the congressional pay number. According to a September 2011 Congressional Research Service report, Perry's figure is on the money: The salary for members of Congress in 2011 and 2012 is $174,000. Under a 1989 law, senators and representatives get automatic pay raises each year unless they vote to stop them. The current salary has been in place since Jan. 1, 2009, when members received a 2.8 percent raise. Congress voted to forgo both the 2010 and 2011 increases. A third piece of legislation, passed in 2010, requires that most federal workers and members of Congress not receive a pay increase before Dec. 31, 2012. It's important to note that the annual salary figure that Perry used in his calculation excludes the value of benefits that U.S. representatives and senators receive, such as health insurance. It also overlooks other sources of wealth — which can be substantial. Members of Congress are required to disclose some information about their finances, and each year, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, examines those filings and ranks the 50 richest members of Congress. Representatives and senators are not required to report precisely how much they are worth, but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities. Focusing on the low end of those ranges, Roll Call calculates each member's minimum net worth, which is then used as the basis for the ranking. The paper's latest analysis, published Nov. 1, 2011, says that members had a collective net worth of more than $2 billion in 2010 and that U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, was the richest man in Congress, with a minimum net worth of $294 million. Roll Call reported that "the lion's share" of McCaul's wealth is held by his wife, Linda, the daughter of Lowry Mays, who founded media giant Clear Channel Communications. Now, to Perry's household income figure. According to Perry's website, that statistic is from a September 2011 Census Bureau report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage in the United States in 2010. Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, told us that the report contains the most recent and best information on U.S. household income, which is based on a survey of 100,000 U.S. addresses. Inside, we found that the Census Bureau's estimate for median household income in 2010 was $49,445, as Perry's website says. Reading further into the report, however, we found a couple of wrinkles. For starters: Perry's statement describes the median household income statistic as the annual income of "the average American family." We think this could be slightly misleading because the popular understanding of "average" is different from "median." According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, the "average" is the numerical result you get from adding up a group of numbers and then dividing by the number of figures in the group — a concept known in statistical circles as "the mean." The median, meanwhile, is the figure that is exactly in the middle when a group of figures is ranked from smallest to largest. According to the Census Bureau's report, the "mean" income for U.S. households in 2010 was quite a bit larger than the median ($67,530 vs. $49,445). Should Perry have used the "mean" rather than the "median" income statistic when talking about the typical American family's income? No, according to experts we asked. Although the Census Bureau included both estimates in the charts at the end of its income report, it focused exclusively on the median figure in the body of the report. That's because median income provides "a truer picture" of what's typical in the United States, unlike the mean, which can be distorted by a small number of very high earners, Bernstein told us. For example, Roll Call in its Nov. 1 article about the wealthiest members of Congress notes that "as with the general U.S. population, a few exceedingly wealthy people skew the averages for the rest of the membership." In fact, Roll Call said, McCaul’s minimum net worth is so large that it "has the effect of raising the average of every member of Congress by about $500,000." The paper then says that the better number to use for comparisons is the median. Pat Wong, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs, agreed, telling us that people who study income usually use the median value to try to convey what a "typical" family earns because it "is not affected by extreme values." So, although Perry's use of the word "average" in his statement could be misleading, his decision to use the "median" — and not the "mean" — household income value from the bureau's report seems to be a good one. Except that Perry didn't say "household." He said "family." And we learned from the Census Bureau report that those two are not synonymous. According to the bureau's definitions, a "household" is all the people who occupy a "housing unit" — which can be a house, an apartment or even a single room — regardless of their relationship. That means a "household" can be a group of related people — a family — but it can also be a group of unrelated people or a single person. The Census Bureau report separates households into two groups: family and nonfamily. "Family households" are those that consist of two or more people related by birth, marriage or adoption. The category includes nuclear families, as well as those led by single parents. It does not include any one-person households. As one might expect, the median income of "family households" is larger than that of the broader category ($61,544 vs. $49,445). Had Perry used the family figure in his calculation, his statement in the letter to Pelosi would have had to change a bit: Half of the current congressional salary is still $25,456 (not $38,000) more than what a typical American family makes in a year. Perry errs around the fringes, but his big-picture point holds. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-15364	"Greece is not a big economy. It's about the size of metropolitan Miami."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/06/paul-krugman/yep-greece-and-miami-metro-have-about-same-gdp/	Greek voters stuck a wrench into European finances with their rejection of an austerity-bailout package on July 5, 2015. With the referendum results all in, the possibility that Greece might ditch the Euro, the European Union’s common currency, became more likely than ever. Before the vote though, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman warned that the greatest worry might have less to do with Greece than with other shaky economies in the Euro zone. On ABC’s This Week, Krugman downplayed the impact of the Greek economy per se. "Greece is not a big economy," Krugman told host George Stephanopoulos, "It's about the size of metropolitan Miami. So if you asked how much direct spillover there is from whatever happens in Greece, not that much." But if Greece bailed on the Euro, Krugman said, Spain and Portugal might follow, which would gut the idea of a unified pan-European economy to compete with the powerhouses of America and China. Our focus is decidedly more humble than the future of Europe. We wanted to check Krugman’s comparison of Greece to the greater Miami area. Krugman has not rested on his Nobel Prize laurels. He is correct. The latest estimate of the Gross Domestic Product of the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area, according to Washington’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, was $281 billion in 2013. The same year, the CIA estimated the size of the Greek economy at $282.6 billion in 2013. Another estimate, from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, put Greece’s GDP at about $283 billion. Either number supports Krugman’s point. The only caveats are technical. The CIA and OECD estimates are based on "purchasing power parity," a set of formulas that adjust for how much it costs to buy exactly the same basket of goods in two countries using different currencies. The OECD says that filtering out price differences gives a more accurate comparison of the economies of the two countries. If you measure the Greek economy strictly by the market exchange rate, the numbers shift. According to the World Bank the country’s GDP was $242.2 billion in 2013. Compared to the total Euro zone economy, Greece represented about 2.2 percent of the zone’s $12 trillion-plus GDP in 2013. By the way, if the size of the Greek economy is about the same as that of the greater Miami metro region, that’s the extent of the similarity. The average person in Miami was much better off financially with a per capita GDP of $48,225. In Greece, it was $25,666. Our ruling Krugman said that the economy of Greece is about a big as that of the Miami metropolitan area. Based on a common measure of Gross Domestic Product, that is accurate. The GDP of Greece was about $282 billion in 2013, and the Miami metro area had a GDP of $281 billion. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14471	Says Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is a "billionaire."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/02/marina-dimitrijevic/marina-dimitrijevic-claims-milwaukee-county-execut/	There’s little question that Chris Abele is the wealthiest man to serve as Milwaukee County Executive. Consider some of his predecessors in the office: Bill O’Donnell took the bus to work. Tom Ament lived for a time in a small apartment on Milwaukee’s west side. Scott Walker gave back part of his salary for years and lived a middle class life in Wauwatosa. Abele, who won the job in 2010, came to Milwaukee from Boston in the 1990s and caused a stir with well-publicized philanthropic efforts, such as gifts to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Milwaukee ($5 million) and the Marcus Center, as detailed in a February 2005 Milwaukee Magazine profile. That, combined with his business endeavors and real estate holdings -- side-by-side condos in a downtown high rise, a house on Lake Drive -- leave no question that Abele is a wealthy guy. But how wealthy is he? On the night of the Feb. 16, 2016 primary, in which Abele ran a narrow second to Democratic state Sen. Chris Larson in the nonpartisan race, one of Abele’s political foes offered her take. "Despite being outspent more than ten to one by a billionaire County Executive, Chris Larson pulled into a lead," said Marina Dimitrijevic, director of the Wisconsin Working Families Party, in a statement. Dimitrijevic is also a Milwaukee County supervisor, and the former Chairwoman of the County Board. Abele has been referred to as a millionaire plenty of times. But is Abele a billionaire? The Working Families Party has used that phrase repeatedly during the campaign, an effort that aims to cast Abele as out of touch with the needs of average families. Larson has pushed a similar theme. When we asked Dimitrijevic for evidence for her claim that Abele is worth more than a thousand millions, she responded with an email that cited, among other things, a 2006 article in Boston Magazine. "Chris Abele belongs to a billionaire family," Dimitrijevic wrote. "In fact, his father was among one of the wealthiest people in Boston and now Vermont." Abele’s father, John, was a co-founder of Boston Scientific, a medical equipment company. He became very wealthy when that company went public in 1992, and enjoyed another windfall when the company’s drug-coated stent product was a huge success in 2004. A 2014 Forbes story cited by Dimitrijevic estimated his fortune at $1.5 billion in March 2008, based on his Boston Scientific stock. The earlier Boston Magazine story put his wealth at $3.3 billion. Fair enough. But that’s his father and he’s not running for county executive. What about Chris Abele? Dimitrijevic noted that Abele’s economic interest statement "show pages and pages of stock and company ownership." His list includes CSA Partners, an investment firm, she noted. (We’ll get to that in a minute.) "Whether it's millions or billions, the fact is that Chris Abele belongs to an elite family that has access to enormous amounts of wealth," Dimitrijevic said. Hmmm. Sounds like this claim just got marked down to pennies on the dollar. Abele’s wealth So what do we know about Abele’s wealth? We asked his spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, whether her boss was a billionaire. She didn’t provide a response. But, frankly, it’s pretty easy to see that Abele is not a billionaire: Argosy Foundation: Abele is the head of the Argosy Foundation, located on Wells Street in a building overlooking Cathedral Square. He told a Milwaukee audience in 2004 that the foundation, formed by his father was worth about $1 billion, and could grow beyond that, the Milwaukee Magazine profile said. But the group’s most recent IRS filing, from 2014, says Argosy has unrestricted assets of $9.8 million -- not billion. In any case, it’s a foundation and not Abele’s personal wealth. His homes: Abele owns two condos on the 29th floor of the Moderne tower in downtown Milwaukee. He purchased one in March, 2015 for $2.1 million and the adjoining unit for $700,000 in the fall of 2015. He also owns a Lake Drive mansion assessed at $2.34 million. That suggests a lot of money, but by itself is not evidence of billions. Venture Capital Fund: In 2013 Abele committed at least $10 million of his own money to CSA Partners LLC, a venture capital fund that invests in young companies. At the time, he told the Journal Sentinel the fund could grow "plenty north" of $15 million if it finds the right opportunities. Again, millions, not billions. Importantly, there’s the list that Abele is not on: The annual list of billionaires published by Forbes magazine. Ten Wisconsin residents were on Forbes’ 2015 list, including home improvement store magnate John Menard; Herbert Kohler, the former CEO of the plumbing fixture and hospitality company; and four members of Racine’s Johnson family. But no Chris Abele. Indeed, Abele’s father was not on the billionaire list either. On a separate 2015 list, of the richest person in each state, Forbes put John Abele’s fortune at $600 million. We put the question to Abele in a brief interview. He said it was well-known around the city that he was well-off, in part because of his philanthropy. He said an estimate of his net worth has never been published. He noted that the Forbes lists are educated guesses. "They have to estimate a lot," he said, adding that "there is a lot that they just don’t know." Abele then answered the question directly: "I am not a billionaire." Our rating Dimitrijevic claimed Abele was a billionaire. There’s plenty of evidence that Abele is a wealthy man, with a even-wealthier father. Meanwhile, the family’s Argosy Foundation doesn’t appear to have anywhere near $1 billion in assets, and, regardless, that isn’t Abele’s personal holdings. We rate the claim False.

State ‘Assault Weapon’ ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/28/marco-rubio/rubios-tweet-about-ny-gun-laws-accurate/	Sen. Marco Rubio took aim at one provision of a gun law passed in New York state that he suggests can be easily circumvented. The Florida Republican posted a photo of two semi-automatic rifles. Both rifles almost look the same. But one has a pistol grip attached, so it is not legal in New York state, Rubio said. "Under N.Y. State ‘Assault Weapon’ ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned," Rubio’s tweet read. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet came as Rubio’s response to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the day that Rubio "should be ashamed of" himself for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. During a CNN town hall the night before, Rubio signaled support for raising the age to buy a rifle or shotgun to 21 and for tighter background checks for gun purchases. Cuomo supports tougher gun-control measures, like universal background checks and a ban on military-style accessories. New York state already has a ban on some of those accessories. We wanted to know if the one on Rubio’s tweet is on that list. New York state gun laws The accessory shown in the image, called a pistol grip, has been banned on rifles in New York state since 2013. It’s one of several features banned by the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, better known as the SAFE Act. The law, spearheaded by Cuomo, was passed a few weeks after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The law banned so-called assault weapons and created a legal definition for them in New York state. The law defined them broadly as semi-automatic firearms with one or more of the features also banned by the law. There are 10 of those features for rifles. The weapon used by Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, is banned under state law, for example. Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a flash suppressor — two of the features banned under the SAFE Act. But the rifle without a pistol grip pictured in Rubio’s tweet would also be subject to other gun regulations in New York state. First, anyone who wanted to buy the rifle in New York state would have to go through a background check, regardless of who they buy it from. State law would also prohibit any gun owner from attaching a magazine to the rifle that holds more than 10 rounds. Only seven other states have laws that ban large capacity magazines. Florida, where a shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this month, is not one of them. Our ruling Rubio said with a photo on Twitter that "1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned" in New York state. That’s true. The pistol grip shown is one of the banned features for rifles under New York state's SAFE Act. The rifle would also be subject to other New York state regulations. We rate Rubio’s claim True.

pomt-08742	"1 in 4 Rhode Islanders under the age of 65 does not have health insurance."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/31/frank-caprio/caprio-says-1-4-rhode-islanders-dont-have-health-i/	If you live in Rhode Island and you pay any attention to politics, by now you’ve probably heard gubernatorial candidate Frank Caprio talk about his "small business plan for Rhode Island." It's on his website, in his speeches, and explained in glossy fliers he passes out to voters. At political events, he encourages audiences to check out his ideas on his website. You don't have to ask us twice. PolitiFact has previously questioned a main component of Caprio's jobs strategy: that if every small business created one new job, unemployment would be cut in half. We found that statement Half True. Now we've spotted another claim worth checking within his small business strategy. In telling voters how he'll make health insurance more affordable for small business owners, he says repeatedly, in campaign material and in person, that "1 in 4 Rhode Islanders under the age of 65 does not have health insurance." (Those 65 and older are not included in the tallies because they have health insurance through the federal Medicare program.) The Caprio campaign said it got its numbers from two sources. The first was a report issued this spring by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. from its Washington, D.C. office. Conducted at the request of Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller and Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts, the study was financed by the Rhode Island Foundation. Caprio's team noted that the analysis found that 187,000 Rhode Islanders, 21 percent -- or about 1 in 5 -- are projected to be uninsured at some point during the year. That might mean, for example, that someone loses his or her job and goes uninsured for a few months. The campaign said it also relied on numbers from a 2009 U.S. Senate Democratic Policy Committee report on Rhode Island. That study, issued in the heat of the health-care debate last summer, found that 27.8 percent of Rhode Islanders "went without health insurance for some period of time," in 2007 and 2008. To reach that tally, it used data from Families USA, a liberal health-care advocacy organization that looks at state-by-state information. Caprio spokesman Nick Hemond said the campaign took both figures –– 21 percent and 27.8 percent –– and averaged them to get the 1 in 4 statistic. We did our own digging. For starters, we elected to steer clear of the second report Caprio talks about, the one by the Senate Democratic committee. We prefer to avoid research conducted by overtly political organizations, so as not to get caught up in partisan squabbling. We then consulted Koller, who was appointed by Governor Carcieri, a Republican, and confirmed by the Democrat-controlled legislature. He said that the most up-to-date report on the matter was the first report Caprio cites, the one issued this spring, by Mathematica. While it's true that study finds that 187,000 Rhode Islanders are likely to be uninsured at some point during the year, it also found that 140,000 people were uninsured in March, the month the report was issued. We think that's the more accurate number because it offers a better snapshot of how many Rhode Islanders have no insurance on an average day. And because Caprio never specified that he was referring to people who were uninsured at some point in the year, we believe voters too will interpret his statement as an average. The most recent Census estimate for Rhode Island's population is 1.05 million. Using those figures, Mathematica projects the number of people younger than 65 to be 889,000 in 2010. That would mean the 140,000 uninsured make up 16 percent of that population. That's 1 in 6.25 Rhode Islanders, not 1 in 4, as Caprio suggests. But we were curious if there was more complete data to be had, so we asked Koller. The Mathematica report "is the best [data] we’ve got," he told us. It was calculated using Census figures on the uninsured. When examined on their own, such Census numbers can be somewhat inconsistent because of Rhode Island's small sample size. But researchers combined those numbers with the state’s unemployment figures to generate a more precise estimate. Koller said that method is common in other states. He stands by the report's results, reiterating that they are the most accurate he's seen in Rhode Island in quite some time. That's not a perfect answer, but it's the best we could find. Now back to Frank Caprio's statement that 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders don't have health insurance. That's a sizable difference from the Mathematica 1 in 6 finding. If you think we’re being too fussy, consider that the Mathematica study estimates that 140,000 Rhode Islanders have no health insurance. Use Caprio’s estimate and that number jumps to more than 220,000 people. That’s a difference of more than 80,000, about the size of the population of Cranston. Small percentage differences matter. Because Koller and other officials can’t say with absolute certainty just how many Rhode Islanders are uninsured, we’ll give Caprio a bit of leeway and call his statement Half True.

pomt-02866	"Given how expansive our program already was," expanding Medicaid in New Jersey due to Obamacare "was a relatively small expansion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/14/chris-christie/new-jersey-medicaid-expansion-was-small-given-alre/	In a victory lap following his landslide re-election Nov. 5, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, hit four of the five major Sunday morning talk shows. On ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos talked about 2016 Republican primary prospects with Christie. Stephanopoulos flagged Medicaid as a potential source of criticism from Christie’s own party. "You didn't set up an exchange, but you did accept the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare," Stephanopoulos said. "And some of your potential rivals like Ted Cruz are going to come after you on that. What's your answer?" Christie’s response was in line with his standard "Jersey-first" approach to discussions of national politics. "I do what's best for the people in the state of New Jersey every day," he said. "And expanding Medicaid in the state of New Jersey, given how expansive our program already was, it was a relatively small expansion. But it's going to mean a lot. And it's also going to benefit New Jersey's budget." We wondered if Christie was right in saying that New Jersey only needed a minor Medicaid expansion to comply with Obamacare. (Christie’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story, but we did hear from the New Jersey Department of Human Services.) What the law says First, some background on the law. The Affordable Care Act expands the pool of individuals who could be eligible to receive Medicaid, a health insurance program for low-income U.S. residents. Previously, most of the people who were eligible were pregnant women, parents and children in low-income households. The law expands coverage to people 65 and under who have income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This year, the poverty level is $11,490 for an individual. Each state can individually decide whether or not to participate in this expansion, which the federal government will fully fund for the first three years. How does New Jersey stack up? To evaluate Christie’s claim, we sized up New Jersey’s Medicaid program against those of other states. Leighton Ku, a Medicaid expert and professor at George Washington University, said it’s not enough to look at a list of how much money each state appropriates for Medicaid funding, because most of the money states appropriate go toward plans for the elderly and disabled -- groups for which Obamacare isn’t expanding Medicaid. New Jersey now covers parents with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level and childless adults at up to 23 percent of the poverty level, according to table 3 of the Kaiser Family Foundation report. Under Obamacare in 2014, that would expand to cover childless adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. New Jersey’s current Medicaid coverage puts it among the most generous states for Medicaid. For coverage of parents, Minnesota comes in first nationally at 215 percent of poverty, with New Jersey and two other states just behind. For childless adults, only 17 states offer any eligibility at all, so New Jersey’s 23 percent isn’t as restrictive, relatively speaking, as it might seem. A 2011 Rutgers University study estimates that 100,000 more New Jersey residents will be eligible for Medicaid in 2014, which currently covers about 1.3 million people. That’s about a 7.7 percent increase in people eligible. How does that compare to other states? We don’t yet have access to uniform, comprehensive, state-by-state data for the number of people who could benefit from Medicaid eligibility expansions, said Chris Lee, a Kaiser Family Foundation spokesman. In all, 24 states (plus the District of Columbia) chose to expand Medicaid. However, we could only locate data for nine other states. For these nine states, we divided the potential increase by the number of people already enrolled in Medicaid. This is an imperfect calculation, because the most recent numbers Kaiser provides are from fiscal year 2010. But it gives a rough sense of the scale. Of the nine states, only Minnesota had a lower projected eligibility increase than New Jersey (3.7 percent). The other eight had a higher percentage. And, of course, many states aren’t expanding eligibility at all. Our ruling Christie touted New Jersey’s "expansive" Medicaid program. Because New Jersey was already generous in its Medicaid eligibility guidelines compared to other states, the potential increase in Medicaid enrollments due to Obamacare is relatively small. Only one out of the other nine states for which we found data had a lower percentage increase in the Medicaid-eligible population due to Obamacare. So Christie’s comment appears accurate, though the uncertainty due to the missing data leads us to rate it Mostly True. Correction, Nov. 18, 2013: This report was corrected to note that New Jersey's current Medicaid coverage is 23 percent, and that would expand under Obamacare in 2014 to up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The rating is unchanged. Also, this item was updated shortly after publication to make clear that the New Jersey Department of Human Services did respond to our inquiry.

pomt-13736	"The top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-outdated-income-inequality-statisti/	After a night of intermittent booing and heckling from disappointed progressives attending the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders received a hero’s welcome and took the chance to remind his supporters of their political revolution’s real purpose. "This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience, the worst it has been since 1928," Sander said. "It is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change." Sanders’ wealth claim, a favorite line from his stump speech, is largely accurate. His claim about the uber wealthy hogging almost all of the new income, however, is out of date and exaggerated. A month before he launched his presidential campaign, Sanders made a version of the claim in an April 2015 interview with Fox News: "99 percent of all new income today (is) going to the top 1 percent." Back then, we rated the claim Mostly True, as Sanders’ figure was credible but not the only way to consider income inequality. (Some economists prefer to also factor in unemployment compensation, welfare and health benefits, Social Security, retirement income and health benefits.) According to University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of pre-tax, pre-transfer income from 2009 to 2012. For this fact-check, the Sanders campaign referred us to a study by the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute that concludes the top 1 percent got 85.1 percent of new income from 2009 to 2013. The trouble for Sanders: A lot has happened since 2013. And as the economy has improved, the income disparity has lessened. When Sanders made the same point at a Democratic debate in February 2016, we found more recent data from Saez. By 2014, the top 1 percent’s share of post-recession income dropped to a less egregious (albeit still disportionate) 58 percent — a figure that Sanders seems aware of. And last month, Saez updated his numbers again to include 2015 data, and the uber wealthy’s share decreased slightly again to 52 percent. "In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession," Saez writes, adding that the recovery now looks "much less lopsided" even as income inequality remains extremely high. Here’s a breakdown: Our ruling Sanders said, "The top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income." That figure covers 2009 to 2013, but there’s data for even more recent years. Factoring in 2014 and 2015, the top 1 percent’s share in post-recession income falls to 52 percent. That’s still a big number, but not nearly what Sanders told convention delegates and a large television audience. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-06933	Says this House processed and approved as many bills as previous Legislatures.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/jul/20/bruce-hanna/did-tied-oregon-house-consider-and-approve-many-me/	The 76th Oregon Legislature adjourned on June 30, 2011, the first legislative session in which the Oregon House had been split 30-30 between Democrats and Republicans. Co-speakers Arnie Roblan, D-Coos Bay, and Bruce Hanna, R-Roseburg, appeared the next morning on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s "Think Out Loud" to talk about their accomplishments. Host Dave Miller asked Hanna to address a concern raised by labor coalition Our Oregon: that the divided House let die a number of Senate approved bills because both committee co-chairs had to agree to move legislation forward. What, asked Miller, could be done to get more bills, especially noncontroversial bills, to the House floor for an up-or-down vote? Hanna objected to the claim that the tie in the House meant more bills were blocked. Plenty of measures, he said, left the House never to be taken up by the Senate, controlled 16-14 by Democrats. But Hanna also said this: "When you talk about the total number of bills that came through the House, we processed and dealt with and passed as many bills as any Legislature ever has." True? Did the 2011 Legislature keep pace with its predecessors? For this, PolitiFact Oregon turned to Legislative Counsel, the nonpartisan office of lawyers responsible for turning legislators’ ideas into bills that may become law. The office has tracked the number of bills introduced by legislators and enrolled, which means approved by both the Senate and the House, since 1997. Here is the summary: 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 Total introduced 3106 2769 2957 2744 2613 3021 Total enrolled 1005 824 853 910 919 807 Percent 32 % 30 % 29 % 33 % 35 % 27 % You can see that the percentage of approved measures dropped this year to 27 percent, from 35 percent in 2009, when Democrats controlled both chambers. In fact, it’s the lowest clearance rate in the last decade, although not entirely out of line. The approval rate was 29 percent in 2005, when Democrats led the Senate and Republicans the House. More significantly, the number of bills approved -- 807 -- is the lowest in a decade. Maybe a lot of the legislation that cleared previously was nonsense. Maybe all 807 bills that passed this session were good and meaty. Still, Hanna is not correct. The House and the Legislature passed fewer bills this session than in previous sessions. There’s no quibbling with those figures. Angela Wilhelms, Hanna’s chief of staff, said her boss was trying to make the point that "co-governance did not lead to inaction or gridlock as many predicted it would." She’s right about that, as she also is correct to say that the Senate and tied House moved fairly heavy-hitting bills on redistricting, education reform, a remake of the Oregon Health Plan and a state budget. Nevertheless, we have to rule the Republican co-Speaker’s statement as Barely True. There’s an element of truth -- the number of bills isn’t that much different from 2005, and there was hefty legislation on important topics. But he states that the number of bills approved this year was on par with previous Legislatures, and that "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04803	Says House Republicans spent $50 million on 33 votes to repeal Obamacare.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/21/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-republicans-spent-50-million-oba/	Members of Congress can send messages in a lot of different ways. One that is almost certain not to be ignored is taking a vote. That, in effect, is what happened in the House of Representatives in July, when its members voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The 244-185 vote, which had five Democrats siding with the entire Republican caucus, was the 33rd time the House voted to repeal all or part of President Obama's health care law. The Republican-led House knew the repeal would not pass the Democratic-led Senate, and would be vetoed by Obama if it reached his desk. But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said the vote was taken "so we may all be on record in order to show that the house rejects 'Obamacare,' and we are committed to taking this flawed law off the books." Republicans also wanted to tie Democrats to what they see as an unpopular law. The vote was, in other words, a message to voters -- "symbolic but powerful," according to the coverage by Politico. To Democrats like Rep. Betty Sutton, who is facing GOP Rep. Jim Renacci in Ohio’s newly redrawn 16th congressional district, the vote represented something else: "Thirty-three votes. $50 million wasted," said an email from her campaign. "According to CBS News, that’s the record GOP Rep. Jim Renacci has helped the Republican Majority in Congress achieve when it comes to their never-ending crusade to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." Thirty-three votes cost $50 million? That caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. The source of the figure, linked in the Sutton email, was a story that ran July 11 on "CBS Evening News." The story said a CBS tally showed that the effort to repeal the health care law has consumed at least 80 hours, or two workweeks, on the House floor since early 2011. "We wondered how much it costs taxpayers for the House to repeal the law again and again," anchor Scott Pelley said. "You can't be exact about these things, but the Congressional Research Service tells us that the House of Representatives costs us $24 million a week. So with two weeks spent repealing the law, that comes to a little under $50 million." PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more. We were especially intrigued because the Congressional Research Service doesn't directly tell anything to the public or to the media, including us. CRS is a nonpartisan think tank that works exclusively for Congress. Its reports, which are authoritative models of research and analysis, are made available only through members of Congress who release them to public domain. We were unable to find a report putting a price tag on congressional activity. Sutton's office provided a CRS report on legislative expenditures as the basis for the $50 million. The report, though, doesn’t measure the cost of a vote. It showed overall appropriations for the House in the current fiscal year totaling $1.226 billion. And while CBS’ report gave a weekly total for operating the House -- Divide the $1.226 billion by 52 and you get to roughly $24 million a week, or a bit under $50 million for two weeks, that calculation isn’t in the CRS report. But another report on the same subject ran the same day as the CBS story, on "Marketplace," the American Public Media radio program. "It’s really hard to break down the cost of a vote in Congress," it said. "In fact, none of the congressional watchdog groups in Washington have done it. So we had to do our own, back-of-the envelope calculation. "We figured out how much we spend per day on salaries and office costs for members of the House of Representatives and their staffs. The grand total? Almost $2 million every day." That totals $20 million for two workweeks -- less than half the total in the other story. American Public Media also cited the Congressional Research Service. In this case, the specific source was a CRS report on congressional salaries and allowances. Both of the stories wisely put qualifiers on their cost estimates. In trying to put a figure on the cost of congressional activity -- specifically, on voting -- both of them took on a task with insurmountable problems. Calculating the per-week cost of running the House from overall House appropriations, for example, takes in fixed costs and the cost of congressional business that is unrelated to activity on the House floor -- while not accounting for related costs that are included in appropriations for the legislative branch but not designated specifically for the House. Calculating the cost based on salaries does not account for the fact that many staff duties are unrelated to floor activity or legislation under debate, and that they continue regardless of whether the House is even in session. The point is not to criticize the two stories, which tried, with some transparency, to come up with a cost estimate not otherwise available. The point is that two reputable news services came up with figures for House expenditures (the "Marketplace" story even shows its calculations online) that still vary more than 100 percent in their conclusions because of the expenditures they factored in. The difference underlines the impracticality, or the impossibility, of trying to isolate the cost of a congressional vote. CRS -- which has not attempted to make that calculation itself -- made that specific point when it issued a memorandum to congressional offices last December addressing "potential challenges for estimating the cost of congressional activities." A congressional office made the memo available to PolitiFact Ohio while we were doing our review. CRS said the memo followed requests "to estimate the cost of various congressional activities, including: House and Senate chamber operations; a day or hour of congressional debate; the consideration of a piece of legislation; a committee hearing or investigation; a special session; and in-session as compared to out-of-session costs." The three-page memo provided no cost estimates but gave an overview of the obstacles to such estimates. "Calculating costs for various congressional activities is methodologically impossible for many reasons," the memo said in its conclusion. "The choice of appropriations levels or actual expenditures as the source of the data, the offices or activities selected for inclusion, and the treatment or interpretation of fixed and variable costs, could result in multiple, different cost estimates for any congressional activity." So where does that leave Sutton’s statement? First, Sutton’s campaign describes the money as wasted, which is an opinion that PolitiFact Ohio cannot rate. Beyond that, the claim is not accurate. Her campaign applies the $50 million figure from the CBS report to something that CRS specifically warned was "methodologically impossible." And as a member of Congress, she would have access to the CRS report from December which made that warning. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Sutton campaign’s claim rates False.

pomt-13179	Department of Veterans Affairs doctors "are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana."	true	/arizona/statements/2016/oct/26/campaign-regulate-marijuana-alcohol/are-va-doctors-barred-recommending-medical-marijua/	The effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona has seen millions of dollars in contributions opposing the initiative -- and political advertisements on both sides of the issue. A recent ad from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-pot group, tells the story of a post-9/11 veteran, Bruce Laird, who was prescribed multiple drugs before he turned to medical marijuana to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder. "VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana," the Oct. 14 ad’s on-screen text reads, before urging a "yes" vote on recreational marijuana to help veterans. As we’ve noted previously, voters approved medical marijuana in November 2010. The first dispensary opened in December 2012. We wondered if the ad’s claim about U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors checked out, especially given the continued delays for health care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. Cannabis concessions The prohibition is outlined in the VA’s 2011 directive on medical marijuana. "It is VHA policy to prohibit VA providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran’s participation in a state marijuana program." According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which means it cannot be used for medical purposes and has high potential for abuse. The DEA has a five-schedule drug scale -- the higher the number, the less dangerous. However, 25 states have already legalized medical marijuana. Dr. Andrew Saxon of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle said federal health care systems have to obey federal laws. Marijuana is still illegal federally. However, a veteran could still receive VA health care -- as the 2011 directive notes -- and seek medical marijuana elsewhere. "A military veteran who is eligible for VA health care cannot be refused those services if he/she is using medical marijuana authorized by a non-VA health care provider," Saxon said. Legislation on amending the VA’s policy has come up short. Earlier this year, an amendment to the VA’s budget bill would have allowed VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it’s legal. However, the amendment was removed from the spending bill, which eventually passed. Our ruling The ad claimed, "VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana." That’s on the mark. Veterans can still seek medical marijuana on their own -- where it’s legal -- and VA health care. We rate the ad’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/265a5a2c-d11f-4e67-b132-57d62130cff1	None	Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol	None	None	None	2016-10-26T12:00:00	2016-10-14	['None']
pomt-02544	"Savings that I achieved" helped fund cameras on the border. "As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/06/todd-staples/grants-staples-agency-were-small-part-existing-bor/	Lieutenant governor candidate Todd Staples says he not only has a plan that addresses border security, he’s already tackled the challenge. Staples, Texas’ agriculture commissioner, wrote in a Jan. 13, 2014, campaign email blast, "Using cost savings that I achieved from cutting government waste, I helped fund Operation Drawbridge, a low-cost, high-tech, DPS-led operation that placed game cameras along the border to detect illegal trafficking. "As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated." The Texas Department of Agriculture indeed approved aid for Operation Drawbridge, we learned, but the multimillion-dollar Department of Public Safety project had already been in place for most of a year. Also, Staples’ cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge’s overall results. In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he’s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency’s savings "helped" achieve the results. "I don’t want to get popped for something I’ve never taken credit for," he said. Operation Drawbridge The state’s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program. The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor’s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million. A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, "(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results." A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation. Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge. Staples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help. Savings to buy cameras Black said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agency’s "lapsed appropriations," money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million. DPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agency’s Oct. 11, 2012, press release on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, release on the $120,000 grant. The 2012 release said, "Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program." Drawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, grant agreement between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was "for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry." An Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story said, "The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras." Arrests and confiscations From January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS website, Drawbridge "resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics." The October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had "resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012." So it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013. Some supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation: Our ruling Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. This statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples’ watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations. It’s documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we don’t see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operation’s funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governor’s office. We rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-08787	Says Rick Perry's proposal on driver licenses and high school dropouts has been state law since 1989.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/20/bill-white/bill-white-says-rick-perrys-proposal-denying-dropo/	Stumping in East Texas, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said GOP Gov. Rick Perry's proposal regarding high school dropouts and drivers' licenses has a glaring weakness. "You know the problem with that plan?" White told a group, according to an Aug. 9 news report by Houston's KRIV-TV. "That's been state law since 1989. And he's been responsible for enforcing it. We're tired of the spin." Was Perry's plan really old hat? More than White knew, as it turns out. First, let's review. Back in January, Perry issued a press release saying: "I believe that in order for high school-aged individuals to get and keep a driver's license they should be enrolled in school, be it bricks and mortar or our virtual high school, and, most importantly, working toward their diploma or GED." Perry said he was calling on the Department of Public Safety and the Texas Education Agency to "work with local school districts to further leverage the privilege of a driver’s license as an incentive to keep students engaged in the education process." Problem: White's campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, pointed out state law already stipulates that minors seeking a driver's license submit proof that they're in school, specifically a Verification of Enrollment form. Bacon cited information posted online by the TEA, including this: "A Texas law was passed in 1989 requiring that persons under 18 years of age must be enrolled and attending school as a condition of licensing that person to operate a motor vehicle. There was an exception: if the person had a high school diploma or a GED, the driver license could be issued." The Texas Transportation Code specifies the requirements for provisional driver's licenses, the kind usually issued to people under 18: The applicant must be at least 16 years old, have passed a state-approved driver-education course, have a high school diploma or its equivalent or be a student who attended school (including home school) for at least 80 days in the fall or spring semester preceding the application date. Former State Rep. Bill Hammond, R-Dallas, authored the school-attendance requirement that passed in 1989. Hammond, now president of the Texas Association of Business, told us that he reacted as White did when he heard of Perry's 2010 proposal. "My thought was that it's (already) in the law," Hammond said. Game over? Not so fast, Perry's campaign told us: The governor is focusing on students who got their licenses and then dropped out. In other words, his proposal applies to teen drivers keeping their licenses, not getting them -- though Perry himself has not always been clear on that point. For instance, in a speech prepared for delivery Aug. 12 in West Texas, Perry said, "I have proposed a simple accountability measure requiring school enrollment or progress to a GED if they want to keep a Texas driver's license." Yet on July 15, KVUE-TV reported that Perry told a Houston news conference: "If you are of high school age and you are not in a bricks and mortar or virtual high school, you are not going to get a driver's license. It's that simple." Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the governor's concept is simple: He wants the education agency and DPS to figure out what legislation would be necessary to revoke the licenses of high school dropouts. "High school students should not be able to have the privilege of driving if they are not enrolled in school," Frazier said. Advantage Perry? Nope, said White's campaign, which argued that existing law also has this covered, since it requires teen drivers to renew their provisional licenses every year until they turn 18. (Typically that means only one renewal, at age 17.) "Dropouts who already have licenses cannot renew them; so they will effectively be relinquished," Bacon said. Then we discovered that in 2009, the Legislature passed -- and Perry signed -- a measure that repealed that provision. House Bill 339 also imposed some new requirements on teen drivers. But once a typical 16-year-old gets a license, he or she can now keep it until turning 18, when proof of school attendance is no longer required. Why did lawmakers take that step? Sara Haenes, chief of staff for the bill's author, Rep. Larry Phillips, R-Sherman, said the intent was to set up a more efficient way for DPS to find out when kids drop out of school so it could revoke their licenses without delay. The bill called for the DPS and TEA to "enter into a memorandum of understanding" under which the law enforcement agency can access state electronic records to verify a student’s enrollment in public school. That sounds a lot like what Perry is proposing. According to a July 19 online report by El Paso's KVIA-TV, Perry would have the education agency alert the DPS when a student drops out of high school, and the DPS would revoke the teen's license. Frazier confirmed that the TV station had accurately presented the proposal. When we asked her how Perry's plan differs from the bill he signed into law in 2009, Frazier said it would keep closer track of a teen driver's school status, while the new law specifies that DPS "may only access information necessary to verify the identity and enrollment status of a license renewal applicant." Since teens no longer have to renew their licenses, we're not sure how that would work. Besides, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us that while the agency is still talking with TEA, "there is currently no process available that provides the timely data necessary to accomplish enrollment verification electronically." The upshot: Instead of cracking down on teen drivers who drop out of school, state law has lightened up, since teens no longer have to submit proof of enrollment to keep their licenses. That was news to White's campaign, which fired another salvo after learning of the change last week. "The old law kept dropouts from keeping their licenses," Bacon said. "Then he (Perry) took that away. Now he wants it back." It was also news to Hammond, who told us he would have opposed the change had he known about it. It's not mentioned on the DPS website page for under-25 drivers, which still says provisional licenses expire every year, unless renewed. As for White's claim, the candidate is right that a 1989 law required teens under 18 to show they're in school or have graduated before they can get their driver's licenses -- and on that point, Perry offered nothing new. But White overlooked the fact that Perry did propose a change, aimed at toughening the law that was in place for the past 20 years to cause dropouts to lose their licenses at renewal time. However, it wasn't entirely new. Last year Perry signed a bill into law that had a similar goal but removed the renewal requirement entirely. We rate White's statement Half True.

pomt-02258	The health care law reduces "the number of uninsured in America by 3 percent for how much money? $2 trillion."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/10/john-e-sununu/john-sununu-says-just-14-million-americans-insured/	For all the cheers of "we did it!" last week about 7.1 million Obamacare sign-ups, former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu says Democrats are glossing over one big, grim fact. They’re barely making a dent in delivering health insurance to the uninsured. Sununu, a New Hampshire Republican who writes columns for the Boston Globe, made his case for this theory during the April 6 political roundtable on NBC’s Meet the Press. (Don’t worry about following his math for right now, we’ll explain it.) "It’s not about enrollment figures. It’s about reducing the number of uninsured in this country," Sununu said. "We have 50 million uninsured. If you only look at the enrollment figure, you miss the question of how many of them were previously uninsured." "So you have to multiply it by about 80 percent, Rand says 80 percent probably will be the number that actually pay. Gets you down to 5.6 (million). And how many who were previously uninsured, McKinsey consulting did some surveys, 25 percent previously uninsured. Now you're down to 1.4 million. That’s about 3 percent," Sununu said. "Reducing the number of uninsured in America by 3 percent for how much money? $2 trillion. That’s not good cost-spending," PunditFact is focusing on Sununu’s conclusion: Obamacare reduces the uninsured population by just 3 percent at a cost of $2 trillion. The claim, we find, is a far cry from reality for three reasons: Just about every piece of the math Sununu laid out is based on shaky or debatable assumptions. This produces the even shakier result that only 1.4 million people were not previously uninsured before getting coverage under the health care law, or 3 percent of the previously uninsured population. The $2 trillion cost he mentions is a 10-year projection for government spending, which does not factor in revenue brought in from the law and is inappropriately juxtaposed with his estimate for the first year of Obamacare signups. The online marketplaces operated by federal and state governments were never meant to be the only way people obtain insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Various reports show millions pursued coverage through their employers and Medicaid over the six-month enrollment period. Let’s dive in. Mangling the math This is not Sununu’s first stab at trying to dissect the government’s reported figures in an effort to pinpoint who’s really gaining insurance for the first time. He wrote a Boston Globe column on the topic before we got the final number from the feds. The real size and insurance history of the Obamacare enrollment pool is not yet disclosed by the federal government. While important, size alone won’t make or break the exchanges as much as including a good mix of healthy, low-risk enrollees. "50 million uninsured Americans" -- Sununu claims there are 50 million people uninsured in America. Analysts at the numbers-crunching Rand Corporation say there are 40 million uninsured nonelderly adults. The Census Bureau put the population at 48 million in 2012. A Congressional Budget Office estimate put it at 55 million in 2013 and 44 million in 2014. Sununu’s figure isn’t indefensible, but it’s clearly just an estimate. And making estimations with estimates doesn’t usually produce good math. "Rand says 80 percent will be the number that actually pay" -- The Rand Corporation says the number doesn’t come from them. Sununu, whom we could not reach for comment, may have mixed up a report by McKinsey and Company, a large private consulting group, when he used a multiplier of 80 percent to get who has actually paid for a plan from the Obamacare marketplaces. In his Globe column, he mentioned a similar figure by Goldman Sachs. That’s not out of left field, though it’s on the lower end of what we’ve heard. Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius has described the premium payment rate reported by insurers to be between 80 and 90 percent of sign-ups, and Blue Cross Blue Shield Associates, one of the largest insurers in the country, has said 80 to 85 percent of people have paid the first month’s premium for plans obtained through exchanges. McKinsey found 77 percent of respondents who obtained new insurance for 2014 through February paid their premium with those who had been previously insured more likely to pay than those who were not. Some argue a 20 percent drop-off rate is too high, as some people have been unable to pay their premiums and others do not have to pay them until late April. Still, "The percent who paid for coverage issue is a valid concern," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who supports the law. "25 percent previously uninsured" -- Once Sununu whittles down who he thinks will actually pay, Sununu tries to get to the bottom of who was previously uninsured. He holds up an oft-reported figure from the McKinsey and Company report. The McKinsey study actually found a previously uninsured rate of 27 percent among people surveyed in February who said they switched to a new plan or were previously not enrolled, up from 11 percent in the company’s previous surveys. It’s important to note, as we did in another fact-check, the McKinsey report focused on the individual insurance market as a whole, not just the federal and state marketplaces. People are still free to buy insurance for themselves through private companies. Point being, the McKinsey survey doesn’t really tell us much about who’s buying covering through the health insurance marketplaces because it did not distinguish between those who bought through the exchanges from those who bought through other means. A Rand survey that debuted a couple days after Sununu’s comments put the previously uninsured rate at about 36 percent of new marketplace enrollees. The Rand survey did not account for people who signed up for insurance in the final days of March. And what about $2 trillion spending? Now to address the $2 trillion question in the room. Sununu is referring to the gross costs of the insurance provisions in the health care law. Gross costs from 2014-24 amount to a little more than $2 trillion, according to projections in a February 2014 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, two respected agencies that analyze the effects of legislation (Page 106). Focusing on the gross amount leaves out the $517 billion the government expects to take in through tax penalties from people who do not have insurance and certain employers who do not offer it, as well as tax revenues. The net cost over the period is $1.487 trillion from 2015-24, or $1.528 trillion if you include the net spending in 2014 primarily on subsidies and Medicaid. Even though Sununu is referencing a figure for spending, he misrepresents the 10-year spending by comparing it to one marketplace enrollment period for 2014. As Gail Wilensky, director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H. W. Bush, said, "This is a numerical ‘no-no.’" Oh, don’t forget these budget-crunchers also found the total effect of the Affordable Care Act is to reduce federal deficits. Wrapping up Sununu’s math Using Sununu’s numbers the same way he did, he finds 1.42 million previously uninsured people are purchasing health insurance, or 2.84 percent of the uninsured population. If we used other available estimates, we could conclude the health care law is providing coverage to 5.75 percent of the uninsured population. We’re not saying you should conclude that; we’re just showing how much things could change by selecting one estimate over another. Marketplace just a piece of the insurance puzzle Still, there is a broader issue with Sununu’s point that is even more important than the math he presents. He’s holding up the online marketplace sign-ups as the only solution in the Affordable Care Act for insuring more Americans. That’s not how the law is designed. It aims to cover more of the country’s uninsured population through a variety of insurance programs, not just the online marketplaces that allow customers to choose from an array of private plans. Other avenues including getting more low-income residents on Medicaid rolls, allowing young people to stay on their parents’ insurance, and expanding employer-sponsored health insurance, the method by which most people obtain coverage. "To look only at the exchanges is not giving you the full picture," said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corporation. Eibner co-authored an April 8 Rand report that found 9.3 million Americans gained health insurance from September 2013, which preceded the most recent open enrollment period, and mid March 2014, the last month of that period. The Rand numbers are estimates based on surveys of a 2,425-person sample and were published after Sununu’s comments on TV (so we won’t take off for what he didn’t know). That’s a net number accounting for 14.5 million people who gained insurance and 5.2 million who lost it. It is not unusual or new for people to lose insurance, Eibner points out, with reasons depending on changes to employment, marital status or policy cancellations. The Rand study offers an interesting glimpse of trends for the whole health insurance market -- not just the online marketplaces. Notably, most of the insurance gains were in employment-sponsored insurance (8.2 million) and Medicaid enrollment (5.9 million). The report found federal and state marketplace sign-ups of 3.9 million, though this does not factor in people who signed up in the final days of enrollment in late March. Rand isn’t the only group with evidence more people are getting insurance. It mirrors findings released a day earlier by the pollster Gallup. Gallup found the uninsured rate among adult Americans fell to 15.6 percent in the first quarter of 2014, hitting its lowest level since before the recession in late 2008 and a big drop from 18 percent in mid 2013. A report by the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute also suggests health insurance gains because of the law. The institute found the number of uninsured Americans fell from 17.9 percent to 15.2 percent, or by 5.4 million people, over the six-month open enrollment period, though it did not include the late March surge. Bigger gains came in states that chose to expand Medicaid. "The one thing not to lose sight of clearly indicates that people are gaining coverage," said Stephen Zuckerman, an Urban Institute health economist. "The exact magnitude, the exact type of coverage, those are measurement issues. There’s no evidence that people on net have lost coverage, and it’s very clear from a statistical standpoint, from a quantitative standpoint, that people are gaining coverage." CBO, for the record, projected the law would reduce the number of uninsured nonelderly Americans by a net of 13 million uninsured people in 2014 and 25 million by 2016. And yet, there will still be millions of uninsured Americans when the law is fully implemented, experts say. CBO estimates that by 2019, 27 million people will have signed up on the marketplaces. There will still be roughly 31 million nonelderly residents who will be uninsured by 2024 due to undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for Medicaid and subsidies, would-be Medicaid enrollees who do not sign up or live in a state that did not expand coverage, and others who just don’t want it even though it is available. Our ruling Sununu used an imperfect methodology to arrive at his conclusion that Obamacare reduces "the number of uninsured in America by 3 percent for how much money? $2 trillion." He’s playing with numbers that aren’t fully known. What’s more, this pronouncement ignores two big places people are finding health insurance: through employers and the expansion of Medicaid in many states. The real focus of the health care law wasn’t just on enrolling people in the exchanges. It aimed to foster enrollment through many avenues of the health insurance market. We rate his statement False. Correction: A Rand survey put the previously uninsured rate at about 36 percent of new marketplace enrollees. An earlier version of this story described the percentage as the "insured rate."

pomt-05194	Under Florida’s voting law, a requirement to turn in voter registrations within 48 hours "makes it impossible to meet the deadline if you’re working right to the end of the week."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jun/12/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-discusses-48-hour-rule-florida-voti/	Count MSNBC’s Chris Matthews among those who think a new voting law passed in Florida in 2011 is bad public policy. On his show Hardball, Matthews discussed the law -- in particular, a requirement that voter registration groups return signed applications within 48 hours or face fines -- with Republican Party of Florida Chairman Lenny Curry and Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of a civil rights group called the Advancement Project. Matthews and his guests were discussing federal Judge Robert Hinkle’s May 31, 2012, decision to deem the 48-hour rule unconstitutional. In his ruling, Hinkle said the Legislature’s restrictions have made it "risky business" for third-party groups to register new voters. "He said -- quote -- ‘If the goal is to discourage voter registration drives, and thus also to make it harder for new voters to register, this may work. Otherwise, there is little reason for such a requirement’," Matthews said, quoting Hinkle. From there, Matthews dressed down Curry, saying the law makes it impossible in some cases for voter registration groups to meet that deadline. Here’s a transcript: Matthews: "Lenny Curry, you’re the chair of the Republican Party down there. Was the intention to suppress the vote down there, as Judith says, or it had some other purpose? Why would you set a requirement you got to get your petitions in, in 48 hours? Why did you set such a requirement and a law?" Curry: "No, there was no intention to suppress the vote." Matthews: "Well, why would you make such a deadline, a two-day deadline to get the petitions in?" Curry: "In my view, the deadline seemed reasonable. The judge struck that part of the law down. A majority of the law stands, which will create ..." Matthews: "Well, wait a minute. I’m going to call you there because everybody watching can figure this one out. If I’m working in front of a Safeway somewhere and I’m collecting registrations -- I’m registering people who aren’t registered -- and it’s Friday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., I can’t even technically turn those in until Monday. That means it’s already elapsed, the 48 hours. "So, under the law, nothing I get done late Friday afternoon is of any value and probably some of the stuff early Saturday morning. The 48-hour rule basically makes it impossible to meet the deadline if you’re working right to the end of the week, right, Lenny?" Curry: "The law was written to ensure that we have controls and processes in place to ensure the integrity of the vote. Most of the law stood. I’m no lawyer. The judge ruled on the 48-hour piece of the law. And it’s gone. And it is what it is. "But to suggest that Republicans want to suppress the vote …" Matthews: "You don’t have to be a lawyer to own a calendar or know what a weekend is. A weekend is 48 hours." Matthews was relentless about his point. But he is also incorrect. We read the bill (HB 1355) that passed the Legislature in 2011 and was signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott. The 158-page bill does indeed create a 48-hour deadline for voter groups to turn in completed registrations. But there’s a caveat. According to the law, a completed application "shall be promptly delivered to the division or the supervisor of elections within 48 hours after the applicant completes it or the next business day if the appropriate office is closed for that 48-hour period." (The passage is included on page 21 of the bill text. We added the bold for emphasis.) Put plainly, if someone is registering voters on a Friday evening -- as Matthews said -- they would have until Monday to turn in the completed forms. If Monday was a holiday, the deadline would be extended until Tuesday. If Monday and Tuesday were holidays, or if the elections office was closed for any reason, the deadline would be Wednesday. And so on. We confirmed our interpretation of the law with Florida Department of State spokesman Chris Cate. There’s no doubt the deadlines were deterring groups from going out to register voters. After the law’s passage, the League of Women Voters said they wouldn’t conduct their usual voter registration drives because the new requirements were too difficult to meet. But Matthews said that Florida’s 2011 voting law made it impossible for third-party groups to register voters on Friday afternoon, because a 48-hour deadline to turn in those applications would expire before the elections office opens Monday morning. That’s not correct. The law factored in weekends and holidays and gave voter registration groups until the next business day. We rate Matthews’ claim False.

pomt-14217	"We win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/19/bernie-sanders/sanders-largely-base-saying-we-win-when-voter-turn/	On the eve of the New York Democratic primary -- where he needs a strong showing to have any hope of winning the presidential nomination contest -- Bernie Sanders has repeatedly emphasized the importance of a large turnout. In an April 12 speech in Syracuse, Sanders told supporters, "A week from today there's going to be an enormously important Democratic primary in New York state. What we have found is we win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low. Next Tuesday, let us come out in large numbers. Let us have the highest voter turnout in Democratic primary history in New York." We wondered whether it’s accurate for Sanders to say he’s won when turnout is high and lost when the turnout is low. We didn’t find a unified source that presents 2016 Democratic primary turnout rates on a state-by-state basis, so we created measurements that address two different ways of measuring turnout. (Political scientists we contacted said our approach was solid.) The bottom line is that we found a few cases where Sanders won high turnout states, but overall, the case he makes is pretty thin. Turnout rates in the 2016 primaries and caucuses Let's start with the first way of measuring turnout: How many people voted in the 2016 primaries and caucuses compared with 2012. To do this, we divided by the number of Democratic ballots cast in the 2016 primaries and caucuses by the number of votes Barack Obama received in the 2012 general election (a reasonable approximation of how many Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters there are in each state). The higher this percentage, the higher the turnout. (We used data from the U.S. Elections Project, run by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, and NBC News.) As the following chart shows, Sanders won the three highest-turnout contests, but also the 10 lowest-turnout contests. States won by Sanders are marked in bold. State Primary/caucus Winner Democratic ballots / Obama 2012 votes Oklahoma Primary Sanders 75.87% New Hampshire Primary Sanders 69.13% Vermont Primary Sanders 67.88% Illinois Primary Clinton 66.82% Massachusetts Primary Clinton 64.18% Wisconsin Primary Sanders 62.08% Arkansas Primary Clinton 56.33% North Carolina Primary Clinton 52.47% Missouri Primary Clinton 51.53% Alabama Primary Clinton 50.01% Michigan Primary Sanders 47.06% Ohio Primary Clinton 44.29% South Carolina Primary Clinton 44.11% Arizona Primary Clinton 43.95% Texas Primary Clinton 43.59% Georgia Primary Clinton 43.44% Mississippi Primary Clinton 41.75% Virginia Primary Clinton 41.20% Florida Primary Clinton 40.36% Tennessee Primary Clinton 38.96% Louisiana Primary Clinton 38.56% Utah Caucus Sanders 33.71% Iowa Caucus Clinton 20.96% Nevada Caucus Clinton 15.88% Washington state Caucus Sanders 14.19% Minnesota Caucus Sanders 13.89% Nebraska Caucus Sanders 11.57% Maine Caucus Sanders 11.56% Idaho Caucus Sanders 11.24% Hawaii Caucus Sanders 11.12% Colorado Caucus Sanders 10.97% Alaska Caucus Sanders 10.38% Wyoming Caucus Sanders 10.18% Kansas Caucus Sanders 9.35% So Sanders does have something of a point -- the top three slots are all states he won. Vermont is an outlier -- it’s Sanders’ home state -- but Oklahoma and New Hampshire are legitimate, high-turnout Sanders victories. Sanders won two other primary states with relatively high turnouts -- Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton took the rest. But Sanders' point holds as long as you only consider primaries and ignore caucuses. Remember those bottom 10 states that Sanders won? They were all caucuses, where the complicated process tends to keep voter turnout low. Ignoring the large number of low-turnout caucuses Sanders won would be cherry-picking. Putting these low-turnout caucuses into the calculation quickly weakens the link between high-turnout contests and Sanders victories: The average turnout rate for a state won by Clinton was 44 percent, while the average state won by Sanders had a turnout rate of 31 percent. Turnout change between 2008 and 2016 There's another way to define a high-turnout primary or caucus -- to see how much turnout grew in 2016 compared with the last contested Democratic primary year, 2008. To do this, we compared the number of Democratic ballots cast in 2008 to the number cast in 2016, once again using U.S. Elections Project data. The chart below shows how primary turnout grew (the positive values) or shrunk (the negative values) between 2008 and 2016. Once again, Sanders’ states are in bold: State Democratic turnout increase, 2008 to 2016 Michigan + 102.82% Alaska + 22.96% Idaho + 12.53% Kansas + 7.85% Maine + 2.98% Colorado + 2.92% Minnesota + 0.44% Florida - 2.33% Massachusetts - 3.44% Illinois - 4.40% Wisconsin - 10.04% Arizona - 10.43% New Hampshire - 11.74% Vermont - 12.89% Nebraska - 13.47% Louisiana - 18.88% Oklahoma - 19.50% Wyoming - 20.03% Virginia - 20.40% Missouri - 24.12% Alabama - 26.05% Iowa - 27.50% North Carolina - 27.69% Georgia - 27.85% Nevada - 28.55% South Carolina - 29.90% Arkansas - 30.02% Tennessee - 40.57% Utah - 41.14% Mississippi - 49.19% Ohio - 49.27% Texas - 50.06% Washington state - 66.73% So, with this measurement too, states that Sanders won are clustered near the top of the list -- but once again, there are some important caveats. For starters, the only primary state Sanders won that saw turnout growth this year was a real outlier, Michigan. Due to an intra-party dispute in 2008, Obama wasn’t on the ballot in Michigan eight years ago. As a result, it’s no surprise to see turnout more than double in 2016. And we’ll discount Minnesota, since its caucus participation figure for 2016 is an estimate, and was virtually the same numerically as 2008. That leaves five states won by Sanders where turnout increased. But it’s worth keeping in mind that each was a caucus state, and the increases in turnout were extraordinarily small in the context of a primary season where millions of votes have been cast. Alaska was up 1,979, Idaho was up 2,660, Kansas was up 2,911, Maine was up 1,330, and Colorado was up 3,507. In most states -- including most of those won by Sanders such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin -- turnout has actually fallen compared with the 2008 primaries, when Obama was running to become the first African-American president. With Democratic turnout down almost everywhere compared with 2008, it’s a stretch for Sanders to tout his ability to win by drawing waves of additional voters to the polls. In fact, Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, not only agreed with our conclusions but also also volunteered to run the math on how Sanders’ share of the vote has been influenced by three factors -- the percentage of African-American voters, whether the state was in the northern or southern United States, and turnout. He found that race and region were powerful predictors of how well Sanders did -- and that turnout mattered very little. Our ruling Sanders said, "We win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low." Sanders did notch a few notable victories in high-turnout primaries, but it would be cherry-picking to focus only on primaries. Sanders has mostly won caucuses, which have produced the lowest turnout rates of 2016 across the board. And while Sanders did win the handful of states where Democratic turnout increased over 2008, these increases were tiny, casting doubt on how significant an accomplishment this is. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/074dfd44-4244-447d-8cd3-371fb14bad33	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-19T10:10:04	2016-04-12	['None']
pomt-01060	"A strong majority of Americans support" the Keystone XL pipeline.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-says-strong-majority-americans-back-key/	See editor's note below During the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, newly elected Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline. The project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions. Here’s what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015. "The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. "President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The President’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact." We wondered whether Ernst was correct when she said that "a strong majority of Americans support" the pipeline. So we looked at the polling data. At the survey curation site pollingreport.com, we found five polls taken since May 2014 that asked questions that shed light on Ernst’s claim. We’ll start with the four polls that asked the question in its most basic form -- whether the respondent favors or opposes construction of the pipeline: • CBS News, Jan. 9-12, 2015. "Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?" Favor: 60 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure or no answer: 12 percent. (Margin of error ± 3 percent.) • USA Today/Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Nov. 13-16, 2014. "Should Congress and President Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas, or not?" Yes: 60 percent. No: 25 percent. Unsure: 14 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.6 percent.) • Pew Research Center, Nov. 6-9, 2014. "Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas?" Favor: 59 percent. Oppose: 31 percent. Unsure/refused: 10 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.1 percent.) • CBS News, May 16-19, 2014. "Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?" Favor: 56 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure/No answer: 17 percent. For these four polls, support for the pipeline held steady in a very narrow band, from 56 percent to 60 percent. So Ernst has a strong case to make. The only caveat stems from the fifth poll, which asked the question in a somewhat different way. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, 2015, phrased the question this way: "Obama has said he won't decide whether to approve a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas until a review has determined whether it is in the national interest. The Republicans in Congress are working on a law to authorize the pipeline without Obama's approval. Which side do you support? Should the pipeline be authorized now, or should the review be completed before deciding?" Asked the question this way, respondents were less sanguine about the approach being taken by the Republican Congress of which Ernst is now part: 34 percent said the pipeline should be authorized without Obama’s approval, while 61 percent said that the review should be completed first. (Another 2 percent said they opposed the pipeline outright, but that answer was only tallied when volunteered, not because it was given as an option.) In other words, the polls show strong and consistent public support for building the pipeline, but one poll suggests it's only after completing full reviews of its merits. Our ruling Ernst said that "a strong majority of Americans support" the Keystone XL pipeline. She’s right that between 56 percent and 60 percent of the public has consistently supported the project when asked outright whether it should be built. However, one poll found public concern about building it before reviews are complete -- a stance more in tune with Obama than with Republican leaders. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. EDITOR’S NOTE, Jan. 21, 2015: After this article appeared, a reader pointed out another poll that had addressed public support for the Keystone XL pipeline that had been released the same day we published the story. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in January 2015 asked respondents whether they favored or opposed building the pipeline, or whether they did "not know enough about this topic to have an opinion." The inclusion of that last phrase increased the "don’t know" response beyond that found in most other polls, to 37 percent. Of those who did have an opinion, 41 percent favored building Keystone XL and 20 percent opposed it. Because that's generally in line with what we found in the other polls, our original rating of Mostly True stands.	None	Joni Ernst	None	None	None	2015-01-20T23:47:06	2015-01-20	['United_States']

pomt-07056	"The American people don't want us to raise taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/john-boehner/polls-taxes-show-people-favor-mixed-approach/	Republicans stopped negotiations on raising the debt limit with Democrats on Thursday June 23, 2011, saying they would not agree to any increases in taxes. The debt ceiling is the legal limit on the amount of debt the United States is allowed to hold. If the government needs to go over that limit, Congress first needs to grant permission. The U.S. is expected to hit the debt limit -- a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion -- later this summer. Republicans, led by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., have been negotiating with Vice President Joe Biden to try to reach agreement to raise the debt limit. Republicans want spending cuts, but Democrats have said new revenue-raisers should be included as well. Revenue-raisers could include traditional tax increases or could mean ending tax exemptions and closing loopholes. On Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio repeated the Republican position that tax increases couldn't be part of any deal: "Listen, we've got to stop spending money that we don't have, and since the beginning, the majority leader and myself, along with Sen. McConnell and Sen. Kyl have been clear: tax hikes are off the table. First of all: raising taxes is going to destroy jobs. If you raise taxes on the people that we need to grow our economy and to hire new workers, guess what: they're not going to do it if they have to pay higher taxes to the federal government. Second, a tax hike cannot pass the U.S. House of Representatives. It's not just a bad idea, it doesn't have the votes, and it can't happen. And third, the American people don't want us to raise taxes. They know that we've got a spending problem. That's why Republicans passed a budget that pays down debt over time without raising taxes." There's a lot in that statement, but we what we wanted to fact-check today is Boehner's final point: The American people don't want us to raise taxes. We've seen polling data that contradicts that, so we thought it was time for a review of the evidence. As with most polling, the answers you get depend on how you ask the questions. The pollsters at Gallup conduct an annual survey in which they ask, "Do you consider the amount of federal income tax you have to pay as too high, about right, or too low?" This year, a majority -- 50 percent -- said "too high." (That's in line with previous years and even a bit lower than in the 1990s.) Another 43 percent said "about right," and a measly 4 percent said "too low." The poll, conducted in April right before Tax Day, also asked about fairness: "Do you regard the income tax which you will have to pay this year as fair?" To that question, 40 percent say their taxes are not fair, but 57 percent say, yes, their taxes are fair. So too high, but fair? Isn't that contradictory? Gallup says not necessarily. "Notably, more Americans consider their taxes fair than say they pay the right amount in taxes (57 percebt vs. 43 percent), suggesting more people dislike what they pay than feel it is unjust," the pollsters concluded. All right, so nobody likes taxes. But what about public policy? Boehner's office referred us to a recent Bloomberg poll on the economy, which asked, "Which of the following approaches is more likely to be successful in growing the U.S. economy and creating jobs?" The number one answer, with 55 percent, was "Spending cuts and tax cuts will give businesses more confidence to hire. The other choices were, "Government needs to keep spending at current level now because the job market is so weak" (17 percent); "Government needs to spend more to stimulate the economy" (also 17 percent); and "Not sure" (11 percent). The poll also asked, "Would you be willing to pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit, or are you not willing to pay more, even if the deficit grows?" A large majority, 61 percent, said they were not willing to pay more. About 36 percent said they were willing to pay more. Still, we found a number of polls that indicate people do want the government to raise taxes. That was most clearly the case when it comes to raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Several polls ask people if taxes should be increased on people who make more than $250,000. Polls show substantial majorities support the idea. We found majorities of 72 percent, 64 percent, and 59 percent. (Those are from April polls by ABC News/Washington Post, McClatchy-Marist, and USA Today/Gallup, respectively.) On whether corporations pay enough in taxes, Gallup found that 67 percent said they pay too little. Finally, we should note one area where we found contradictions on tax increases --in polls that ask people if they favor spending cuts, tax increases, or some combination thereof. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted at the beginning of May found that most people, 52 percent, favored a combination of cuts and tax increases. The NBC/Washington Post poll from April found that number was even higher, at 59 percent. On the other hand, when you don't give people the option of both, they favor spending cuts over tax increases by significant margins. We found a Reuters/Ipsos poll from March that found people favored spending cuts over tax increase by 56 percent to 30, and a CBS News/New York Times poll from January that put it at 62 to 29. But then we found polls that asked participants if they preferred cuts to benefits such as Social Security and Medicare over tax increases. In those cases, the results favored tax increases. The CBS News/New York Times poll found that 62 percent favored increasing taxes before Medicare benefits are cut. We turned to Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who studies polling and has conducted a review of polls on taxation. We asked her, why the contradiction? Here's what she had to say: "Generally, combinations of tax hikes and spending cuts are most popular. It seems fair to most people. Spending cuts are favored in the abstract. Tax hikes are favored as long as they don't affect me. Generally, people don't think anybody should have to pay more than a quarter of their income in total taxes. "Those are general statements I think we can make. As someone who reads almost all the polls, it is very hard for me to go beyond these generalities. Hypothetical questions about what Congress or the administration should do are especially dangerous because people think in concrete and not abstract terms," she said. Marc Mellman, CEO of the Mellman Group and a Democratic pollster, agreed that people tend to favor a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts when it comes to balancing the budget. "People don't want to pay more taxes, but to deal with the deficit, they prefer a balanced approach that combines tax increases with spending cuts," he said. In conclusion, Boehner said that "the American people don't want us to raise taxes." In fact, polls indicate that people don't like taxes, but they are often okay with increasing specific taxes or closing loopholes. Additionally, when it's time to make hard decisions about the budget, they favor a balanced approach of spending cuts and tax increases. Finally, they tend to favor tax increases for other people -- such as the wealthy or corporations -- if not themselves. Overall, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04569	"President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/25/adam-hasner/mitt-romney-surrogate-adam-hasner-obama-meeting/	With world leaders meeting at the United Nations in New York, the Mitt Romney campaign went after President Barack Obama, repeating the charge that he hasn’t supported Israel enough and isn’t taking threats from Iran seriously. The specific talking point this time is that Obama refused to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Romney campaign released this statement from Adam Hasner, a Florida Republican who’s running for the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing Congressional District 22 in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Hasner, a former state House majority leader, is a Jewish surrogate for Romney. "Now we know why President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York next week: because the president has decided to ‘block out any noise that’s out there’ about the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel," Hasner said, adding that the snub was "an absolute insult" and "no way to treat our friends around the world." (The statement says "next week," but the meetings are actually happening this week.) We have heard conflicting reports about whether Obama jilted Netanyahu, so we decided to look into the matter. A meeting in New York? We found several news stories -- based on anonymous sources -- that said Netanyahu’s team asked for a meeting between the two leaders and was rejected. The White House responded on the record that the leaders couldn’t meet due to scheduling conflicts. The back-and forth started Sept. 11, 2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the White House declined Israel’s request for a meeting during the U.N. conference. "An official in Jerusalem said that the Prime Minister's Office sent the White House a message stating that although Netanyahu will spend only two and a half days on U.S. soil, he is interested in meeting Obama and is willing to travel to the U.S. capital specifically for that purpose. The official added that the White House rejected the request and said that at this time Obama's schedule does not allow for a meeting." Haaretz contrasted those comments with statements from White House National Security Council Spokesman Tommy Vietor saying the leaders were not scheduled to be in New York the same day. Reuters also reported that the White House rejected a request by Netanyahu to meet: "An Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Netanyahu's aides had asked for a meeting when he visits United Nations this month, and ‘the White House has got back to us and said it appears a meeting is not possible. It said that the president's schedule will not permit that.’" (The Romney campaign referred us to the Reuters story when we asked for evidence; Hasner’s campaign pointed us to a longer version of the Reuters article as well as others.) Reuters also reported that Vietor "denied that Netanyahu's request had been spurned, insisting instead that the two leaders were attending the General Assembly on different days and would not be in New York at the same time." The brouhaha over the alleged snub led Obama and Netanyahu to speak for an hour by telephone on Sept. 11. The White House issued a statement that night that the two leaders "reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward." The statement also said: "Contrary to reports in the press, there was never a request for Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet with President Obama in Washington, nor was a request for a meeting ever denied." We’ll note that statement didn’t specifically address whether there was a request for a meeting in New York. The next day, White House spokesman Jay Carney said this of an alleged snub: "The president will be in New York at the United Nations General Assembly early in that week; the prime minister does not arrive until later in that week. There was not logistically an opportunity for the two leaders to meet in New York. A meeting was never requested in Washington, therefore it could not have been denied." We found many similar news reports from other news outlets. The New York Times, for example, reported that Netanyahu’s office had requested a meeting sometime during the United Nations General Assembly, but that it wasn’t possible due to scheduling. According to the article, the White House said that after "a possible New York encounter was ruled out, Mr. Netanyahu did not request a meeting in Washington" and that the scheduling conflict "had been conveyed to Israel long ago." In response to questions from PolitiFact, Vietor emailed us: "Bottom line is that Obama is in New York Monday and Tuesday of this week. Netanyahu is here Thursday (and) Friday because of the holidays," he wrote, referring to Yom Kippur, which starts Tuesday night and continues Wednesday. "In other words, they're not in the city at the same time, which makes having a meeting a logistical challenge." On Thursday, Obama will be campaigning in Virginia Beach, Va. His schedule for Friday has not yet been made public. We emailed Vietor several questions, asking which Israeli officials requested a meeting with Obama and when Israel has made additional attempts at a face-to-face get together. We did not get a response. 'Blocking out noise'? Much has been written about the scheduling of a meeting that didn’t happen. This occurred during a close presidential election in which both parties are fighting for Jewish voters. Although about three of every four Jewish voters supported Obama in 2008, Republicans hope to cut into that edge in swing states such as Florida. And that’s why we see the ongoing war about semantics and symbolic issues as both sides profess their love for Israel. (Read some of our previous fact-checks about Israel during this campaign here and here and here and here.) Hasner noted in his statement the president has decided to ‘block out any noise that’s out there’ about the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to Israel." That was a reference to Obama’s 60 Minutes interview. Host Steve Kroft asked Obama if he was getting pressure from Netanyahu "to make up your mind to use military force in Iran." Obama replied, in part, "When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what’s right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that’s out there. Now I feel an obligation, not pressure but obligation, to make sure that we’re in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues because it affects them deeply. They’re one of our closest allies in the region. And we’ve got an Iranian regime that has said horrible things that directly threaten Israel’s existence." We asked Aaron David Miller, a former State Department adviser on Arab-Israeli affairs for Democrat and Republican Secretaries of State, about the non-meeting. (He wrote an article, "When Bibi Didn’t Meet Barack.") "This in my view wasn’t smart politics on Obama’s part," Miller said in an email. "He’s running for re-election and it could be close. Meeting with Netanyahu is a no-brainer. Why hand the Republicans a hammer?" But Miller said that if the two leaders had met in New York, he doesn’t believe that it would have led to any policy change by the United States or Israel about Iran. It simply would have avoided it becoming an issue that Obama didn’t meet with Netanyahu. "Nothing would have come of it," he said. Our ruling Hasner said, "President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York." Obama was in New York on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, and Netanyahu will be in New York on Thursday and Friday. Obama is campaigning in Virginia on Thursday, and his schedule for Friday has not yet been released. So a meeting with Netanyahu didn’t fit Obama’s schedule. However, he is the president of the United States, and at the end of the day he determines his schedule. The White House has confirmed that a scheduling conflict prevented a meeting. That's not quite refusal, but he is not meeting with Netanyahu in New York, so on some level he made the decision. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-13981	"Tuition-free public universities and colleges are just a pipe dream. False. They were both free up until the Vietnam War."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/10/viral-image/viral-image-stretches-truth-about-college-tuition/	Is free tuition at public colleges and universities a lofty dream or modest proposal? Liberals are Cool, a media organization, posted a meme on their Facebook page June 1. It reads, "Tuition-free public universities and colleges are just a pipe dream. False. They were both free up until the Vietnam War." In February we looked at a similar claim made by Bernie Sanders, who said, "Making public colleges tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States." After talking to experts we concluded that Sanders’ claim was Mostly True because at least nine nations offer free tuition, and some U.S. public colleges and universities offered free tuition. The caveat is that college tuition was up to each school or state to decide, meaning certain U.S. colleges charged tuition as early as the 1800s. This new claim is broader when it comes to free tuition in the United States, so we wanted to take a fresh look. Roger Geiger, a education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II, said the claim is "completely not true, except for California." Geiger also took issue with the idea that there were multiple tution-free universities. "The only state that I am aware of that did not charge ‘tuition’ was California," Geiger said. "In 1960 it charged a basic fee of $60, plus incidental fees — still very cheap. ... Most other state universities charged tuition of roughly $200-300." At its founding, the University of California offered free tuition to California residents, but charged a fee in 1921. By the 1970s both in-state and out-of-state students began to be charged tuition. William G. Tierney, a professor at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education, said public colleges used the word fees, not tuition, to describe costs associated with going to school. "We didn’t call costs ‘tuition’ and instead used the word ‘fees’ to suggest that the cost was free but if you wanted something extra there was a ‘fee,’ " he said. Geiger said some land-grant universities were tuition free in the 1800s, but that all ended after 1920 because universities needed more revenue due to inflation and the growing number of people attending colleges. John Thelin, professor at the University of Kentucky, and author of A History of American Higher Education published by Johns Hopkins University Press, said that tuition prices in America have never been set on a nationwide basis, so higher education decisions are left up to the states. This means in each state a higher education official works with the state to come up with tuition policies. "So, there is no statute or mechanism by which the federal government could set tuition nationwide, across state borders," he said. There was no consistent pattern that public colleges and universities followed for charging tuition, and some institutions have changed their policy since their founding, Thelin said. For example, based on its charter, Rice University (formerly Rice Institute) was not allowed to charge tuition. Stanford was tuition-free at its founding up until the 1910s and Berea College, to this day, doesn’t charge tuition. Both Rice and Stanford now charge tuition. The meme further suggests some change in policy necessitated or prompted by the Vietnam War. Geiger says that is wrong. He said public funding for higher education remained strong until the 1970s, which was years after the Vietnam War ended. It wasn’t until the 1979-81 recession when tuition began to increase and state appropriations were lowered. Thelin agreed with Geiger’s point that the Vietnam War had no cause-effect impact on tuition costs in America. He said a main influence on rising college costs was "stagflation"— a period of more than 15 years where inflation rates are higher than 10 percent and national economic productivity is low—in the 1970s. "Some of this was due to OPEC and the unexpected, huge dollar and percentage increase in oil prices – which was very hard on colleges and other nonprofit organizations," Thelin said. Our ruling A widespread Internet post claims that public colleges and universities were tuition-free up until the Vietnam War. This claim takes a potentially factual talking point and stretches it too far. Some public schools had essentially free tuition in the 1960s, but experts say they were largely isolated to California and that it was very much typical for public universities to charge tuition or fees at that point of time. Any claim or suggestion that the Vietnam War had an impact on college costs is not borne out by the facts. We rate this claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/77771a4f-9a2a-4440-89f6-58d38ad18cbe	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-06-10T12:00:00	2016-06-01	['None']
pomt-04882	Says Obama "refuses to recognize Jerusalem" as the capital of Israel.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-rejects-jerusalem-capital-israel/	A 30-second ad from Mitt Romney’s campaign paints two starkly different portraits of the two presidential candidates’ positions on Israel. Barack Obama: a president who has not visited the Jewish state. Mitt Romney: a friend who cherishes America’s friendship with the ally. "Who shares your values?" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. "As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital." Romney, the ad continues, "will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel." It ends with clips of Romney speaking in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall. In separate fact-checks we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on visiting Israel. Here, we consider his position on the city of Jerusalem. Capital question In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. The CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating "Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv." The U.S. Department of State posts similar language. During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided." The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. "It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations," Obama said in the wake. For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing "Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital." "And," he added, according to the New York Times, "we should move our embassy to Jerusalem," from Tel Aviv, "before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people." Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy. As our peers at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that’s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House. How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly what the capital of Israel is. He replied only that "our position hasn’t changed" and "you know the answer." This is the evidence Romney’s campaign pointed to when we asked for backup to the ad. Our ruling The ad says Obama "refuses to recognize Jerusalem" as the capital of Israel. As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process. That’s not so much a refusal on his part but a continuation of the line taken before him by previous presidents. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA under his administration note Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with a footnote attached. Romney’s ad portrays Obama’s position as a betrayal of an ally. That’s misleading. We rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-08-07T15:45:27	2012-08-05	['Israel', 'Jerusalem']

pomt-12183	The Inland Empire is "the second fastest growing region" for jobs in California.	true	/california/statements/2017/jul/27/gavin-newsom/inland-empire-second-only-san-francisco-california/	California’s workforce of 19 million is spread across distinct metro regions, from tech-heavy Silicon Valley to the agricultural powerhouses of Fresno and Bakersfield, to the movie studios of Los Angeles. Less talked about are the nearly two million who work in the state’s Inland Empire. It’s home to more than 4.5 million people in sprawling San Bernardino and Riverside counties east of Los Angeles. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor, recently claimed this region of high desert and valley communities is among the leaders in California job growth. The Inland Empire is "the second fastest growing region" in California, Newsom said in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on July 12, 2017. "It’s about logistics, warehousing, transportation." Newsom makes his claim at about the 2:00 minute mark above. We took Newsom’s statement to mean the Inland Empire has the state’s second fastest job growth rate because the lieutenant governor went on to talk about statewide job growth immediately after making this claim. Newsom’s comments follow Gov. Jerry Brown’s recent claim on NBC’s Meet the Press that California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire "are experiencing tremendous job growth." We examined that claim and rated it Mostly True. Still, we wondered whether Newsom was right. We set out on a fact check. Our research Asked for evidence to support the claim, Newsom’s spokesman cited research from John Husing, chief economist with the Inland Empire Economic Partnership. The industry group advocates for jobs creation in the region. The spokesman specifically pointed to a section of Husing’s April 2017 report that found the Inland Empire’s "3.47% growth rate in 2016 was second to San Francisco (4.16%)." The report went on to say the region added the second most total jobs of any in the state, 47,500, behind Los Angeles’ 109,000 and ahead of San Francisco’s 43,800. These figures back up Newsom’s claim. His statement also holds when looking at job growth rates over the past five years. In April 2017, Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, compiled data showing job growth rates by metro area. The Inland Empire had the fastest job growth rate over the past year at that time, 3.2 percent, and the second fastest rate, 22.3 percent, over the past five years. The economists analyzed data from the California Employment Development Department. Types of jobs Newsom’s claim about the rapid pace of job growth appears on the money. But what about the type of jobs he described: "logistics, warehousing, transportation" ? Husing told us this description was also on the right track. With the explosion of e-commerce, developers have seized on the Inland Empire’s vast and affordable stretches of land to build warehouses for products shipped through ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach. More than 60,600 distribution and transportation jobs have been added in the Inland Empire since its rebound from the Great Recession in 2010, Husing said. In addition, nearly 46,000 construction jobs; about 25,000 healthcare jobs and 15,000 manufacturing positions have been created. Logistics, transportation and construction "are overwhelmingly the sectors that are driving the growth," the economist said. Husing described most of these positions as "blue collar jobs." In April, Husing described in more depth the Inland Empire’s wage picture. He said it had a lower share of high-paying administrative jobs compared with the state as a whole. But, he said, the region was outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed the Inland Empire is "the second fastest growing region" in California. We took Newsom’s claim to mean it has the second fastest job growth rate. Data compiled by two leading economists back up Newsom’s assertion. It shows the Inland Empire’s nearly 3.5 percent jobs growth rate in 2016 was second only to San Francisco’s 4.16 percent. Figures over the past five years show the Inland Empire grew jobs at 22.3 percent, again second only to the San Francisco market. The lieutenant governor was also correct to describe these Inland Empire jobs as based in the transportation and distribution sectors, based on data from the economists. We rate Newsom’s claim True.

pomt-04359	"I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-he-balanced-budget-salt-lake-city/	The London Games may be only a memory now, but the Olympics remain an issue in the presidential campaign. During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Mitt Romney once again cited his experience running the 2002 Winter Olympics as a credential in his bid for the White House. "I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets," he said. "I was in the world of business for 25 years. If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there." Is Romney’s claim about the finances of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics accurate? First, some background. Romney left Bain Capital in early 1999 to take over leadership of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed widespread corruption in the bidding process used to award the games. The scandal forced several of Salt Lake City’s Olympic officials to quit and the mayor to step down, and the committee was reorganized. With two years until the games were set to begin, officials needed someone who help restore credibility to the organization, and they tapped Romney, a Mormon whose family has deep roots in the state and who attended Brigham Young University. The Salt Lake City assignment launched Romney into the national spotlight and helped reboot his political career, catapulting to a successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts. As we analyze Romney’s claim, it’s important to understand that there is not one budget for the Olympic Games -- there are two. One is handled by a privately run committee -- in the case of the 2002 Winter Games, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. The committee collects money from such sources as television rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Under the rules at the time, this revenue funded the operational costs of the Olympics as well as the costs of building the necessary sports venues. The other pot of money comes from government funding -- primarily to cover transportation upgrades and security costs. The budget Romney is talking about is the first one, covering Olympic operations. He’s correct that under his stewardship, this budget was balanced -- in fact, more than balanced. According to Fraser Bullock -- a former Bain Capital colleague of Romney’s who joined him at the committee as chief operating officer -- the committee spent $1.3 billion and ended up with a surplus of about $100 million. Romney is widely credited with creating a sponsorship juggernaut, reeling in such corporations as Allstate, General Mills, Sears Roebuck, certified Angus beef, and Monster.com to sponsor the Games. According to the Washington Post, committee secured 53 deals, more than double the number for the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The sponsorships that rolled in after Romney arrived exceeded more than $300 million, perhaps a third of which consisted of local Utah sponsors who had never sponsored the Olympics before, Bullock told the New York Times in 2007. On the spending side, Romney disdained the lavish patterns typical of Olympic committees, charging employees a dollar a slice for pizza (served on paper plates) and 25 cents for sodas. "When Mitt joined (the committee), there was a budget deficit of $400 million," Bullock told PolitiFact. "So for (the committee), Mitt not only balanced the budget, he produced a surplus, which is remarkable. Only Los Angeles in 1984 also had a surplus. All other Olympics lose money--a lot." These figures, however, don’t include the second budget. Bullock counts the second budget as reaching $400 million -- $240 million for security (the games came shortly after 9/11, heightening costs) and $160 million for core transportation upgrades, such as interstate interchanges. Bullock says that in many cases the dollars spent on transportation projects were already in the pipeline, but were accelerated to meet the Olympic timetable. Other observers, however, say the true amount of this second budget was larger than $400 million. On top of this base amount, at least $400 million was spent on a light-rail system. Bullock says local politicians used the Olympics as an opportunity to push through funding for the light rail project, and that he doesn’t consider it spending that was required by the Games. "I would not for any reason include light rail" in the calculations, Bullock said. "We didn’t need it." Investigative journalists Donald Barlett and James Steele calculated in a 2001 Sports Illustrated article that Congress was spending $1.5 billion in taxpayer dollars on the Salt Lake City Olympics -- "1.5 times the amount spent by lawmakers to support all seven Olympic Games held in the U.S. since 1904—combined." (These figures were adjusted for inflation.) We weren’t able to independently verify the $1.5 billion figure, but even the number Bullock accepts -- $400 million -- isn’t a trivial amount of extra dollars. And Kenneth Bullock, a former executive committee member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee who now directs the of Utah League of Cities and Towns, added that various Utah localities chipped in an unknown number of additional dollars. "Some of them managed to negotiate reimbursements from (the committee), but even that never would have been enough to pay all of their costs," said Kenneth Bullock, who is no relation to Fraser Bullock. Officially, Romney had no control over this second budget. But he does appear to have taken an aggressive role in advocating for additional spending. In Romney’s 2004 book, Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games, he wrote that he asked his lobbyist "to bring in more federal funding than had ever been appropriated for any Olympics, summer or winter." The committee employed five federal lobbying firms beyond his in-house lobbying office, spending $3.5 million in all, NBC News reported earlier this year. And the Games ended up getting support from at least 18 federal agencies, according to a 2001 Government Accountability Office report. "I was successful in organizing the Olympics, got record funds from the federal government," Romney said in 2002 as he was running for governor of Massachusetts. We asked a number of Olympics experts whether they thought Romney was being accurate when he said he "balanced the budget" of the Salt Lake City Olympics. Most agreed that it’s not a simple question. "The entire issue of accounting" for Olympics finances "is difficult, as it very difficult to know what to count as an Olympic-related cost and what is an infrastructural improvement to the host city," said Bill Mallon, co-founder of the International Society of Olympic Historians. "It can get very complex." Still, most of the experts we asked concluded that Romney was right, but with what David Wallechinsky, the author of several histories of the Olympics, said was "a major asterisk." "Romney is right on a technicality that misses the major issue about financing any Olympics," said Roger G. Noll, a Stanford University economist who has studied large public infrastructure projects, including stadiums. "Romney saved the Salt Lake City Olympics by regaining political support. One way he did this was to reduce costs below the plan, but the main reason is that Romney succeeded in getting a huge subsidy from the federal government." Our ruling It’s correct that Romney more than balanced the the Salt Lake Organizing Committee’s budget. But that doesn’t tell the whole story, since he helped secure at least $400 million -- and possibly up to $1.5 billion -- in government funding to make the Olympics function that is not included in the balance sheet he’s touting. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. So we rate Romney’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-22T23:40:58	2012-10-22	['None']
pomt-00811	"White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/31/starbucks/its-race-together-campaign-starbucks-says-white-pe/	Soon after unveiling its "Race Together" campaign -- which seemed to get more bad publicity than good, initially -- Starbucks published an insert in 2 million copies of USA Today to explain why it wanted to start a national conversation about one of the nation’s most sensitive topics. The eight-page insert, which appeared March 20, 2015, included a series of statements about race. One of them was: "White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth." That number is striking because only 67 percent of households are white, and reports have indicated the U.S. population is shifting toward minority-majority status. With Starbucks chief executive officer Howard Schultz expected in Milwaukee on April 1, 2015, we thought we would check the company’s claim. The campaign In addition to its coffee, Starbucks is known for social awareness. In 2015, it placed fifth in Forbes’ annual ranking of the world’s most admired companies. The rankings are based on nine attributes, and one of Starbucks’ top attributes, according to the business magazine, is social responsibility. "Race Together" grew out of concerns over police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York. In announcing the campaign, Schultz called it "an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society – one conversation at a time." Schultz encouraged his baristas to write "Race Together" on Starbucks cups and to engage in conversations while serving their customers. That ended after less than a week, which Starbucks said was as planned, after heavy criticism. Other parts of "Race Together" are continuing. Starbucks hasn't confirmed it, but the family of Dontre Hamilton said Schultz would be meeting with them in Milwaukee. Hamilton was shot to death by a Milwaukee officer on April 30, 2014, after Starbucks employees called police to report Hamilton sleeping in a downtown park. The officer was fired. Starbucks’ evidence To back its claim about white wealth, Starbucks cited a November 2013 article in the American Prospect, a liberal magazine. The author said he did calculations on net worth data from the 2010 version of the Federal Reserve System’s Survey of Consumer Finances, a respected source. According to the article: Whites held 88.4 percent of the nation’s wealth; Hispanics, 4 percent and blacks 2.7 percent. The remaining 4.9 percent was listed as other. That category includes Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders and those with a multi-racial background. So, that’s a start. But first let’s take a step back. To be clear, wealth -- commonly measured as net worth -- is different than income. It is the difference between a household's assets, such as savings or a home, and liabilities, such as a mortgage or a car loan. So, you can have a good-paying job but have a negative net worth, if your debts outweigh your savings. Some reports in recent years have said as many as one in four households has zero net worth or negative net worth. More recent data We were able to get the latest and more detailed breakdown on net worth from the Federal Reserve, for 2013. The nation’s net worth was $65.5 trillion and breaks down this way: Race/Ethnicity Net worth Share of net worth White $58.1 trillion 90 percent Black $1.71 trillion 3 percent Hispanic $1.46 trillion 2 percent Other $3.29 trillion 5 percent As we close, we'll note that two of our most-clicked fact checks were about disparities in wealth: In 2011, activist and filmmaker Michael Moore said in Madison that 400 Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." We rated the claim True. And in 2013, we rated as True this claim by the liberal group One Wisconsin Now: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." Our rating Starbucks said: "White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth." That matches the latest net worth figures from the Federal Reserve System. We rate the statement True.

pomt-09638	When Charlie Crist was elected governor, Florida ranked 31st in K-12 education. "Last year ... we went from 31st to 14. And this year, the top 10 in America."	half-true	/florida/statements/2009/dec/21/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-touts-floridas-improvements-educatio/	Gov. Charlie Crist says Florida has a good story to tell when it comes to K-12 education. His evidence? State-by-state rankings from a reputable education publication. "When I came in three years ago, according to Education Weekly , a well-respected national publication, it said that out of the 50 states Florida was ranked 31st. Thirty-first in K-12 education," Crist told members of the Pinellas Republican Executive Committee on Dec. 14, 2009. "Last year my friends, we went from 31st to 14. And this year, the top 10 in America. "These aren't my statistics. They're not from our Department of Education. They're from objective observers who gave us this ranking." Crist means Education Week , not Weekly, but that's not really important. What is, is his claim that Florida's education ranking has improved dramatically from 2007 to 2009. Does Crist have the rankings right? Each January, Education Week produces a detailed state-by-state report that measures and compares states on a number of education benchmarks. It ranks states based on accountability, K-12 achievement, school finances and other categories. The report, which is published online as well as in print, then produces an overall ranking for each state, both as a letter and a number between 1 and 100. We'll start with the most recent rankings and work backward. In Education Week 's January 2009 report titled "Portraits of a Population," Florida received an overall letter score of B- or a number score of 79.6. As Crist suggests, that score put Florida in a tie for 10th when compared to the other 49 states and the District of Columbia. Check. We then turned to the 2008 report called "Tapping Into Teaching." There, Florida scored a C+ or 79.2 and ranked 14th in the country. Another check. Finally, we looked at the 2007 report "From Cradle to Career." The 2007 report doesn't have the same overall ranking that is available for the 2008 and 2009 studies, but there is a ranking called the Chance For Success Index. The Chance For Success Index, its authors say, was designed to measure the odds of success for a child who grows up in a particular state when compared to other states. Indicators include family income, a parent's education and employment, high school graduation rates, adult employment status, and state annual income figures. On that index, as Crist says, Florida ranked 31st nationwide. That year, Florida also ranked 31st in the publication's K-12 Achievement Index, which focuses explicitly on in-school learning. Three reports, three years, three rankings – 31, 14, 10. C-h-e-c… If only it were that simple. Turns out, one of these numbers is not like the others. Christopher B. Swanson, director of the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, the not-for-profit organization that publishes Education Week, says Crist is referring to overall rankings for 2008 and 2009. But there is no overall ranking for 2007. That's because the publication never produced one, Swanson says. What was graded and ranked in 2007 are two specific categories, Chance For Success and K-12 Achievement. Those categories were then folded into the overall calculations and rankings for later years, Swanson said. Put another way, the 2007 rankings measured A and B, while the 2008 and 2009 numbers measured A, B, C, D, and so on. Crist shoehorned the numbers together. "We generally advise against making strong statements about year-to-year comparisons because our framework/indicators generally changes at least a little bit," Swanson said. "This would particularly be true in the past couple years since we have made some major revisions to our research and grading framework." But for argument's sake, let's compare years anyway. While it did not publish overall rankings each year, Education Week did publish state rankings for its Chance For Success and K-12 Achievement indexes in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Florida's Chance For Success ranking -- which takes into account state graduation rates, employment opportunities and income potential -- fell from 31, to 32, to 33 (not so good). The state's K-12 Achievement ranking -- which measures only in-school learning -- climbed from 31 in 2007 to 7 in 2008 and 7 again 2009 (very good). We understand this can be confusing. The St. Petersburg Times made the same general assumption Crist did in a report Jan. 7, 2009. In a story called "Schools gain national respect," the Times used Education Week rankings to say how Florida had jumped from 31 to 14 to 10. Which brings us back to Crist's original statement. Crist is right that Education Week ranked Florida 31st in 2007, 14th in 2008 and 10th in 2009. But they're simply not comparable rankings. The publication didn't make an overall ranking in 2007, and says it has adjusted the ratings formula slightly each year. A cursory review would have revealed as much. And even if he missed it, the Orlando Sentinel put the rankings very much in doubt back in September. But there's plenty of good news to be found in the Education Week rankings. Florida's K-12 achievement ranks 7th in the country, and the state ranks 10th overall. That's certainly worth cheering and, we assume, part of the point Crist was trying to make to begin with. On the whole, he gets a Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2009-12-21T12:21:43	2009-12-14	['United_States', 'Charlie_Crist']
pomt-01058	The United States is "the only advanced country on Earth" that doesn’t guarantee "paid maternity leave to our workers."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-united-states-only-developed-cou/	President Barack Obama sent signs in the days leading up to the 2015 State of the Union address that he would once again call for Congress to require paid maternity leave for all workers. For those hoping he would, he didn’t disappoint. The push came as part of a package of ideas to help the middle class get ahead. " Middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change," he said. "That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement  —  and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year." Paid medical leave is one way to accomplish that, he said. "Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers," he said. We’ll put aside the part about sick leave for this fact-check. Instead, let’s review whether the United States’ policies on maternity leave differ from the rest of the world. Obama made a similar statement in a Huffington Post op-ed last June. We rated it Mostly True. Since this is a big piece of Obama’s State of the Union legislative push, we thought a review was warranted. Under the Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a couple of exceptions. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes, and Washington state passed a bill to establish paid maternity leave but later reversed course. Additionally, some employers offer paid maternity leave even though it’s not required. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 13 percent of workers had access to some kind of paid family leave, up 1 percentage point from 2013. Compared to the rest of the developed world, that’s very low. According to the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States joins New Guinea as the two countries out of 170 that provide no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of the 41 other developed countries highlighted by the report, the United States also mandates the shortest period of time off — 12 weeks. Compare that to the U.K. and Australia, which each allow for a full year off (though not all of it is paid). Iceland has the second-shortest leave of developed countries at 13 weeks off, though it’s all paid. Of the developed countries, the United States is in a bracket with the smallest percentage of people receiving the benefit in practice, with an estimated 10 to 32 percent of the population eligible for paid leave. No other developed country is below 33 percent. However, paid maternity leave is not a universal benefit even in developed countries. Some countries exclude certain portions of their populations from eligibility, making it far from a universal benefit. Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get any in Japan. Canada, where about 66 to 89 percent of women are actually eligible for maternity leave, also excludes migrant workers and individuals that own more than 40 percent of their business, and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. The result is that in some countries, large portions of the population don’t end up actually being covered. In Spain and Japan, between 33 and 65 percent of workers are eligible, the fewest other than the United States. The International Labor Organization also sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) They should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and 3) the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide that didn’t check off any of the three). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Our ruling Obama said that the United States is the only advanced country on earth that doesn’t guarantee "paid maternity leave to our workers." Unless you live in one of three states that mandate it, paid maternity leave is not required, and it’s uncommon among employers. As a result, the United States has the smallest population of women eligible for paid maternity leave among developed countries. All developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization mandate at least some paid maternity leave. However, it’s worth noting that the benefit is not exactly universally enjoyed in parts of the developed world due to restrictions and exclusions on certain workers. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T00:16:00	2015-01-20	['United_States']

pomt-08776	Under the new health care law, "all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/23/chain-email/health-care-law-sales-tax-home-sales-no/	A new chain e-mail wrongly claims that the 2010 health care law will institute a new tax on home sales. Here's the e-mail a reader recently forwarded to us: "Under the new health care bill -- did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don't kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama's re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democrat Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? Does this stuff makes (sic) your November and 2012 votes more important? "Oh, you weren't aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren't alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren't aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they've never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking." The root of this claim appears to be Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled "Unearned income Medicare contribution." Legislative wonks might remember that this was the second part of the health care bill, passed via reconciliation so that it only required 50 votes. Democrats had to do it that way after they lost their 60-seat majority due to a special election for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. (Republican Scott Brown won the seat that Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democrat, held until his death.) The health care law imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the investment income of couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. That investment income could include income from real estate transactions. But it would only apply to those high earners, who make up less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. We're not sure why the e-mail extrapolates this tax to all real estate transactions, but that's the only 3.8 percent tax we could find in the new law. We ran this by two tax policy experts who confirmed our analysis of the new law. Under current law, workers pay Medicare hospital taxes on wages. Workers and employers split a 2.9 percent tax; the self-employed pay all of it. The new tax marks the first time investment income will be subject to Medicare taxes, said Clint Stretch, the managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP. We should point out that the government currently taxes investment income in various ways and could have simply raised current rates. But lawmakers wanted to link the new revenues to health care, Stretch said. "The point of doing it as a Medicare tax was to have the money go to the Medicare trust fund and have it act like a tax that is paying for health care. So there is additional complexity," he said. And by the way, if you're an empty-nester of any means, and you're thinking of downsizing, part of your profits are already tax-free. There are long-standing tax exemptions on the profits from home sales. In general, if you sell your own home, individuals are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit and married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit. Again, that's profit, not the sales price. If you're wealthy and sell your home at a substantial profit, it's possible you might get hit with the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Most Americans won't have to worry about this, though. Not that our chain e-mail acknowledges any of those pesky facts. It says that a 3.8 percent tax applies to all real estate transactions as a sales tax. That is not the case. The e-mail seems intended to scare people, particularly older Americans, and it urges them to vote a particular way based on false information. And for that, we award this chain e-mail a Pants on Fire! Update: This report has been changed to reflect that there is no wage limit on Medicare hospital taxes. A wage limit of $106,800 applies to Social Security payroll taxes, but not Medicare hospital taxes.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-08-23T15:02:52	2010-08-02	['None']

pomt-07438	Says Texas routinely gets "a lot more federal spending" than it pays in taxes.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/22/rachel-maddow/msnbc-host-rachel-maddow-says-texas-routinely-rece/	After playing a 2009 video clip in which Republican Gov. Rick Perry touts states’ rights, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow suggested secession could hurt the Lone Star state’s bottom line. "Many of these states flexing their 10th Amendment muscle, flexing their state sovereignty, even flirting with secession, states like Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina and Utah, one of these things about the states is that they all routinely get a lot more federal spending than they pay in taxes," she said on the April 12 edition of her weeknight show. A reader brought her comment to our attention. Is Texas really getting more for less? To back up Maddow, MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski pointed us to the most recent state-by-state analysis of federal tax burdens and spending by the Washington-based Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. It covers the 25-year period between 1981 and 2005. According to the analysis, Texans paid about $147 billion in federal taxes in 2005 while the state received $149 billion in federal spending. That year, 33 other states also got, as Maddow put it, more money back than residents paid in. The paid taxes included employment, estate and trust income taxes, among others. Federal spending in Texas includes funding for retirement and disability, grants (such as for research and construction), wages of federal employees and direct payments for programs such as Medicare. On an annual basis, however, there were only six years in that time period when Texas residents paid fewer dollars in federal taxes than they got in return, according to the foundation. And since 2005? For those numbers, Skowronski pointed us to the most recent federal tax data posted by the IRS and federal spending data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In fiscal 2009, the IRS collected about $163 billion from Texans and the state received about $224 billion, for a net gain of $61 billion. Federal spending in Texas also exceeded tax payments in 2008 by $8 billion. It was the other way around in 2006 and 2007, when tax payments by Texans exceeded federal spending by a total of about $47 billion. Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at Austin’s Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for moderate- to low-income Texans, told us Texas started receiving more federal funds in the last decade because of an increase in military spending, tax cuts and tax credits and a modest growth in federal health spending — not to mention a spike in social services and aid every time a hurricane hit. "Texas is definitely getting back way more than people in Texas are paying in taxes," she said. "So do a lot of other states. Texas isn’t unique in that." In 2009, most states — there were 45, including Texas — received more than residents paid in taxes. Though no data is yet available, DeLuna Castro said Texas will again receive more than residents paid in taxes in 2010. But by 2011, when stimulus funds dry up, she speculated that Texas will revert to being a "donor state." Summing up: The figures from our sources show two different trends. On an annual basis between 1981 and 2003, Texas almost always paid more in federal taxes than it got back from Uncle Sam. But since 2003 the reverse has been true, with Texas receiving more than it paid in five out of seven years, which is close to routine. We rate Maddow’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-05420	"After four years of a celebrity president … 85% (of recent college grads are) moving back in with their parents."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/01/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-ad-says-85-percent-recent-coll/	In a provocative campaign ad, American Crossroads, a Republican-aligned group, criticized President Barack Obama for being a "celebrity" who yukked it up with Jimmy Fallon, danced a softshoe with Ellen DeGeneres and dissed Kanye West as a "jackass" -- while the economy crumbled. We zeroed in on one claim in the ad -- that "after four years of a celebrity president … 85% (of recent college grads are) moving back in with their parents." Where the 85 percent figure comes from The ad attributes the claim to a Time magazine story dated May 10, 2011. We found the article in question, which was headlined, "Survey: 85% of New College Grads Move Back in with Mom and Dad." The story begins, "The kids are coming home to roost. Surprise, surprise: Thanks to a high unemployment rate for new grads, many of those with diplomas fresh off the press are making a return to Mom and Dad’s place. In fact, according to a poll conducted by consulting firm Twentysomething Inc., some 85% of graduates will soon remember what Mom’s cooking tastes like." Since the Time story didn’t give any details on the study or give any indication that a reporter had called the firm -- the same was true for the two other media reports that cited the statistic, the New York Post and CNNMoney.com -- we tried to contact Twentysomething Inc. for additional details on the methodology and date of the survey. Twentysomething's website was not much help. There was no news release about the study, and the phone number listed had been disconnected. It appears the site hasn't been updated since 2009. Ultimately, we received a call back from David A. Morrison, the firm’s managing director and founding partner. Morrison said he had closed down his Philadelphia-based firm after about two decades of operation and left the area. He told us the poll had been done for a client "many years ago" but would not release any details about the methodology, citing a binding non-disclosure agreement with the client, whom he would not name. Morrison speculated that his client had leaked the numbers to the media. "These numbers tend to get recycled," Morrison said. He is right about it being recycled. The statistic has been repeated many times on websites and blogs -- twice in the Huffington Post, for instance, and once in the personal finance blog PT Money. It even was picked up by bloggers both liberal (Democratic Underground) and conservative (Free Republic), each with their own political spin. We did not hear back from the author of the Time magazine article. Morrison told us that given the fact the survey was done "many years ago," it was not accurate to use statistic the way the ad did. What’s the actual number? As it happens, there are credible statistics about grads returning home, from a report released March 15, 2012 by the Pew Research Center, titled "The Boomerang Generation: Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad." The report included a survey of 2,048 adults nationwide conducted Dec. 6 to Dec. 19, 2011. Unlike Twentysomething, Pew offered extensive documentation about how it had conducted the poll and what the results were. The report examines the boomerang phenomenon for different demographic groups, but none come close to 85 percent: • Among adults ages 18 to 29, 42 percent of those who have graduated college live with their parents. • Among adults ages 25 to 29 with or without a college degree, 41 percent either live with or moved back in with their parents. • Among adults ages 18 to 34, 24 percent moved back in with their parents in recent years after living on their own, due to economic conditions. • Among parents of adult children, 29 percent report that a child of theirs has moved back in with them in the past few years because of the economy. The Pew report does show modest support for a trend of grads moving back home. It found that in 2010, almost 22 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 lived in a "multigenerational household," up from about 16 percent in 2000; of these, the vast majority were living with their parents. ("Multi-generational households" are defined to include parents living with children 25 and older, or households with three or more generations.) Finally, when we take up a claim in which the speaker seeks to assign credit or blame to a politician for something that happens on their watch, we also consider whether credit or blame is warranted. And as we have ruled in the past, no president can unilaterally move the economy, much less determine whether grads have to move home with Mom and Dad. "There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation told us last month. "If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results." Foster added, "The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point. The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances." So it's a stretch to blame Obama if more grads are returning home. Our ruling The ad cites a questionable survey and suggests the data is new when the author says the survey was "many years ago." Also, the 85 percent figure is at least twice the highest rate found by Pew, a well-respected research group. And the ad blames Obama for a phenomenon that economists say is beyond the impact of a president. We rate the claim False.

"Now, health insurance reform is one of those pillars that we need to build up that new foundation," said President Barack Obama at a town hall in New Hampshire. "I don't have to explain to you that nearly 46 million Americans don't have health insurance coverage today. In the wealthiest nation on Earth, 46 million of our fellow citizens have no coverage. They are just vulnerable. If something happens, they go bankrupt, or they don't get the care they need." The number is important because of the big dollars involved in the health care bill. If the number of uninsured is significantly higher or lower, it could have a major impact on the cost. That 46 million number — which to be exact, is actually 45.7 million — comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which releases estimates of the uninsured yearly. That estimate is for 2007, and the data were released in 2008. (The 2008 data are scheduled for release on Sept. 10, 2009.) The Census Bureau is not the only government agency that collects numbers on the uninsured, but it is often cited because it has the biggest sample, contacting about 97,500 households to ask about their insurance and other factors. The Census Bureau calls these people each spring, and it asks if they were insured at any time during the previous year. They run through a list of questions of all the ways people could have been covered to make sure. If a person had insurance for even one day during the year, they are not counted as uninsured. That seems like a nice, conservative way to measure, but the census number still has a few critics. Researchers have noticed that the census numbers tend to be a bit higher than some of the other government surveys collected for similar time periods. For example, in 2007, a survey from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found the full-year uninsured population to be 40 million, not 45.7 million. The researchers have a suspicion about the reason for the difference: people's bad memories. The Census Bureau calls people and asks them to think back during the past year as to whether they were insured or not. The other survey calls the people back every few months and ask if they're insured at that moment. Looking back to Obama's statement, though, he said nearly 46 million Americans don't have insurance. Actually, the census data include noncitizens. The Census Bureau breaks out that information and reports that 9.7 million of the uninsured are noncitizens. So the number of Americans without insurance is actually closer to 36 million. While we're on this topic, we wanted to also report what we've learned about a popular question from readers: How many of the uninsured are illegal immigrants? None of the government agencies that we're aware of asks people about insurance and about whether they are in the United States legally. The census survey does not ask whether people are in the United States legally or not. Since the government doesn't provide data on uninsured illegal immigrants, we turned to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization that seeks to "improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation." The center does not take positions on policy issues. Jeffrey Passell is the center's senior demographer, and he's used the census data to calculate estimates of illegal immigrants for Pew. He told us that Pew's data indicate that 11.9 million illegal immigrants were in the United States in 2007. About 6.8 million of them did not have health insurance. Pew's model assumed that illegal immigrants are slightly undercounted by the Census Bureau, so the total number of uninsured in the country would be slightly higher than the official census number. The model supposes a total of 46.3 million uninsured, so illegal immigrants would represent close to 15 percent of those without insurance. There are other complicating factors to consider: The children of illegal immigrants born in this country are citizens, and Pew estimates that of those, 1 million are uninsured. Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, "Nearly 46 million Americans don't have health insurance coverage today." That is the most recent number for the U.S. Census available, but he messes it up in one way that would tend to overcount the uninsured and in another way that would tend to undercount them. It's an overcount because it counts noncitizens. Take out the 9.7 million noncitizens and the actual number is closer to 36 million. It's an undercount because it's old data from when the economy was doing much better, and it was for people who were uninsured for a whole year. If you wanted to look at numbers just for "today," the number would likely be higher, but by how much we can't say. (The Department of Health and Human Services survey found that there were 57.7 million uninsured at some point during the first half of 2008, but we couldn't find a breakout for noncitizens.) So Obama is sloppy by saying it is for "Americans" but not accounting for the noncitizens, which leaves him off by about 22 percent. Yet it's likely his error is counterbalanced to some extent by the large number of people who have lost insurance during the recession. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01193	"The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/03/marc-morial/are-deaths-police-shootings-highest-20-years/	The shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by former Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson has sparked national dialogues ranging from the racial makeup of police forces to the militarization of local law enforcement. Another issue up for debate is the use of deadly force by police. On this topic, we heard a noteworthy statistic from National Urban League CEO Marc Morial during an appearance on Fox News Sunday: "The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high." The stat caught our attention, but is it accurate? At first blush, it looked like Morial is on solid ground. He has two good sources for his claim: USA Today and the FBI. But as we dug deeper, we discovered sizeable shortcomings in the data. A spokeswoman for the National Urban League pointed us to the USA Today story. The headline: "Police killings highest in two decades." USA Today reviewed data collected by the FBI for its annual Uniformed Crime Report and a statistic called "justifiable homicide by law enforcement." We looked at the statistics ourselves. In 2013, the latest year on record, there were 458 justifiable homicides involving a firearm. The previous high was in 1994, when 460 were reported. Here’s a graph of justifiable homicides by law enforcement: This would seem to make it a cut-and-dried case. However, as we learned from experts who have studied crime statistics and police-involved shooting, there are significant holes in the FBI data that cast doubts on whether real conclusions can be drawn from the statistics. Even the USA Today story the National Urban League linked us to highlighted many of the inadequacies of the data. Other news outlets have noted the limitations of the FBI statistics as well. Here’s the biggest problem: There is no mandate that local law enforcement agencies report officer involved shootings to the FBI. While 18,000 city, university, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participate in the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, just a small fraction of them willingly provide data on deadly force and justifiable homicides within their departments. Robert Worden, professor at the University of Albany School of Criminal Justice, said "the actual number of such homicides may be as high as double the FBI’s counts." "(Morial’s) claim might be true, but it’s impossible to say with confidence," Worden said. "The consensus among experts is that these data are unsatisfactory, leaving questions about the number of people shot and killed by police in any year and trends in that number over time completely open." David Klinger, a professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said there is no reason to believe the number of agencies that do report are representative of the population, and the number who report may fluctuate from year to year. It’s entirely possible that the reason the number went up from 2012 to 2013 is simply because more police agencies reported their officer-involved shootings than in previous years. Even less definitive conclusions can be drawn from comparing 2013 results to 1994. And there’s no way to extrapolate the FBI figures because there is no benchmark that indicates by how much the information is underreported. We couldn’t even tell if more or fewer police departments were reporting the numbers over the years. A spokesman for the FBI did not get back to us. Klinger said academics and others in the field have publicly questioned these numbers for decades. "I wish people would just admit that the data sucks and they shouldn't be using it for anything other than to say, that’s the baseline number of people who have been reported to be killed by the police in a given year," Klinger said. "To talk about trends against time? No, we don’t know what agencies are coming in and out of reporting and how many are accurately reporting." Are there any other sources for the data? Not really. James McGinty, spokesman for the Police Executive Research Forum, a think tank focused on best practices for law enforcement, said there’s no data that’s conclusive, even for determining basic trend lines. "We certainly think there should be better data on this," McGinty said. The Bureau of Justice Statistics used to track the number of deaths while in police custody, a similar but imperfect number. However, the data only goes from 2003 to 2009 and it appears it has not been updated since. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates deaths in cases of "legal intervention" which includes "injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcing agents, including military on duty, in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances, maintaining order, and other legal actions." However, this is a calculated statistic based on sample surveys and the data only goes back to 1999 anyway. Lorie Fridell, a professor at the University of South Florida Department of Criminology, surveyed most local law enforcement agencies in the country and found the vast majority track the number of officer-involved shootings internally. However, there is no national clearinghouse for the data and mandating reporting to the federal level would be a challenge. "Individual researchers sometimes collect this information from multiple departments, but even those latter efforts do not come close to providing us with reliable national data," Fridell said. Our ruling Morial said, "The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high." Morial was quoting a USA Today analysis based on FBI statistics. In that sense, Morial seemed to have good sources. But digging deeper showed the information is hardly reliable. Only a fraction of law enforcement agencies provide this data to the FBI, and the agencies reporting changes every year. These problems are not new and were in fact noted in the USA Today story he referenced. Normally we would put more stock in FBI statistics. But in this case there are many known problems with the data. We rate the claim Half True	None	Marc Morial	None	None	None	2014-12-03T11:40:11	2014-11-30	['None']

pomt-07166	An iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin could operate for 100 years and generate billion of dollars in economic activity.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/12/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce-says-new-mine/	The heat is on for state lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would allow planning to proceed for a massive iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, the week of June 1, 2011 launched a statewide radio ad campaign pushing for swift approval of legislation that allows mine planning to move forward. The group sees approval of the mine bill as a top priority, said Scott Manley, director of environmental policy. One version of the ad is directed at residents of southeastern Wisconsin, and specifically those represented by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills. She’s one of six Republican and three Democrat state senators facing recall elections this summer. That ad urges listeners to call Darling’s office and ask her to support the "Jobs for Generations Act." The ad says the mine project will create 2,000 jobs initially "and sustain thousands of jobs statewide for years to come." "Over the 100 year life of the mine, it will generate billions of dollars in economic activity, and millions of dollars in tax revenue to pay for schools, libraries, roads, parks and other vital services." WMC’s ad stirs several questions, including what this mine has to do with residents in southeastern Wisconsin, and why Darling is a focus of the ad. There’s also another issue: No legislation has been introduced. More about these below. The ad states that the mine will be open for 100 years, and will be a boon to the state’s economy. Let’s look at the broader impact of the mine, and how realistic it is that it would operate for so long and have such an impact. We’ll set aside for now the considerable environmental concerns that make this project highly controversial. The mine would be located in a remote section of far northern Wisconsin, about 25 miles southeast of Ashland, near the burg of Mellen. The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company based in Florida with operations in Illinois and the Appalachian mountains. The firm holds the rights to mine the iron ore in a 22-mile-long portion of the ore body. The company would dig out the ore, crush it, and use water and magnets to extract the iron and then return the unused material, or tailings, back to the ground. Gogebic wants to speed up the permitting process and eliminate steps that can be used by opponents to create years of delays. They want to condense a five- to seven-year process to 300 days. The key to the project is the massive amount of iron ore believed to be there. Remember: We’re talking about the key component used to make the steel used in the cars and trucks of the future. There are various estimates about the amount of iron ore at the Gogebic site. One estimate by the U.S. Geologic Survey says in excess of 2 billion tons. An earlier estimate said there was 3.7 billion tons. The company is only seeking permission to mine the first phase, a 4.5 mile by 1.5 mile stretch along State Highway 77 east of Mellen. One projection says that the company could process about 8 million tons of ore a year, based on the current demand and prices for steel. That phase would be mined for about 35 years, the company says. At 8 million tons a year, that’s less than 15 percent of the low-end estimated ore deposit. At that rate, it’s going to take a lot longer than 100 years to dig up all of the ore. The WMC’s 100 year claim is based on the 2 billion tons estimate. But the PolitiFact calculator says that at 8 million tons a year, it would take 250 years. WMC’s Manley admitted that the 100 year claim was an estimate that depends "on how quickly you can dig out 2.2 billion tons or iron ore." So the business group’s claim is off by more than a bit. But there’s are problems with their estimate beyond simple math. The permit being sought is for 35 years, in one phase. The company would have to seek another permit - or more than one - for expansion of the mine. "The future of this proposed mine ultimately depends on the economics of the world iron ore market and the future of the domestic iron and steel industry," wrote Bruce A. Brown of the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey in a study about the project.. Gogebic Taconite says that the project would employ about 700 direct mining jobs, and 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Construction of the mine would create 3,000 jobs and have a $2 billion economic impact on the state, according to a study done by Gogebic by economist David Ward of NorthStar Economics. Ward says the ripple effort of the mine’s operation would be $604 million, and produce $17 million in state and local taxes. That effect, too, extends the impact of the mine hundreds of miles, including to southeastern Wisconsin, home to mining equipment makers Joy Global and Bucyrus International. That’s some project. But that’s not what’s before the Legislature. In fact, nothing is before lawmakers right now. And Sen. Darling hasn’t indicated she’s opposed to the project. A draft proposal of the mine law was circulated last month and scheduled for a hearing in a rushed fashion. But then it was pulled back for retooling. The WMC ad isn’t limited to Darling’s district. Similar versions are being aired statewide and in the districts of all six Republican senators who face recall elections. One thing is clear: The mining company (and WMC) want to get the bill approved while the Republicans control both the legislative and executive branches of state government. If the GOP loses the state Senate in the recall elections, the bill could face big delays. So where does that leave us? The state’s largest business group is ramping up the effort on behalf of Gogebic Taconite. They want state law changed so the company can receive speedier consideration -- and presumably approval -- of permits to mine iron ore in northern Wisconsin. Injecting the mine ads into the recall campaigns could lead to a quicker vote; it’s also a move by WMC to link business-friendly Darling to a project that could create many of jobs. If approved, the mine could operate for decades and employ thousands of people. Yet the WMC ads take the extra leap of referring to the mine as having a 100 year life. That’s a leap. Any vote before today’s Legislature would be for the first 35 year phase. Another permit would be required to extend the project’s life. And the 100 year claim is based on current demand for steel. In short, it’s a complete guess. It’s no surprise the state’s largest business group wants to put the best possible spin on a project that will generate heated debate. Surely, the mine could generate an economic boon to numerous parts of the state. But the claim leaves out some critical information -- the permits, details of the legislation, and assumptions of the market for steel decades in the future -- as it makes a sweeping claim about jobs and longevity. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce	None	None	None	2011-06-12T09:00:00	2011-06-12	['Wisconsin']

pomt-01846	"Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/15/michael-eric-dyson/liberal-pundit-claims-teenage-births-cost-texas-ta/	On July 3, 2014, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced that his state has seen a 40 percent drop in teen birth rates since 2009, when Colorado began a program to provide discounted and free contraceptive devices to women. Pundits immediately compared Colorado’s contraceptive program to Texas’ abstinence-only efforts, including Michael Eric Dyson, filling in for Ed Schultz on the July 9 Ed Show. "We should all be taking a page from Colorado when it comes to contraception," Dyson said. "The state saved $42.5 million in health care expenditures associated with teen births in 2010 alone. It’s a stark contrast to the results out of Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry has pushed an abstinence-only education program." Texas, said Dyson, "has the fifth-highest birth rate among teenagers" and "the highest rate of repeat births among teenagers aged 15 to 19. Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone." The discussion around contraceptives often revolves around the rights of the unborn child and the mother, so we were surprised to see such a precise cost attributed to teenage birth. In this fact-check, we’re looking at Dyson’s claim that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in 2010. The source of the claim While we didn’t hear back from Dyson, the statistic he’s referring to comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that researches and advocates for their eponymous cause. According to the National Campaign, teen childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers $9.4 billion, and $1.1 billion of that -- more than any other state -- comes from teen childbearing in Texas. David Wiley, professor of health education at Texas State University, vouched for the National Campaign’s reliability. "They are pretty much the gold standard on research. Their methods are good and they don’t do hyperbole." And even though there’s no perfect way to measure the public cost of teen birth, Denver University professor of sociology Jennifer Reich told us that the National Campaign’s stat is "substantiated by a sizeable amount of data." A press officer from the Texas Department of State Health Services also deemed the National Campaign’s figures credible. So on a basic level, Dyson is right to imply that Texas’ relatively high teen childbearing numbers have a substantial fiscal impact. But the National Campaign’s communications director, Jessica Sheets Pika, cautioned that "Texas’ high cost compared to most states may not be the most meaningful way to measure differences in teen childbearing." "Part of this difference is due to Texas’ relatively high teen birth rate. For example, the teen birth rate in Texas was 52.2 births per 1,000 teen girls in 2010, while it was 33.4 in Colorado. However, much of this difference is simply due to the fact that Texas has a much larger population than most states." It’s also worth noting that Texas’ teenage birth rate has been steadily decreasing, albeit at a slower rate than Colorado’s. Texas’ teenage birth rate for teenagers between 15 and 19 declined by 5 percent from 2011 to 2012, compared to 12 percent in Colorado and 6 percent nationally. Texas’ teenage birth rate remains, though, the fifth-highest in the nation, and three of the experts we contacted suggested that the difficulty of accessing contraceptives in Texas is part of the problem. Drilling down on the $1.1 billion figure Dyson gets the gist of the National Campaign’s research right, but his particular wording misrepresents exactly what goes into their $1.1 billion figure, and where that comes from. The National Campaign gets their public cost estimates by comparing teenage mothers to 20-to-21-year-old mothers on several factors, including the mothers’ and their children’s odds of participating in state and federal welfare programs, the children’s increased chances of incarceration, and the taxable incomes of these women, their children, and their children’s fathers. "Based on this increased risk for participation among teen mothers and the total number of teen births, we then estimate the additional number of participants in various government programs," Pika said. "Then, based on the cost per participant in each of those programs, we then estimate the total cost of teen childbearing." The three factors Dyson names -- health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue -- certainly constitute part of the National Campaign’s measurement, but increased risk of incarceration and social welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are also part of the National Campaign’s full $1.1 billion figure for Texas. Importantly, that cost also isn’t only on the shoulder of Texas taxpayers; the loss in tax revenue and Medicaid costs, for example, are national. The National Campaign’s research more accurately means that Texas teenage births cost taxpayers $1.1 billion (instead of "teenage births" costing "Texas taxpayers," as Dyson phrased it). The National Campaign also is careful to emphasize that their estimate is just that. "It’s useful to keep in mind that this is an estimate," said Pika, "based on the best available research on the consequences of teen childbearing, rather than a dollar-for-dollar accounting of exactly what was spent on teen mothers." To that end, the National Campaign pegs the Texas figure as "at least" $1.1 billion, leaving open the possibility that it could be more. Our ruling In the course of comparing the results of Colorado’s public contraceptives program to Texas’ high teen birth rate and abstinence-only program, Michael Eric Dyson said, "Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone." Dyson’s stat comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, who experts say is a reliable source. But Dyson misrepresents their data in three minor ways: He gives an incomplete list of the components of that cost; he implies that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion when, in fact, births in Texas cost all taxpayers $1.1 billion; and he doesn’t mention that the National Campaign’s stat is a conservative estimate on an issue that’s difficult to quantify. Dyson gets the gist of the statistic right, though he was inartful in his phrasing. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Michael Eric Dyson	None	None	None	2014-07-15T16:17:07	2014-07-09	['Texas']
pomt-02893	Says taxpayer subsidy for the Oregon Convention Center hotel jumped $100 million in closed-door sessions	true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/08/coalition-fair-budget-priorities/did-public-subsidies-oregon-convention-center-hote/	Plans for a large upscale hotel to boost business at the Oregon Convention Center have floated around for years. So has opposition, in part from downtown hotels concerned that any public subsidies could unfairly undercut their businesses. Momentum surged again early last year behind a project calling for a 600-room hotel that would be privately owned and operated. Metro, the regional planning government, asked developers for proposals in February 2012 and spelled out only a relatively small public investment -- a $4 million loan from the Portland Development Commission. "We recognized there were limits to other potential (public) financing tools, and we didn’t know what that number would look like," said Teri Dresler, general manager of Metro’s visitor venues, such as the Oregon Zoo. "We wanted developers to tell us: What are you willing to invest?" Of the two proposals submitted, Metro chose Mortenson/Hyatt’s to move ahead. But opponents remain frustrated, saying they were shut out of what should be a far more open process and what ended up as being a much more lucrative deal. One of the opponents’ claims, published on the website of OUCH -- ("Our Unfortunate Convention Hotel") caught our eye: "Taxpayer subsidy for OCC hotel jumps $100 million in closed-door sessions. $8 million to $130 million with zero public input. OUCH, that hurts." PolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether a $197.5 million project rolled out as minimalist in public investment ended up getting significant subsidies in "closed-door sessions." We called Bashar Wali, president of Provenance Hotels, who belongs to the group fearing that public subsidies could unfairly tip the market toward a new Hyatt Regency. Wali, it should be noted, served on the committee that ultimately recommended that Metro go with Mortenson/Hyatt’s proposal. Early on, he said, the amount of public money committed to the project began rising. It started with the $4 million PDC loan, then doubled to the $8 million cited on OUCH’s website when Metro agreed to chip in a $4 million grant. But almost as soon as Minneapolis-based Mortenson Development was selected to build the hotel, Wali said, three things happened: The committee was disbanded, communication to outsiders stopped, and the public commitment to the project swelled. He cited a $10 million commitment of lottery proceeds approved this year by the Oregon Legislature. Then Metro upped the ante by agreeing to sell $60 million in revenue bonds to aid construction. The total project cost of the bonds, including interest, is $121 million over the 30-year life of the bonds, according to a Metro fact sheet. "And all of the negotiations between Metro and Hyatt have been conducted in secret," said Wali, who belongs to the Coalition for Fair Budget Priorities that opposes the project. "The transparency Metro promised has simply not been there." Metro’s Dresler responded to both of Wali’s main points. Yes, she acknowledged, negotiations between Metro staff and Mortenson/Hyatt team members have been conducted in what OUCH characterized as "closed-door sessions." "But real estate transactions are always conducted that way," she said. "Often, there are trade secrets being discussed, things that companies such as Hyatt want protected until any deal is signed and delivered." She got agreement on that point from Tim Ramis, a Portland attorney whose firm has helped represent downtown hotels opposing the deal. "The negotiation aspect of this is typical to the way these things are usually handled," he said, adding that, "What’s unusual is that the outcome isn’t being disclosed." The amount of public money involved has definitely increased from Metro’s original request for proposals, Dresler said, but that was always a possibility. We tracked the document down. In the "Public Investment and Resources" section, it reads, "Metro and its partners recognize that some level of public investment may be necessary to achieve the type of convention hotel required by this" request for proposals. Among the financing options listed is Metro’s willingness "to consider additional" monetary support and "site-specific transient lodging taxes ‘rebated’ to the project for a period of years." The latter -- more commonly known as room taxes -- are what Metro plans to use to pay off the $60 million in revenue bonds, Dresler said. The figure was chosen, she added, not based on what Mortenson requested but on the gap between construction cost and the revenue consultants said the hotel could generate over the next 30 years. Finally, Dresler said, the $60 million in bonds shouldn’t be regarded as a public subsidy since it will be paid off entirely using money plunked down by conventioneers staying at the new hotel. OUCH’s claim rests on two pillars -- a $100-million jump in taxpayer subsidy in "closed-door sessions." On the first point, all agree that at least $18 million in public money is on the table: a $4 million PDC loan, a $4 million Metro grant and $10 million in Oregon Lottery proceeds. So should the $60 million in revenue bonds be considered a public subsidy? We called Robert Whelan, senior economist at ECONorthwest, who said yes. We also referred to a recent New York Times financial article, in which analysts say such bonds amount to public subsidies because they divert money that could otherwise go toward public projects to help pay for a private project. The ultimate projections dance around a bit, given the 30-year pay-off period at stake, but even Metro agrees that the bond sale will end up requiring about $121 million to satisfy. So we find that OUCH is on the mark in stating that the total public stake involved grew substantially, at least in specifically outlined amounts, from the original request for proposals. All also agree that the negotiations took place behind closed doors. Some opponents think that was improper or unfair, though others agree that real estate negotiations between public agencies and private developers are routinely held in private. But that’s a separate issue. So we also find OUCH accurate on that point. We rate the statement on OUCH’s website True.

pomt-08773	"Taxpayer money will provide iPod Touch devices to high school students in Utah, BlackBerry smart phones to smokers who kick the habit and funding for a study of exotic ants in East Africa."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/24/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-stimulus-money-will-fund-ipods-ut/	Sen. John Cornyn, the junior Republican from Texas, isn't running for re-election this year, but he's sounding a similar tenet as his colleagues squaring off with Democrats: spending bad. In an Aug. 3 press release, Cornyn touted the latest in a series of three stimulus reports by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., crowning 100 projects funded with stimulus money as examples of wasteful spending. "As summer barbecues pop up in backyards across the country, another kind of pork is making its way to a gratuitous study or project near you," Cornyn said. "This new report reveals 100 stimulus-funded pet projects that have failed to create jobs for Americans. Instead, we discover taxpayer money will provide iPod Touch devices to high school students in Utah, Blackberry smart phones to smokers who kick the habit, and funding for a study of exotic ants in East Africa. We wondered about the three projects that Cornyn singles out — but first, a few words about job creation. There are a couple ways to assess the impact of the stimulus bill on employment: counting jobs created directly by the stimulus and counting those created in the broader economy since the stimulus took effect in February 2009. In February 2010, PolitiFact.com rated False a claim by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who said the stimulus "didn't create one job." According to Recovery.gov — the Obama administration's website that tracks the stimulus effort — the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved 634,042 jobs between Feb. 17, 2009, and Sept. 30, 2009, and it funded 595,263 jobs between Oct. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2009. More recently, the stimulus funded 749,142 jobs between April 1 and June 30. The data come from reports filed by the primary recipient of stimulus funds such as state and local governments and private-sector companies. These numbers meld different part-time jobs into "full-time equivalent" jobs, and some of the time periods use different criteria for job counting, due to a change dictated by the Office of Management and Budget in December 2009. So those statistics may overstate the actual number of jobs created. Another take comes from economists who have compared current employment statistics with an estimate of what those employment numbers would have been without the stimulus. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for example, has estimated between 800,000 and 2.4 million jobs have been saved and created. But we digress. Back to the 'pods, berrys and ants. iPod Touch devices to high school students in Utah Through a $1 million federal stimulus Enhancing Education through Technology grant, about 1,600 students at Kearns High School in Utah will receive iPod Touches this school year, in the vein of giving them a laptop without the expense of a computer lab, according to a July 6 article by The Associated Press. The students will download applications to use during lessons, use the iPods to take notes, research online and read their English textbooks. And — according to a July 1 Salt Lake Tribune article — students who graduate will get to keep the device. BlackBerrys for smokers who quit In September 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded about $500,000 to the American Legacy Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that develops programs to address the health effects of tobacco use. Laura Cruzada, a spokeswoman for the foundation, told us it will study 700 low-income smokers who contact the Washington, D.C., Quitline program, 400 of whom will receive smartphones. The phones will enable smokers to access literature online, track their progress in quitting and determine what coping techniques work. While the foundation will use about a third of the stimulus money to purchase the phone plans, Sprint donated the BlackBerry phones. The foundation expects to publish the program's results by fall 2011. Once the study ends, the foundation will stop paying for the plans but participants can continue paying for the phone service themselves. "We're trying to create a free sustainable system that any DC resident can use, so one day someone can download this onto their phone for free," she said. "But we start with a sample and test it out." To the senators' point, the project has resulted in one new full-time job. Exotic ant study Using stimulus money, the National Science Foundation awarded the California Academy of Science about $1.9 million to collect and study ants from Southwest Indian Ocean islands with the goal of discovering evolutionary relationships and capturing "detailed digital images of over 3,000 species of African ants, the vast majority of ant species known from the continent," the foundation said. On recovery.gov, the award is divided among universities. For example, about $276,490 is allotted to the University of California, Davis, where 0.06 of one job was created. Other benefits of the project, according to the science foundation: "A large pool of ant taxonomists will be fostered through student training and support, graduate student recruitment, mentorship, and ant taxonomy workshops." Where does that leave us? On two of the three projects, Cornyn got it mostly right. Through stimulus grants, taxonomists will study ants on islands in the Southwest Indian Ocean and in East Africa, and some 1,600 high school students in Utah will each receive an iPod Touch. What Cornyn didn't mention is that the iPods — better known for playing music and surfing the Internet — are for helping students with school work. Cornyn was less accurate when he said that taxpayer money will provide BlackBerrys to smokers who kick the habit. First, the phones are part of a study — they're not a reward for quitting smoking, as Cornyn suggests. Plus, the phones are free, thanks to Sprint, which is trying to gin up business. It's true, however, that stimulus money will fund the initial purchase of service plans for the phones. We rate Cornyn's statement as Mostly True.

pomt-08963	"Today, we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jul/21/sheila-jackson-lee/sheila-jackson-lee-says-there-are-two-vietnams-nor/	Good morning, Vietnams. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on July 15, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, raised eyebrows when she compared the war in Afghanistan to Vietnam. "I stand here asking us to do what we did not do in Vietnam, (which) was to recognize the valiant and outstanding service of our men and women, and to understand victory had been achieved," she said during the special order speech, which House members can give on any topic at the end of a day's legislative work. "Today, we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working," she said. "We may not agree with all that North Vietnam is doing, but they are living in peace. I would look for a better human rights record for North Vietnam, but they are living side by side." Conservative pundits and bloggers are still lampooning the congresswoman, and Jackson Lee, who earned a bachelor's degree in political science at Yale University and is a member of the House foreign affairs committee, backpedaled. "If there was any reason to raise a point of concern, it was probably because I misspoke and did not add the phrase, after my discussion of North and South Vietnam, that 'the nation was united as one,'" she said in a statement issued the following day. "However, my point is still accurate, and that is that the war between North and South Vietnam is similar to Afghanistan, in that those fighting against each other were Vietnamese and now the country lives as one Vietnam. However, it is South Vietnam that was consumed by North Vietnam and governed by the policies of North Vietnam." The incident is already infamous on Jackson Lee's entry on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, under a section titled "gaffes." Also noted: in 1997, Jackson Lee asked a NASA scientist if the Mars Pathfinder had photographed the flag that Neil Armstrong had planted on the moon. Quick history lesson, compliments of the CIA World Factbook:Under the 1954 Geneva Accords, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. The United States' military presence in South Vietnam grew during the 1960s in an attempt to bolster that government, but armed forces withdrew in following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnam conquered the south, reuniting the two countries under Communist rule. Today, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is home to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Jackson Lee was four decades too late in her reference to two Vietnams. There's just one now, and just one way to rate her statement: False.

pomt-07028	"Voting in the wrong precinct led to over 14,000 registered voters statewide to lose their vote in 2008."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/04/nina-turner/state-sen-nina-turner-says-more-14000-voters-cast-/	An elections reform bill approved in June by the Ohio Senate had plenty of troubling new provisions for critics of the proposal, namely Democrats. The bill contained a number of changes to Ohio’s voting and election procedures, some of which may lead to voter suppression, opponents of House Bill 194 argued before the Republican-controlled Senate passed the bill along party lines. For example, one provision added by the Ohio House barred poll workers from helping voters find their correct precinct for voting if they end up in the wrong place. Current law mandates that poll workers direct voters to their correct voting location. That’s important because casting a ballot in the wrong place means your vote doesn’t count. "Voting in the wrong precinct led to over 14,000 registered voters statewide to lose their vote in 2008," state Sen Nina Turner, a Cleveland Democrat, said during a floor speech on June 22. "But I guess the loss of votes for some doesn’t matter," she sarcastically concluded, suggesting that Republicans were deliberately trying to suppress valid ballots in urban and impoverished areas of the state where mixing up precincts most often occurs. It’s a powerful charge. And one can see Turner’s concern for those who are legitimately confused as to where they are suppose to vote. But Politifact Ohio wanted to know if there really were more than 14,000 ballots thrown out during the November 2008 elections — a presidential election, making it more significant — as she claimed. First, it needs to be noted that bills are ever-changing before they become a finished product, and so, too, was this one. The House added the provision blocking poll workers from helping voters, an idea that was not supported by Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. House Republicans said they were merely trying to protect poll workers and county boards of election from being legally liable for giving voters wrong information that might lead to a ballot not being counted. But the time the bill received final passage, that provision was removed. So to, though, was another mandate. "As the bill now stands there is no strict prohibition on them directing voters to their correct precinct and there’s no mandate that they do, either," explained Maggie Ostrowski, a spokeswoman for Husted. That still concerns Turner and other opponents of the bill — which will soon become law — because it removes the mandate for poll workers to help. But, what about the figure Turner quoted? Turner cited information supplied by the secretary of state’s office. Former Secretary Jennifer Brunner compiled a report for the governor, legislature and state residents compiling statistics and analysis of how well the state’s election process worked. It is a routine report following major elections. Provisional ballots are required when a person shows up to vote but does not have the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter. Poll workers then allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until their identity is proven and at that point the ballot will be counted. According to the secretary’s report, there were 206,859 provisional ballots cast during the November 2008 election. But 39,989 of those ballots were not counted for a number of reasons, most commonly because the person casting the ballot was not registered to vote in the state of Ohio. But the second most common reason the ballot was not counted was because while the person was properly registered to vote in Ohio, they cast the ballot in the wrong county or precinct. In all, 14,335 such ballots were not counted for this reason, according to the Brunner report. Of those 14,000-plus ballots, 3,423 were cast in Cuyahoga County, home to Turner’s district and by far the county with the most uncounted provisional ballots during the November 2008 elections due to wrong place filings. The irony here, given Turner’s fight to get poll workers to assist voters, is that the casting of provisional ballots in the wrong place is most often the fault of the poll workers themselves — not voters. A voter cannot get a provisional ballot unless given one by a poll worker. Remember, under current law, the law in place in November 2008, poll workers were mandated to get voters to the right location even if they are voting provisionally. Ostrowski noted that it is not always poll workers fault because sometimes voters insist they are in the right location and demand a provisional ballot. Regardless, data from the secretary of state’s office supports Turner’s claim. In the November 2008 election ballots from more than 14,000 registered voters weren’t counted because they were cast in the wrong place. Her claim is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Turner’s statement as True.	None	Nina Turner	None	None	None	2011-07-04T06:00:00	2011-06-22	['None']
pomt-11637	"Fifty percent of our new" Texas "teachers don’t have college degrees."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jan/17/andrew-white/andrew-white-says-half-new-teachers-lack-degrees-c/	Andrew White, a Democratic candidate for Texas governor who’s called for $5,000 pay raises for public school teachers, declared that half of the state’s newest teachers lack college degrees. White, a Houston investor, said, "I know this: One way to fix education is to pay teachers more, so that we can attract the best teachers and keep the best teachers. So, we have a problem in this area right now. Fifty percent of our new teachers don’t have college degrees. Right?" Not right, according to information we obtained from the Texas Education Agency, though figures backed up an alternate claim we fielded from White’s campaign. After a reader brought White's claim to our attention, White's campaign spokeswoman, Desi Canela, told us that White misspoke in the Jan. 11, 2018, public interview with Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune. By phone, Canela said that White, drawing on information from a teacher advocacy group, had intended to stress the increased rarity of newly certified teachers in the state having bachelor’s degrees in education. Canela said that White, whose late father, Gov. Mark White, shepherded into law a 1984 overhaul of state education laws, "wants to mandate a uniform pathway to be certified to teach" including, as a "good first step," a focus on educators majoring in education. Let’s cover whether incoming teachers have college degrees, then turn to the alternate statement. Teachers without degrees? TEA spokeswoman Lauren Callahan told us by email that, with minor exceptions, state law requires anyone seeking a state teaching certificate to have a bachelor’s degree. Also by law, Callahan wrote, almost all teachers in open-enrollment charter schools must hold bachelor’s degrees. Callahan said that of "over 25,000 newly certified Texas teachers in 2015-16, a maximum of 1.5 percent could’ve been certified without a baccalaureate degree." She added: "It’s likely the number would’ve been less." The agency reached the 1.5 percent estimate, Callahan said, by comparing the 382 individuals newly certified in the two school subjects that don’t require a teacher to hold a bachelor’s degree—"health science technology" and "trade and industrial workforce training" -- with the 25,451 total newly certified teachers for that year. Alternate claim Canela told us White had intended to echo a claim specific to education degrees included in a candidate questionnaire he’d fielded from the Texas State Teachers Association, an affiliate of the National Education Association that advocates for teacher-members. Canela emailed us a photo of part of the questionnaire, which says in part: "A majority of incoming teachers no longer graduate from college with education degrees; they are certified via ‘alternate certification’ programs.’ Some have suggested that reducing the standards for becoming a certified teacher could alleviate the teacher shortage." The questionnaire then asks if the candidate is for or against reducing teacher certification standards. To our request for elaboration, TSTA’s Clay Robison emailed us a document, attributed to the State Board for Educator Certification, which oversees the preparation, certification and standards of conduct for Texas public school teachers. The document, dated March 2017, breaks out the ways that new Texas teaching certificates were earned from 2011-12 through 2015-16. In the latter year, the document says, 12,553 individuals gained certificates by taking an alternate route while 8,366 did so by meeting state requirements through an undergraduate program. That makes for a 60-40 split between teachers certified by alternative means and those who went through undergraduate programs though if you also consider individuals certified by coming from out of state or attaining advanced degrees, then people certified via the alternate route comprised 49 percent of newly certified teachers. By email, we drew more recent figures from the TEA’s Callahan indicating that 33 percent of the state’s 32,795 newly certified teachers in 2016-17 were certified through undergraduate education programs--with 52 percent succeeding via alternative certification. Our ruling White said 50 percent "of our new" Texas "teachers don’t have college degrees." In fact, very few newly certified teachers lack college degrees. White's camp told us he meant to refer to teachers who don't get certified through undergraduate education programs. We rate what he said False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01381	"3,000 teachers lost their jobs when (Crist) was governor."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/15/rick-scott/scott-says-3000-teachers-lost-jobs-under-crist/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott is a fan of attacking former Gov. Charlie Crist’s record on jobs. At an Oct. 15 debate between the candidates -- the second debate of the campaign -- Scott repeatedly said 832,000 Florida jobs were lost during Crist’s term. (We’ve previously rated that claim Half True.) Crist swatted away Scott’s critique, arguing that the recession was to blame for those job losses. He said he took federal stimulus money that "helped us make sure we didn’t have to fire 20,000 school teachers." (We’ve rated that claim Mostly True.) Scott retorted by saying Crist was responsible for killing thousands of teacher jobs as he focused his attention on other career opportunities. "He spent all his time trying to be vice president and then running against Marco Rubio for the Senate," Scott said. "3,000 teachers lost their jobs when Charlie was governor." When Scott used the same statistic in a June ad, we rated it Mostly False. Here, we will review the evidence on whether 3,000 teachers were laid off under Crist and, if so, whether he was to blame. How Florida cut education during the recession In the years leading up to Crist winning the governor’s office in 2006, the Florida economy was booming, pushing up funding for education. The K-12 budget when Crist took office was nearly $18 billion, including state and local dollars. But in 2007, Florida’s tax collections sagged as the national and state economy crumbled. The Legislature held a special session in September to determine how to fill a $1.1 billion hole in the $71 billion state budget. Education and health care, two of the largest expenses, ended up taking huge hits. In 2008, the state continued to suffer from a recession, and that led to more cuts. Republican leaders rejected Crist’s call to expand Lottery games and a property tax hike to pay for schools. Ultimately, lawmakers cut K-12 by more than $300 million. Democrats, the minority party in Tallahassee, and the teachers’ union opposed the cuts. "We all want to do more," said Crist, a Republican at the time, at the end of the session. "You just do the best you can." Amid shortfalls, the Legislature continued to slash the budget in 2009. But then the state got some help from the federal government. In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- the $787 billion federal stimulus bill that supporters credit with saving jobs of teachers and other government workers nationwide. Crist accepted the funds, and state data indicated that about 19,000 full-time equivalent jobs for instructional personnel were preserved. Republicans cite report for teacher layoff numbers The ad attacking Crist for 3,000 teacher layoffs relies on a September 2009 report by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that tallied jobs shed from state and local governments during the recession. The report includes a list that shows the lost teacher jobs in Florida added up to about 3,700. Here’s the problem with the way the ad uses that report: It doesn’t explain that it was based on news articles about layoffs or potential layoffs. The report explains that caveat clearly: "This list shows press accounts of government planned job cuts. In some cases, the cuts may not have actually been implemented because of subsequent budget adjustments. Also, the job losses may have been met through attrition rather than actual layoffs." For example, one article cited in the report stated that Miami-Dade, the state’s largest district, "cut nearly 1,000 teaching positions." But the Miami Herald reported that many teachers were moved into other jobs, and a district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that no teacher was laid off. Broward initially cut about 400 teachers, but rehired about 75 percent of them. While Marion County announced it would cut about 500 workers, the stimulus "saved us from having to lay a single person off in 2008 or 2009," a school district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida. Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties -- none of which were cited in the report -- didn’t lay off any teachers. (The report only addressed about 15 percent of Florida’s school districts.) School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data showed 3,282 fewer teachers in the fall of 2008 compared to 2007 -- roughly a 2 percent decline. There was a smaller drop the next year. It’s fair to assume that some of those declines were due to layoffs. However, the districts don’t say how many of the declines were due to layoffs and how many were for other reasons, such as retirements, voluntary career changes or firings for cause. "There were some layoffs during the steep downhill dive of the state economy, but there was a strong effort in school districts to avoid teacher layoffs," said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. In some districts that meant other support workers -- such as custodians or bus drivers -- absorbed the bulk of the layoffs, she said. Our ruling Scott said that "3,000 teachers lost their jobs when Charlie was governor." The claim omits some key points. The number was derived from media reports about possible layoffs; not all of them materialized. Also, the claim glosses over the fact that Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs. Finally, Crist was not solely responsible for teacher layoffs. Crist and the Republican-led Legislature signed off on budget cuts amid a national recession -- something no single politician is personally responsible for. Clearly, some teachers were laid off statewide, but there's a lack of evidence that it amounted to 3,000 positions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11259	"Alabama is operating government on the lowest amount of tax revenue of any state in the nation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/01/sue-bell-cobb/alabama-lowest-state-local-tax-revenue-capita/	Democratic candidate Sue Bell Cobb made a bold claim about the poor state of Alabama’s budget at the governor’s debate on April 24, 2018. Cobb, former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, was responding to a moderator’s question about whether she would consider raising taxes. Cobb said she would present the Legislature "a modest but adequate increase in our fuel tax" to repair the state’s crumbling infrastructure. The reason? "Alabama is operating government on the lowest amount of tax revenue of any state in the nation, which is why we’re lagging behind our sister southern states," she said. Our fact-checker ears perk up with superlatives like this one. For this fact-check, we wanted to answer whether Alabama has the lowest amount of tax revenue in the United States. We found it does. Alabama ranks 51st out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local tax collections per capita. In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which Census data was available, Alabama collected $3,141 per capita. "You’ll notice that Alabama comes in dead last in total per-capita tax collections," said Cobb campaign manager Landon Nichols. The highest? The District of Columbia at $10,605 per capita. Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, doubted rankings would change much with 2017 numbers. He agreed with the per-capita measurement for state-by-state comparisons. Alabama ranks toward the bottom by other revenue measurements, too. When you count only state taxes, Alabama ranks 41st with $2,041 per capita. That was in fiscal year 2016. Taxes aren’t the only way states raise revenue. In terms of own-source revenue — which includes highway tolls, state university tuition, public hospital payments and other fees and transfers in addition to taxes raised by Alabama — the state ranks 44th. And when we looked at the gas tax, which Cobb suggested raising, Alabama ranks 37th, according to the Tax Foundation. In a 2016 study, the Tax Policy Institute found Alabama’s total tax revenue is below average. The reason is a combination of low wealth levels and relatively low taxes. By household median income, Alabama ranks 46th. While Alabama has a low top-income tax rate, sales taxes are relatively high. As Cobb suggested, total tax revenue falls short. The Tax Policy Institute study found that to fund spending programs following national averages, Alabama would need $9,092 per capita. Our ruling Cobb said, "Alabama is operating government on the lowest amount of tax revenue of any state in the nation, which is why we’re lagging behind our sister southern states."

pomt-04782	The price of gasoline was at $1.85 a gallon when President Barack Obama took office and has since nearly doubled because of his policies	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/24/billboard/billboard-blames-obama-high-gas-prices/	There are few expenses that hit drivers and businesses harder in the wallet than high gas prices. So it caught our attention when a new billboard went up in Milwaukee reminding us of the good old days, when gas was below $2 a gallon. But the billboard, on 35th St. visible, from westbound Interstate 94, is more than a trip down memory lane. It links high gas prices to the administration of President Barack Obama. This is how it reads: "Gas $1.85. Obama took office. Tight drilling regulations. No pipeline. Obama=Higher Gas." There’s a smiley face, and the tagline: "Authorized and paid for by WI Business Owner." Higher gas prices are a familiar complaint of Obama critics. A series of ratings on gas prices can be seen on the national PolitiFact site. The local message went up on a single billboard during the last week of July, said Mark Rausch, vice president for real estate for Clear Channel Outdoor, the billboard owner. The company charges $6,100 a month for the sign. Rausch put us in touch with the sponsor of the message, Bret Eulberg, owner of Robert Haack Diamonds, which has stores in Greenfield and Glendale. (There is nothing on the billboard to link the business to the political message.) Eulberg said customers complain a lot about gas prices, so much so that he gives a $10 gas card to those who sell their gold items to his store. "I believe the administration has control over the price of oil," Eulberg said. He noted it may be better for the environment if people drive less, but it hurts the economy if businesses and consumers have to spend more on gasoline. There are really two parts to the billboard’s claim -- the price when Obama took over and that the president is to blame for the increase. Gas prices According to AAA, the price of a gallon of gas in Milwaukee was $1.97 on Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was sworn in. Nationally it was $1.84, and the Wisconsin average was $1.95. (In contrast, on Aug. 15, 2012, prices were about $3.95 a gallon in Milwaukee, AAA says.) So Eulberg’s claim on the price is on target. And, he notes, gas was even cheaper in the weeks around the time of the November 2008 presidential election when it dipped to around $1.75 a gallon. Obama’s role But is Obama responsible for the pain at the pump? This is where things get more problematic. We evaluated a similar claim from Eric Hovde, then a candidate in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate on May 4, 2012. Hovde claimed that the economic policies of Obama and Congress and actions of the Federal Reserve are to blame for high gas prices because they led to a devaluation of the dollar. We rated his claim Mostly False, because experts say the devalued dollar has only a small impact on how much we pay for gas. Obama has taken steps to hold up the Keystone pipeline -- as referenced on the billboard -- which would bring oil from the tar sands in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. But have those policies led to higher gas prices? Let’s start with prices in the fall of 2008, when prices were especially low. Gas and crude oil prices crashed along with the financial markets that fall, said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst, Oil Price Information Service. Oil prices fell from a national average high of $4.11 in July 2008 to a low of $1.61 on Dec. 30 of that year. "Oil fell with the financial markets -- there was a massive deleveraging across all asset classes in the second half of 2008 and in much of 2009," Kloza said. He and other experts say that oil prices are set on global markets and there’s little that the president can do to sway them. He also said there’s been a sharp increase in North American crude oil production. "I don’t think President Obama can take credit for the explosion in North American crude or natural gas output (which is largely a function of price and technology), but he cannot be blamed for high global crude oil, and by extension, high diesel and gasoline prices within the U.S.," Kloza said. The price of oil and, in turn gasoline, is determined by international markets and the amount of domestic consumption has little effect. Booming global demand, especially from China, and tension in the Mideast, are far greater factors. As for the pipleline, that project wouldn’t be completed for years, and it’s impact on today’s oil markets would be minimal. Our rating A billboard sponsored by a local business owner notes that the price of gasoline was much lower when Obama took office -- $1.85 a gallon. That’s about right. But experts say the president and his policies have little effect on the prices. Demand is skyrocketing in China, and that pushes up prices. There’s been ongoing turmoil in the Mideast. And locally, there have been supply disruptions that have all pushed prices higher. None of these were tied to Obama’s policies. The blanket claim that Obama is responsible for gas prices doubling gets one part correct: the unusually low price at the start of his administration. The broader claim that Obama is to blame is off base. The statement contains some elements of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition for Mostly False.	None	Billboard	None	None	None	2012-08-24T09:00:00	2012-07-23	['None']

pomt-08036	"Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/05/john-kasich/ohio-gov-elect-john-kasichs-claim-population-losse/	Gov.-elect John Kasich likes to underscore his statements with a strong, sometimes sensational, anecdote to drive home his points. At a recent news conference, the incoming Republican leader stressed the urgency for his administration to come in and work quickly to jump start Ohio’s economy to, as he claims, stem the state’s declining population as more people give up on the Buckeye state and choose to live elsewhere. "I just read the other day that Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two," Kasich told reporters Dec. 14. "So, people exiting the state, gosh, it’s a terrible situation." Kasich isn’t sure where he picked up that tidbit of information. PolitiFact Ohio isn’t either, because it sounded new to us. Has Ohio really has lost more of its population than 47 other states? Over what time period? So we decided to take a look. According to the U.S. Census Bureau official state counts for the Census 2010, released on Dec. 21, only one state lost population from April 2000 to April 2010 and it wasn’t Ohio — it was our neighbors to the north, Michigan. But maybe Kasich flubbed his words and meant Ohio’s population grew more slowly than every other state but two. That would be closer to the truth. Ohio’s population grew 1.6 percent over the decade to just over 11.5 million people, according to the census figures. Only Louisiana at 1.4 percent and Rhode Island at 0.4 percent grew at a more sluggish pace. Michigan’s population dropped 0.6 percent. That would leave Ohio ranked 47th over the past decade in population growth. Or, maybe the governor-elect was talking about some previous census figures. The census bureau had routinely put out annual estimates and other projections prior to issuing its official data drop in mid-December. But even by earlier estimates and projections, Ohio did not lose population but gained more people, albeit at a much slower pace than most of the rest of the country. Kasich is correct to be concerned. While Ohio’s overall population is still seventh-highest in the country, the state’s slower pace of growth could also directly affect the pace at which Ohio’s struggling economy recovers. Another concern is that while Ohio hasn’t lost population, other states are gaining new residents faster. The most immediate consequence of that for the state is a loss of clout in Washington, where Ohio will lose two of its 18 congressional seats and have fewer electoral college votes for presidential elections due to the population trends. We offered the governor-elect the benefit the doubt, but from any angle you look at it, Ohio did not lose population from this year over last, or in 2009 from 2008, or this year compared to 2000. On this one, Kasich doesn’t need sensational talk to highlight a problematic issue. We rate Kasich’s statement False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-01-05T06:00:00	2010-12-14	['Ohio']
pomt-01955	Wisconsin was the "first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/22/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-wisconsin-was-first-state-ban-empl/	When the White House announced that President Barack Obama would sign an order barring federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan hailed the move. But Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, thinks a federal law is needed -- one that covers all workers. "Only 21 states have made it illegal to fire or harass someone based on sexual orientation, or to deny a raise or refuse to hire on that same basis," Pocan wrote in a June 16, 2014 press statement. He added: "Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue, becoming the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982." In the wake of a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb declaring Wisconsin’s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, we’ve seen that claim about the state’s pioneering role pop up a lot recently. We wondered whether a state that voted in 2006 to ban gay marriages was the first to outlaw job discrimination against gays and lesbians. A look at the history Wisconsin has a history of "firsts" on fair employment and worker protection laws dating to early in the 20th century. The state was first on injured worker’s compensation (1911), outlawing legal discrimination against women (1919), unemployment compensation (1932), and protections for handicapped persons (1965), according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. Many cities in the 1970s and early ‘80s, including Milwaukee, enacted local bans on workplace discrimination against gay people at the municipal level. In 1975, Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp, a Democrat, issued the first statewide executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It applied only to state employees. In Wisconsin, Rep. David Clarenbach, a young Democrat from Madison, had spent several years pushing what even gay-rights advocates called a too-radical bill to legalize same-sex marriage, legalize prostitution, lower the age of consent to 14 and legalize consensual sex among unmarried adults. It went nowhere. Then in 1981, Clarenbach introduced an anti-discrimination measure. Unlike the municipal laws and the Pennsylvania statute, it applied to the private sector as well as public workers statewide. Clarenbach framed it as fairness and human rights issue, as recounted in William B. Turner’s "The Gay Rights State: Wisconsin’s Pioneering Legislation to Prohibit Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation." "The point is not whether homosexuality is admirable, but whether discrimination is tolerable," Clarenbach said during the debate. The bill squeaked through the Assembly by four votes in 1981; Democrats dominated the majority, though it was Republican votes that helped put it over the top. Critics said it could lead to affirmative action advantages for lesbians and gay men. Republican Gov. Lee Dreyfus and others insisted on language banning such affirmative action, and the bill cleared the Senate in early 1982. Many mainstream religious denominations backed the overall bill, Dreyfus noted at the time. Fundamentalist Christian radio listeners mounted a campaign to pressure Dreyfus into a veto, but the governor signed what was termed Chapter 112 into law on Feb. 25, 1982. "I have decided to sign this bill for one basic reason, to protect one's right to privacy," Dreyfus said in his signing statement. "As one who believes in the fundamental Republican principle that government should have a very restricted involvement in people's private and personal lives, I feel strongly about governmentally sanctioned inquiry into an individual's thoughts, beliefs and feelings." He added: "Discrimination on sexual preference, if allowed, clearly must allow inquiries into one's private life that go beyond reasonable inquiry and in fact invade one's privacy." Republican Tommy Thompson, who later served as governor, was minority leader in the state Assembly during the 1982 debate. Clarenbach later remarked that Thompson opposed the anti-discrimination bill but nonetheless kept it alive by declining to smother it in amendments, according to Turner. States followed suit The result was a law that banned discrimination against gays not only in employment but housing and public accommodations as well. Wisconsin was first, and it would be seven years before Massachusetts followed suit. Today, 21 states have such employment measures, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and other sources. Most were enacted from 1991 to 2002. Those states are clustered in three regions: West (Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico); the upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois); and East ( Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland). Hawaii is the other. Of the states on the list, Wisconsin is one of three that does not cover gender identity in its law. That leaves transgender people out of the law, something Pocan and Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin hope to remedy through the proposed Employer Non-Discrimination Act. Pocan, who is gay, won the congressional seat formerly held by Baldwin, who became the Senate’s first openly gay member in 2012. That bill would make discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender illegal in all 50 states. It passed the U.S. Senate in November 2013 on a 64-32 vote but has not cleared the Republican-controlled House. Our rating Pocan claimed Wisconsin was the "first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation." The history books say he is correct. While some municipalities did so earlier, and Pennsylvania did so for public workers only, Wisconsin’s 1982 law was statewide and covered all employees. We rate Pocan’s claim True.

pomt-07940	The federal government "now tells us which light bulbs to buy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-government-tells-us-what-lig/	Rep. Michele Bachmann said we've spent a lot of money over the past few years, but we don't have much to show for it. Bachmann gave a response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on behalf of two tea party groups. "Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill," Bachmann said in her January 25, 2010 response to the State of the Union, delivered at the request of the Tea Party Express and Tea Party HD. Bachmann is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Minnesota. Her statement caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. Here, we'll look at her claim about light bulbs. We'll look at her statement about IRS agents in a separate item. We've looked into light bulbs before, when PolitiFact Texas examined a similar statement by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. What our Texas colleagues found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen) and fluorescent lamps, according to a 2007 report from the Congressional Research Service. In June 2009, Obama announced more changes for lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use. PolitiFact Texas also found a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial said the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb "on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly." Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, "bureaucratic rules will phase in," and conventional 100-watt bulbs "will be first on the contraband list." Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told PolitiFact Texas in November that conventional incandescent bulbs as currently manufactured are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set. However, the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards, or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013, and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014. Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. "Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb," Stutsman said. Finally, PolitiFact Texas talked with the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulbs to buy. "Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy, but that's an interpretation -- especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement," McGowan said. "There will still be household light bulbs available," McGowan's e-mail said, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. "One thing is for sure, what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought -- and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do." So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use? Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements, and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Bachmann's statement an element of truth -- but not much more. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-01-26T18:46:55	2011-01-25	['None']

pomt-11879	Says Patrick Morrisey "ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/30/evan-jenkins/did-patrick-morrisey-once-support-abortion-rights/	In the West Virginia primaries for U.S. Senate, the Republican candidates are lobbing accusations of being insufficiently conservative. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey first attacked his opponent, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., on Twitter for being a political opportunist due to changes in his party affiliation. Morrisey and Jenkins are competing for the GOP nomindation to challenge Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat. "GOP, then Dem for 20 years, then Jenkins becomes a rank political opportunist and joins GOP. Jenkins stands for nothing but himself," Morrisey tweeted. Jenkins responded by accusing Morrisey of supporting abortion rights in a 2000 race for U.S. Congress in New Jersey. (Morrisey moved to West Virginia in 2006.) "Guy who ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice and just took $100k in pill money," Jenkins said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Both candidates have received endorsements from anti-abortion groups in recent years, and Morrisey received the endorsement from West Virginians for Life this year. So is it accurate that Morrisey advocated for abortion rights in a race to represent New Jersey’s 7th District? Not exactly. Morrisey clearly opposes abortion. Jenkins’ claim essentially boils down to Morrisey not having opposed it enough in 2000. When we asked Jenkins’ campaign for evidence, they directed us to the following line in a May 15, 2000, AP story about the GOP primary race between Mike Ferguson and Morrisey: "Ferguson has the support of state and national anti-abortion organizations and says he would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The other abortion opponent in the field, Morrisey, says he would not support such an amendment," the story said. "While Ferguson and Morrisey are against abortion, and (Tom) Kean favors abortion rights, (Joel) Weingarten says only that lawmakers should respect ‘current constitutional strictures’ by not trying to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion," the story went on to say. So the same article that Jenkins says shows Morrisey supported abortion rights also referred to him twice as an abortion opponent. The only other evidence the Jenkins campaign provided for his claim was an April 2000 news article in which Morrisey and Weingarten accused Ferguson of conducting a push poll in which Morrisey was portrayed as an abortion rights advocate. "(Morrisey) also said he is ProLife and not ProChoice on the abortion issue as he said was indicated in the Ferguson campaign poll," the story said. The Westfield Leader wrote of Morrisey’s abortion stance two months later: "The candidate said he is pro-life on the abortion issue, with exceptions for rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is in danger. He opposes partial birth abortion." Wanda Franz, the president of West Virginians for Life, which endorsed Morrisey for Senate, called Jenkins’ accusation inaccurate. Franz emphasized that Morrisey had been fighting against abortion since the 1990s as a lawyer on Capitol Hill. (Morrisey served as Counsel to the House Commerce Committee under Republican leadership.) "Both of the pro-life candidates were pro-life, that’s what it said in the article," Franz said. "Simply the difference had to do with the Human Life Amendment as a constitutional effort." Human life amendment The human life amendment is a pretty broad term encompassing not one but several proposals to amend the Constitution to effectively overturn Roe vs. Wade. Most of the proposed amendments define personhood as starting at fertilization or conception, which poses a problem to some who believe abortion should be permitted in certain cases. "A Constitutional Human Life Amendment is the only practical action we can take to broadly prohibit abortion and permanently protect unborn human life," said Andy Sere, Jenkins’ spokesman. "If a candidate for Congress says he would not support the only way to do that, then that is a pro-choice position — no matter if that politician would like to be labeled pro-choice or not." Just to be clear, Morrisey sent a letter to the West Virginia GOP that said he would "strongly support" a constitutional amendment in the U.S. Senate to overturn Roe vs. Wade. "For my entire career, I have been opposed to that horrific decision," Morrisey wrote. So what about his stance in 2000? Morrisey’s campaign did not recall the reason for Morrisey’s opposition to a constitutional amendment in 2000. We were unable to gather the specifics of the amendment Morrisey opposed. "Mike Ferguson was pro-life, no exceptions, and all the articles about Morrisey had some exceptions in the case of rape or incest," said Nachama Soloveichik, Morrisey’s spokeswoman. "It’s possible they were talking about some specific amendment that didn’t have exceptions." Charles Camosy, author of Beyond the Abortion Wars and theology professor at Fordham University, explained this was a common reason for opposition to the amendment. Larry Arnold, the author of the AP article in question, said Morrisey’s position on the amendment likely came from Morrisey’s campaign website, which the Wayback Machine showed included a link to a position paper on partial birth abortion. (We were unable to track down the paper.) There’s also the chance Morrisey opposed the amendment for other reasons, like believing it was not the most effective way to push the anti-abortion agenda or that it was a decision that should be left to the states. Franz said that either way, opposition to the amendment by itself wouldn’t have meant he supported access to abortion in most cases, as the practicality of a constitutional amendment has long been contested even among people pushing for abortion restrictions. "We have not thought of the human life amendment as a viable option for decades," Franz said. "We don’t have it on our candidate questionnaires. It isn’t an issue for us anymore because we have other strategies." The Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group, is not focused on pushing the amendment, Camosy explained, whereas other groups such as the American Life League and the Human Life Action Center still consider it a long-term goal of the anti-abortion movement. The National Pro-Life Alliance includes the issue on their candidate questionnaire. "There are various paths to providing legal protection for unborn children," said Carol Tobias, a spokeswoman for National Right to Life. "A constitutional amendment is one. Another would be for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, followed by action at the state level to enact pro-life measures." In other words, the importance of the amendment is contested among anti-abortion groups, but Carmosy agreed that equating opposition to an amendment — no matter the reason — to supporting abortion rights was unfair. He proposed the example of the LGBT rights movement in the 1990s. "Was someone who, back then, was arguing only for civil unions and not a constitutional amendment about marriage not a genuine LGBT ally?" Camosy said. "That's ridiculous. It was a difference in political strategy." Our ruling Jenkins said Morrisey "ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice." We found no evidence Morrisey supported abortion rights during a New Jersey congressional race in 2000. Morrisey opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the woman’s life is in danger. The Jenkins campaign cited a 2000 AP story that said Morrisey was opposed to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, one of the more extreme tactics among those who oppose abortion. However, experts and anti-abortion groups told us that opposition to the amendment would not have made Morrisey an abortion rights advocate. We rate this statement False. Correction: This report initially said that both candidates had received endorsements from an anti-abortion group this year. We have corrected it to note that both candidates have received endorsements in recent years.

Through Feb. 29, 2008, Obama raised $184-million, compared with Clinton's $129-million and McCain's $55-million, according to an analysis by the Campaign Finance Institute based on public filings. Much of Obama's money has come from small donors. (See a statement we checked earlier about Obama's small donors here .) About 41 percent has come from individual donors giving increments of $200 or less, according to the institute's analysis. (Compare that with Clinton at 26 percent and McCain at 13 percent.) Obama has touted those small donors as evidence that his candidacy is changing traditional models of campaign finance. "We have created a parallel public financing system where the American people decide if they want to support a campaign they can get on the Internet and finance it,'' Obama said at a fundraiser on April 8, 2008, in Washington, D.C. "And they will have as much access and influence over the course and direction of our campaign that has traditionally reserved for the wealthy and the powerful." His claim that he's created a "parallel public financing system" might be a harmless boast, except that Obama's views on public financing have been a matter of significant debate. Early in his campaign he had said he would use the public financing system in his run for president, but after he took off as a candidate and fundraiser, his statements about that have been less clear. His fundraising skill has made it likely that he could raise more money for his campaign than would be available to him through the public financing system. (We covered whether Obama promised to get public financing or not here .) So, when Obama says he's running the equivalent of a publicly financed campaign, that's a statement worth checking. First, a brief explanation of public financing: In the primary election, candidates who choose to take public financing agree to spending limits on a state-by-state basis and then receive money from the government that matches the small donations they receive. In the general election, public financing gives the major party candidates about $84.1-million in public money to spend however they like. There is no required match for the candidates to raise. But once the money is spent, that's it for the candidates' campaigns. It's important to remember that the above rules apply only to the presidential candidates' campaigns. The parties and outside groups are also spending money separately; and different rules apply to these groups. The public financing system was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal as a means of diminishing the role of money in politics. But it appears to be breaking down: The first candidate to opt out of public financing for the primaries was John B. Connally in 1980. In 2004, George W. Bush, John Kerry and Howard Dean opted out. In fact, taking public money for primaries is now a sign of weakness: In early 2008 when John Edwards decided to take public financing, critics said it showed he couldn't compete with Clinton and Obama's fundraising. The general election has been another matter, however. No general election candidate has opted out of public financing since the current system started. It remains to be seen whether the eventual Democratic candidate will opt out or not. If Obama secures the nomination, it seems likely that his army of small donors could propel him over the $84.1-million mark. So does a robust network of small donors constitute a "parallel public financing system"? Only somewhat, said the election experts we asked. The best way that Obama's fundraising mimics public financing is that such a significant proportion of his money comes from small donors. Most public financing strategies have a goal of encouraging small donors to become involved in the process through matching funds. But the other aspect of public financing is limiting spending. "I certainly don't blame him for not taking public financing, but to say it's the functional equivalent of public financing, even as an aspirational statement, you can only say that in terms of his broad donor base, not on the expenditure side," said Kenneth Gross, an expert on campaign finance election law who has represented both Democrats and Republicans. Gary Kalman, the federal legislative director for the nonpartisan public interest group U.S. PIRG, agreed that it's not quite the same thing as public financing. "It is important to acknowledge that one of the more exciting things coming out of this campaign is the increase in small donors," Kalman said. "But it's not completely analogous to the public financing system. The public should still be fighting for the elimination of special interest money from the system through better public financing." The public financing laws needs a tune-up, Kalman said, by increasing the spending limits and providing extra funds (so-called "fair fight funds") to candidates whose opponents opt out of the system. Obama's small donor network has implications beyond money, said Michael J. Malbin of the Campaign Finance Institute. These donors tend to put up yard signs, attend events and knock on doors. "It's not the same thing as public financing, but I wouldn't get hung up about that," Malbin said. "In a sense, calling it a 'parallel public financing system' undersells the importance of the small donor revolution." We agree that Obama's network of small donors does imitate an important goal of public financing of encouraging political participation of small donors. But Obama omits the spending limits that public financing has and exaggerates his own donor network. His group of small donors be may positive for democracy, but it does not equate to public financing system. For this reason we find his statement that he has created a "parallel public financing system" to be only Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-15T00:00:00	2008-04-08	['None']
pomt-01221	"Fox News uses photo of a married couple promoting ‘traditional marriage’ and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/21/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-fox-news-topped-same-sex-marriage-ar/	No meme should ever be taken at face value, so when a reader asked us to look at one that slammed Fox News, we read it with a skeptical eye. The meme shows two women -- one in a bridal gown and the other in a suit -- kissing. It reads, "That special moment when Foxnews.com uses a photo of a married couple promoting ‘traditional marriage’ and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple." There are two key elements to check. Did the Fox News website use this image at all, and did it appear in the context of an article that favored hetereosexual marriage? And we suppose you could ask if the people in the photo above are both women. That last one is easy. Yes. The picture was taken on Valentine’s Day 2012 by an Associated Press photographer. This was the first same-sex couple to be married at the Empire State Building. So did the photo (not the snarky words of course) appear on Foxnews.com? Fox News said it had. Through a spokeswoman, Jeff Misenti, Fox’s chief digital officer, said that when the photo was pointed out to Fox, they pulled it and replaced it with one that fit the context of the article it accompanied. The image also showed up on a segment of Fox and Friends. Cue Google So who tipped off Fox? Google conveniently includes a feature to spot all the occurrences of a particular image. Through that, we found a blog post from Feb. 6, 2013, by Jessica Valenti, a columnist with the Guardian. Valenti is credited by other bloggers for being the first to spot Fox’s faux pas. Valenti wrote, "Shhhh … no one tell Fox News that the ‘wedding kiss’ picture they’re using to accompany a piece about traditional gender roles is actually of a same sex couple." Valenti told PunditFact it seemed pretty obvious to her that the picture was of two women. She recognized that it was shot atop the Empire State Building and did her own image search to find the original. Valenti included the image of the couple kissing in her post, but there was no logo or other sign that it had appeared on Foxnews.com. And Valenti updated her post to say, "Fox News has taken the image down :( " But Valenti’s item inspired much repetition in the blogosphere, and Gawker’s post had a complete screenshot. Traditional marriage It’s safe to say that when people talk about traditional marriage, they mean heterosexual couples. The article on Fox’s website that included the photo did not directly say that opposite-sex marriages were superior to same-sex unions. It simply did not make the comparison. However, it did target the values it saw as being thrust upon American women. Society, said the writer Suzanne Venker, "eschews marriage." Women have "been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment," Venker wrote. Venker advocated a code that struck a definite chord of traditionalism. It was based on accepting the validity of norms from times gone by. "Prior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as (sic) equally valuable," Venker wrote. "Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare a woman’s life." Venker also happens to be the niece of Phyllis Schlafly, a long-time social conservative activist who opposes same-sex marriage. The two co-wrote a book attacking feminism. It is fair to characterize Venker’s article on Fox as supporting traditional marriage. Our ruling A Facebook meme said Fox News used a photo of a same-sex couple in an article that promoted traditional marriage. Fox News agrees that it used the photo and the story presented a case for marriage based on men and women adopting traditional gender roles. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03765	Says that under President Barack Obama’s health care law, "your insurance" premiums could go up by 200 percent and cost "as much as a new Explorer."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/03/fred-thompson/ex-sen-fred-thompson-says-obamcare-could-raise-pre/	As District Attorney Arthur Branch on Law & Order, former Sen. Fred Thompson was always ready with a wisecrack. In a recent Twitter post, the Tennessee Republican offered a pointed barb about President Barack Obama’s health care law: "Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%. It's the ‘A-Ford-able Care Act’ -- your insurance costs as much as a new Explorer." As we looked into whether Thompson’s comparison was accurate, we found a trail of facts twisted into a misleading narrative. Here’s how the tale was constructed, piece by piece. Why premiums will go up First, we should make clear that independent, credible experts do expect health insurance premiums to increase for many people once the mandates in the health care law take full effect, many of them in 2014. As we have written previously, the health care law is so complex that it's difficult to predict its ultimate impact on premiums. Some parts of the law should reduce premiums (subsidies for lower-income Americans and rebates from insurers that charge too much for overhead) while other parts should increase premiums (a longer list of mandatory benefits). The overall impact will likely vary depending on your income and what type of insurance you buy. Take special note of the "type of insurance" -- it proves to be crucial in analyzing Thompson’s claim. There are three types of private-market insurance. Large-group plans supply coverage through an employer with more than 50 employees. Small group plans work the same way, but with the company employing fewer than 50 people. (For both types of group plans, the employees typically pay a portion of their health care premiums, and the employer pays the rest.) The third type of private insurance is in the nongroup market -- policies that people buy on their own, paying the entire cost themselves. Large group plans account for roughly 70 percent of private policies, with small-group plans accounting for about 13 percent and the nongroup market accounting for about 17 percent. The health care law is expected to affect each of these three types of policies differently. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2016, insurance premiums in the large-group market would either stay the same or drop by up to 3 percent, while the small-group market would see anywhere from a drop of 2 percent to an increase of 1 percent. The biggest rises would be felt in the nongroup market, where premiums were projected to rise by between 10 percent and 13 percent. There’s a logic to this pattern: Currently, nongroup policies typically offer high-deductible coverage with low premiums. But under Obama’s law, all plans must provide a fixed list of benefits such as preventive care, and adding these services will come with a pricetag. So it’s reasonable for Thompson to point out that for this portion of the private-insurance market -- accounting for about one in every six private policies, many of them issued for younger and relatively healthy Americans -- will take a financial hit from the law. The congressional Republicans’ report We failed in our efforts to reach Thompson, but the first clue to figuring out his math is to look at the first part of his tweet: "Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%." We read the report, which was released in March 2013 by the Republican staffs of three congressional committees. This report is hardly a neutral document, given that it was written by staffers of a party that has worked to repeal the health care law since it was passed in 2010. Still, Thompson’s tweet goes much further than the report does, and it ignores some important qualifiers. The Republican staff report says that "some estimates show some Americans facing startling premium increases of 203 percent because of the law." Let’s parse this statement. First, "some estimates" refers to a January 2013 study done by former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and as a top policy adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. His survey asked a range of companies to share premium quotes for individuals with specific demographic characteristics in five cities, before and after the health care law took effect. In Holtz-Eakin’s study, the numbers around 200 percent refer to "young adults in the individual market" for certain cities. For instance, in Chicago, a young adult in the individual market before Obamacare would pay a premium of $756, rising to $2,268 after the law -- an increase of 202 percent. In Milwaukee, a pre-Obamacare premium of $696 would rise to $2,100, a jump of 203 percent. In three other cities listed, the increases ranged from 179 percent to 183 percent. Looking at these figures in isolation amounts to cherry-picking. To its credit, the Republican staff report made an effort to put this number into context by listing smaller projected increases as well. For instance, when the report lists projected increases in the 50 states for all people with individual insurance -- not just "young adults" -- these premium increases range from 30 percent to 100 percent. And the Republican report cites two studies that support figures on the low end of that spectrum: The Republican report cites a study by actuarial firm Oliver Wyman that suggests increases of 40 percent in the nongroup market, while the Society of Actuaries suggests a rise of 32 percent. These are still large increases, but they are nowhere near the eye-popping 200 percent figure that landed in headlines on conservative news sites and blogs. And there’s an additional level of cherry picking going on as well. The Republican report looks only at the nongroup market, which, as we noted, accounts for just 17 percent of the private-insurance market. The report says nothing about the large-group and small-group markets. This is not to say there won’t be financial hardship among young, healthy people with health insurance; there will be, and probably among other groups of Americans as well. But Thompson ignored the nuances when he tweeted that "your insurance" could rise by 200 percent. That kind of increase would only affect a vanishingly small proportion of Americans (or Thompson’s 139,000 Twitter followers). The cost of a Ford Explorer Some may suggest that Thompson was being facetious with his comparison, but we concluded that it's a checkable claim. And this is the part of the tweet where Thompson really goes off the rails. According to NADAguides.com, an online auto pricing service, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for a four-wheel drive, four-door 2013 Ford Explorer ranges from $31,995 (for the basic model) to $41,675 (for the "sport" trim). For simplicity, we’ll choose the basic model. Is there any way that health premiums will zoom past $30,000 a year as a result of Obamacare? We can’t find any. The people in Chicago who could be seeing a 200 percent increase in their health insurances are currently paying annual premiums of $756. After the law hits, according to Holtz-Eakin, their premiums would go up to $2,268 -- an amount well short of the $30,000 pricetag for a new Explorer. Perhaps Thompson looked at a different chart in the Republican report. This chart, titled "Obamacare Impact on Young Adults in the Small Group Market," shows that in Milwaukee, the costs for health insurance premiums in the small-group market would rise from $28,488 before the law to $78,744 after the law. The latter amount would be enough to buy two nicely pimped up Explorers -- but it refers to the cost of premiums for a business that employs 20 people. (The Republican report’s table doesn’t explain that, but we confirmed it with Holtz-Eakin.) Our ruling Thompson’s tweet takes a few snippets and spins them into a misleading tale. By some estimates, premiums for certain Americans could go up by 200 percent -- but only for a very specific type of person, namely young, healthy people who have already bought insurance on the nongroup market and will continue to do so. Meanwhile, the people who could see that big an increase would end up paying $2,200 in premiums after the law, far less than the $30,000 an actual new Explorer costs. Thompson’s tweet illustrates what can happen when eye-catching statistics are cherry-picked and repeated without the proper context. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01310	Seth Magaziner "plans to spend billions more of your money."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/29/ernest-almonte/ernest-almonte-claims-seth-magaziner-treasurer-pla/	In a television ad for Ernest Almonte, independent candidate for treasurer, his campaign tries to compare him and Democrat Seth Magaziner in categories such as fiscal efficiency, protecting employee pensions, and political ties. At one point the narrator says, "Ernie Almonte is an independent who isn't tied to any party and is ready to save tax dollars. Seth Magaziner -- a partisan politician with plans to spend billions more of your money." Billions? That's quite a claim when the current state budget is $8.7 billion. When we contacted the Almonte campaign to ask what the "billions" claim was referring to, spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger sent a tally of five items that totaled just over $2 billion. It turns out that virtually all of that $2 billion is hypothetical. In essence, Almonte takes Magaziner’s proposals -- which notably lack specific cost estimates -- and extrapolated his own estimates, taking each to the extreme. He assumes that Magaziner plans to finance every school, infrastructure and historic preservation project the state has suggested. And he assumes that Magaziner would serve a full eight years, magnifying the potential costs. Almonte bases the calculation on Magaziner's website document "A Blueprint for Rhode Island," which offers several proposals to spur economic growth in the state. We'll consider the five items separately. Main Street Opportunity Loan Program -- Almonte notes that Magaziner is promising to advocate for $20 million for this loan program for people looking to start a business. Magaziner's campaign counters that it would only cost the state $20 million if every single loan defaults immediately. But, in fact, the state would still be paying $20 million up front to make the loans in the first place. Actual cost to taxpayers: $20 million, as Almonte says. Rhode Island Venture Pool -- Almonte says Magaziner is calling for investing $15 million from the state's pension fund into a venture capital program that focuses exclusively on new Rhode Island businesses. The goal is to create jobs. But the program would cost $15 million only if the entire amount is loaned and the companies pay none of it back. Almonte says it’s reasonable to assume the full amount because investments in new companies carry a high risk. Actual cost to taxpayers: Nothing immediately. With bad investments -- up to $15 million. Or it might make money. School Building Capital Improvement Authority -- Magaziner says in his plan that he wants to rebuild or renovate Rhode Island's schools using a School Building Capital Improvement Authority. His blueprint mentions no price tag, but says it would be modeled after a successful program in Massachusetts, where 1 penny of the 6.25-percent sales tax goes to school construction and improvement. Almonte says that if Rhode Island were to divert a penny when it collects its 7-percent sales tax, that would raise about $127 million a year. But the state would have to find a way to make up for that lost sales tax money, so it would be an extra burden on the taxpayer. Almonte estimates the total cost of the proposal would be more than $1 billion -- $127 million per year times the eight years Magaziner could potentially be in office. But Evan England, campaign manager for Magaziner, said the candidate has not specified how much of the sales tax should be tapped and is simply proposing that some portion of existing state revenue be earmarked for school construction. Actual cost to taxpayers: It depends on how the program is set up and how ambitious it tries to be. Infrastructure Bank -- Magaziner proposes a revolving fund for roads and bridges similar to one in Virginia that offers bonds and loans to communities at low-interest rates. Again, he doesn’t specify a dollar figure. Almonte, however, says it would cost $430 million over several years. He derives that number from a 2013 General Assembly staff report that said Rhode Island needs to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its biggest infrastructure projects over five years. Magaziner's campaign manager said the assumption that the bank would fund every proposed infrastructure project "is completely out of left field and does not appear anywhere in the Blueprint." Actual cost to taxpayers: Once again, it would vary by how the program is set up and how ambitious it is. Historic Preservation Tax Credit Trust -- Magaziner's blueprint promises to "push to restore" the program, which had been capped to trim costs. Once again, Magaziner doesn't cite a cost. Almonte says the program will cost $460 million, a figure he derived by assuming that all 277 projects cited in a 2007 report would be funded. England's response: "Seth has said numerous times that the tax credits should exist, but that the level and the cap should be fluid and responsive to the needs of the economy for that given year," Actual cost to taxpayers: It depends on how many projects actually are awarded tax credits. Our ruling Ernest Almonte said Seth Magaziner "plans to spend billions more of your money." Almonte is referring to Magaziner’s Blueprint for Rhode Island, which outlines a series of economic development proposals. If any were implemented, there would certainly be a cost, but the lack of specifics in the blueprint make it impossible to calculate. Almonte told PolitiFact Rhode Island that he is simply doing what a good general treasurer should do -- evaluate proposals and offer realistic estimates about what they would cost. He said the total eventual price tag could be more than $2 billion. But extrapolating worst-case costs from vaguely defined programs, piling assumption onto assumption and extending them over several years is not realistic at all. Because the statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it False.

pomt-14983	"Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world" are in India and China.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/15/jim-webb/15-20-most-polluted-cities-world-are-india-china-s/	Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., spent most of the first Democratic presidential debate in the shadow of frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But he got in a few shots here and there. During the debate, Webb discussed the issue of climate change, arguing that the United States can’t go it alone. "We are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here," Webb said. "We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem." We decided to check whether Webb is right that "15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world" are in India and China, and whether his point is relevant for the climate change debate. (Webb’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) The top-20 list There is indeed a credible top-20 list for most-polluted cities. It was assembled by the World Health Organization in 2014. It compares cities based on how much fine particulate matter they have in the air. This measurement is called PM 2.5, standing for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or smaller. (There are about 25,000 microns per inch, so these particles are very small.) Such pollutants at the ground level pose such immediate health risks as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, and they can elevate the risk for lung and heart ailments over the longer term. These small particles typically come from exhaust from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles, though they can also come from natural sources such as forest and grass fires. Here’s the list: Rank CIty and country PM 2.5 pollution level 1 Delhi, India 153 2 Patna, India 149 3 Gwalior, India 144 4 Raipur, India 134 5 Karachi, Pakistan 117 6 Peshawar, Pakistan 111 7 Rawalpindi, Pakistan 107 8 Khormabad, Iran 102 9 Ahmedabad, India 100 10 Lucknow, India 96 11 Firozabad, India 96 12 Doha, Qatar 93 13 Kanpur, India 93 14 Amritsar, India 92 15 Ludhiana, India 91 16 Idgir, Turkey 90 17 Narayonganj, Bangladesh 89 18 Allahbad, India 88 19 Agra, India 88 20 Khanna, India 88 So, 13 of the 20 cities on the most-polluted list are located in India (they’re highlighted in bold). That’s two fewer cities than Webb had said, and none of the 20 cities on the list are located in China, as he’d indicated. Still, Webb’s not that far off, and he has a point that the list is dominated by developing countries, including many in south Asia. The relevance of this finding for climate change It’s important to note, however, that particulate pollution is not a key contributor to climate change. Rising global temperatures are more heavily tied to emissions of another substance -- carbon dioxide. Webb’s comment "does seem to conflate two issues," said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Looking at the U.S. experience over the past few decades can help clarify the difference between the two metrics. "The U.S. cleaned up emission of particulates and sulfate aerosols by requiring cleaner, lower-sulfur coal and cleaner diesel fuel," Reilly said. "But cleaning up those emissions does nothing directly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, since we continued to use coal and petroleum products." Ironically, particulate emissions may actually have a cooling effect rather than a warming effect because they can reflect sunlight back into space, said Brian Soden, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. This reflectiveness may have made the earth warm more slowly than it might otherwise have. That said, experts agreed that there’s likely a reasonably high correlation between cities that have high particulate counts and those that have high emission levels for carbon dioxide, particularly when you look beyond advanced industrialized nations like the United States. While "the two lists will not necessarily line up perfectly, the 20 most polluted cities are certainly also top contributors of carbon emissions," Soden said. And experts said that Webb does have a point about the need for international cooperation if carbon levels are to be cut. While the United States is a bigger carbon emitter right now, other nations like India are seeing their emissions rise more rapidly. Emissions are only going to fall worldwide if most major emitters reduce their output together. "Yes, it is absolutely a global problem, but someone needs to lead," Soden said. Our ruling Webb said that "15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world" are in India and China. He’s close -- 13 are in India, though none are in China. It’s worth pointing out, however, that the top-20 list measures cities with the greatest level of particulate pollution, which is not the same thing as emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b78a803a-7a52-45a4-beff-8123446f0f36	None	Jim Webb	None	None	None	2015-10-15T16:00:28	2015-10-13	['India', 'China']
pomt-00441	"Apple and Amazon already operate in many states that require levels of voter ID."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/aug/22/civitas-institute/do-amazon-apple-operate-states-voter-id/	With three top research universities a half-hour drive from one another and the well-established Research Triangle Park, the Triangle area is increasingly attractive to large corporations. That’s why it’s on Amazon’s short list as a possibility for a second headquarters. Apple CEO Tim Cook may have had the same thing in mind when he met with Gov. Roy Cooper to discuss a possible new project. Talk of the two tech giants coming to North Carolina has sparked pushback from advocacy groups. The Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, launched a campaign telling these companies to stay away from North Carolina because the state’s November ballot will ask voters whether to approve a constitutional amendment creating a voter ID requirement. No Gay No Way, a Washington-based campaign, is against Amazon putting a second headquarters in any state with discriminatory policies against the LGBTQ community, and the organization lists North Carolina as one of those states. The Civitas Institute, a conservative Raleigh group, tweeted on June 25, 2018, that Amazon and Apple already operate in states with various levels of voter ID laws, so the proposed voter ID amendment should not be a factor in deciding to open an Apple campus or Amazon headquarters in North Carolina. Is that true? Do Apple and Amazon, known for their liberal social stances, already operate in states with strict voter ID laws? According to the National Conference of State Legislators, 34 states have voter ID laws as of 2018. The strictest voter ID laws are in Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Dakota and Ohio. PolitiFact North Carolina looked at Apple and Amazon press release archives for information on their locations. Where does Amazon operate? Amazon’s headquarters is in Seattle. A voter ID bill became law in Washington state in 2005, after the company was founded in 1994. The law is categorized by NCSL as non-strict, meaning there is an option for voters without identification to be able to vote, such as signing an affidavit of identity. Strict voter ID laws, according to the NCSL, require voters to have ID, or vote on a provisional ballot and take extra steps to have their vote count. At Amazon fulfillment centers, the company stores the products sellers send before shipping them to buyers. Arizona, home of several fulfillment centers, passed a strict voter ID law in 2005. Three years later, Amazon opened its first fulfillment center in Goodyear, Arizona. Indiana passed one of the country’s strictest voter ID laws in 2005. Amazon opened fulfillment centers there in 2008 and 2011. Virginia passed a strict voter ID law in 2013, a year after Amazon opened a fulfillment center there. In 2011, Amazon opened three fulfillment centers in Tennessee. That’s the same year the state passed a strict voter ID bill. Nine of the American cities on the Amazon shortlist have some type of voter ID law. Where does Apple operate? Apple’s first campus was built in Cupertino, California, where there are no voter ID laws. However, Apple’s third campus is in Austin, Texas. There has been a voter ID requirement in Texas since 1997. Apple has had a presence in the state since 1992, according to Terri Bolin, the manager of lobby operations for the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Apple expanded its presence in Austin again in 2016, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce’s 2016-2018 relocation and expansion records. The state tried to make the 1997 voter ID law stricter in 2011 by allowing only government-issued IDs to be used. The law was struck down by a federal district court, but a non-strict photo ID law from 2017 went into effect in 2018. The original 1997 law is categorized as a strict photo-ID law by the NCSL. In 2017, Apple announced it would be building a data center in Iowa. That’s the same year Iowa passed a voter ID bill. The company also has plans to expand its existing operations in Arizona. Arizona is known for having some of the strictest voter ID requirements in the country since 2005. The North Carolina General Assembly placed six constitutional amendments on this fall’s statewide ballot. If the voter ID amendment passes, the legislature would follow up by writing a law with details, so there is no information on how strict the voter ID requirement would be. A North Carolina voter ID law from 2013 was struck down by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as unconstitutionally discriminatory. PolitiFact ruling The Civitas Institute’s statement that Apple and Amazon already operate in states with voter ID laws is accurate. While some of their offices, such as in Washington state and Virginia, predate the laws, many others don’t. They have built offices, such as in Tennessee and Iowa, either after a voter ID bill became law, or the same year. PolitiFact North Carolina rates this statement True.

pomt-11179	Perpetrators of school shootings "have been drugged in many cases … many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/22/oliver-north/no-connection-ritalin-school-shootings-nra/	The National Rifle Association’s new president, Oliver North, deflected attention off guns and onto medication in the wake of the latest school shooting. "The problem that we got is we are trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease," North said. "The disease in this case isn't the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence. "They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases. And they have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie," North continued. "If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten." Pundits have long harped on the dangers of violence in movies, television shows and video games. But we were curious about the link North suggests between Ritalin, prescribed for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and gun violence. The overprescription of ADHD medication has been the subject of heavy debate. For the record, we found no evidence that the suspected Texas shooter was diagnosed with ADHD, or prescribed Ritalin. More broadly and to North’s point, we found no evidence to back up the idea that ADHD medication was behind school shootings or that "many" shooters had been on Ritalin. "The short answer is that this is nonsense," said Katherine S. Newman, Torrey Little professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts and author of Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings. For Rampage, Newman and her fellow researchers studied medication as a precipitating factor in the school shootings that took place between 1970 and 2000. They found no evidence drugs played a role. "​The vast majority of shooters were, sadly, not under any kind of medical supervision," Newman said. "Indeed, the shocking finding is that despite evidence of serious mental disorders (after the fact at least), these young men had — in the main — not been seen by physicians for any kind of psychological disorder and were hence not under medication at all." Peter Langman, a psychologist in private practice who has been studying school shootings for over a decade, said he has not found any ties between psychiatric medication and rampage attacks, either. Langman looked at 48 school shooters between 1966 and 2012 in his 2015 book School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators. Langman found that two of the 24 secondary school shooters he profiled were taking medication at the time of their attacks. A third shooter might have been, or he may have stopped his medication three weeks before the attack. Including that case, 12.5 percent of the shooters Langman studied were taking medication. The 12.5 percent statistic held true for the 48 shooters Langman studied, too, which also included adults and college students. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, sent along various stories about the overprescription of Ritalin. Only one was a scientific study mentioning both ADHD medication and violence. The study found that three ADHD drugs were responsible for 108 of 1,937 case reports of violence toward others in a 69-month period FDA database. But Russell Barkley, a clinical professor of psychiatry who monitors ADHD research weekly at the Virginia Treatment Center for Children, explained that the study does not control for the high probability that patients receiving treatment with these drugs were already highly aggressive to begin with. "We have no research in our scientific literature of more than 50,000 articles showing that Ritalin increases aggression on average," Barkley said. "Research in fact shows that stimulants like Ritalin reduce aggressive behavior in those with ADHD." There is also no evidence that any of those reports of violence were related to school shootings. "We don’t know that any of those people in the study had anything to do with a mass rampage attack," Langman said. "Even if the drug gets people to get agitated or angry, there’s a difference between that and plotting and carrying out a mass murder." Our ruling North said, "They have been drugged in many cases … many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten." A minor percentage of school shooters studied had been medicated, not "many." The notion that many have specifically been on the drug Ritalin since kindergarten has no factual basis. More broadly, causation has never been established between the medication and violence. We found no specific ties between ADHD medication and school shootings, either. We rate this statement False.

pomt-05357	Jim Renacci "voted repeatedly to end Medicare."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/11/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-jim-renacci-has-voted-repeatedly/	Few subjects can equal health care for stirring political debate and fueling partisan talking points. Claims about health care have won the dubious honor of being PolitiFact National's "Lie of the Year" for three straight years. PolitiFact’s editors award that title to the claim they view as the most significant falsehood, the one that had the most impact on the political discourse. Republican claims that health care reform law would include "death panels" and that health care reform represented a "government takeover of health care" were winners for 2009 and 2010. A claim from Democrats' that Republicans "voted to end Medicare" was tapped for the honor in 2011. But as hot-button an item as health care is with voters, it’s no surprise that politicians and their campaigns return to those claims -- particularly when the race is expected to be hotly contested. That is indeed the case with Rep. Betty Sutton. Because of redistricting, she is running this fall against Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in the new 16th District. A new campaign solicitation emailed by Sutton’s campaign referred to Renacci as "someone who has voted repeatedly to end Medicare." Sutton's campaign staff said the statement referred to Renacci's votes, in April 2011 and March 2012, in favor of the House Republican budget plans presented by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. The Ryan budget proposal restructures Medicare toward private insurance. Under the current Medicare system, the government pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65. Under the Ryan plan, future beneficiaries would be given a credit from the government to shop for new health plans — a dramatic departure from the current system. The plan has some guarantees for coverage, although seniors would have to pay more to get the benefits they receive today, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Sutton's campaign provided two sources for the "end Medicare" statement. The first was a Wall Street Journal article from April 2011 that, according to the campaign, said the Ryan plan "would essentially end Medicare." As we have noted in previous fact-checks, however, the Journal article didn’t quite say that. The partial quote deceptively truncates what the article said: "The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills." Changing the payment method is not the same as ending the entire program. The other source cited as an article from the McClatchy-Tribune News Service that ran in The Plain Dealer. It said Ryan's plan "effectively would end Medicare for seniors." It said the plan "would end Medicare for anyone who retires after 2021 and replace it with a 'premium support' program, in which the federal government would subsidize private health plans." Sutton's campaign manager, Scotty Eggleston, added this: "Ohio seniors deserve the Medicare guarantee that they have paid for and that will actually cover their costs, not the pretend version and voucher system that Jim Renacci wants that has seniors pay nearly $6,000 more while getting less coverage." These are questions of degree. While Medicare would move into a privatized voucher version under the Ryan plan, it would still exist as a health-insurance program for seniors. And the Ryan plan would not affect seniors currently in Medicare, or even the people who would join the program in the next 10 years. For everyone else, the Ryan plan might better be defined as the end of "Medicare as we know it" -- a cliche, but one with enough qualification to keep the claim out of the hot seat. PolitiFact's rating was matched by other independent fact-checkers. "Medicare would remain an entitlement program, but it would also be more costly to future beneficiaries. It would not end," said FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. FactCheck.org rated the end of Medicare claim as one of their "Whoppers of 2011." The Washington Post’s Fact Checker concluded that while there’s "a worthwhile debate" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, "it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare." It labeled the claim as one of the "biggest Pinocchios of 2011." The unqualified end-of-Medicare statement is not accurate. The Sutton fund-raising pitch included no "as we know it" qualification. On the Truth-O-Meter, that means the statement, as it has in the past, registers a rating of False.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2012-05-11T06:00:00	2012-05-01	['None']
pomt-11469	"Joe Biden just confirmed that he is running for president in 2020 and it has America applauding!"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/06/realtimepolitics/joe-biden-hasnt-confirmed-he-running-president-202/	A story on Facebook proclaimed that former Vice President Joe Biden confirmed that he is running for president in 2020, but that’s premature at best. "Joe Biden just confirmed that he is running for president in 2020 and it has America applauding!" stated a March 6 headline on Realtimepolitics, a hoax website with a similar name to Real Clear Politics, a credible website with polling data. The story lifts from a story posted by The Political Voice in February, although that story had a more vague headline: "Just in: Joe Biden’s plans for 2020 has the entire nation elated." Facebook users flagged the realtimepolitics.com post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The headline is inaccurate and doesn’t reflect what the story actually stated. The story said that Biden told longtime policy aides that a White House campaign in 2020 is a definite possibility, according to a report by the Associated Press. The AP reported Feb. 18 that Biden was "tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in 2020, even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides." Biden held the meeting with aides in Washington to set the agenda for the newly opened Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. During the meeting, Biden "said he was keeping his 2020 options open, considering it a real possibility. He insisted he had made no decision, and didn’t need to yet, according to five people who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it by those who did," the AP wrote. The AP reported that "several people came away from the meeting with the impression that if no strong Democratic candidate emerges in the next year or so, Biden would feel strongly compelled to run." The AP’s sources demanded anonymity to discuss the private meeting. In December 2017, Biden was asked on The View what it would take for him to decide to run. Biden said he hadn’t organized any campaign organization, but left open the door. "If, in a year from now, if we’re ready, and no one has moved in that I think can do it, then I may very well do it," he said. Biden ran for president twice in the past and contemplated challenging Hillary Clinton for the 2016 nomination but ruled that out after his son Beau Biden had died from brain cancer earlier that year.

pomt-13158	Says it’s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games, "they’re forced to watch Viking games," so he "got a law passed to fix" the problem.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/28/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-he-got-law-passed-so-fans-can-wat/	Aiming to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold and win re-election on Nov. 8, 2016, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is turning to Green Bay Packers fans for support, confident that they aren’t fans of the rival Minnesota Vikings. A Johnson radio ad released Oct. 25, 2016 starts with a strong claim, as the male narrator says: "There’s nothing like watching the Packers win on Sunday. But for some in Wisconsin, that’s not possible. They’re forced to watch Viking games." Not possible to watch Packers games? "Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packer games, and their local news," the narrator continues. "That’s why, when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it. And he did it in his first term. One broadcast station already plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties. And other broadcasters across northern Wisconsin will have the opportunity to offer coverage." Rescuing thousands of Wisconsinites fans from having to watch Vikings games sounds like the politician’s equivalent of returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. So, why haven’t we heard the crowds cheering? The problem isn’t as pervasive as the ad states. And, so far, the law only offers the possibility of fixing the problem. ‘Not possible’ in ‘orphan counties’ There is a phenomenon in broadcasting called "orphan counties." It occurs when a county in one state is assigned to a local television market in a neighboring state. In 13 northern Wisconsin counties, including Ashland and Iron, according to a broadcast industry blog, the local channels, including the local news, are from stations in either the Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth TV markets. That means that if the Packers and Vikings play at the same time on the same network, but not against each other, viewers in the orphan counties are shown the Vikings game, not the Packers game. That occurred six times in the 2015 season and is expected to occur twice in the 2016 season (NFL game times are subject to change), according to the Ashland Daily Press. On those days, viewers in orphan counties can see the Packers games only if they subscribe to a satellite service and pay an additional fee for NFL package. So, Johnson overstates the problem when he says it’s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games. That happens, at most, several times per season. But it’s true that on those days, Wisconsinites in "orphan counties" are shown Vikings games rather than Packers games. Now to the fix Johnson talks about. The law to ‘fix it’ In 2014, when Congress reauthorized a satellite television law, a provision was included to address the orphan counties problem. But it requires a petition to be filed and the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. So, when Johnson says he "got a law passed," it’s not as though the law itself fixes the problem. Johnson takes credit for the petition provision. And while it’s clear he supports the provision, doing so in a December 2015 letter to the FCC, his campaign could not cite evidence that he was responsible for the provision. So, that part of the claim is unclear. But to be fair to Johnson, there isn’t necessarily a formal record on how provisions get inserted into a law. Johnson does support the first petition filed under the new provision -- one filed in September 2016 by WSAW-TV in Wausau (part 1 and part 2). But when the ad says one station "plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties," that’s misleading in that WSAW’s petition must get FCC approval. The petition seeks to have satellite providers -- there are two in the United States -- DirecTV and DISH Network -- carry its signal to some orphan county viewers, those in Ashland and Iron counties. That would allow satellite TV subscribers in those areas to see Packers games that aren’t shown there now, without any additional fees. "In a state where the Packers are publicly owned and religiously followed, orphan county viewers feel an affront akin to forcing Washington (Redskins) football fans to watch nothing but Dallas Cowboys," WSAW wrote to the FCC, which is based in Washington, D.C. But the petition applies to only two of the orphan counties. Moreover, DirecTV told Johnson in October 2016 it was technically possible to carry WSAW’s signal to only to four of 11 ZIP codes in Iron County. In short, there are many unknowns. The FCC told us it has until Feb. 6, 2017 to decide on WSAW’s petition. WDIO-TV in Duluth is objecting to it. The FCC must determine whether granting the petition is in a county’s interest and whether it would be economically and technically feasible for satellite providers to carry the WSAW signal. And if it approves the petition, the FCC might order only order one satellite carry to pick up WSAW’s signal, not necessarily both. Indeed, one of Johnson’s Senate staff members has essentially said that no fix has been achieved yet. "Everything in government is slow, but we do think we are very close to a real solution that will give Wisconsinites real change," aide Brooke Ericson told the Ashland newspaper in commenting about the WSAW petition. "Just this petition going to the FCC, I think, is a further step in the right direction. It’s more than any other senator or congressman for that matter has been able to achieve." Our rating Johnson says it’s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games, "they’re forced to watch Viking games," so he "got a law passed to fix" the problem. In some northern parts of the state, viewers in markets served by Minnesota TV stations are not shown some Packers games, whenever they happen to conflict with Vikings broadcasts. But those residents still see the vast majority of Packers games. As for the "fix," Johnson backs a new provision in federal law that allows for petitions to be filed that, if granted by the Federal Communications Commission, could alleviate the problem in at least some of the so-called orphan counties. But whether that will occur remains to be seen. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. Other Packers items President John F. Kennedy released star Packer Paul Hornung from military reserve duty so he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. True. Wisconsin’s right to work bill would "likely apply to" Packers players and their union. Mostly True. The Packers a "socialist organization." Mostly False. Gov.

pomt-00554	"The top 25 hedge fund managers (are) making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-top-hedge-fund-managers-make-more-/	At her presidential campaign kick-off rally June 13, Hillary Clinton said the rich are getting richer, while many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Case in point: the disparity between Wall Street hedge fund managers and kindergarten teachers. "While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet," she said, "you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate." Is the salary gap between kindergarten teachers and hedge fund managers really so wide? We decided to check it out. (We previously looked into a Clinton claim about taxes among the working class and the ultra-wealthy.) Kindergarten teachers The best data we could find on kindergarten teachers comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other statistical sources, such as the National Center for Education Statistics, don’t separate out kindergarten teachers specifically. According to a 2014 BLS report, there are about 158,000 kindergarten teachers in the United States. The figure includes teachers from both public and private schools, though it excludes special education instructors. The average annual pay for a kindergarten teacher is $53,480 -- ranging from less than $34,000 to more than $78,000. This is higher than what the average preschool teacher makes, but slightly lower than that of elementary, middle and high school teachers. So the aggregate pay for kindergarten teachers is about $8.5 billion. For some historical context, Susan Moore Johnson, an education professor at Harvard University, said kindergarten teachers have traditionally been paid less than teachers at higher grade levels. But the implementation of district-wide pay scales has made pay mostly uniform across all grades within a district -- with exact salary varying based on experience and education, rather than the grade level. However, this is not the case in all districts. Johnson added that, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, private school elementary teachers get paid, on average, several thousand dollars less than their public school counterparts. So how does the $8.5 billion collective salary of America’s kindergarten teachers compare to the top-25 hedge fund managers’ take-home pay? This number is a little bit more elusive. Hedge fund managers In its 2015 ranking of the top-earning hedge fund managers, Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine said the group of 25 collectively earned $11.62 billion in compensation. At the top of the list is Citadel founder and CEO Kenneth Griffin, who earned an estimated $1.3 billion off his fund. Lest your jaw remain fully hinged, 2014 was a bad year. The magazine called the total $11.62 billion bounty "paltry" compared to what it was in 2013, when the top-25 hedge managers made about twice as much -- $21.15 billion. There are, however, some issues with measuring hedge manager salaries, though the experts we polled couldn’t name a source that would necessarily be more accurate than Alpha magazine’s list. The magazine’s report is just an estimate -- based on the manager’s capital gains in the fund, as well as his (the top 25 are all men) estimated share in the firm’s management and performance fees charged to clients. These numbers are hard to verify because no one really knows for certain a manager’s stake in his or her firm, said Nicole Boyson, a finance professor at Northeastern University. Additionally, funds charged to clients vary drastically among and within the different firms, and one would also have to account for how much of these fees go toward running the business, rather than the salary, Boyson said. "If you could get comfortable with the ‘right’ number for a hedge fund manager, which I am not sure is possible, then you could compare it directly to the gross pay of teachers ... with the caveat that these two groups are likely subject to different tax rates, etc.," Boyson said. In any case, the best information we have shows 25 hedge managers making about $3 billion more than the country’s 158,000 kindergarten teachers combined -- and that’s in a bad year for the hedge managers. The data here isn't perfect, but the gap between the two professions is so wide that it seems a safe bet that hedge fund managers make more. Our ruling Clinton said, "The top-25 hedge fund managers (are) making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined." Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that America’s 158,000 kindergarten teachers together make $8.5 billion a year. There are a few possible problems with the data for hedge fund managers’ earnings, but there’s no denying it’s significantly higher than a kindergarten teacher’s compensation. A rough estimate for the top-25 hedge fund managers shows they collectively earned $11.62 billion in 2014, and that was a bad year. In 2013, they earned approximately $21.15 billion. So using the smaller number, kindergarten teachers come up shy of hedge fund managers by about $3 billion, a huge margin. We rate Clinton’s claim True.

pomt-00382	Says Texas "high school graduation rates are at all-time highs."	true	/texas/statements/2018/sep/07/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-texas-enjoying-record-high-school/	Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who seeks re-election in November against Democratic nominee Lupe Valdez, says in a new ad that he’s kept his big campaign promises as evidenced, he suggests, by the state’s economy and schools. We’ve tracked progress on numerous Abbott campaign promises from 2014 on our Abbott-O-Meter. Abbott’s "Promises Made, Promises Kept" TV ad, released Aug. 30, 2018, talks up jobs and crime-fighting. He also says in the ad that on his watch, "schools are stronger; high school graduation rates are at all-time highs." All-time tops? We wondered about that mindful that this March, we rated True an Abbott claim that Texas ranks among the top five states for its high-school graduation rate. Abbott spokesman John Wittman told us at the time that Abbott had gotten to his top-five claim by relying on a chart showing state-by-state graduation rates in 2015-16. According to the chart, posted by the National Center for Education Statistics, Iowa led that year with a 91.3 percent high school graduation rate.Texas landed fifth with a rate of 89.1 percent, just ahead of Missouri (89 percent). The nation’s high school graduation rate was 84.1 percent, the chart says. Separately, a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman, Lauren Callahan, urged us to notice that the Texas graduation rate had consistently escalated. The statewide graduation rate in 2014-15 was 89 percent, the agency advised, compared with 88.3 percent in 2013-14 and 88 percent in 2012-13. So, the state’s 2015-16 graduation rate was the highest in a few years. And did it set a record? Rates gauged since 1996 In September 2018, Callahan replied to our fresh query on this front with an email confirming that the 2015-16 rate set a Texas record and noting that charts in the agency’s report on the year’s rate show state-gauged graduation rates for 1996 through 2016. Callahan cautioned, though, that the definition of dropouts changed in 2005-06 and was phased into graduation rates over three school years, making comparable only the graduation rates shown for 2009 through 2016. In 2009, the report for 2016 says, some 82.9 percent of the year’s class of seniors graduated. That rate was the highest since 2005, according to figures in the report, when 84 percent of seniors graduated. According to the report, the previous high graduation rate or the years starting in 1996 was set in 2004, 84.6 percent. We wondered too if every high school has lately experienced a record rate. Callahan said confirmation would take more historical research than the agency could immediately perform. That said, Callahan called it "unlikely that rates are at a record high for all high schools statewide." Other metrics From past fact-checks, we recognized another method used to gauge progress through high school — by comparing a year’s count of graduates to the number of ninth-graders three years earlier; the difference signals student attrition. There are two paths to such an alternative comparison. In 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, 89 percent of Texas high school students graduated three years after finishing ninth grade. According to the agency, Texas tied Alabama and Nebraska for third place nationally by this metric with Iowa (91 percent) and New Jersey (90 percent) leading the nation. In contrast, Texas lags more states by a cruder yet popular measure based on tallying high school graduates each year and comparing that count with the number of students who completed ninth grade three years before. In 2012-13, the latest year analyzed by the education statistics center, Texas tied with California with an "averaged freshman graduation rate" of 83.6 percent. Twenty states had higher rates, a center chart says. In October 2017, the San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research Association, which tracks high school completion rates, reported that, through the 2016-17 school year, the state’s attrition rate, not counting charter schools, hovered around 24 percent to 25 percent for five years — down from 33 percent in the mid-1980s. "Texas public schools are failing to graduate one out of every four" high school students, the report says. To our inquiry, state education officials didn’t have a comparable attrition rate for 2016-17. DeEtta Culbertson, a TEA spokeswoman, emailed us agency information indicating that for 2015-16, the state calculated an attrition rate of 19.6 percent. Even earlier, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, told us enrollment drop-offs that show up in calculations of attrition amount to a soft spot in the state’s calculation of graduation rates. In 2015, Heilig told us that’s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons — such as moving to another state. In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student "leaver" codes here. Also in 2015, the TEA’s Callahan said by email that if a district’s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review. "Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate?" Callahan said. "Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying. People just change their minds. At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example. Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere." We reconnected with Heilig about Abbott’s claim; he said by phone that nationally, improved rates are an indicator that public schools are better than ever though any discussion of rates, he reaffirmed, still merits a caveat about the persistent difference between the number of students who graduate each year trailing the number of students who were enrolled in ninth grade four years before. Our ruling Abbott says in his ad that Texas has record high school graduation rates. In 2016, the Texas graduation rate of 89.1 percent was the highest the state has measured since 1996, the earliest year of available data. Abbott was not talking about an alternative metric by which Texas in 2012-13 trailed 20 states for its share of students graduating compared with the number of ninth-grade students advancing three years before.

pomt-01134	Only 20 colleges and universities "have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/22/jim-moran/moran-says-only-20-colleges-make-profit-sports/	At the end of his 24-year congressional career, Rep. Jim Moran Jr. is returning to his athletic roots. Moran, D-8th, is the son and namesake of Jim Moran Sr., who played professional football with the Boston Redskins in the mid 1930s. The congressman, himself, played football at the College of the Holy Cross in the mid 1960s. Moran, who retires Jan. 3, introduced legislation this fall that would create a commission to look into the policies of the NCAA after myriad college sports scandals. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve "the interaction of athletics and academics" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. "We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses," Moran said in a Facebook post. We rated Moran’s statement about coaches’ pay as Mostly True. Now, we’ll look at his claim that only 20 athletic departments at the nation’s largest universities are making a profit. Let’s start with a definition of the Football Bowl Subdivision -- the term Moran used to qualify his statement. There are 1,083 colleges and universities competing in sports that fall under the NCAA’s governance. They are grouped into three divisions, that are defined by athletic scholarship rules and the amount of money the schools spend on sports. For example, Division I schools -- which are typically large -- can offer many full athletic scholarships, Division II schools can offer partial athletic scholarships and Division III schools are not allowed to offer sports scholarships. There are 346 Division I schools. Of them, 123 are classified as members of the Football Bowl Subdivision, the top tier of sports competition. These are colleges and universities that are eligible to compete in bowl games and have average attendance of at least 15,000 at their home games. So Moran is generally talking about the athletic department finances at large universities that field football teams. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, said the congressman’s claim was based on an NCAA study on Division I athletic department budgets that was released in April. The report says, "A total of 20 athletics programs in the FBS reported positive net revenues for the 2013 fiscal year." The study deals in broad statistics and does not identify schools that are in the black or the red. Only two sports were profitable at FBS schools, according to the report. Football programs netted a median profit of slightly more than $3 million and men’s basketball netted a median $340,000. But the profits at most schools quickly vanished after paying for a long list of other intercollegiate teams, all of which lose money. The median loss among of athletic departments was $11.6 million. Here are some other findings from the NCAA report: Median revenues generated by athletic departments increased by 3.2 percent from 2012 to 2013, while expenses went up 10.6 percent; Of the 20 schools that made money, the median profit was $8.4 million; Of the 103 schools that lost money, the median deficit was $14.9 million; The highest total revenues generated by an athletic department was $169.7 million; The highest total expenses by an athletic department was $146.8 million. According to the report, all athletic departments outside of the FBS operate in the red. In other words, only 20 of the 1,083 college sports programs in the nation are profitable. Our ruling Moran said only 20 FBS schools generate more money from athletics than they spend. We rate his statement True.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2014-12-22T12:30:00	2014-11-22	['None']

pomt-07630	"Lake Erie supports nearly 10 percent of Ohio's jobs and generates $750 million in state and local taxes."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/18/betty-sutton/rep-betty-sutton-says-lake-erie-drives-jobs-tax-re/	Cuts in government spending aim to reduce the deficit and bring the budget closer to balance. But the process can be more complicated than that. That point was made when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar went before the House Committee on Natural Resources this month to testify about President Obama's proposed fiscal 2012 budget request. Rep. Betty Sutton noted the economic benefits the department helps spur in Ohio, as she focused on the budget recommendation to cut $125 million from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Sutton called the initiative "incredibly important" to the region economically. "Lake Erie supports nearly 10 percent of Ohio's jobs and generates $750 million in state and local taxes," she said. PolitiFact Ohio wondered where those figures came from, and took a look. The long-range Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, developed by a task force of 11 federal agencies, aims to clean up toxic sediment and polluted areas, combating invasive species such as Asian carp, restore degraded wetlands and support fish and wildlife resources. Obama requested $350 million for the program for fiscal 2012, down from the $475 million standard of 2010. The initiative was chopped to $225 million, or less than half of that, by a plan from House Republicans to cut $61 billion in federal spending. We asked Sutton's office to cite her source for data on the Lake Erie’s economic impact. They referred us to the Great Lakes Commission, a cooperative formed by the eight Great Lakes states and Canada in 1955. One of the commission's fact sheets did have those numbers, and others, which were attributed to the commission's own studies and a variety of official sources. The tax figure, credited by the commission to a fact sheet from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, ultimately came from Ohio Travel & Tourism, part of the Department of Development. It said that Lake Erie tourism generated $430 million in state tax revenue and $320 million in local tax revenue -- together totaling the $750 million Sutton cited. But the commission's communications director, Christine Manninen, told us the jobs figure Sutton relied on was stated erroneously in the March 2011 fact sheet, in a paragraph that jumbled lake-related and statewide figures. The online fact sheet was corrected after the hearing where Sutton cited it. It is the state's tourism industry that accounts for nearly 10 percent of Ohio's more than 5 million jobs, according to Ohio Travel & Tourism. Nevertheless, Lake Erie does support a large number of jobs -- more than 100,000 in northeast Ohio. Sutton relied on a credible official source for her numbers, and she cited them accurately, though one of her sources, a credible one at that, misstated its data. That’s a piece of information needed for clarification. We rate her statement as Mostly True.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2011-03-18T06:00:00	2011-03-03	['Ohio']
pomt-05762	"Since President Obama took full control of Washington," every day, 13,000 more people "have been put on food stamps."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-blames-barack-obama-food-stamp-use-rising-/	A recent ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- offers a flurry of statistics to argue that President Barack Obama doesn’t deserve a second term. "What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington?" the narrator says. "A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured. … This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America?" There’s a lot to digest here, but we’re going to look at two claims from the ad. In another item, we examined the claim that "since President Obama took full control of Washington ... every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost." The one we’re looking at in this item is, "Since President Obama took full control of Washington," every day, 13,000 more people "have been put on food stamps." We’ll start by noting that "food stamps" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name. Also, for the purposes of this fact check, we won’t be checking whether literally 13,000 people joined the food stamp rolls each and every day. Instead, we’ll be looking at the average rate of Americans joining food stamps over the course of the full three-year period to see whether that number is close to 13,000. As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? First, the numbers. Obama took office on January 20, 2009, so we’ll look at the numbers for both January 2009 and February 2009. In January 2009, there were 31,983,716 Americans receiving food stamp benefits. In February 2009, the number was 32,332,622. Fast-forward to the most recent month for which data was available when the ad was made -- November 2011 -- and the number of Americans then receiving food stamp benefits was 46,224,775. That means an increase of either 14,241,059 (if you use the January statistic) or 13,892,153 (if you use the February figure). Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then the number of additional food stamp recipients per day of the Obama presidency was either 13,005 (using the January figure) or 12,687 (using the February figure). We consider either calculation to be fairly represented by the ad’s rounded-off estimate of 13,000. So the ad is right on the numbers. What about the question of whether Obama deserves the blame? The NRCC stands by its ad. "Leadership means taking responsibility, and President Obama bears responsibility for the consequences of his policies," said NRCC spokesman Nat Sillin. Clearly, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. It’s impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010. On the one hand, SNAP usage has continued to climb almost every month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. On the other hand, there is typically a lag before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The previous high from 1994, for instance, came following a recession that officially ended in mid 1991 -- and that recession was much milder than the most recent one. This makes it harder to assign blame. In addition to being influenced by the business cycle, enrollment and spending on means-tested programs such as food stamps is "quite sensitive to political decisions by Congress, state lawmakers, and state and local administrative agencies," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Indeed, the number of food stamp beneficiaries rose under President George W. Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits and partly because of rules changes that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama. The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency (the final two years of which had Congress under Democratic control). All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency, and the number of additional recipients per day during Bush’s eight years was 5,538 -- well below Obama’s rate, but still going up consistently during a period when the economy was relatively healthy. We should also note that this ad uses the formulation, "since President Obama took full control of Washington." Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. Our ruling The NRCC ad is right on the number of additional Americans using food stamps during Obama’s time in office. But it’s wrong to suggest that Obama’s "full control of Washington" -- to the extent he even had full control -- was to blame. The broader economic cycle and changes in how the program is administered have had a major impact as well. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00727	"More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/23/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-more-americans-have-been-moon-farm/	Liberal comedian Bill Maher made an out-of-this-world comparison to poke a hole in the Republican argument that the estate tax threatens the livelihoods of "family farmers." Of 5,000 Americans who paid the estate tax in 2013, "20 farmers paid it," Maher said on his April 17, 2015, show. "Twenty-four Americans have been to the moon." "More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013." There obviously is no relation between the number of farmers paying the estate tax and the number of Americans who went to the moon, but as a point of trivia, Maher’s claim is an intriguing one. A reader asked us to "do the magic that you do," which is determining whether Maher’s point is accurate. One small step for fact-checkers ... Caveat No 1: Maher is using the number of astronauts who have been to the vicinity of the moon, not just the number of moonwalkers. Twelve Americans have walked the moon’s surface over six Apollo missions, starting with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting an American flag in 1969. (If you’re not sure about whether the lunar landing really happened, you won’t like this fact-check, but you may enjoy these bona fide moon misconceptions.) Add another 12 American astronauts who orbited the moon but did not walk on it, and you get 24. NASA chief historian William Barry said the 24 Americans is a solid figure in that it doesn’t double count Americans who made more than one lunar trip. "There were several astronauts who flew to the Moon and orbited it on one mission and then were lucky enough to go back and land on it on a later mission," Barry said. Jim Lovell, for instance, made two trips to the moon in Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, but he never walked on it. (In this Smithsonian picture, Lovell and his crew emerge from the U.S.S. Iwo Jima after landing the spacecraft Apollo 13 in the South Pacific.) … One giant leap for the truth What Maher calls the "inheritance tax" and what Republicans call the "death tax" is more accurately described as the estate tax. Some wealthy families face this tax when they pass on assets (cash, land, homes, stocks, etc.) to heirs after death. Most estates do not owe estate taxes. It affects about 5,500 Americans whose estates exceed the exemption limit of $5.43 million per person. If the estate is worth more than that, an heir could pay a tax rate up to 40 percent on the value of the estate above that limit. Even though it doesn’t affect all that many people, it brings in big bucks for the government. Repealing it would cost about $270 billion over the next decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. In the week ahead of Maher’s April 17 show, House Republicans approved a plan to eliminate the estate tax, saying it "can prove devastating to families — forcing them to sell land, lay off workers, and even shut down entirely." So did this tax really affect just "20 farmers" in 2013, as Maher said? The number comes from an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Tax Policy Center economists wanted to get an idea of how the tax would affect estates, including those with farm and business assets, in 2013. All of their numbers are estimates based on the center’s estate tax model. They defined family farms and businesses as estates having farm or business assets less than $5 million and half of the estate. These farms and businesses had taxable returns and total assets between $5 million and up $10 million. "It’s a definition that hones in on small farms and business — the most relevant in responding to the myth that many small farms and small businesses must be liquidated to pay estate tax," said Brandon DeBot, a research assistant at the federal fiscal policy division of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the Tax Policy Center’s model, an estimated 20 small farms and small businesses would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, amounting to a total of $6.9 million of tax with an average tax rate of 4.9 percent. So that’s not just small farms, it’s small farms and small businesses, which might not be a farm. Caveat No. 2: The number of farms and businesses is probably not exactly 20, as it is an estimate rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. That means the number is anywhere from 16-24. Caveat No. 3: Maher talked about "family farmers," addressing the Republican argument about the plight of farmers who could lose their livelihood because of the estate tax. But family farms can be big farms, and that’s where things get more complicated. Maher set up his comparison by discussing the plight of family farmers, but then later dropped the word "family." That one word is important. The Tax Policy Center broadened the scope to include all farm and business estates, regardless of size, with at least half of their value from farm business activity. By that method, 120 farm and business estates would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow who worked on the model. Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies federal tax and budget policy, says the the estate tax has a lot of flaws, but the effect on farmers is "just not the right grounds to criticize this tax." Maher’s point was strong, he said. In 2001, House Republicans voted to repeal the "death tax." New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston scoured 1999 IRS filings, phoned the American Farm Bureau Federation, and interviewed farmers in effort to find examples of working farmers who lost their farms because of estate taxes. He found none, writing that the reality of who is bitten by the estate tax "is different from the mythology," as "the overwhelming majority of beneficiaries are the heirs of people who made their fortunes through their businesses and investments in securities and real estate." And in 2001, the estate tax was more robust than it is now, with a lower exemption level of $675,000 and a higher top tax rate of 55 percent. "It is a small number, bottom line," Williams said. "They’re going to be the exception rather than the rule." Our ruling Maher compared 24 American astronauts who "have been to the moon" to 20 farmers whom he said were the only ones to pay the estate tax. His count for astronauts who "have been to the moon" is reasonable, counting both American moonwalkers and those who have flown in its orbit during various Apollo missions. The larger point about only 20 farmers paying the estate tax is a little more complicated. A 2013 nonpartisan study found 20 small farms and small businesses faced the estate tax in 2013. Maher referred to "family farms" in setting up his claim. Saying small farms would have been better. And he dropped "family" in later references. Experts said Maher generally could have been more careful in his wording, but that his bit of trivia largely checks out, as does his point that the estate tax affects very few small farmers. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2edf78cd-008c-408e-ae35-939322661e70	None	Bill Maher	None	None	None	2015-04-23T18:01:33	2015-04-17	['None']

pomt-14122	Before April 22, "we have restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/09/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-held-va-record-retoring-felon-voting-rig/	The shock waves still are being felt from Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s blanket restoration of voting rights on April 22 to an estimated 206,000 Virginia felons who had served their prison sentences and completed their probationary periods. Republicans say the action is a ruse to help Hillary Clinton - McAuliffe’s close friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia in November’s presidential election. GOP legislative leaders have hired a lawyer to guide an expected lawsuit challenging the governor’s authority to order the sweeping restoration. McAuliffe says it’s only right to forgive people after they’ve served their punishments and that Virginia’s traditionally steep path toward restoration of rights can be traced to Jim Crow-era efforts to exclude black voters. The governor says that before his blanket action, he already had shattered the restoration-of-rights records by previous governors. Here’s what he said during an April 22 speech on the Capitol steps, moments before announcing his blanket policy. He also republished it on Medium.com. "Today, I am proud to tell you that in a little more than two years that we have restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms." We wondered whether the McAuliffe’s figures were correct. The governor’s office sent us a data sheet with McAuliffe’s restoration numbers just before his announcement and those of every governor dating to 1938. We were able to confirm the figures of past administrations through old newspaper stories and with the help of Roger Christman, senior state governors’ archivist at the Library of Virginia. McAuliffe reports restoring the rights of 18,009 felons at the time of his announcement. Here’s how that compares with the previous seven governors, listed in descending order by their terms: •Republican Bob McDonnell, 8,111; •Democrat Tim Kaine, 4,402; •Democrat Mark Warner, 3,486; •Republican Jim Gilmore, 238; •Republican George Allen, 460; •Democrat Doug Wilder, 427; and •Democrat Jerry Baliles, 853. The seven governors restored rights to 17,977 felons - 32 fewer than McAuliffe’s total before his April 22 announcement. The seven governors, all serving four years, go back to 1986. Let’s keep going back, in descending order, to 1938: •Democrat Chuck Robb, 1,180; •Republican John Dalton, 939; •Republican Mills Godwin, 515; •Republican Linwood Holton, 303; •Democrat Mills Godwin, 260; •Democrat Albertis Harrison, 158; •Democrat Lindsay Almond, 136; •Democrat Tom Stanley, 163; •Democrat John Battle, 139; •Democrat William Tuck, 167; •Democrat Colgate Darden, 157; and •Democrat James Price, 273. If you’re wondering, the 19 governors before McAuliffe restored the rights of 22,367 felons. If McAuliffe’s action withstands legal challenge, he’ll have restored voting rights to about 224,000 felons in less than 2 1/2 years - 10 times more than the last 19 governors combined during their entire terms. McAuliffe says he’s empowered to issue a blanket restoration of rights and points to language in the Virginia Constitution that grants governors the authority to "remove political disabilities" for felons. Republicans say the governor must follow a more individualized process for restoring rights. The Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a May 3 article, said the GOP challenge could center on other language in the constitution that says no "person" convicted of a felony can vote unless "his" civil rights have been restored. Our ruling McAuliffe said that before issuing a blanket restoration of rights on April 22 to felons who had served their time, he already had "restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms." Records prove his point. We rate his statement True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/11494026-9243-4851-ab1b-4d3ca1aded06	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2016-05-09T00:00:00	2016-04-22	['None']

pomt-02385	Says his Patient OPTION Act is the only Republican plan "that completely repeals Obamacare and it takes the federal bureaucrat out of decisions for you."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/14/paul-broun/does-candidates-obamacare-repeal-plan-take-bureauc/	Georgia Congressman Paul Broun has been telling anyone who’ll listen that he has the elixir to improve the nation’s health care system. Broun, a U.S. House member from Athens, is running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate and promoting his plan -- the Patient OPTION Act -- on the campaign trail. Broun made a claim about his plan that seemed worthy of a thorough examination on the Truth-O-Meter. "Of all of the Republican plans out there, it’s the only one that completely repeals Obamacare," Broun said at a recent candidate forum, organized by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. "It takes the federal bureaucrat out of decisions for you." Broun, a doctor, most recently introduced his bill in August. His legislation, House Resolution 2900, would allow consumers to buy health care across state lines, make it easier for small businesses and other groups to band together in an effort to establish less expensive health plans, offer tax incentives to doctors who provide free health care to indigent patients, and move Medicare and Medicaid to other programs that he believes will create greater flexibility and help consumers. "Dr. Broun's Patient OPTION Act is the only healthcare alternative plan that repeals Obamacare in full and removes bureaucrats from one’s personal healthcare decisions," Broun’s spokeswoman, Christine Hardman, said in one email. The bill has yet to make it to the House floor, and it has not been reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for its potential impact on the federal budget. Several congressional Republicans have pitched their own plans to repeal the health care law, but Broun says his is the only proposal that removes federal bureaucrats from the process. Hardman gave us examples to support Broun’s claim. They included: H.R. 2900 does not require the secretary of health and human services (or anyone else at the federal level) to administer health plans put together by associations. All the other bills give the HHS secretary this power, she said. Broun’s team says his bill does not place judicial mandates on the states while the other bills have high federal involvement. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is phased out in Broun’s plan. The other bills keep CMS in place, Broun’s camp says. With no CMS, there is no bureaucracy to determine what doctors who see Medicare patients are paid, it says. Patients would be able to use the premium assistance in the bill or other means to contract with them one on one based on the services they need and want. "Without CMS, there would also be no interference with where one gets a procedure done (a physician-owned hospital vs. a traditional one), what kinds of imaging a patient can receive, and where (can you get an MRI right there, or do you have to travel to a secondary center), what type of treatment a patient can receive (can you get all of the physical therapy your condition warrants? What kind of oxygen tanks or other durable medical equipment can you use?)," Hardman said. One recent GOP plan to repeal Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was put together by a trio of Republican senators. The legislation, called the Patient CARE Act, keeps some provisions such as its requirement that insurers cover adult children younger than 27. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., has authored the Patient Centered Healthcare Savings Act, which calls for repealing Obamacare. It does allow adult children to remain on their parents’ plan until they are 23. Another bill was authored by a fellow Georgian serving in the House, Tom Price of Roswell. It would offer tax credits of nearly $5,800 to low-income families, give grant money to states to provide care through various pools, allow consumers and small businesses to buy insurance across state lines, and let private insurers offer options to Medicaid. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a companion bill to Price’s legislation. Hardman said one difference between Broun’s bill and Price’s proposal is that the latter’s legislation directs the secretary of health and human services to issue best-practice guidelines for the treatment of medical conditions. That’s an example of bureaucrats getting involved, Broun’s camp says. Price’s plan requires the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement to approve Medicare program services. The American Medical Association started the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement about a decade ago with the goal of improving patient safety. William Custer, the director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, is skeptical that Broun’s plan can be implemented. "Administering a Medicare premium assistance program requires someone to determine who is eligible and for what," Custer said. "If you’re going to give Medicare-eligible recipients (after someone, presumably in the federal government, has determined they are eligible) a voucher, are there rules as to what they can purchase with that voucher? Does it have to be health insurance, for example, and if so, are there restrictions or mandates on what’s covered? Who is going to write those rules and to ensure they are followed?" Custer wondered who would ensure elderly Americans will be sold insurance. He also wondered who would make sure a procedure or treatment is safe if CMS is not around. Broun’s bill raises another question. Once CMS is phased out, his legislation would transfer those duties within a part of the U.S. Treasury Department. Isn’t that still part of the federal bureaucracy? PolitiFact Georgia raised that question and others to Hardman. She said there would be fewer federal people involved on the administrative level. "There would still be federal bureaucrats involved at the administrative level, however, there would be thousands fewer than there are now, and as Dr. Broun stated, they would not be involved in making your healthcare decisions (the more personal decisions that are currently being made by a federal bureaucrat under Obamacare). So by transferring the duties of CMS to the Treasury Department, we would remove the middlemen and instead, empower Americans to take direct control of their own medical care," Hardman said. To sum up, Broun said his legislation would completely repeal Obamacare and takes federal bureaucrats out of individual health care decisions. There is quite a bit of context needed to understand this claim. Since the duties of CMS would be transferred to the Treasury Department, there will still be some federal officials involved in the process. Broun’s bill would make Obamacare disappear. But so would other GOP proposals. And Broun’s plan does not make the bureaucracy go away. Our rating: Mostly False.

pomt-09525	"When we go to vote, they ask for driver's license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/12/farouk-shami/shami-says-poll-workers-request-voters-drivers-lic/	Houston businessman Farouk Shami and former Houston mayor Bill White, both running for governor, politely sparred during the Democratic primary debate Monday but they agreed on at least one thing: A proposed law requiring voters to show a photo ID at the voting booth was a bad idea. Last May, House Democrats in the Texas Legislature effectively killed a Republican-backed bill that would have required voters to show photo ID — or two alternative kinds of non-photo identification, such as a utility bill — at the polls. Shami said he was opposed to the bill because he thinks current ID requirements are sufficient. Shami said: "When we go to vote, they ask for driver's license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of Texas. So, I support what we have right now." Is that what we have right now? According to Vince Leibowitz, Shami's campaign director and senior strategist, Shami was "probably talking about" Harris County, "where the clerk's office was requesting driver's licenses for people to vote." Some background: Harris County started using a computerized system in 2008 where poll workers swiped driver's licenses in lieu of checking voter registration cards during the early voting period. But Hector DeLeon, director of communications at the Harris County Clerk's office, said voters aren't required to show their licenses, nor does the clerk's office push one type of document over the other. The program, designed to expedite the voting process for voters who want to use an ID or license instead of their voter registration card, is "just an option when people show up," he said. "A good number of people show up with their license." According to state law, voters are not required to show a photo ID during early voting or on election day. If you don't have your voter card but your registration is still current, you are required to sign an affidavit at the polls and provide one of seven documents — including a driver's license, a current utility bill, a bank statement or paycheck — that shows your name and address. You can register to vote if you don't have a driver's license or a Social Security number, but you'll be flagged on the official voter registration list with an "ID" annotation, which cues poll workers to request another form of ID in addition to your voter card. So state law doesn't require voters to show a driver's license, but do poll workers still ask for it? Apparently, not in Harris County. "When somebody shows up to vote, nobody asks for this first or this second," DeLeon said. He said the Harris County Clerk's office trains poll workers in what documents are acceptable. Maybe somebody should tell the Secretary of State's election division. When we called that office, a representative told us (incorrectly) that we need a photo ID to vote — even if we have a voter registration card. She also said a driver's license is preferred. Shami is correct that poll workers verify that voters are registered — and voters can use a driver's license as a substitute for their registration card. But state law doesn't require poll workers to ask voters for their license, and voters can use other forms of ID to cast their ballots. We rate Shami's claim Half True.

pomt-03216	Florida’s "high school graduation rates continue to increase at the fastest rate in the nation, with Florida leading the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/23/pam-stewart/florida-education-commissioner-gives-props-states-/	As Florida kids enjoyed the last lazy days of summer, political players were squabbling about a series of hot education controversies. In a split vote, the Board of Education decided to soften school grades. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a complaint challenging the state’s race-based education goals. Sen. Marco Rubio came out against federal Common Core standards -- putting him at odds with the state’s other potential Republican presidential contender, Jeb Bush. And Bush bashed conservative pundits’ claims about Common Core. Meanwhile, Education Commissioner Tony Bennett resigned following allegations that he took steps to prevent a charter school led by a prominent Republican donor from getting a "C" in Indiana, where he formerly held a similar job. Bennett’s resignation led to renewed arguing about Florida’s school grading system. But hey, nothing like back-to-school week for a fresh message about optimism. In an Aug. 19 letter in the Miami Herald, interim commissioner Pam Stewart wrote that though challenges remain, Florida’s teachers and parents have many reasons to be proud. "National rankings show that Florida is moving in the right direction. High school graduation rates continue to increase at the fastest rate in the nation, with Florida leading the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates," she stated. We assigned ourselves some homework about the state of our state’s graduation rates. Diplomas Count data For the national comparison, the Florida Department of Education pointed in part to Education Week’s Diplomas Count analysis of graduation rates based on standard diplomas. The most recent analysis covered 2000-10. It is true that Florida made major gains in the graduation rate. But that’s because Florida started at such an abysmally low rate: 49.9 percent in 2000, among the lowest in the country at the time. (And as of 2010, Florida remained slightly below the national average.) Florida’s graduation rate rose to 72.9 percent in 2010 -- a 23-percentage-point increase second only to Tennessee. Much of the increase in graduation rates was due to higher rates of graduation for Latinos and blacks. As for Hispanics, Florida had a 77.1 percent graduation rate -- the highest in the country but barely in front of Virginia at 77 percent and Maryland at 76.7 percent. Diplomas Count uses a formula that captures grade-to-grade promotions each year between ninth and 12th grades and graduation. Other ways to count graduation rates Diplomas Count, which uses federal data, is only one way to measure graduation rates and has been criticized by some education experts. Florida’s overall or Hispanic-only graduation rate can vary depending on the methodology and the years examined. The federal government pointed us to two other ways to measure graduation rates: a new cohort method, which examines how many students who enter ninth grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma, and the average freshman graduation rate, which is an estimate of the percentage of an entering freshman class graduating in four years. The cohort method showed for 2010-11 that Florida’s overall graduation rate was 71 percent -- lower than all but five states (Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon) and the District of Columbia. (Louisana’s rate equaled that of Florida’s.) Since the cohort method is new, for a historical perspective we turned to the average freshman graduation rate. That data shows Florida’s graduation rate increased by a handful of points between 2003 and 2010, but so did some other states. (Florida also has its own state reports, which show gains in recent years.) Robert Balfanz, an education expert at Johns Hopkins University, examined the data between 2006 and 2010 -- the years when rates began to move nationally -- and found Florida was the ninth fastest improving state. In the case of Hispanics, under both the cohort and average freshman graduation rate methods, several states had a higher rate than Florida. Balfanz pointed to Hispanic rates in a few large states to show that Florida has a high graduation rate but doesn’t hold a unique record. The average freshman graduation rate for 2010 showed a Hispanic graduation rate of 71.1 in Florida -- slightly less than California and less than Texas at 77.4 percent. The cohort data showed Florida just a smidge under California, but again less than Texas. "Most researchers believe that the adjusted cohort method offers the promise of more accurate and more uniform rates," said Sterling Lloyd, of the entity that produces Diplomas Count. (A Harvard economist wrote extensively about the shortcomings of various methods of calculating graduation rates.) We wondered: Why would Florida Hispanics fare better than Hispanics elsewhere? " ‘Hispanics’ is a meaningless category for educational purposes," said Richard Rothstein, an education research associate at the Economic Policy Institute. "Florida’s ‘Hispanics’ are not comparable to ‘Hispanics’ in other states because Florida’s include a larger proportion of middle-class Cubans, and a smaller proportion of lower-class Mexicans. Without knowing anything else, you would expect middle-class Cubans to perform at a higher level than lower-class Mexicans, because of the literacy levels at home, if for no other reason." Economics Nobel prize winner James J. Heckman and Paul A. LaFontaine, authors of The American High School Graduation Rate: Trends and Levels, have argued that Diplomas Count is "exceedingly inaccurate" because of the "assumption that the number of students enrolled in 9th grade is the same as the number of students entering high school. This assumption artificially lowers the estimates of current graduation rates, especially for minorities who are more likely to be retained (repeat ninth grade)." They also argue that grade retention differs sharply across states and localities. Our ruling Florida’s interim education commissioner Pam Stewart said "high school graduation rates continue to increase at the fastest rate in the nation, with Florida leading the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates." That’s true -- under the Diplomas Count measurement for 2000-10. But Stewart omitted a couple of key points: Florida’s graduation rate was incredibly low and among the worst in the country in 2000 and even with the climb upward it remains below the national average. Also, Stewart is relying on the method of calculating graduation rates that puts Florida in the best light. Other methods do not show Florida as earning the top-increase spot and do not put Florida’s Hispanics at No. 1. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11363	"Application for March for Our Lives permit was made months before Parkland shooting"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/fellowship-minds/no-march-our-lives-demonstration-was-not-prepared-/	An Internet hoax has spread suggesting that the student-led demonstration March for Our Lives was planned months in advance to the actual event. "Application for ‘March for Our Lives’ permit was made months before Parkland school shooting," read the headline on Fellowship of the Minds, a website that pushes conspiracy theories and religious ideas. The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School happened on Feb. 14. Since then, student survivors have made multiple media appearances and organized events promoting increased gun control. The national demonstration March For Our Lives occurred on March 24 in Washington. An application for a permit organized by Los Angeles-based television producer and co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation, Deena Katz, was submitted on Feb. 20. The article cites a correspondence with D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Scott C. Earhardt as to why the march may have been planned in advance. After an apparent source of Light on Conspiracies author Ole Dammegard contacted the police department regarding the permit, they received a response from Earhardt with the following message: "In reference to your inquiry concerning the March for Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event." However, when we contacted Officer Scott C. Earhardt, he said that he had mistakenly mixed up the annual D.C.-based March for Life rally that happened in January with the more recent March for Our Lives demonstration in the email. Earhardt told PolitiFact that the story is not factual and that the permit for March for Our Lives was issued on March 13. The misunderstanding between the two parties is likely to have increased confusion about the actual dates of when the permit was issued. The screenshot of the email pictured in the article was credited to James Fetzer, a philosophy of science professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth who has promoted various conspiracy theories, including denying the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing and the Holocaust. March for Our Lives was organized by the Parkland student survivors who began the Never Again movement to promote gun control. They partnered with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Our ruling A website pushing conspiracy theories claimed that the March For Our Lives permit was actually prepared months in advance. We contacted the police officer referred to in the story who confirmed that the story is inaccurate and the permit was actually issued 11 days prior to the march. We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-11462	"California won’t let law enforcement officers like you and your people transfer prisoners to ICE custody or even to communicate with ICE that you’re about to release them from your custody — people that ICE is looking for."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/mar/07/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-misleading-claim-california-bans-pol/	Does California ban local law enforcement from transferring prisoners to and even communicating with federal immigration agents? U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made that claim in a speech in Sacramento on March 7, 2018, one day after the Department of Justice announced it’s suing California over allegations the state’s immigration laws obstruct federal authorities. Here’s what Sessions told a group of local and state law-enforcement officials in downtown Sacramento: "California won’t let law enforcement officers like you and your people to transfer prisoners to ICE custody or even to communicate with ICE that you’re about to release them from your custody — people that ICE is looking for." California has enacted laws — SB 54, AB 103 and AB 450 — that limit cooperation with federal immigration agents, largely in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on immigration enforcement. But do those state laws really prevent local police from transferring prisoners to and talking with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents? We set out on a fact check. Our research Experts on immigration told us Sessions’ statement includes some truth, but exaggerates the limits on local law enforcement. Police and sheriff’s officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE agents in cases where undocumented immigrants are in jail for minor crimes — unless they are presented with a federal warrant or criminal removal order. "What the attorney general did is leave out important qualifying language," said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the UC Davis Law School. "It’s not as if state and local law enforcement never have to cooperate with ICE." Senate Bill 54, often referred to as California’s sanctuary state law, says, in part, California law enforcement agencies shall not "transfer an individual to immigration authorities unless authorized by a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination." Notably, local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE when undocumented immigrants are convicted of about 800 serious misdemeanors and felonies, said Louis DeSipio, a political science professor at UC Irvine who studies immigration. "ICE is also able to enter county jails to question immigrants," DeSipio said in an email. "Transfers to ICE are authorized after conviction of 30 or so serious crimes. So, clearly, it allows for communication and transfers. State law does, however, seek to protect immigrants in jails for minor crimes and after conviction for those minor crimes." 'Sessions is wrong' One expert took an even stronger stance: "Sessions is wrong," said Bill Ong Hing, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and its director the university’s Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic. "Under Senate Bill 54, communication between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies allows passing on information about inmates who have previously been deported for a violent felony, or are serving time on a misdemeanor or felony and have a prior serious or violent felony conviction." Gov. Jerry Brown said at a news conference following Sessions’ speech that he is still willing to cooperate with the U.S. attorney general on immigration enforcement targeted at criminals. That’s possible, the governor added, because of the limitations he demanded on SB 54. When we asked for evidence supporting Sessions’ claim, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department cited in an email three "real examples of declined detainer requests and the release of criminal aliens back onto the streets of California since the implementation of SB 54." They include three separate cases of undocumented immigrants arrested in California for a range of alleged crimes, from sexual abuse of a minor to vehicle theft to felony drug possession. Our ruling U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed California prevents local law enforcement from communicating with and transferring prisoners to federal immigration agents. There are limits on cooperation under California’s SB 54. Local law enforcement are prohibited from working with immigration agents in cases where undocumented immigrants are charged with minor crimes, unless they are presented with a federal warrant. Notably, the law does not limit cooperation in cases involving 800 serious misdemeanor and felony crimes. Sessions’ statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04555	Says Obama is only president in history who has deliberately removed the words "endowed by their Creator" when referring to the Declaration of Independence.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/27/government-not-god-pac/ad-says-obama-leaves-creator-out-declaration/	Is President Barack Obama disavowing the Creator? A political action committee called Government Is Not God, or GING-PAC for short, has produced a newspaper ad claiming to reveal "the true agenda of Barack Hussein Obama." The group says it’s running the ad in several newspapers, mainly in Ohio and Florida. The black-and-white ad includes a laundry list of claims against Obama, dealing with topics from Islamic law to abortion, most of which PolitiFact has debunked as False or Pants on Fire. The kicker: an accusation that Obama puts an atheistic spin on the Declaration of Independence. Obama, it says, is the "only president in history who has deliberately removed the words ‘endowed by their Creator’ when referring to the Declaration of Independence not once but several times." First, a quick American history review. The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, proclaiming America’s separation from the British empire and asserting the right to govern itself. Here’s the most famous line, and the one at issue: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Presidents and politicians often cite that line to stir the passions of voters. But is Obama unique among presidents in skipping the religious reference? Indeed, we did find video of Obama paraphrasing the line and leaving out the "Creator." At the 2010 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute awards gala, he said it as, "we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, endowed with certain inalienable rights, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Several conservative websites appear to be tracking his omissions. But there’s also video evidence of Obama saying "their Creator" when citing the Declaration. The blog of the liberal group People for the American Way even put together a compilation video of Obama reciting the line verbatim. But Obama's not "the only president in history" who has done it. A website that investigates urban legends dug up examples of Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan omitting the "Creator." Our ruling GING-PAC’s ad says Obama is "the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words." Not so. It’s true that Obama has omitted "endowed by their Creator" in speeches, but he’s also included those words many times. And at least three other presidents -- including Ronald Reagan -- have left out the Creator. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10293	McCain is "raising campaign cash with one of (Jack) Abramoff's closest business partners: scandal-plagued conservative activist Ralph Reed."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/13/democratic-national-committee/mccain-teams-up-with-old-rival-scandals-notwithsta/	Critics of Sen. John McCain have seized on news that controversial political strategist Ralph Reed is helping McCain's campaign. The Democratic National Committee piled on in a recent news release. "On the campaign trail, John McCain likes to brag about chairing the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that investigated criminal lobbyist Jack Abramoff's role in the Republican culture of corruption," the DNC said in the Aug. 13 release. "But that is not stopping John McCain from raising campaign cash with one of Abramoff's closest business partners: scandal-plagued conservative activist Ralph Reed." Reed is the former executive director of the Christian Coalition and currently a principal of the political consulting company Century Strategies. He was credited as a key operative in George W. Bush's sharp-elbowed effort against McCain in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary in 2000. McCain, in turn, chaired the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2006 when it investigated and unveiled Reed's deep personal and business ties to Abramoff, a lobbyist who pleaded guilty to three felonies. So it came as a surprise to many political observers when the Atlanta-Journal Constitution recently published on its Political Insider blog a copy of an Aug. 7 e-mail message from Reed to Republicans around Georgia, inviting them to an Aug. 18 fundraiser for McCain Victory 2008, a committee that supports McCain's presidential run. The paper followed up with a piece in which Reed acknowledged he "sent that e-mail out," but said he did so "in my capacity as a private citizen." McCain Victory 2008 is a joint fundraising committee made up of the McCain campaign, the Republican National Committee and several state affiliates. Its purpose is to support McCain's presidential run, so it is fair to characterize its fundraising events as McCain campaign efforts. So yes, Reed and McCain are raising cash together. (There is speculation that McCain may cancel the fundraiser, but Reed's e-mail included a contribution form, so McCain's campaign and Reed are indeed actively "raising campaign cash" together.) Now for the allegation that Reed is a "scandal-plagued conservative activist" and "one of Abramoff's closest business partners." It is accurate that Reed was severely tainted, though never charged criminally, as a result of the scandals that enveloped Abramoff. A longtime conservative lobbyist, Abramoff represented Indian tribes in the gambling business, and pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiring to corrupt public officials and cheating some tribes out of tens of millions of dollars. Reed was friends with Abramoff. Their business ties dated at least to 1998, when Reed e-mailed Abramoff: "Hey, now that I'm done with electoral politics, I need to start humping in corporate accounts! I'm counting on you to help me with some contacts." That e-mail and heaps of other information about Reed's ties to Abramoff were unveiled in a 2006 report by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , which McCain chaired at the time. Abramoff arranged for Reed and his companies to receive $5.3-million to gin up opposition among Christian groups to gambling operations that would have competed with those of Abramoff's tribal clients, the Senate report said. Abramoff "had each tribe use conduits to implement their grass-roots campaigns," the report said. "Over time, those tribes became accustomed to (1) paying substantial fees for their grass-roots activities and (2) paying those fees to or through conduits. …The vendor that Abramoff and (Abramoff's partner Michael) Scanlon used, and relied on, the most to implement those campaigns was former Christian Coalition Executive Director and political strategist Ralph Reed." For example, Reed was hired to help defeat video poker machines at dog tracks, which would have competed with Abramoff's clients' casinos. Reed boasted in a letter to Abramoff: "Century Strategies has on file over 3,000 pastors and 90,000 religious conservative households in Alabama that can be accessed in this effort," the Senate report said. Reed did not return calls for comment on the DNC's news release. He said in a 2006 statement that he agreed to organize antigambling campaigns only after he was assured he "would not be paid with funds derived from gambling." Reed subsequently lost a 2006 Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Georgia. Reed's name appears 197 times in the Senate report, which ties him to numerous unseemly Abramoff efforts. So yes, he was one of Abramoff's closest business partners, and he was plagued by scandal as a result.

pomt-13106	Says Russ Feingold said that with Obamacare, "we could keep our doctors and our plans, it was rated as the Lie of the Year."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/04/us-chamber-commerce/did-wisconsin-us-senate-candidate-russ-feingold-st/	An ad from the political arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce starts with a misleading attack on Democrat Russ Feingold, saying the former U.S. senator "cast the deciding vote for Obamacare." We rated that claim Mostly False when it was made in 2015 by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent Feingold is challenging in the Nov. 8, 2016 election. (Go here to see all of our fact checks in that race.) Feingold did cast one of the 60 votes, which he touts, on a crucial measure that paved the way for final Senate passage of the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010. But to call it the deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt. Meanwhile, the chamber’s ad, which was released Oct. 28, 2016, makes more attacks on Feingold regarding the law, saying of Feingold: "He said we could keep our doctors and our plans. It was rated as the Lie of the Year." Let’s give that claim an examination. 'Keep our doctors and our plans' The chamber cites a column Feingold wrote for the La Crosse Tribune during his 2010 campaign, which ended with a loss to Johnson. The column poses questions and answers about Obamacare. It does not mention doctors, but the first question covers plans: I currently purchase my own insurance. Will this bill force me into a public plan? Feingold’s answer: No. The health care law does not create a public plan. If you like the plan you purchase, the health care reform bill does not force you to change it. So, the chamber’s claim is that Feingold said "we could keep our doctors and plans" under Obamacare. Feingold, though answering a question about a "public plan," essentially said the same -- that the law "does not force you" to change insurance plans. But we also found this statement about Obamacare on Feingold’s 2010 campaign website: You will be allowed to see the doctor of your choice and, if you like your current plan, you are free to keep it. Which brings us to the second part of the chamber’s statement. 'Rated as the Lie of the Year' The second part claims that what Feingold said was rated as the Lie of the Year. The reference is to PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year for 2013, which was this statement made repeatedly by Obama and others about the Affordable Care Act: "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." The Feingold campaign argues that insurance plans existing before 2010 were grandfathered in under the law, but that employers and insurance companies chose to make changes, causing cancellations. But our colleagues wrote that Obama’s promise "was impossible to keep": As cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong. Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief. Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology …. The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called "grandfathering," which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules. The problem for insurers was that the Obamacare rules were strict. If the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. In practice, that meant insurers canceled plans that didn’t meet new standards. Our rating The U.S. chamber says Feingold said that with Obamacare "we could keep our doctors and our plans, it was rated as the Lie of the Year." Feingold did make that statement about keeping doctors and insurance plans during his 2010 Senate campaign. And that was PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year.

The number comes from two reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, two groups that conduct an annual survey on employer health benefits.

pomt-03636	Says opponents of proposed Austin school district bonds say the district’s "debt load doubles with these new bonds."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/03/league-women-voters-austin-area/league-says-opponents-bond-package-say-approval-wo/	A Voters Guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area says opponents of an $892 million bond issue for the Austin school district say that "the Austin ISD’s debt load doubles with these new bonds." The four-part bond package appears on the district’s May 11 ballot. Early voting began in late April. League volunteer Nan Clayton, a former member of Austin’s school board, told us by phone that the debt warning reflects what league members heard in the community, though she said she couldn’t recall precisely who aired the claim. We identified a basic methodology that supports the doubling statement, though district officials said a doubling might not occur--or, if it does, the threshold would be crossed no sooner than 2018. Bond opponent Roger Falk of Austin, a member of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, pointed us to figures posted online by the Texas Bond Review Board indicating that as of Aug. 31, 2012, the district owed $750.6 million in outstanding principal with plans to pay $372 million in related interest. If voters OK the sought bonds, Falk said, the district’s outstanding principal would more than double. School district officials said it’s not that simple. By email, spokesman Antonio Lujan said the district believes its debt load will not double. "Yes, it would be the case if the district issued debt all at once for the $892.2 million" before voters, Lujan wrote, attributing his reply to unidentified financial advisers. "However, the estimate does not take into account the amount of debt that is retired annually by the district each year. The district uses a layering approach that allows the district to manage its debt load based on its cash-flow needs. For the purposes of estimating the tax impact, the district assumed an aggressive schedule for bond issuance of 5 years with a maximum projected outstanding debt load of $1.5 billion in 2018." Lujan added that the bonds, if authorized, might end up being issued over seven to eight years, which also would affect the district’s outstanding debt load. By email, he noted that another $242 million in bonds authorized by voters in 2004 and 2008 also would be issued in the time window. Leo Lopez, the district’s executive director of finance, elaborated, saying by phone that the district’s approach to financing projects--a mix of short-term commercial paper and occasional bond sales--keeps its debt lower than if it sold bonds alone. The use of short-term loans saves money, he said, with the current interest rate on such paper 0.18 percent. Also, he said, the district makes regular repayments; for instance, the plan is to repay $46.6 million in principal and $30.2 million in interest in August 2013. The pace of the proposed bonds being issued would be driven by factors including the speed of construction projects, Lopez said. "We’re not going to go and issue bonds when we don’t need the money," he said. Lopez didn’t quibble, however, when we said it still looks like the prospective district debt of $1.5 billion in 2018 would amount to double the district’s outstanding principal, as of Aug. 31, 2012, of about $750 million. A financial analyst for the bond review board, Rob Latsha, said by phone that it’s reasonable to make that comparison, though he cautioned that he hadn’t personally confirmed the district’s aired $1.5 billion figure. Latsha said it’s helpful to keep in mind that a district definitely owes its outstanding principal, while anticipated interest amounts can change depending on how the body pays it off. Latsha also said it makes sense that the district would build its outstanding principal over several years. It would take the Austin district "a while to digest this new issuance," he said. Indeed, Latsha said, the district currently plans to have its outstanding principal knocked down to $444 million as of Aug. 31, 2018, though that assumes no debt is issued in the meantime and the district sticking to its current repayment schedule, he said. Lopez, the district official, summed up by email: "In general we agree with the statement that the debt load would not double, but if it did, that would not occur until 2018, However, it is fair to say that there are a lot of events that have to transpire in order for the 5-year issuance schedule to occur, and there are lot of assumptions about construction spending, property value growth, and facilities needs built into the ‘peak debt’ year of 2018. Austin ISD may never see $1.5 billion in outstanding principal all at once, due to construction delays, defeasance (early payoff) of existing bonds, shifts in enrollment, etc." Our ruling According to the league, opponents of the district’s bond package say voter approval would double the district’s debt load. The district’s outstanding principal could total $1.5 billion by 2018, compared with $750 million as of the end of August 2012, though the district says it might take up to three years more. Then again, the district says, the doubling might not even occur depending on construction schedules and repayment/financing terms to be determined as time passes. Doubling isn’t a certainty.

pomt-11781	Under the Republican tax bill, President Donald Trump "and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/27/lloyd-doggett/how-much-does-trump-family-have-gain-gop-tax-bills/	One of the arguments from Democrats against the Republican overhaul of the tax code is that President Donald Trump, a billionaire, stands to benefit handsomely from the changes being proposed. In a Nov. 20 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas — a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee — argued that a vote for the tax bill amounts to a vote to give the president a massive windfall. "The result in the House (of passing the tax bill) was just a matter of arithmetic and was never much in doubt," Doggett said. "I am pleased that all Democrats and 13 Republicans voted against what I consider to be a real job-killing bill. I'm not surprised President Trump would come (to Capitol Hill to support the bill) because he and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally." He repeated a similar version of the claim on the PBS NewsHour. Our research suggests that Trump and his family (as well as other wealthy Americans) do stand to benefit from the bill. However, this billion-dollar talking point needs important context that Doggett didn’t provide, including key differences between the House and Senate bills. (Doggett's office did not reply to an inquiry for this article.) Also, we don’t know much about Trump's tax situation due to his own actions. The estimates we have depend on a leaked tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. Trump would save big from estate tax repeal The vast majority of the savings for Trump come from fully repealing the estate tax, which is part of the House-passed bill but not the Senate’s. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments. Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill, relying on a partial tax return from 2005. There's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump’s finances, which would skew the results of a forward-looking analysis. Still, the New York Times analysis found that Trump’s taxes could be cut by more than $1.1 billion. The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.) But the biggest benefit would come from changes to the estate tax — $1.1 billion more for Trump — under a full elimination. The NBC analysis undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group, found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax, plus $1.1 billion from shelving the estate tax. In other words, the vast majority of the "more than a billion dollars" Doggett referred to stems from the estate tax. But Doggett left out a few important pieces of context about that figure. • Trump’s finances are shrouded in secrecy. It’s important to emphasize that any estimates of Trump’s potential savings are subject to a lot of uncertainty due to a lack of hard data on his finances. Trump refused to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns (and broke his promise to release them). Trump’s current income and wealth picture is unclear, and would change by the time of his eventual death. • The final tax plan may not include a full estate tax repeal. While the House bill would end the estate tax after 2024, the Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. This would drastically lower Trump’s estimated savings to the tens of millions, rather than $1.1 billion, according to the analyses we just described. Both the New York Times and NBC analyses assumed that the estate tax would be totally eliminated when they made their calculation that Trump would save $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked at the alternative Senate approach. Doggett, a House member, was apparently referring to the House bill. However, the reality is that the fate of the estate tax -- and the subsequent effect on Trump’s taxes -- remains up in the air. • Trump wouldn’t simply "walk away" with that much money. Trump might save tens of millions of dollars in short order, according to the two media-sponsored analyses, but any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after a death, presumably years down the road. "To get it as high as $1 billion, one needs estate tax repeal, and it is certainly right to note that this would be deferred," said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. "Indeed, under present law the estate tax wouldn’t be levied until Trump’s wife died, rather than just him." Melania Trump is 47, 24 years younger than Trump. She could outlive him by decades, delaying any estate tax benefit to the family’s heirs. Our ruling Doggett said that under the Republican tax bill, Trump "and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally." Independent analyses, working from bare-bones public information about Trump’s income picture, suggest that he stands to benefit in the short term by somewhere in the low tens of millions of dollars. Getting that figure up to $1 billion requires factoring in the estate tax -- but that demands some caveats that Doggett didn’t mention. There is no certainty that the House version of the bill, which eliminates the estate tax entirely, will ultimately prevail. And the family couldn’t simply "walk off" with $1 billion in benefits; to achieve that windfall might require waiting until Melania Trump’s death several decades from now. Tens of millions of dollars in tax savings would be real money to most Americans, but it’s far less than the catchy $1 billion figure Doggett has repeatedly highlighted.

pomt-11237	Says Luke Messer and Todd Rokita "voted to fast-track Obama’s trade deals."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/04/mike-braun/indianas-mike-braun-misleads-about-opponents-recor/	Lifelong political rivals Todd Rokita and Luke Messer have been locked in a bitter personal feud to represent Indiana in the U.S. Senate for over a year. But they had reason to band together in the last debate before voting day. Mike Braun, the third challenger who touts himself as a business-savvy outsider, called his rivals advocates of former President Barack Obama — in a race that has been all about who is most aligned with President Donald Trump. Braun built his career as a businessman and served three years in the state House of Representatives and 10 years on the Jasper School Board. Messer and Rokita have represented Indiana in Congress for three and four terms respectively. The three are competing in a May 8 primary for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. "Let’s make it clear," Braun said. "They voted to fast-track Obama’s trade deals. Now, they’re acting like it’s a tool for President Trump. They can’t escape it, I know it’s tough. They try to twist it, but that’s the truth. That was Obama’s fast-tracking and look at the trade deals we got into." Messer and Rokita shot back. "Not one trade deal passed under Obama with the authority you cited," Messer said. "Not one, Mike. And you know it." "Not one trade deal passed for President Obama," Rokita said. "We made sure of that." So who’s telling the truth? Both sides make fair points. Fast-track In 2015, Messer and Rokita voted for the Defending Public Safety Employees’ Retirement Act. Tucked into that law was the Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, in question. Presidents are the usual trade negotiators, but the Constitution only allows Congress to set tariffs. So Congress can speed up, or fast-track, votes on trade by allowing for a change in the rules. That is, Congress can’t amend or filibuster a trade agreement, and the deal only needs 51 votes in the Senate to pass. These have been granted in some form or another to most presidents since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In each specific law, Congress lays out the conditions for the deals the president will negotiate. "If you are bringing back a trade agreement for an up or down vote, no amendments procedure, Congress tells the president, it has to do all these things we lay out," said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Alden said the conditions laid out in the 2015 TPA were designed for the negotiation of Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That said, the rules would apply to any trade negotiation in that time period. If the Trump administration renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement, it will also be submitted under the 2015 trade authority Messer and Rokita voted for. The 2015 law included a provision that would automatically renew it on July 1, 2018, for the next three years, unless Congress votes to block it. Trump requested its renewal on March 20. "These are modifications of the House and Senate rules (in this case the House) that apply regardless of who’s president," said Grant Aldonas, a senior advisor on international trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "So to the extent it’s characterized as voting to fast-track a particular president’s trade deal, that’s wrong." But Messer and Rokita bring up good points: TPP never came to a vote because the Republican Congress blocked it. Congress never got to give the agreement a formal up or down vote, but opponents did effectively kill the deal. To be clear, three trade deals with Colombia, South Korea and Panama passed under Obama in October 2011. But those had been primarily negotiated under President George W. Bush, and were not subject to the 2015 law in question. Our ruling Braun said Messer and Rokita "voted to fast-track Obama’s trade deals." Messer and Rokita indeed voted in favor of fast-track authority in 2015. The authority was for three years, counting toward both Obama and his successor’s trade deals. It has and will apply to Trump’s trade deals for another three years if Congress does not vote to block it come July. The law would have applied to the TPP if it had come up for a vote. But a vote in favor of the authority does not equate a vote in favor of the deal. Messer and Rokita could have still voted against "Obama’s trade deals." We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-14547	"On average it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/12/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-ad-says-it-takes-300-working-ameri/	Income disparity is a big deal in Nevada. State unemployment remains higher than the national average at 6.4 percent, and new income growth goes almost entirely to the top 1 percent of Nevadans. So maybe it’s no surprise that Hillary Clinton is blanketing Nevada with numerous television ads ahead of the Feb. 20 primaries. One ad promises to tackle the "wage gap" and has aired more than 650 times in the state, according to the Political TV Ad Archive. "On average it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO," the ad’s narrator says. "It’s called the ‘wage gap,’ and the Republicans will make it worse by lowering taxes for those at the top and letting corporations write their own rules." The opening statement of the ad is similar to other statements we’ve fact-checked on the vast chasm in pay between the average worker and top executives. We thought it merited a fresh look. Reports from left-leaning think tanks reaffirm Clinton’s claim. A 2015 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that CEOs from 350 top firms make an average of $16.3 million a year, including stock options and other forms of compensation. That averages out to about 303 times the pay of an "average worker," which matches up with Clinton’s ad. Other pro-worker sources support this claim. Labor giant AFL-CIO issues an annual "Executive Paywatch" report, which highlights the disparity between low-income workers and well-compensated CEOs. Its 2014 report says the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 373 to 1. University of Nevada, Reno economics professor Elliott Parker agreed with the studies and said in an email that the number cited by Clinton was "in the ballpark." It’s worth noting that variances in the studies are due to the fact that different groups use different metrics and methods to crunch the numbers. PolitiFact Virginia previously addressed this issue and found that there’s no standard formula for determining salary and compensation for both average workers and CEOs. This makes it hard to accurately compare the data. Right-leaning groups have poked holes in the numbers. American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry takes issue with the methodology behind the AFL-CIO study and called it "bogus/exaggerated/distorted" in an email. He says the AFL-CIO analysis makes misleading comparisons and cherry-picks data in order to make the wage gap look as high as possible. Perry says limiting the data to the top 350 companies isn’t representative for the majority of workers, and that CEOs at those highly-valued companies should be duly compensated. "The value of Apple stock ($521 billion) is more than the value of the entire stock market in Brazil," he wrote in an email. "If Tim Cook makes 300 times more than a plumber in Kansas, so what?" Part of the difficulty is that there’s no way to accurately gauge the average salary for workers at the companies headed by the 350 "top CEOs." These variances in crunching the numbers may soon be resolved. Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill requires public companies to disclose CEO and median worker compensation, and takes effect in 2017. Our ruling Clinton’s ad states that "it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO." There’s no standard metric used to measure income disparity, but Clinton’s ad seems to land on the safe side of many recent studies. Clinton hedges by sticking to a smaller number, but there are still imperfections in the methodology. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-08377	"Georgia had the worst job losses in state history under GOP watch."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/25/roy-barnes/barnes-attacks-job-losses-under-gop/	Most Georgians who've spent a few hours in front of a television set this fall have inevitably seen a message from Democrat Roy Barnes that he'll put the state "back to work" if elected governor this fall. The campaign of Republican Nathan Deal has scoffed at the idea. Deal noted in several television ads that the Peach State led the nation in job losses during one 12-month stretch when Barnes was governor. The Deal campaign said in one television ad that Barnes has tried to hide his record of "historic unemployment." Barnes campaign aides have fired back. "Georgia had the worst job losses in state history under GOP watch," the campaign said in a written response to a recent Deal television ad. Is that true? Barnes has attempted to make the state's unemployment troubles a major selling point of his candidacy. He served as governor from January 1999 to January 2003 and claimed Georgia created about 235,000 jobs during his tenure. Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows the number of Georgians employed during his tenure rose by 234,355 people. Georgia's unemployment rate also rose during Barnes' term, and so did the number of people unemployed. The man who beat Barnes, Republican Sonny Perdue, also can claim more Georgians had jobs since he took office in 2003. But as with Barnes, the unemployment rate and the number of people unemployed also have increased during Perdue's two terms. A review of unemployment data does show there have been more job losses since Perdue took charge at the state Capitol. We looked at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics website, which has the most detailed unemployment data by state. Its data goes back to January 1976. Georgia's unemployment rate has ranged from 3.3 percent in the final months of 2000 to a high of 10.5 percent earlier this year. The greatest increases in unemployment under the Barnes administration took place between November 2001 and May 2002, the months the national economy tumbled as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The largest 12-month increase in unemployment took place from February 2001 to February 2002. The number of Georgians who filed for unemployment rose by 56,809 people and the unemployment rate rose from 3.4 percent to 4.8 percent during that time period, the BLS data showed. The unemployment rate never rose above 5 percent during Barnes' tenure. The greatest increases in unemployment since Perdue was governor started in mid-2009 and continued through the middle of this year. The largest 12-month increase in unemployment took place from April 2008 to April 2009. The number of Georgians who filed for unemployment rose by 175,804 people, according to the BLS data. The unemployment rate rose during that time from 5.5 percent to 9.2 percent. The highest unemployment rate during Perdue's tenure was 10.5 percent, which was February and March 2010. It's also worth noting that there were slightly more than 1 million Georgia residents more in 2009 than there were when Barnes left office in 2003, according to U.S. census data. The Peach State's population rose from 8.68 million residents in 2003 to 9.83 million in 2009. Presumably, there are more people who need jobs now than there were when Perdue became governor. State and national Republican Party officials have blamed higher unemployment on the economic policies of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Both major political parties also say the Great Recession is a big part of the equation. Robert Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government, believes governors have a "minimal impact" on unemployment. Ward directed us to Site Selection magazine, which does an annual review of which states are best to do business, saying that's a better measure to determine a governor's effectiveness. Georgia ranked eighth in the magazine's 2009 survey, which includes the opinions of executives on what's it like to open a business. It also includes new plants and other businesses that opened. Perdue's spokesman, Bert Brantley, said that because of the Great Recession, it isn't fair to compare job losses during his administration to Barnes'. Brantley said housing, financial services and the travel industry have been particularly hit hard, which is not good for a state like Georgia. "The things that Georgia is built on are the things that have been hit hardest during the recession," Brantley said. Ward, the Rockefeller Institute expert, had similar concerns about comparing job losses between these two governors. "That's not a good way to measure the difference," he said. "There was a recession in [Barnes' term], but much less than this recent recession period." We agree. The Barnes campaign is technically right about the numbers. The current economy under Perdue is widely considered to be the worst in about 80 years. But it's difficult to say how much blame can be attributed to the state GOP since Georgia's economy operates against the backdrop of a precipitous national downturn. We believe the Barnes statement needs additional information to be considered in its proper context. Still, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-09756	Forty percent of gross domestic product "is state, local, or federal money."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/06/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-says-government-accounts-40-percent-/	Part of the frustration voiced by critics of President Barack Obama stems from the notion that the government has simply grown too big. But just how big is the government? ABC News commentator Cokie Roberts offered one estimate: Government spending accounts for 40 percent of gross domestic product. Here's what Roberts said on the Oct. 4, 2009, edition of This Week With George Stephanopoulos : "You know, right now, 40 percent, 40 percent of GDP is state, local, or federal money. I mean, that's an incredible number. So that, you know, adding more [government spending] to that, I think, is going to ... distort things even more. And the public is so concerned about it." Could such a large number possibly be right? We contacted economists familiar with this topic to give us an idea of what goes into these numbers. And wading through the data is messy indeed. Marc Goldwein, an economist with the New America Foundation, framed the conundrum in this mind-bending fashion: "What percent of GDP is made up of government spending is a different question from what government spending equals as a percent of GDP." That's because when a government "transfers" money — such as through Social Security — it is shifting money around rather than spending it directly. "This can have real and large effects on GDP, but it does not directly impact GDP, since tax and transfer policies simply take money that one person could be using for consumption or investment and give it to another person to use for consumption or investment," he said. The decision to exclude transfers underlies one set of federal economic statistics — the so-called National Income and Product Account data collected by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Using these figures, direct government consumption and investment amounted to just under 20 percent of GDP in 2007, the most recent year available. That's only about half of what Roberts said it was. But there's also a second way of thinking about this question — and using this method brings the percentage closer to what Roberts cited. Adding all federal spending, including transfers, for 2008 ($2.98 trillion) to state and local government spending (estimated to be between $1.72 trillion and $2.2 trillion) gets government spending to between 33 percent and 35 percent of GDP. This, too, is short of Roberts' 40 percent -- but there's an important caveat. This year, the recession has driven federal spending higher (think of the stimulus package) and sent GDP lower (due to slumping economic activity). These twin developments could spike government's percentage of GDP for 2009, quite possibly above 40 percent, although this rise could be offset somewhat by lower state and local spending, since many states are constitutionally bound to balance their budgets and must cut back as tax revenues decline. Obviously, this sort of calculation is tricky on a number of levels. Most importantly, the nation is in the midst of a recession and engaging in deficit spending to get out of it — yet the data that are available have not caught up to the new reality. So, while the government's percentage of GDP for 2009 and beyond is likely to rise, saying so requires the use of preliminary estimates and educated guesses rather than hard data. Still, we spoke to several liberal and conservative economists, none of whom objected to including transfers in the data, and all of them said they expected the 2009 figure to be either 40 percent or close to it. Still, using the latest data, Roberts is off by 5 percentage points. So we find her claim Mostly True.	None	Cokie Roberts	None	None	None	2009-10-06T19:12:15	2009-10-04	['None']
pomt-07753	Says Florida's pension plan faces the same long-term funding problems as Social Security.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/25/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-compares-state-pension-problems-soc/	Give him credit: Though Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to eliminate about 10 percent of the state workforce over two years, and make those who remain pay more toward their retirement and health care, the new governor is at least taking the time in his first few months in office to meet with state employees and answer their questions. Scott has visited close to 10 state agencies and departments, explaining his style of governing, praising government employees as hard-working, and defending his tough choices to reduce the government payroll. The events have been interesting to watch because state employees have become more and more willing to ask Scott tough questions about his plans for state workers. One of the more remarkable exchanges came on Feb. 23, 2011, during a short meet-and-greet with employees at the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which assists Florida businesses and workers. During his opening remarks, Scott praised the department for its work before opening up the floor to questions. That's when a worker dissected Scott's plan to make workers contribute 5 percent of their salary to their retirement, framing it as punitive. "Do you fully realize the gross unfairness of that proposal?" the worker asked Scott. Scott said a change was needed and that, "You never know exactly what's fair." Then he compared the defined pension system to the federal Social Security program to illustrate the need for reform. "Everybody here wants a plan they can rely on. Right now, your plan is underfunded, whether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not," Scott said. "Pension plans all across this country, including Florida, are underfunded. So whoever the youngest is, everyone else should thank them because there might not be a pension plan, just like we're worried about Social Security." We were struck by Scott's comparison of the state pension plan and the federal Social Security program and thought it merited analysis. Pension proposals Scott has proposed massive reforms to the state's retirement plan. Among them, he wants to close the state defined pension program to employees hired after July 1, 2011, and force them into a 401(k)-style plan where participants make their own investments. He also wants employees to contribute 5 percent of their gross salary to help fund their retirement benefits, and proposes reducing the benefit calculation for members of the state's special risk group (police and fire), elected officers and senior management classes of employees. Currently, the state retirement system has more than 655,000 active working members. Nearly half of the participants work in K-12 schools, and another 28 percent work in city and county government. Only about 18 percent of the system is made up of state workers. Of current members, 85 percent participate in a defined pension program, and 15 percent participate in a 401(k)-style plan. (Scott's proposals would affect all members of the retirement system in both plans). The pension system generally has been well-funded through required state and local employer contributions, according to state Department of Management Services annual actuarial studies. The study measures the value of the pension's assets against liabilities it is required to pay as people retire and new workers are hired. The work is hugely complex but tries to answer a basic question: Is there enough money coming in currently to pay the benefits going out? The answer in Florida, until 2009, was yes, according to actuarial studies. But when the investment markets collapsed as part of the recession, Florida's pension assets went with them. The state pension system reported nearly a $17.5 billion unfunded liability in 2009 ($118.9 billion in assets versus $136.4 billion in liabilities) and nearly an $18.8 billion unfunded liability in 2010 ($120.9 billion in assets versus $139.7 billion in liabilities). As a percentage, that means the pension fund can currently cover about 87 percent of its obligations. The underfunding problem is not confined to just Florida's plan. Joshua Rauh, a Northwestern University economist and one of the leading critics of state-run pension plans, argued in a controversial paper that many state plans were on a path to running out of money. The 2010 paper said that without reform, state retirement plans would start running out of money in 2018. Only five states would never run out of money, Rauh estimated, including Florida. To some, the underfunding of Florida's pension system sounds worse than it is. The size of the pension fund fluctuates based on the result of the investments the state makes with the money through the State Board of Administration. And the money will be paid out over a long period of time as employees retire and start collecting benefits. That means the state has 20 to 30 years or more to fill that gap. Industry experts say that a government pension plan is considered well-funded if it can meet 80 percent of its obligations, and Florida has been considered one of the best funded government pension programs in the nation. But some economists disagree with the 80 percent funding level, noting that government plan funding levels are measured expecting an 8 percent annual return on investments, and that isn't always possible. Florida bases its projections on an assumed 7.75 percent return. Still, the Pew Center on States studied state government pension plans in 2010 and said that Florida had one of the top five funded pension programs in the country. The Pew study called Florida's pension a "model for success." Social Security woes That's not how people generally describe the federal Social Security program. The federal entitlement program is now paying out more money than it is taking in through payroll taxes. The government is able to continue paying full benefits because of the Social Security Trust Fund, but those funds are expected to be exhausted by 2037. After that, Social Security is only expected to have enough money to pay out 78 percent of benefits. A 2010 report from the Social Security trustees shows that over the next 75 years, Social Security has an unfunded liability of $7.9 trillion, meaning the program will have to pay out $7.9 trillion more in benefits than it will receive in tax revenues. The $7.9 trillion includes $2.5 trillion to repay special issue bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund and $5.4 trillion to pay benefits after the trust funds are emptied in 2037. "The longer you wait, the harder it is to fix," said David John, with the conservative Heritage Foundation. So anecdotally, Social Security sounds in far worse shape than Florida's pension system. But we wanted to try to compare the two with data. So we asked John, who is an expert on retirement programs, if there was an appropriate way to measure the two against each other. We suggested maybe comparing the unfunded liability of each program against the size of the federal and state budget. But John said that using budgets as a comparison would give weight to how governments philosophically spend their money. Also, the federal government funds national defense -- not the state, John said. A better but not perfect comparison, he suggested, would be to measure the unfunded liability of each program in relation to the size of the national or state economy -- the gross domestic product. According to the Social Security Administration, the unfunded obligations of Social Security over the next 75 years represent 1.2 percent of national GDP. According to Moody's Investors Service, Florida's pension liabilities represent 2.37 percent of state GDP. Florida's liabilities are measured over 30 years. So the data seems to fly in the face of the accolades Florida usually receives. Our ruling Where does this leave us? Scott said that without changes, "there might not be a pension plan, just like we're worried about Social Security." There's no real suggestion that Florida's pension plan faces a major crisis, even from Rauh, a pension critic who believes most government plans are doomed. That said, Florida's plan -- like most government programs -- is underfunded and needs either reform or better investment returns over the long run. In that way it's not that unlike Social Security, a federal program that must be reformed in the coming years to avoid benefit cuts. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-12316	"A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the (Paris climate) deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration."	false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/21/gus-bilirakis/gus-bilirakis-cites-flawed-study-defend-us-wit/	U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, defended the president’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, claiming it would save millions of jobs in a letter to constituents. "A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration," Bilirakis said. A reader who received the letter asked us to look into it. Would the United States have lost 2.7 million jobs had it remained in the agreement? This is a statistic President Donald Trump also cited in his speech declaring the withdrawal, but we found that the study is based on an extreme model, and its results were presented in a misleading way. Bilirakis’ office directed us to Trump’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord, citing the same study. But when we asked NERA about it, the organization forwarded the same statement they put out following Trump’s speech. "Use of results from this analysis as estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement alone mischaracterizes the purpose of NERA’s analysis, which was to explore the challenges of achieving reductions from U.S. industrial sectors over a longer term," it states. "Selective use of results from a single implementation scenario and a single year compounds the mischaracterization." Here’s why plucking the 2.7 million-lost jobs talking point is a bad idea. The study predicts the potential impact of hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris. It was produced in March 2017 and funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both vocal opponents of the agreement. The loss of 2.7 million jobs economy-wide by 2025 reported in the study is contingent on "additional regulatory actions necessary to meet the Paris target." But the Paris agreement does not require actions, as it was not binding, and the regulatory action mentioned has not been proposed. The study begins, then, with the assumption that regulation would expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. According to law professor Cary Coglianese, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation and author of Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, the study is a forecast based on an erroneous model. "How accurate that forecast or any forecast will be depends upon how well the model matches reality and the world. The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn’t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy," Coglianese said. According to Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that received a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the model does not accurately reflect government regulation or the energy industry’s reaction to market trends. "They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the Unites States agreed to under the Paris accord," Yohe said, but "they pick the least efficient way of doing it." The hypothetical regulations they impose are inflexible, ruling out cap-and-trade or taxes and instead set strict regulations on specific sectors. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions. "The findings contained in this report may contain projections based on current data and historical trends," the report states. "Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled, including, without limitation, changes in business strategies, the development of future products and services, changes in market and industry conditions, the outcome of contingencies, changes in management, and changes in law or regulations." The development of future products and services, though, is precisely what the renewable energy industry is all about. But the study assumes the economy and technology will remain unchanged. "There’s no inclusion in the analysis of the growth or development of renewable energy sources, for example," Coglianese said. "And one thing we know about jobs, renewable energy sources tend to result in hiring of more people and more jobs than in other parts of the energy sector." "According to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. So while the quote in the NERA study seems to conflate job loss with unemployment, it ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement. Our ruling Bilirakis said that the Paris accord could cost the United States 2.7 million jobs by 2025, citing a NERA study that presented this projection. But the study is unreliable, using an extreme model that does not consider the possible benefits of carbon regulation and rules out investment, flexibility or technology that would lead to more jobs. And as NERA itself stated, the study was not designed as a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris accord. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14655	"Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/21/mike-rogers/mike-rogers-says-trump-appeals-democrats-much-repu/	Can the Republican establishment steer GOP voters away from Donald Trump? Pundits on CNN chewed over the matter recently, with one conservative arguing they shouldn’t try. "I think we're missing one important point here. Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans," said Mike Rogers, a former Republican congressman from Michigan and CNN's national security commentator, on Jan. 12. Rogers said people who don't see this are "missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He's got this whole group of Democrats for Trump, it's an economic issue. … This is a Republican Party attracting Democrats, independents, Reagan Democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken." We were intrigued by the idea that Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans, so we asked Rogers' office for his sources. We also checked some national polls. First stop: the latest Fox News Poll, jointly conducted by a Democratic and Republican polling firm from Jan. 4 to 7. The results were reported four days before Rogers' statement. It surveyed 1,006 registered voters by phone and found that in a matchup with Hillary Clinton, Trump's level of support was 84 percent among Republican but only 9 percent among Democrats. The latest Quinnipiac poll to look at the question, conducted Dec. 16-20 among 1,140 registered voters, found that while 82 percent of Republicans would support Trump, only 4 percent of Democrats would vote for him in a matchup with Clinton. So Democratic support for Trump doesn't come close to his level seen among Republican voters. When we asked Rogers about his sources, his spokeswoman sent us two articles, one from the New York Times and the other an opinion piece from U.S. News & World Report. The Times analysis is based on surveys by Civis Analytics of more than 11,000 people who say they lean Republican. Trump's support was 43 percent among Republicans who are still registered as Democrats. But that group makes up only 8 percent of the respondents who said they tend to support the GOP, and Civis spokeswoman Lisa Kornblatt told us no Democrats were included in the survey. Arguing that Civis polling shows that Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans "is a misrepresentation of our data," she said. The results from Mercury Analytics, cited in the U.S. News & World Report opinion piece, found that a hefty 19 percent of likely Democratic voters would cross party lines and vote for Trump if the election were held when the online survey was conducted, January 6-8. But, in contrast, Trump was supported by 73 percent of Republicans, making him nearly four times more popular among Republicans. "If the claim was truly 'Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,' this is completely untrue – ridiculous," Mercury CEO Ron Howard wrote in an email. The Mercury poll also found that 14 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Our ruling CNN commentator and former congressman Mike Rogers said, "Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans." A January 2016 Fox News poll found Trump was nine times more popular among Republicans than Democrats, when matched up against Clinton. A December 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that the billionaire was 20 times more popular. Rogers, in contrast, cited one survey that didn't even poll people who said they leaned Democrat and another that found Democrat support for Trump was only about one quarter of what it was among Republicans. The relevant numbers render Roger's assertion ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-09126	"While Exxon Mobil has 40 pages on its media response strategy, its plan for resource protection is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/16/bart-stupak/exxon-oil-spill-clean-plan-has-long-detailed-media/	At a Congressional hearing looking at how oil companies respond to oil spills, here was an unlikely claim: Exxon Mobil's emergency plan for dealing with an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has 40 pages on how to deal with the media, but only nine pages on how to clean up a spill. The statement sounded improbable to us. Isn't answering media questions easier than cleaning up a major oil spill? So we decided to check it out. The hearings, held June 16, 2010, were aimed at letting members of Congress grill the oil executives on their plans, and they were held by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Another Congressman, Bart Stupak, was particularly concerned about how similar the clean-up plans of all the major oil companies seemed to be. "It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the bunch," Stupak said. "But, unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of company. Exxon and other oil companies are just as unprepared to respond to a major oil spill in the Gulf as BP." He singled out Exxon Mobil, though, for particular criticism. Unlike the rest of the companies, Stupak said, Exxon Mobil devoted 40 pages to how to handle the media, everything from suggested statements to pre-written press releases to instructions on directing questions about global warning and the Exxon Valdez spill to corporate headquarters. "While Exxon Mobil has 40 pages on its media response strategy, its plan for resource protection is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long," Stupak said. "If a public affairs officer is asked about criminal charges, the plan instructs them to say, 'We believe that there are no grounds for such charges. This was clearly an accident and we are working to respond to the immediate needs of the incident,' " the Michigan Democrat added. "That talking point is ready to go before a hypothetical incident even occurs, before Exxon Mobil could have any idea of whether it was actually an accident or if there are any grounds for criminal charges. In short, Exxon Mobil has meticulously anticipated virtually every conversation that the company might need to have with the media in the days following an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico." The committee released the reports of the companies as part of their investigation. So we reviewed Exxon Mobil's 663-page plan to see if Stupak's description was accurate or exaggerated for effect. First, we'll look at the section on how Exxon handles the media. It starts on page 557 with Appendix K and continues to page 596. That's 39 pages. And just as Stupak said, it contains detailed outlines for roles and responsibilities involving the media. Questions about global warming and the Exxon Valdez are categorized as including "sensitive corporate issues" that should be handled by Exxon headquarters. "Category D requires referral to EMCorp for response and should not be included in press releases or response statements issued from site/region or Functional HQ," the document said. The appendix also includes sample press releases and suggested statements for an index of topics. Yes, it does have the pre-written denial of grounds for criminal charges. So Stupak is right about the press section of the document. BP's media section, by the way, is only six pages long. Chevron's is five pages, ConocoPhillips' is five pages and Shell's is four pages. Next, we looked at Section 13 in the Exxon plan, which is "Resource Protection Methods." It runs from pages 330 to 334, which is five pages. It includes a list of things the company might do to protect wildlife, everything from the deployment of several types of booms, using chemical dispersants and "in situ" burning (burning oil to prevent spreading) to removing sea turtle nests and playing the recorded sounds of live birds. We also looked at Section 15, "Oil and Debris Removal Procedures." It runs from pages 350 to 358, or nine pages. It includes some of the same elements as the previous section, including the use of booms, chemical dispersants and burning. So Stupak is largely correct in his descriptions. We did notice that a few of the elements described in those sections, though, were explained in greater length in other sections of the report. There are an additional seven pages on wildlife rehabilitation, an additional 23 pages on using chemical dispersants, and another 14 pages on burning. So that's an additional 44 pages. We asked Exxon Mobil for a response on Stupak's charges, but we didn't hear back. During the hearing, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson didn't directly address why the media section was so long. But he did defend the fact that all of the oil companies' plans are highly similar to BP's plan. "You know, the aspect of the plan, the cookie-cutter characterization, should not come as much of a surprise, because the industry has relied on sharing of resources -- boats, booms, skimmer equipment. And in working with the Coast Guard and federal agencies, what we really should have is a unified plan. Because it doesn't matter whose well has the problem, when it has the problem, we need to be able to respond with everything we have available. So those plans look the same because in fact they call upon the same resources to respond," Tillerson said. In rating Stupak's statement, we find he is largely accurate in his description that the Exxon Mobil plan "has 40 pages on its media response strategy" while its plan for resource protection "is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long." We did notice that other sections of the plan expand on some of the topics listed in resource protection and oil removal. Nevertheless, Exxon's media plan is highly detailed and lengthy, particularly when compared with the other oil company plans and other sections of its own report. So we rate Stupak's statement Mostly True.	None	Bart Stupak	None	None	None	2010-06-16T14:19:37	2010-06-15	['ExxonMobil']

pomt-08432	Ken Buck wants to "outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/18/michael-bennet/ken-buck-opposes-abortion-including-cases-rape-or-/	The race for U.S. Senate in Colorado is neck-and-neck between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and Republican Ken Buck. Bennet, a former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, was appointed to the seat when then-Sen. Ken Salazar became the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration. Buck, the district attorney for Weld County, has support from the tea party movement and defeated a more establishment rival in the Republican primary. A recent ad from Bennet attacks Buck's views as out of the mainstream. "Extreme beauty, extreme sports -- good extremes in Colorado," the ad says. "But what about Ken Buck's extreme ideas? Do we really want to privatize Social Security and risk it in the stock market? ... Are we ready to outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest? Extreme beauty is a good thing, but Colorado's no place for Buck's extreme ideas." We fact-checked the charge that Buck wants to privatize Social Security, and we rated that statement Half True. We found that Buck has been clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring. This time we wanted to look at Buck's views on abortion. During a debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 17, moderator David Gregory asked Buck about waffling on issues like abortion, which made us wonder if Bennet's charge that Buck wants to "outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest" was true. We want to be clear here that we're not checking whether Buck's views on abortion are "extreme" but only whether the Bennet ad accurately characterizes them. Our first stop was Buck's website. "As a father of two, Ken believes in the value of life and is opposed to abortion except to protect the life of the mother," the site says. "As U.S. Senator, Ken will oppose federal funding of abortion and will fight to protect the life of the unborn." We then turned to news coverage of Buck's public statements. Buck has said in response to questions from voters that he opposes abortion and that includes pregnancies that result from rape or incest. "I don't believe in the exceptions of rape or incest. I believe that the only exception, I guess, is life of the mother," Buck said. "And that is only if it's truly life of the mother. To me, you can't say you're pro-life and say -- if there is, and it's a very rare situation where one life would have to cease for the other life to exist. But in that very rare situation ... we may have to take the life of the child to save the life of the mother. In that rare situation, I am in favor of that exception. But, other than that, I have no exceptions in my position." In the course of our research, we noted two instances in which Buck has changed position on abortion-related issues, but neither one was about exceptions for rape or incest. Earlier in the campaign, Buck indicated he favored a state constitutional amendment that would have granted personhood to people "from the beginning of biological development." Later, he backed off full support for the amendment, because some people believe the amendment will outlaw some forms of birth control. "I have said that I am in favor of personhood as a concept," Buck said in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS's Face the Nation. "I am not taking a position on any of the state amendments, and I have said over and over again -- and it has been reported over and over again -- that I am not in favor of banning any common forms of birth control in Colorado or in the United States." His website also says, "Ken believes life begins at conception and does not favor doing away with common forms of birth control, like the pill." The other question has been whether Buck would vote to confirm presidential nominees who favor abortion rights. Buck indicated earlier in the campaign that he would not confirm such nominees, but later he said he would only oppose nominees who are activists for abortion rights. "I won't use abortion as a litmus test with a pro-choice individual," Buck told Schieffer. "Someone that is an activist on the abortion issue, I think, goes outside the pale, and I cannot support an activist on the abortion issue." To be clear, we did not find any instance of Buck changing position from the view that abortion law should not include exceptions for rape or incest. And a campaign spokesperson reaffirmed that position. "Ken is pro-life, and only has one exception -- that's when the life of the mother is at risk," said Owen Loftus. But Loftus also said that Buck is focused on economic issues and government spending. "The reality is that the Senate only deals with a few abortion related issues -- partial birth abortion and public funding. Ken would not support either. This ad is another example of how Michael Bennet wants to talk about anything but the issues that Coloradans care about -- creating jobs, controlling spending and getting our economy back on track." In reviewing the record, Buck has said he opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape or incest. We did not find any evidence of him changing position on that issue over the course of the campaign. So we rate Bennet's statement True.	None	Michael Bennet	None	None	None	2010-10-18T18:14:09	2010-10-15	['United_States_Senate_election_in_Colorado,_2010']
pomt-02271	"Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? … More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/08/jay-carney/white-house-says-most-those-helped-its-minimum-wag/	White House Press Secretary Jay Carney did his part last week to promote President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. In a tweet on April 3, 2014, Carney forwarded a meme created by the White House. It read: "Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? You might be surprised that: More than half are women. More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old." We recently checked a similar claim about women and the minimum wage and found it Mostly True. But we thought it would be worth checking the claims that more than half of those who’d be helped by a minimum-wage increase currently work full-time, and that the average worker who would be helped is 35 years old. When we first looked at the data, we were suspicious. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics we had used in previous fact checks seemed to tell a different story. But as we’ll see, the White House has found another way to look at the numbers. When we asked the White House for their supporting data, they pointed us to a slideshow from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers and a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group. The specific data points in the meme appear be drawn from the institute’s study. The Economic Policy Institute study made its calculations using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rather than studying just the people earning the minimum wage today, it looked at anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour. There’s some logic behind this. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 doesn’t just raise wages for those earning $7.25 an hour, but rather for everybody earning less than $10.10. In addition, David Cooper, the author of the report, told PolitiFact that his calculations actually included everyone currently earning up to $11.10. That’s a dollar more than Obama’s proposed minimum wage level, but this decision was based on the assumption that anyone earning slightly above $10.10 at the time of the minimum-wage hike would also get a small boost, in order to keep them nestled correctly in a company’s wage hierarchy. Reasonable people can differ about the wisdom of these assumptions, but the important point for this fact-check is that doing it EPI’s way produces a starkly different image of the low-income workforce than one would get from looking just at people who earn the minimum wage today. (This data is available in a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released last month, "Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013.") To see these distinctions in action, let’s start with the question of full-time versus part-time work. Hours worked per week EPI data (workers earning up to $11.10) BLS data (workers currently earning minimum wage or less) Less than 20 14.2% 22% 20-34 hours 32.0% 43% More than 35 hours ("full time") 53.8% 35% This chart shows that, according to the study cited by the White House, almost 54 percent of workers earning up to $11.10 worked more than 35 hours a week, which is considered "full time." That helps the White House create a sympathetic image -- a person working long hours to support themselves, rather than someone just looking for some extra spending money. If, however, you use the BLS report, which looks at people who currently earn the minimum wage, a much smaller share of minimum-wage workers -- just 35 percent -- worked "full time." Using this data, almost two-thirds of minimum-wage workers work part time, more closely fitting the preferred image of wage-hike opponents. Now let’s look at age. First, we should note that the White House did a bit of cherry-picking. It cited EPI’s "average" age of 35, when the median age -- the exact midpoint in the distribution of ages -- is several years younger at 30, Cooper told PolitiFact. Now, here is the full breakdown: Age EPI data (workers earning up to $11.10) BLS data (workers currently earning minimum wage or less) Less than 20 12.5% 40% 20-29 36.5% 31% 30-39 16.6% 11% 40-54 20.8% 12% 55 and over 13.7% 6% The numbers from EPI and the White House show a noticeably older skew to low-income workers. A slight majority of workers earning under $11.10 are at least 30 years old, according to their favored data. But if you look just at minimum wage workers using the BLS data, a full 71 percent are younger than 30. So the White House can paint a picture of middle-aged and older Americans getting a boost from the proposal, since a majority of the people helped by a $11.10 minimum wage are at least 30 years old. At the same time, opponents of the wage hike can counter that today’s minimum-wage earners are basically kids just starting out, since a plurality of current minimum-wage earners are younger than 20. In other words, the predominant image of who benefits from a minimum-wage hike depends on whether you factor in, or leave out, Americans who earn between $7.25 and $10.10 an hour. Weighing the value of both models In reality, both approaches have some pitfalls. Even as the White House asks, "Who will raising the minimum wage actually help?" the meme sidesteps any mention of who might be hurt from raising the wage to $10.10. In February, the independent Congressional Budget Office looked at the impact of the $10.10 proposal and found both positives and negatives. On the upside, the change would raise salaries for 16.5 million people and lift 900,000 out of poverty. On the downside, total employment could be reduced -- possibly by as much as 1 million, but more likely by around 500,000. By not acknowledging this estimate, the White House presents a one-sided view of its policy proposal. Yet those who would cite the BLS study also have their own shortcomings to acknowledge. The BLS report on minimum wage workers describes only those workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below. It doesn’t include workers in states with higher state minimum wages, Cooper said -- even the "minimum wage" worker in Missouri who makes $7.35 per hour. Because 21 states and the District of Columbia have state minimums that exceed the federal minimum, slightly more than half the nation’s workforce is excluded from the BLS study, making the usefulness of its data somewhat questionable. "Although both approaches present reasonable ways of describing the characteristics of those that will be affected by a raise in the minimum wage, neither one necessarily properly characterizes who will be helped by a raise in the minimum wage," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling The White House meme asked, "Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? … More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old." The White House’s math is credible because it carefully framed the question as "who gains from a minimum-wage hike to $10.10," rather than "who currently earns the minimum wage" -- a common yardstick used by its opponents. Still, the White House’s portrayal is somewhat one-sided because it leaves out the negative impacts of raising the minimum wage, which have been pointed out by such independent groups as the CBO.

pomt-13995	Says Obama "called Kagan a moderate. He called Sotomayor a moderate."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/07/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-mostly-right-about-obama-selling-previou/	Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says that just because President Barack Obama says his Supreme Court nominations are moderate doesn’t mean they are. McConnell, who appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, discussed Merrick Garland, Obama’s nomination for the vacant Supreme Court seat May 31. Co-host Mika Brzezinski characterized Garland as a middle of the road nomination, but McConnell quickly clarified that this was not the case, adding that just because Obama calls someone a moderate doesn’t make it true. McConnell has joined other Senate Republicans in pledging not to consider Garland’s nomination in an election year. Obama said the same things about previous nominees Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, McConnell told Brzezinski. Obama "called Kagan a moderate. He called Sotomayor a moderate," McConnell said. Is that true? Yes, and no. Obama never used those words to describe his two previous Supreme Court nominees. But he has talked up their bipartisan credentials. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart referenced Obama’s nomination speeches for Sotomayor and Kagan as evidence. Stewart said that Obama described Sotomayor as having bipartisan support during his remarks following the announcement of her nomination in 2009. "It's a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court by a Republican President, George H.W. Bush, and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat, Bill Clinton," Obama said. Stewart also pointed to Obama’s remarks from Elena Kagan’s nomination speech that characterized her as a "consensus builder" and which made clear her openness to viewpoints of all kinds. Each instance, Obama characterizes the Supreme Court appointees as open minded. But he never used the word moderate. What’s the difference? Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that just because Obama didn’t use the word moderate doesn’t make McConnell wrong. "The point is that Obama was selling his nominees as in the legal mainstream, of good temperament, and generally suitable for high judicial office," Shapiro said. "That’s not uncommon. Indeed, it’s good PR." Shapiro also said that there are some common themes among the characterization of the presidents’ nominations for Supreme Court. "Consensus building and respect by all sides seems to be, on this unscientific canvas, a fairly common characteristic," Shapiro said. For example, President George W. Bush described nominees Samuel Alito and Harriet Miers in a similar way. "(Alito) is scholarly, fair-minded and principled. ... In the performance of his duties, Judge Alito has gained the respect of his colleagues and attorneys for his brilliance and decency. He's won admirers across the political spectrum," Bush said of Alito. "Harriet has built a reputation for fairness and integrity," Bush said. President Bill Clinton did the same. Speaking of nominee Stephen Breyer, Clinton said, "He has proven that he can build an effective consensus and get people of diverse views to work together for justice's sake." On Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton said: "I believe that in the years ahead she will be able to be a force for consensus-building on the Supreme Court . . . Judge Ginsburg has also proven herself to be a healer, what attorneys call a moderate." Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert with the Brookings Institution said moderate is a "comparative term," so its validity depends on who you're comparing the person too. "When Sotomayor was on the court of appeals, there were other court of appeals judges across the country who were more liberal than she was, and by the same token, law professors and deans more liberal than Kagan when Obama nominated her," Wheeler said. "I presume that’s the context of what Obama was supposed to have said, according to McConnell." Our ruling McConnell said Obama has called his last two Supreme Court appointments "moderate." The president didn’t use that word, but he did use language that characterizes them as liked by both sides.

His most recent tweet was from June 26 with a letter from Bush supporting Houston’s bid to host the 2020 Democratic convention. The day before, he retweeted a story about Bush getting a new dog named Sully. Former president Bill Clinton was there to welcome the dog, as well. Bush has his own Twitter account.

pomt-00109	Says Dan Feehan "would vote with Pelosi for open borders and amnesty, putting Minnesota families at risk."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/29/congressional-leadership-fund/despite-claim-minnesotas-dan-feehan-isn/	A new ad from a Republican-backed super PAC has a scary message about Democrat Dan Feehan for voters in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District: "Gang members and criminals" are marching toward the U.S. southern border in a caravan with thousands of potential immigrants from Central America — and if Feehan were elected, he just might let everyone in. The ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, hoping to keep a Republican majority in the U.S. House, juxtaposes the march-toward-the-border footage with a question: "Who is tough enough to secure our border? Not Dan Feehan. In Washington, Feehan would vote with Pelosi for open borders and amnesty, putting Minnesota families at risk." The concern about criminals has been heard since President Donald Trump stated it in tweets, speeches and remarks to reporters. Numerous news stories say the march that started in Honduras is full of people fleeing violence and economic turmoil. But Tyler Q. Houlton, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a tweet on Oct. 23 that the department "can confirm that there are individuals within the caravan who are gang members or have significant criminal histories." It is uncertain what will happen when the crowd arrives at the United States border, where some are expected to request asylum. Trump is working to increase barriers to entry and has spoken of sending soldiers, saying the caravan is "an assault on our country." Would Feehan really vote for open borders, and for that matter, would Pelosi? We went to find out. Their policy Few if any lawmakers and congressional aspirants have a policy that addresses the question, What to do about caravans? But none say they want to throw open the borders. Since the CLF says Feehan would vote for open borders and for amnesty, we asked his campaign if that’s what he wants. "Dan obviously does not," Sara Severs, Feehan spokeswoman, said. "As a decorated Iraq combat veteran, the safety and the security of this nation is personal to Dan and he believes our nation needs to secure our borders and pass comprehensive immigration reform to address our immigration challenges." Feehan’s campaign website includes a page dedicated solely to immigration. He says he wants "a pathway to citizenship for those who pay their taxes and don’t have a criminal record." He wants to hold "employers who hire undocumented immigrants accountable," and develop "a robust guest worker program." He also says that as a veteran, "when it comes to public safety, let me be perfectly clear, no matter who you are, if you commit a violent crime, you must be punished." In that vein, his ideas are similar to what House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others have proposed. Immigration and border debates over recent years have concerned what to do about immigrants who seek asylum, how to treat immigrants who got in without authorization, and whether to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as Trump wants. The rhetoric has grown heated following large-scale deportations of immigrants here illegally, and separation of children from their parents. "I don’t see any of us voting for wall funding," Pelosi told Politico recently. "We have a responsibility to secure our borders. There are ways to do that that are consistent with civilization, humanitarianism and who we are as a nation." She also said she wants to work on protecting so-called Dreamers, undocumented young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children. In 2013, she supported proposals to create a way for others here illegally to stay, while also doubling the number of border patrol agents to at least 38,405, adding hundreds more miles of border fencing and requiring the Obama administration to have a plan to apprehend 90 percent of attempted border crossings. The proposed legislation was similar to a 2013 bipartisan Senate bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, that passed with support from 14 Republicans and every Democrat. In the House, however, Republicans favored working on enforcement first, with some saying a path to citizenship would disadvantage U.S.-born citizens for jobs. One point of criticism of the Senate bill was that it would have allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status only if they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. That means, as the Congressional Leadership Fund said in materials it sent us in support of its ad, that people who had committed two misdemeanors could qualify. The ad, however does not say that, focusing instead on "gang members and criminals" the super PAC says are marching to the country now. Under the Senate bill, applicants would have had to be living in this country already before they could qualify to apply. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund says Dan Feehan "would vote with Pelosi for open borders and amnesty, putting Minnesota families at risk." There is no question Feehan holds views contrary to the president’s and those of many House Republicans. He wants to find a way for people who are in this country already to stay, under certain conditions. But nothing in his positions suggests he supports open borders and total amnesty. There is a lot of either-or posturing in politics, and this is no different, but the CLF’s extreme framing of Feehan’s positions calls for a harsh ruling: False.

pomt-00584	Says Ronald Reagan "talked about" converting the United States to the metric system.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/07/lincoln-chafee/lincoln-chafee-says-ronald-reagan-talked-about-con/	When former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee announced he was joining the 2016 Democratic primary race, some people scratched their heads when he said switching to the metric system would be one of his goals as president. Of the world’s major countries, only the United States, Liberia and Myanmar don’t use metric units as their primary measurement systems. Instead, America uses U.S. customary units. CNN anchor Dana Bash asked Chafee about his desire to have the country use meters instead of feet and kilometers instead of miles in a June 7 interview. Noting that he lived in Canada while they converted to the metric system in the 1970s, Chafee said this discussion has been going on for a while in the United States. "I know many in the scientific community, the health care community that deal internationally, the business community, are saying this is way overdue," he said. "(Former President) Ronald Reagan talked about it. Others have talked about it." It’s amazing how often politicians use Reagan’s name as a way to advance their cause. In this case, we wondered if Chafee’s claim measures up. Falling short In 1975, Former President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act, which created the United States Metric Board, charged with leading the planning and educational efforts for switching over to the metric system. (Check out this delightful cartoon about converting to the metric system from 1975.) So when Reagan took office in 1981, a government-backed push for metric conversion -- also known as metrication -- was already well underway. However, the Metric Board had limited effectiveness in that there was no mandatory conversion timeline, and the board included some members who actually opposed conversion. In 1982, Reagan effectively dismantled the metrication effort by stripping funding from the Metric Board. The group morphed into the Office of Metric Programs, under the Department of Commerce, with much less responsibility and less than a fifth of the budget. That year’s federal budget also cut a $2 million Department of Education program for metric education, according to the New York Times. The Reagan administration justified the Metric Board cut as part of a general reduction in federal spending, rather than opposition to conversion -- preferring to leave conversion to the private sector. Reagan’s budget proposal said, "The board has accomplished its mission to familiarize the public with the metric system. Voluntary metrication will continue through market adjustments.'' The U.S. Metric Association, a current group dedicated to metric conversion, dug into this issue with Reagan Library materials. They found more than one piece of correspondence indicating that Reagan’s action against the Metric Board did "not imply a lack of support for voluntary metrication." It’s worth noting that Frank Mankiewicz, a former Democratic strategist and National Public Radio president, took at least partial credit for killing the Metric Board -- having convinced a top Reagan adviser that metrication could damage the country. We looked through newspaper archives with LexisNexis and found that for nearly the rest of the Reagan administration, there was very little talk of metric conversion, at least in Washington. (Other than in 1985, when the U.S. ambassador to Canada resigned in part because he called the Canadian metrication process "rubbish.") But in 1988, his last year in office, Reagan signed into law an omnibus trade bill that included a slight amendment to the 1975 Metric Conversion Act. Tucked into the 1,000-page bill was a declaration that the metric system was "the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce" and called for federal agencies to switch to the metric system wherever practical by 1992. While supporters of metrication saw this as a win because it had a timeline for implementation and a directive for federal agencies, unlike the earlier legislation, some believed the bill was without teeth because it allowed agencies an economic out from conversion, according to news reports from the time. It’s unclear how much influence Reagan had over this amendment to the Metric Conversion Act because it went over with little fanfare, and we were unable to track down any relevant White House statement. Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, further solidified that directive with an executive order in 1991. All in all, the Reagan administration seemed ambivalent toward metrication, at best. Today, not all, but many federal agencies -- including the military -- use metric units almost exclusively, according to a statement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Many metric experts estimate that the United States is 50 percent metric, said U.S. Metric Association President Don Hillger, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. While most Americans use customary units in their homes, those in science and heavy industry typically use the metric system. He added that there is no longer a standard yard or pound because U.S. customary units are defined by their metric equivalents. "So we really are on the metric standard in the U.S.," Hillger said. "It’s just that we continue to use non-metric units that no other major country uses anymore." Our ruling Chafee said, "Reagan talked about" converting to the metric system. The issue of metrication rose at the very beginning and at the very end of Reagan’s presidency. However, Chafee’s statement implies that Reagan had more than a passing interest in the issue, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The metrication process started before Reagan took office. He slowed the process to a standstill by taking away funding. He was silent on the issue for the next six years until he signed a law that directed federal agencies to make a more concerted effort to transition to metric units when practical -- though it’s unclear how much influence Reagan’s White House had on that tiny aspect of a 1,000-page omnibus bill. Without this additional context, Chafee’s claim is off by a few yards. Or meters. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-04013	Says "MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush-hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/05/trimet/they-did-math-and-they-did-it-right/	For a city content to bill itself as the most sustainable in America, there’s always a fair share of debate over just how useful Portland's public transit is. Do people even use those MAX cars? Seems like somebody is always asserting that empty trains abound. But in a recent advertisement, TriMet pulled out an interesting statistic: "MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways." Right above that statement is a photograph of bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic and a MAX train cruising down the rails along side it. The fact along with the picture begs the question, so we asked it: How could that train possibly be carrying 30 percent of all that freeway traffic? We sent an email to TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch to see how the agency came up with this fact and she sent us one right back with the documents we needed -- and more. (If only everybody were so helpful when we came calling.) Here’s how TriMet figured it out: They picked two points for gauging the traffic (both car and MAX) leaving downtown Portland on either of the freeways they mentioned. For the Banfield they used Lloyd Center and for the Sunset they used Goose Hollow. Both of those points are MAX stations as well as traffic-counting stations. For the MAX piece of all of this, they simply looked at what the average ridership was for a weekday between the hours of 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. (About 2,200 riders went eastbound and 1,600 went westbound.) Counting the folks traveling by car proved to be a little trickier, but not by much. The Oregon Department of Transportation counts the number of vehicles passing by certain counting stations through loop detectors embedded in the roadway. The data is archived in a system housed by Portland State University, so TriMet could easily figure out the average number of cars running in each direction. Now, a car is not the same as a person, so you can’t do a one-to-one comparison with these two sets of data. But TriMet realized that. To get the average number of riders per car, TriMet turned to the Federal Highway Administration’s "Summary of Travel Trends: 2009 National Household Travel Survey" (the most recent available). According to that survey, the average number of commuters in a vehicle is about 1.13. They took that number and multiplied it against the number of cars counted by the transportation department. What they found was that about 4,600 commuters traveled eastbound by car and about 4,400 traveled westbound by car. If you compare those figures with the MAX commuting figure, you find that TriMet is right on the money: About 30 percent of evening commuters along the Banfield and Sunset highways use the MAX. (In case you’re curious, the number is slightly smaller for the morning commute, but not by much.) Now, we did have one other nagging question: Was that 1.13 passengers per car figure that TriMet used fair in the context of Portland? After all, Portlanders commute by bike more often than the national average, maybe the same was true for carpooling. We can’t be sure based on the study TriMet used, because it doesn’t offer city-specific figures. But we’re in luck because the Census gives us some indication. According to the most recent Census data from the American Community Survey, about 9.2 percent of Portlanders carpool. That puts us about in line with the national average of 9.7 percent.

pomt-08608	Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani "was never sentenced to stoning."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/mahmoud-ahmadinejad/iranian-president-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-claims-woman/	Asked about his thoughts on stoning in light of the international uproar over the case of an Iranian woman who reportedly received the sentence for adultery, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the case as pure western media propaganda. In fact, he said on ABC's This Week that Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, 43, was never actually sentenced to stoning in the first place. "First, what I want to say is that Miss Mohammadi was never sentenced to stoning," Ahmadinejad told This Week host Christiane Amanpour in an interviewed aired on Sept. 19, 2010. "This was news that was produced and incorrect, and regretably, U.S. media affected -- was infected by U.S. politicians to make a piece of news out of it." "But the Iranian government lifted the sentence..." Amanpour interjected. Said Ahmadinejad: "Allow me. Allow me. When I represent the Iranian government, how is it that I am unaware of what you are telling me and that you should be aware of it? This is an issue that is being considered. It is still being processed. Given that there was no sentence of stoning issued in the first place this was the news that was made up. The propaganda behind it was big, and then those same murderers of people become supporters of human rights. "Now this is ancient method, an ancient method that needs to change." The following day, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry echoed Ahmadinejad's claim, saying the controversy over Ashtiani being sentenced to death by stoning for adultery was "organized media propaganda against Iran and to build up a human rights (violation) case," according to the news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur. When pressed about the matter while attending a U.N. anti-poverty summit on Sept. 21, Ahmadinejad defended the handling of the case, telling reporters, "You do not understand our judicial system." Iranian officials have made it clear that the case involving Ashtiani, who, in addition to adultery, is also charged with having been an accomplice in the killing of her husband, is still under investigation, and Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said no final sentence has been issued yet on either of the charges. But was Ahmadinejad correct that the issue of stoning in this case was pure fabrication, that Ashtiani "was never sentenced to stoning"? Ahmadinejad's claim is at odds with earlier comments from Iranian justice officials who seemed to acknowledge the stoning sentence while announcing in July the penalty had been shelved "for now." In July, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, the top judicial official in the province where Ashtiani was convicted, told the Iranian state news agency IRNA that her crimes were "heinous" and that the stoning would still take place if the judiciary wanted. "Although the verdict is definitive and applicable, the verdict has been halted due to humanitarian reservations and upon the order of the honourable judiciary chief, and it will not be carried out for the moment," according to reports from the Associated Press and Agence France Presse. That same week, Mohammed Javad Larijani of Iran's human rights council told the state news agency that the "review and appeal of the verdict is on the agenda," and maintained that "the hue and cry that the West has launched over this case will not affect our judges." "The implementation of Islamic regulations like stoning and the headscarf have always been faced with their impudent hostility and opposition," he said. Moreover, Ahmadinejad's claim is directly contradicted by two court documents smuggled out of the country by Mohammad Mostafaei, Ashtiani's original attorney. We spoke to Mostafaei, who fled Iran in August under threat of arrest and sought amnesty in Oslo, Norway. "Everything Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on TV is not true," Mostafaei said, adding that the sentence of stoning was handed down by the lower court, and confirmed in an appeals court, before the international furor among human rights activists pressured Iranian officials to review the case. Mostafaei thinks Ahmadinejad simply didn't calculate that he had taken copies of court documents with him. One of the documents, he said, is the original sentencing document, obtained by Amnesty International and posted online by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Amnesty International provided us with a translation of the document, which was originally written in Persian. It reads, in part, "In this case, Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, born in 1968, from and resident of Oskou, daughter of Asghar, is accused of adultery with strangers. In consideration of the file contents, the complaint of her children from her murdered husband, the late Ebrahim Qaderzadeh, the police report, and the express confessions of the aforementioned during all preliminary investigations and cross examinations...it seems that the main motive of the aforementioned for murdering her husband in complicity with one of the strangers -– this charge against her is being examined by another court of the province –- was her illicit relations with strangers and strong moral corruption. Other indications and adminicles all point to the committing of the said adultery offence and have led to the achievement of knowledge by the majority. Therefore, invoking Articles 63, 83 and 105 of the Islamic Penal Code, the majority of court members sentence Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, daughter of Asghar, to stoning for adultery (repeatedly with strangers). This sentence may be appealed before the Supreme Court within 20 days of its notification." (An adminicle is something that contributes to proving a point.) In addition, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran posted a document that Mostafaei said was issued by the Supreme Court administration on July 7, 2010. The document is also written in Persian, and Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said the document acknowledges the receipt of an appeals request to rule on the stoning sentence of Sakineh Ashtiani. We had the documents independently translated and confirmed both documents list stoning as the sentence. "It explicitly states her sentence as stoning," Ghaemi told us. "If there was no stoning sentence, the Supreme Court would not have issued this report." Amnesty International pointed us to one other piece of evidence. A press release issued by the Iranian embassy in London on July 8, 2010, "denies the false news aired in this respect (the Ashtiani case) and notifies the Ministry that according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment. It is notable that this kind of punishment has rarely been implemented in Iran, and various means and remedies must be probed and exhausted to finally come up with such a punishment." The statement also notes that "the stoning punishment has not been cited in the draft Islamic Penal Code being deliberated in the Iranian Parliament." According to a 2008 report from the United Nations on human rights issues in Iran, the head of Iran's judiciary issued a circular to prohibit stoning as a punishment. "However," the report states, "as in the case of the ban on public executions, this circular does not have a binding legal effect and serves only as an instruction for individual judges." Reports of stoning sentences in Iran are uncommon, and it's even more rare that the sentence is actually carried out. The U.N. report notes that stoning verdicts have been suspended for at least 14 people (11 women and three men); and an active coalition exists in the country seeking to ban the practice of stoning altogether. Nonetheless, the practice of stoning still occurs -- with the most recent instance in 2007, according to the U.N. Mostafaei said he has handled about 10 cases involving stoning. In a handful of cases, the punishment was later reduced to 99 lashes, he said. About 14 people in Iran have been sentenced to stoning and are in prison awaiting punishment. Mostafaei believes international denunciation has worked, and in an open letter, he talks broadly about human rights issues facing Iran. "I think the government can't continue this punishment in the future, in my opinion," he said. Iranian officials have accused Mostafaei of taking advantage of the case to get asylum in Europe. In August and September, a woman claiming to be Ashtiani appeared on state television (with her face blurred out) and confessed to being an accomplice to her husband's murder. The woman also criticized Mostafaei, saying that he had shamed her by making the case an international human rights issue. Her lawyer said the interviews were coerced. We are not weighing the issue of Ahtiani's guilt or innocence but whether she was "never sentenced to stoning." We think there's enough evidence -- from previously reported statements from Iranian judicial officials and from court documents provided by Ashtiani's one-time attorney -- to show that stoning was the sentence by the lower court. In this case, the sentence has been suspended, and the case is under review. Ahmadinejad may have a point that stoning sentences are rare, that the sentence is often overturned and that there is often a prolonged process of review before such sentences are carried out. But we rule his claim that Ashtiani was never sentenced to stoning in the first place is False.	None	Mahmoud Ahmadinejad	None	None	None	2010-09-22T15:40:18	2010-09-19	['None']
pomt-05258	Thanks to our policies, "for the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/31/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-has-made-first-back-back/	With a better-than-expected tax-collection estimate and savings from delaying some debt payments, Gov. Scott Walker on May 10, 2012 made a small deficit at the mid-point in his two-year budget -- poof -- disappear. Gone along with it: An issue Democrats were using against Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election. This was posted the following day on the Walker campaign blog: "Not only have we turned away from the failed policies that drove us to the brink of insolvency with chronic billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record-setting job loss, but we have taken a complete 180 degree turn to true prosperity with a budget surplus that will help far into our future," the post read in part. The Walker’s campaign boasted the news was so good extra funds will be socked away in budget-stabilization account: "For the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years." History, or course, can be an awful long time. Did back-to-back contributions happen thanks to Walker’s policies? Wisconsin first created a stabilization fund in 1985, so it’s actually a fairly new thing. But the state has seldom put money into it. That’s one reason Wisconsin lives closer to the fiscal edge than many other states. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the first deposit into the fund was in 2006-07, during the final term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker’s predecessor. That deposit totalled $55.6 million, but was quickly used up in a budget crisis later in Doyle’s term. The second deposit made to the fund -- $14.8 million -- came at the end of Doyle’s last budget, 2010-11. The deposit was made after Walker had taken office. His first six months overlapped the final six months of the Doyle budget. That brings us to May 2012. That’s when Walker signalled that he could make another deposit, estimated at $45.4 million, after the fiscal year ends June 30, 2012. So, did Walker -- for the first time in state history "put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years"? Not exactly. First, the deposit is a projection. It would make two budgets in a row for the first time if it happens. It looks likely that a deposit will be made, but it’s premature to say it already happened. Second, the numbers are not based on the "official" revenue estimates that come from the Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper on budget items. That caused Democrats to howl in protest when Walker put out the well-timed news. In February 2012, the Fiscal Bureau said that tax revenues were coming up short, leaving a small projected deficit by June 2013. The new Walker estimate is based on revenue forecasts compiled by Walker’s Department of Administration for February, March and April. In a May memo to Walker, Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch described it as "the potential" for a $45.4 million deposit when the books close at the end of June 2012. While not official, the estimates are based on the same sources of data used by the Fiscal Bureau. Bureau Director Bob Lang told us he didn’t verify Walker’s numbers but said they don’t appear unreasonable. We’ll know the size of the actual deposit, if there is one, when the state completes its annual financial report once accounts are settled, in late summer. It’s also possible the deposit could exceed the projected $45.4 million. Who deserves credit? While 2011 was Doyle’s final budget year, it was Walker who brought the budget back into balance with his budget-repair bill in early 2011. You may recall that little old bill -- the one that included higher pension and health-insurance payments from state and local government employees, and curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. Likewise, the expected 2012 surplus would clearly be on Walker’s watch. But it’s arguable how much a governor has to do with rising tax collections. Walker’s administration attributed the brighter tax-collection forecasts in large part to improved job-creation figures and personal income growth, which are subject to economic cycles. Additionally, putting money in the stabilization fund is not a matter of choice. By law, 50 percent of any surplus from higher-than-expected income and other tax collections must be transferred to the rainy day fund. That’s exactly what Walker is saying he would deposit. "I believe that both the Doyle deposit and pending Walker deposit were not done by volition or predetermined plan but by a state law requirement when excess funds appear," said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. But we attribute budget deficits to elected officials, so they must also get some credit for surpluses. Our rating Walker’s took credit for what the campaign said was a historic double-up of surplus tax funds into a rainy day fund for stabilizing future state budgets. The chances for a second straight transfer into the fund appear good, but it’s premature to say the money is in the bank. Walker gets the bulk of the credit, but his campaign claim is just partially accurate, because it skips over the important fact that the deal’s not done yet. We rate it Half True.

When Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman described the events of Oct. 7, 2016, during a post-election interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, we had to rewind the clock. "On Oct. 7, the Access Hollywood tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails," Podesta told Chuck Todd on Dec. 18, 2016. "One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence." The Access Hollywood tape Podesta referenced showed Donald Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. "I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her," Trump tells interviewer Billy Bush. "You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." The tape was discovered and first published by the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold right around 4 p.m. ET on Oct. 7. Fahrenthold shared a link to his story on Twitter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks revealed that it had received 50,000 of Podesta’s emails. It released 2,050 initially. It, too, shared the news via Twitter. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We authenticated the time of each tweet using the Twitter source code and this very helpful blog post. We obviously cannot assess if the two events were connected, as Podesta suggested, but on the timeline he’s right on. Here's how Time described the events in an article published that day. "The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign."

pomt-07164	Says 1,000 World War II veterans die every day.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/13/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-1000-world-war-ii-veter/	On the 67th anniversary of D-Day, when allied troops landed in France to fight Nazi forces on the beaches of Normandy, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst took to Twitter to praise World War II veterans. "We lose 1000 #WWII veterans every day. Take a moment to share your stories & thank America's #GreatestGeneration," he tweeted on June 6. With nearly 70 years gone since D-Day, it’s no wonder that many veterans of the war are passing away. But 1,000 a day? Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz passed on eight pieces of documentation to back up his boss, including four news articles. The latest, a May 31, 2010, Dallas Morning News article, said: "Only about two million World War II veterans are still alive, and an estimated 1,000 die every day." Walz also passed on a congressional transcript, in which then-U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, who served as national chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign, said at a June 2000 U.S. House hearing: "We are losing 1,000 World War II veterans every day. We have lost over 1 million since March 1997." So the daily statistic is at least 10 years old. Does it stand? According to data from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, in fiscal year 2010, about 263,000 veterans who served during World War II died, nearly 15,000 of whom lived in Texas. Nationally, that’s about 721 a day. Some 244,000 are expected to die in 2011, according to the department’s estimates — nearly 670 a day. In 2002, nearly 368,000 World War II veterans died, or just more than 1,000 a day. By 2006, the number dropped to about 332,000, or 909 a day. By 2008, about 815 veterans on average were dying each day. Veteran Affairs spokesman Ozzie Garza told us: "The number is decreasing because, of course, there’s fewer World War II veterans alive now." Today, the average age of a World War II vet is 92, he said. As of Sept. 30, 2010, about 23 million veterans were alive nationwide, with 1.7 million in Texas. Of those veterans, nearly 1.8 million served during World War II, with 101,400 of that war’s veterans living in Texas. Lastly, we wondered how veteran deaths from that era compared to those who served during the Vietnam War era, from 1964-1975. According to Veteran Affairs data, 103,890 died in 2010, about 285 a day. And veterans who served during the Korean War? In 2010, nearly 134,000 died, or 367 a day. Bottom line: Dewhurst’s well-meaning salute relies on an outdated statistic, overstating the number who now die daily. Half True.

pomt-06839	"Today we stand as the highest-performing urban school district in America."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/05/alberto-carvalho/miami-dade-superintendent-says-school-district-hig/	Addressing South Florida lawmakers Aug. 1, 2011, Miami-Dade school superintendent Alberto Carvalho had great news to share. "Today," he said, "we stand as the highest-performing urban school district in America." The declaration came based on two pieces of evidence, Carvalho told the Miami-Dade legislative delegation. The first, he said, were results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test. The second was the inclusion of Miami-Dade as a finalist for the respected Broad Prize -- which awards student achievement in urban districts. "So today, very quickly, today we stand as the highest-performing urban district in America," he said. "On the basis of two measures: No. 1 NAEP ... the only nationally administered exam as far as math, reading and science to fourth- and eighth-graders. ... And the results that we got over the past few months are impressive, to say the least. "Our kids live in a community that grew in poverty 10 full percentage points from last year to this year, (yet) outperformed their peers nationally. New York, Chicago, L.A., Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., don't hold a candle to our kids' performance here in Miami-Dade. .... Second: We are one of four districts out of 15,000 districts nationally up for the Nobel Prize for urban education, the Broad Prize for Urban Education, a conservative think tank that looks at student achievement, narrowing the achievement gap and overall graduation rates for students across the nation. And out of 15,000 school districts, Miami-Dade is one of four finalists for this revered prize, which will be announced at the Library of Congress on Sept. 20th." PolitiFact Florida set out to see if Carvalho was right. First some basics about the Miami-Dade school district, which is the fourth-largest in the country with nearly 350,000 students. About 70 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch and most are minorities -- 66 percent Hispanic, 24 percent black, 9 percent white and 2 percent other. The state of Florida, which gives individual schools and districts grades based on the FCAT, gave the district an overall score of a "B" for the 2010-11 school year. The Broad Prize The Broad Prize, established in 2002, is given to urban school districts based on academic performance and improvement and reducing achievement gaps among poor and minority students. School districts can't apply for the Broad (rhymes with road) -- each year 75 are identified by the Broad Foundation as eligible. Broad generally defines eligibility as districts that serve at least 37,500 students, where 40 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch and at least 40 percent are minorities. A group of education experts analyzes data -- including performance and improvement in reading and math, graduation rates, participation in advanced placement course and college entrance exam scores among other factors -- to select four finalists. Experts then make site visits and a jury of business, government and public service leaders review the data and select one winner. The top winner earns $550,000 in college scholarships while the other finalists get $150,000 in scholarships. Miami-Dade has never won but was one of four finalists in 2006, 2007 and 2008 while neighboring Broward County was a finalist in 2008 and 2009. Both Broward and Miami-Dade are finalists again this year, and the 2011 winner will be announced Sept. 20 in Washington. The focus isn't just on academic performance -- the key here is looking at improvement and shrinking disparities between different groups. A press release from Broad summarizes some of the reasons Miami-Dade was chosen as a finalist in 2011: • In 2010, the district outperformed other Florida districts that serve students with similar family incomes in reading and math. The district's Hispanic students performing at the highest levels performed in the top-third compared with Hispanics in other districts in Florida at all school levels in reading and math. For blacks at the highest levels, they performed in the top-third compared to blacks in other districts in Florida in math and in reading at the elementary and high school levels. • Between 2007 and 2010, Miami-Dade was more successful than the vast majority of Florida districts at improving the percent of poor students who performed at top levels in reading and math at the elementary and high school levels and increased participation for all students in ACT and AP. National Assessment of Educational Progress The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a test in reading, math and other subjects given to a sample of students nationwide every other year. The federal government compiles the data to create the "Nation's Report Card" and data on urban districts -- 18 in 2009 -- are compiled separately. Those urban districts, known as the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) are defined as districts located in cities with a population of at least 250,000 where the majority of the students are black or Hispanic or eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Miami-Dade was the only Florida district included in the urban assessment in 2009 -- Broward takes the NAEP and is factored into the national scores but doesn't meet the urban criteria. The Miami Herald wrote about the results from 2009 and noted that overall on the reading exam, the county's fourth- and eighth-graders outperformed their peers in New York, Boston, Atlanta and Los Angeles. "In particular, Miami-Dade's Hispanic students shone. They scored higher than their counterparts in any other large city where the test results are studied and well above the national average for Hispanic students," the Herald wrote May 21, 2010. "Black eighth-grade students also bested the average among their counterparts in other big cities." We asked Arnold Goldstein, a program director in the assessment division at the National Center for Education Statistics, to compare Miami-Dade's test performance to other TUDA districts. "In summary, in mathematics there were a few districts where the average NAEP score was higher than Miami-Dade at both grades 4 and 8," Goldstein said in an e-mail. "In reading, no districts scored (significantly) higher than Miami-Dade at either grade, although some districts’ scores were not significantly different from Miami-Dade. ... We only say there is a difference between two scores if the difference is greater than the margin of error." Goldstein sent us a chart based on NAEP test scores comparing Miami-Dade to the 17 other TUDA districts. It generally showed that Miami-Dade scored better than most of the urban districts but often fell into a group of a few districts with similar scores. • Fourth-grade math: Two districts performed better than Miami-Dade while five received similar scores and 10 had lower scores. • Eighth-grade math: Five districts performed better than Miami-Dade while two received similar scores and 10 had lower scores. • Fourth-grade reading: No other district performed significantly higher -- three had similar scores and 14 were lower. • Eighth-grade reading: Five received similar scores to Miami-Dade while 12 were lower. The report cards also show how Miami-Dade's gaps in achievement between different ethnic and income groups compared to other large cities. The large cities aren't limited to the 18 TUDA districts -- they are defined as cities with at least 250,000 people. For example, the eighth-grade reading report card shows that poor Miami-Dade students scored 17 points lower than those who weren't poor -- but that gap was 24 points lower for the average of large cities. On eighth-grade math, Miami-Dade black and Hispanic students scored lower than whites -- but again there was less of a disparity than the national large city average. Our ruling Carvalho told PolitiFact Florida that his comments come with an additional caveat -- that he was only comparing Miami-Dade to the largest urban school districts in the nation, those with more than 250,000 students. That distinction excludes many of the districts in the NAEP test, including those that have scores comparable to Miami-Dade -- like the public schools systems in Austin, Texas, Charlotte, N.C., and the metro area around Louisville, Ky. Those districts are smaller and their students are less diverse. The NAEP results, when combined with Miami-Dade's inclusion as a finalist for Broad, speak for themselves, Carvalho said. "So when I say that, I'm pretty confident," he said. We're not quite there. The fact is that while Miami-Dade has been a finalist for the coveted Broad Prize four times, it has not yet won. And Miami-Dade's standing on the NAEP tests depends on if you count districts with a student population under 250,000. In the end, we don't want to undersell Miami-Dade's successes. But we don't want to oversell them either. We rate Carvalho's claim Half True.	None	Alberto Carvalho	None	None	None	2011-08-05T18:06:44	2011-08-01	['United_States']

pomt-10545	Obama "suggested bombing Pakistan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/21/john-mccain/a-distortion-of-what-obama-said/	At a media availability in Columbus, Ohio, on Feb. 20, 2008, Sen. John McCain took a claim that President Bush made a week earlier and cranked it up a notch, saying that Sen. Barack Obama wants to bomb Pakistan. It's an extreme charge because Pakistan has been a key ally to the United States. We find McCain's remark seriously distorts what Obama actually said. Here's the exchange from the media availability: QUESTION: Senator McCain, last night in your speech you talked about Barack Obama saying that he once suggested invading our ally, Pakistan. MCCAIN: I said bombing. My statement was bombing. I don't know if you received a text, but my statement that I made at my speech was that he suggested bombing Pakistan without their permission. QUESTION: Regardless, if you go back and look at Barack Obama's (inaudible) what he's saying is not going after Pakistan, but going after al Qaeda targets within Pakistan. And as you know... MCCAIN: That's still bombing Pakistan. QUESTION: But there are some people even inside the Bush administration who think that going unilaterally and not, sort of, being at the mercy of Musharraf may not be the worst idea. MCCAIN: Well, the best idea is to not broadcast what you're going to do. That's naive. The first thing that you do is you make your plans and you carry out your operations as necessary for America's national security interest. You don't broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war -- in the struggle against Taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold. McCain's remarks echo a comment made by President Bush in an interview Feb. 17 on Fox News Sunday after he was was asked what he thought of Sen. Barack Obama. "I certainly don't know what he believes in," Bush said. "The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, which — I think I commented that in a press conference when I was asked about it." Bush and McCain are referring to a speech that Obama gave in August 2007 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan. Then Obama added: "I understand that (Pakistan) President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will." The transcript of his speech makes it clear that Obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government. We recognize that McCain is making a larger point questioning the wisdom of Obama telegraphing our future military plans and we are not addressing whether that is a good idea. But it is a serious distortion to say Obama wants to "attack Pakistan," as President Bush did, and an even more serious one that he supports "bombing Pakistan," as McCain did. (Indeed, all Obama said was that he would "act.") For the U.S. to bomb Pakistan would essentially be no different from the U.S. bombing Mexico or Great Britain, two other allies. The charge from Bush and McCain is especially unusual in the light of a Feb. 19 article in the Washington Post that revealed missiles from a CIA-operated Predator aircraft recently killed a key al Qaeda commander in the Pakistani town of Mir Ali. The U.S. government did not have permission from the Pakistan government for the attack, the article said. A week ago, we rated Bush's statement, which included a mischaracterization of Obama's position on Ahmadinejad, as False. But McCain has ratcheted up the rhetoric, saying bombing instead of just attacking and adding that Obama wants to "bomb a country that is a sovereign nation." That's not just wrong. That's Pants-on-Fire wrong.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-02-21T00:00:00	2008-02-20	['Pakistan', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-14890	"Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices, and building a members-only lounge."	true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/09/florida-democratic-party/rubio-spent-tax-money-renovate-florida-house-state/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio railed against taxes during his career in Florida politics, but his presidential campaign has been facing accusations that he has a long history of being a spendthrift with other people’s money. The Florida Democratic Party posted a message Nov. 5, 2015, on Facebook about Rubio’s financial habits as incoming speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. "Remember that time Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices, and building a members-only lounge? We do," the post read. It included a link to a 2010 Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald story about Rubio’s use of a Republican Party of Florida credit card. It’s common for incoming speakers to spruce up the chambers as they see fit, so we wondered if Rubio really spent $400,000 for renovations and a new lounge. Rubio’s renovations In August 2006, before he was officially sworn in as speaker, Rubio did order some renovations to the House. The Times/Herald story the Democrats linked to noted, "When Rubio became speaker, he spent about $400,000 in tax dollars to remodel offices and build a members-only dining room so lawmakers rushing to meetings or in the throes of negotiations would not have to leave the Capitol to eat." The story was written before renovations were complete. The West Miami Republican said he sought to "decentralize the power of the speakership from being some imperial position to being more of a manager of the process." That involved moving some offices around inside the Capitol. He wanted the clerk and sergeant-at-arms moved from the fourth floor to the fifth floor, which pushed the House rules and calendar council to the 12th floor. Rubio also wanted the budget and policy committees together, and did have a members-only dining room built. A dining area just for lawmakers raised some eyebrows at the time. While the Capitol had a public cafeteria and separate snack bar, some critics wondered if a private room was an excuse for lawmakers to meet away from where public records laws could find them. (The dining room was built, and is still there.) In all, Rubio ordered almost $560,000 in renovations, according to records from the Speaker’s Office. There were some rumblings that a state representative so opposed to taxes and government waste — in 2006 he published his book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future — shouldn’t have been spending that kind of money. But is that a lot? Consider that his predecessor Allan Bense only spent $1,500, according to the Times/Herald. On the high end, John Thrasher spent almost $7 million in 1999 to renovate the House chamber, the speaker's office and the House office building. Former Speaker Daniel Webster spent about $100,000 in 1997 to build a spiral staircase between the Speaker’s Office and the Republican Majority Office. Rubio closed the staircase. The leader of the House Democrats at the time, Rep. Dan Gelber of Miami Beach, acknowledged the spending but didn’t make it an issue, instead praising Rubio for including Democrats in new committee suites. "I think the speaker has a prerogative to spend his budget as he sees fit," he said at the time. Criticism of Rubio’s spending as speaker came up during his 2010 U.S. Senate campaign against then-Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist criticized Rubio for the renovations and for inflating his staff’s payroll by $2 million over his predecessor. Rubio hired 20 new workers, many of them from former Gov. Jeb Bush’s office, paying several of them more than $100,000. One of them was Rubio’s chief of staff, Richard Corcoran, who earned $175,212 — $46,000 more than Crist did as governor. Corcoran, now a state representative from Land O’Lakes, takes over as speaker of the House in 2016. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said, "Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices, and building a members-only lounge." It was actually more than that. Rubio spent almost $560,000 to move around offices, renovate meeting spaces and open a dining area in the Capitol. Other speakers have spent more or less than that, as they saw fit. Democratic leadership at the time didn’t quibble with the changes, although Rubio did face some criticism over the moves, especially when he ran for U.S. Senate.

pomt-15240	"Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/06/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-fox-changed-poll-eligibility-cr/	There’s no love lost between MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and Fox News. The liberal show host frequently chastises the conservative Fox News, and the network’s process of picking the top 10 candidates for the first Republican presidential debate gave Maddow another opportunity. Maddow aimed her barb at the explanation Fox News gave for deciding who would be the last candidate to make the cut-off. Fox News gave Ohio Gov. John Kasich the coveted 10th slot at the expense of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Maddow accused Fox News of unilaterally sounding the death knell for the lesser-ranked candidates seven months before the first Iowa voter would show up at the nation’s first caucus. "If a candidate can't even make it to the debate stage, why would rational donors and volunteers continue giving money and time to what is apparently a lost cause," Maddow said on her Aug. 4, 2015, show. A bit later, Maddow said, "Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate." In particular, Maddow chastised Fox for not using an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that was the fifth-most recent poll on record. Fox News skipped that poll and used a slightly older poll from Quinnipiac. Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination. "He didn't lose it, it was stolen from him," she said. "Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him." Maddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use. Fox News became more nuanced with the polls In May, when Fox News first announced the debates, it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: "Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques." Fox News directed us to a Bloomberg article that added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable. But on Aug. 4, when Fox News unveiled who would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May: • "They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date)." • "They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)" • "Their GOP primary vote question mirrored the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics." • "Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used." • "The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point." • "Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry." • "We did not include the highly-respected NBC/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided "Kasich" response tied the aided "Perry" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate." In May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow’s claim that "Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria." A change of uncertain significance The bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement. "We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls/interviewers and the like," Sabato told PunditFact. "You can call it ‘changing the rules’ if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up." David P. Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University, said Fox could have done more to avoid this situation. "They added criteria after they saw what the polls were," Redlawsk said. "To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning." By comparison, in May, CNN named the polls it would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results. That said, Fox News’ decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University. "If Kasich was not on the NBC/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense," Erikson said. "Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount." Michael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls. He wrote a critique of CNN’s "poll of polls" after the 2008 election. "The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration," he told us. "The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision." Traugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error. Traugott said that in large measure, Fox set itself up for this problem. "If you are vague initially, when the time comes, you have to specify the details by which you acted," he said. We contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow’s statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror "the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics." Fox News declared that this made no difference. Our ruling Maddow said that "Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate." We found that the poll criteria were much more detailed in August (over 260 words long) than they were in May (about 45 words long). The network could have been more precise early on, but Fox did leave some room for itself when it qualified the polls it planned to use for the debate back in May with "as recognized by Fox News." Also, some experts said, Maddow exaggerated the impact of the approach Fox News ultimately used, and she implied that statistical certainty was achievable under any circumstances. Fox News moved from a broad approach to a more detailed one, and experts aren't convinced that it slighted Perry. With those missing caveats, we rate Maddow's claim Half True.

pomt-02591	Says state Sens. Greg Evers, Nancy Detert and Charles Dean "got a failing grade from conservatives."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/28/americans-prosperity-florida/americans-prosperitys-florida-chapter-says-three-g/	It’s no surprise when a conservative advocacy group like Americans for Prosperity targets Democrats. But last month the Florida chapter launched a $250,000 media blitz against three veteran Republican state legislators. Their beef: The senators weren’t conservative enough on the group’s top policy priorities. The advertising campaign was directed at state Sens. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, and Greg Evers, R-Baker, and it included YouTube videos, mailers, TV advertising and social media. In the videos, Americans for Prosperity said that each of the three legislators "got a failing grade from conservatives." The group says this claim referred to the organization’s "Economic Freedom Scorecard" for 2013, which grades state legislators on how they voted on 20 amendments and bills. While the ads make identical statements about Detert, Dean and Evers, Detert is the only one of those legislators to receive an actual F on the organization’s scorecard. The group gave Dean and Evers D's. (The AFP also gave D’s to Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, and Sen. Miguel de la Portilla, R-Coral Gables, although they weren’t targeted in the AFP blitz.) The fact that only one of the three targeted legislators got an F raised an immediate question for us. We also wondered whether there were other vote ratings from conservative groups that might have come to different conclusions. So we took a closer look. First, some background. Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, was started in 2004 partly by the billionaire libertarian industrialists, David and Charles Koch. David Koch is the chairman of the board for the AFP Foundation. The ad blast comes nearly a year before the November elections; so far, Detert and Evers are running unopposed, while Dean is termed out in 2016. Slade O’Brien, AFP’s Florida director, told the Tampa Bay Times in November, that "we’re not going to make much progress with these three. But we’re putting the rest of the Legislature on notice. We’re letting them know that there is a group in Florida that is holding them accountable." The AFP scorecard gave legislators a point for each vote in support of its position and extra votes for actions like sponsoring a bill, rather than just voting for it. Points were deducted for sponsorship of a bill the group opposed. The voting scorecard weighed such issues as the Internet sales tax, reduced regulation of agricultural lands and local regulatory transparency. But the AFP’s media blast focused on a few specific legislative votes by Dean, Detert and Evers -- on pension reform, professional sports facilities and parent empowerment for ailing schools, which is also known as the parent trigger bill. When we looked into other conservative, free-market or pro-business groups that had rated Florida legislators, we found that only AFP issued a failing grade to any of these three senators. The clearest example of a conservative vote scorecard in Florida comes from the American Conservative Union, which gave Detert, Dean and Evers each a score of 70 percent on nine issues that included pension reform, medical malpractice reform and the parent trigger bill. Several pro-business groups also gave the three legislators ratings that were well above "failing." While these groups are officially nonpartisan, their positions are often in tune with conservative priorities. • The Florida Chamber of Commerce gave Detert an 85, Dean a 90 and Evers an 82. • The Associated Industries of Florida, which promotes business and free enterprise, gave Dean 98 percent, Detert 93 percent and Evers 94 percent. • The Foundation for Florida's Future, which supported the parent trigger or parent empowerment bill and was founded by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, gave Detert and Evers 78 percent and Dean 83 percent. Our ruling AFP said that Sens. Evers, Detert and Dean "got a failing grade from conservatives." Detert did receive an F from the group, but the others received Ds -- a grade that, while not very good, usually suggests barely passing rather than "failing." Meanwhile, the American Conservative Union gave all three a rating higher than F. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13562	Says Hillary Clinton "abided by the ethics agreement" between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/	A batch of newly released emails between Hillary Clinton’s aides and a Clinton Foundation official set off another debate over whether Clinton blurred the lines dividing the nonprofit bearing her family name and the State Department. In an Aug. 10 interview with Clinton surrogate and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, CNN’s Brianna Keilar brought up one email thread in particular: Clinton Foundation official Doug Band asking Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills on behalf of Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire and foundation donor of Lebanese descent, to "speak to the substance person re Lebanon," at the department. Given Clinton’s promise of a firewall between the foundation and the state department, was that exchange "really appropriate?" Keilar asked Granholm. Granholm pushed back, saying that Band wrote the email as an aide to former President Bill Clinton, not on behalf of the foundation, and the meeting request also didn’t lead to "official action taken on the part of the State Department on his behalf." Pressed further by Keilar, Granholm then argued that Clinton actually kept her word. "She has abided by the ethics agreement she signed at the beginning, which was not to take any action on the part of the State Department that mixed foundation business," Granholm said. Granholm's claim about an ethics agreement is narrowly focused and misses the big picture about concerns of conflict of interest. While Clinton personally has not been directly implicated in mixing the business of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, there are clear connections between her top aides and Clinton Foundation interests. We'll walk you through it. The emails in question The email about the Nigerian billionaire Chagoury is one of two out of 44 email exchanges released by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that link the State Department directly with the Clinton Foundation. In the email, Band, a member of the Clinton Global Initiative's board, wrote to Clinton top aides Abedin and Mills. "We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person regarding Lebanon. As you know, he’s key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon," said the April 2009 email. "Very important." "It’s Jeff Feltman. I’m sure he knows him," Abedin replied, referring to ambassador to Lebanon until 2008. "I’ll talk to Jeff." Chagoury’s spokesman said in a statement that Chagoury, who donated between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, "was simply passing along his observations and insights about the dire political situation in Lebanon at the time. But nothing ever came of it." Feltman, who Clinton named the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, confirmed this and told media he had never met with Chagoury or spoken to him. In a separate thread, Band recommended an unidentified person for a job at the State Department. "We have all had him on our radar," Abedin wrote back. "Personnel has been sending him some options." "Great," Band replied. Clinton herself wasn’t involved in either exchange, and the Clinton campaign referred us to a State Department spokeswoman’s comments on the matter. "The department does not believe it was inappropriate for Mr. Band or any other individual to recommend someone be considered for employment at the State Department," spokeswoman Jennifer Trudeau said. "We also do not believe it’s inappropriate for someone recommended in this matter to be potentially hired insofar as they meet the necessary qualifications for the job." New emails released after Granholm made her statement, detailed in an Associated Press investigation, show that Clinton took many meetings with foundation donors as secretary of state and offered assistance to several. The ethics agreements, plural Clinton pledged to keep her distance from foundation matters as secretary of state. "I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which The William J. Clinton Foundation (or the Clinton Global Initiative) is a party or represents a party ...," she said. The Clinton Foundation signed its own, separate memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration, promising to disclose donors annually and report material donation increases to the State Department among other things. "The parties also seek to ensure that the activities of the Foundation, however beneficial, do not create conflicts or the appearance of conflicts for Senator Clinton as Secretary of State," the memorandum of understanding reads. What's clear is that both agreements were intended to minimize conflicts of interest. And in that regard, experts told us Granholm's comments amount to poorly masked spin that focus on Clinton's personal involvement while ignoring the involvement of her top aides. Granholm is right that neither agreement prohibits aides facilitating meetings or taking job recommendations, but that's only technically accurate because terms of the agreement were pretty specific to begin with, said John Wonderlich, the director of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation. "The letter of the memorandum of understanding is not the standard by which they’re being judged," Wonderlich said. "By trying to use that as a defense, that just highlights the deficiencies of the memorandum of understanding." Granholm offered a lawyerly response that reflects "a certain tone-deafness on the part of the Clintons, their staff and surrogates," said Kathleen Clark, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Washington University in St. Louis. "It keeps you out of jail but it doesn’t really address the underlying concern." That concern is that donors and those with ties to the Clinton Foundation could use their connections to curry favor with the U.S. government, "not just whether Clinton is technically violating an ethics statute" narrowly tailored for legal purposes. So while the emails contain no smoking guns that point to pay-to-play, Wonderlich said, they contribute to "a sense of commingling the personal and the official." Clark held up the Clinton campaign’s argument that Band sent the emails as Bill Clinton’s aide as an example of a flimsy response. "That’s nice, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a foundation connection," she said. "The foundation’s work is no doubt laudable, but it’s not at all clear how they are addressing a reasonable perception that giving money to the foundation may help one accomplish goals related to the U.S. government." Craig Holman of the government accountability think tank Public Citizen said the new emails at least show "an effort was made to secure official favors" for donors. "The Clinton Foundation itself did not live up to the expectations of the ethics agreement," he said. Violations elsewhere Outside of the emails, the Clinton Foundation has actually violated its memorandum of understanding with the State Department. As previously mentioned, the foundation agreed to disclose donors every year while its various initiatives would do the same and report material increases from existing donors to the state department. But in 2015, numerous media outlets reported several instances of the Clinton Foundation breaking its promises. There were three major examples: • Not reporting to the State Department a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010 • Not disclosing over 1,000 donors who passed $2.35 million total through the Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative through a Canadian foundation (the foundation simply reported the revenue from the Canadian foundation) • Not updating or notifying the State Department on the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s donor list, which included five new foreign countries and two with material increases in giving, from 2010 to 2013 To be clear, none of these disclosure failures are proof of quid pro quo. But experts told us that the Clinton camp and the public should have higher standards. "The fact that it’s not a bribe may help keep you out of federal prison, but is that good enough?" Clark said. Our ruling Granholm said Clinton "abided by the ethics agreement" between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration. That's a misleading response that ignores what occurred at Clinton's State Department. Experts told us emails between Clinton aides and a foundation aide may not have been prohibited by the specific terms of the ethics pledges. But they demonstrate a blurring of the lines between official government business and Clinton’s personal connections — breaking the firewall Clinton agreed to preserve. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10910	"Revealed: UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/01/infowars/misleading-infowars-story-says-un-plans-flood-amer/	A misleading Infowars post claims there’s a United Nations plan to inundate the United States with hundreds of millions of immigrants. "Revealed: UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants," said the headline on a July 24 Infowars story. The site and its operator Alex Jones are known for peddling conspiracy theories. The story said a 2001 UN strategy document "outlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain population levels." There is a UN report on replacement migration, and Infowars lays out scenarios listed in the report. But Infowars deviates from the truth by claiming this has been the UN’s "agenda for decades." The report explicitly said the scenarios in its study "are not meant to be recommendations in any way, but illustrations of hypothetical scenarios." The title of the report — "Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?" — even questions, not asserts, whether replacement migration is a solution. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The UN report said the organization’s population division monitors fertility, mortality and migration trends for all countries of the world, as a basis for its official population estimates and projections. Due to two prominent trends — population decline and population aging — it conducted a study to address whether replacement migration is a solution to those issues. Replacement migration is defined as "the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of population and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population." It analyzed six replacement migration scenarios for eight low-fertility countries, including the United States, and for two regions, Europe and the European Union. It also offered "additional considerations" besides the scenarios. Infowars’ post includes a scenario outlined in the report for the United States that said that to keep a certain "potential support ratio" it "would be necessary to have 593 million immigrants from 1995 to 2050, an average of 10.8 million per year." Press releases in six different languages accompanied the UN report, countering Infowars’ headline claiming that a "plan" had been "revealed" just recently. Infowars did not respond to requests for comment. The UN document at the center of the Infowars post explores "replacement migration" but explicitly stops short of recommendation, much less implementation. The UN has no authority to compel anyone to immigrate. Further, the document that was "revealed" is nearly two decades old. We rate the headline False.

pomt-10729	"When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/15/hillary-clinton/edwards-was-worried-about-cost/	In fending off attacks on her as someone who equivocates, Hillary Clinton singled out John Edwards for changing his mind on health care. "When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now," she said. Clinton is correct. In 2004, when he was running for president, Edwards favored universal coverage for children but stopped short of proposing universal coverage for adults. At the time, he was concerned that true universal coverage would be too costly. "What we ought to be doing is something that No. 1 is achievable and No. 2 is responsible," he said at a debate in Manchester, N.H., on July 28, 2003. Edwards released a health care plan in February 2007 that mandates universal coverage. At a debate a few months later, moderator Tim Russert charged Edwards with changing his position. "That's true and so has America," Edwards responded. "I proposed universal health care for children at that point, and what is clear from this presidential campaign is I was the first presidential candidate — others have followed me now, and that's a good thing, good thing for America — but I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan. And the one thing I can tell you ... anybody who knows me knows I will never give up." Edwards did release his plan before Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but Dennis Kucinich released a proposal for universal health care before Edwards.

pomt-12139	"Violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County"	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/aug/11/chris-collins/how-has-gun-crime-changed-safe-act/	Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, says some of New York state’s gun control laws should be scrapped. The 2013 Secure Ammunition and Firearm Enforcement Act was supposed to reduce gun violence in New York. Collins says there’s no evidence that’s happened. "Statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County," Collins said in an op-ed in The Buffalo News. Collins is sponsoring federal legislation to reverse parts of the SAFE Act that regulate rifles and shotguns. He says the law has been an unnecessary burden for gun owners across upstate New York. But is he right that the number of violent crimes with a firearm has been unchanged since 2013? Statewide data For the state as a whole, the numbers don't back up Collins' claim. In 2016, there were 10,007 violent crimes with a firearm reported to police, according to data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. In 2013, there were 12,235. The percentage of violent crimes with a firearm also fell from 16 percent in 2013 to 13.5 percent in 2016. Looked at another way, the number of firearm-related violent crimes per New York state resident also has declined. There were 62 firearm-related violent crimes reported for every 100,000 residents in 2013, compared with 50 for every 100,000 residents by 2016. The number of firearm-related violent crimes has decreased statewide each year since 2012, the first year New York City was included in the data. The number was already going down outside New York City before the SAFE Act in 2013. There were 5,340 violent firearm crimes reported to police outside New York City in 2008 — the most in the last decade. The count has only increased twice since, in 2012 and 2016. Erie County data In Erie County, the trend is different. Violent crimes with a firearm have been on the rise. Police in Erie County reported 1,154 violent crimes with a firearm in 2016 — more than any other county upstate. That’s up from 1,092 in 2013. The rate of firearm-related violent crimes has also increased, from 118 of those crimes for every 100,000 Erie County residents in 2013 to 125 in 2016. Collins’s view A spokesperson for Collins said he based his claim on an article from WKBW, a Buffalo news station. "The SAFE Act has done little to keep Western New Yorkers safe and has taken away the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens," Collins spokesperson Sarah Minkel said in a statement responding to our findings. WKBW used the same data we did and presented the same results, though the article notes there have been "no major changes in crime rate" since 2013. Our ruling Collins said "statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County." Statistics tell a different story. Violent crimes with a firearm have decreased statewide since 2013 and increased in Erie County. But correlation does not equal causation. Trends show violent crime with a firearm was already going down statewide before the SAFE Act. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-07967	"There was no panhandling when I left office."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jan/21/bob-buckhorn/bob-buckhorn-says-there-was-no-panhandling-when-he/	A key element of Bob Buckhorn's campaign for mayor is reducing small, quality-of-life crimes before they turn into bigger crimes. Think public urination, "raves" at bars or Tampa's famous "six-foot rule" for lap dancers that Buckhorn pushed. He's also been a major advocate for cracking down on panhandling. Last summer, St. Petersburg's ban on panhandling put the issue on the front burner. The Tampa City Council is poised to pass a ban for major streets after refusing to do so three times in recent months. Many residents are frustrated. Candidates in the March 31 mayoral race get a lot of questions on the topic. During a Jan. 4, 2011, interview on the "AM Tampa Bay" radio show on WFLA-AM 970, Buckhorn outlined a previous attempt to curb roadside begging. "We passed an ordinance that allowed legitimate charities to apply for a permit once a year provided they had the right liability coverage, which allowed the Shriners and firefighters and some of the vendors to do what they've been doing for years without causing problems," he said. (That ordinance, passed in 1999, was nullified after a court tossed out a similar law in another town.) He continued: "There was no panhandling when I left office. Now we've seen it explode. We've seen an unwillingness on the part of some of the elected officials in our community to do anything about it." This leads to an obvious question: Really? Was there NO panhandling in Tampa when Buckhorn left office after two terms in 2003? We turned to our archives for help and found a St. Petersburg Times story from March 2003 published three days after Tampa's municipal election and a few weeks before Buckhorn left office. The article quotes a homeless person asking a business owner, "Hey, hey. Can I get a dollar?" According to the article, "Scenes like that unfold hundreds of times a day on Ybor's busy Seventh Avenue strip." A little more color: "Merchants say Ybor draws dozens of panhandlers — homeless men, mostly, who ply the strip with hard-luck stories. As the crowds grow, so do the number of people pleading for change." The prognosis isn't good for Buckhorn's claim. But maybe the Times got it wrong. Is it possible that "dozens of panhandlers" asking for cash "hundreds of times a day" was just a fluke that day? We asked a few people who would know if panhandling was eradicated in Tampa circa 2003. There were 8,700 homeless people that year, according to an annual survey by the Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County. In 2009, the latest year figures are available, that count was 9,500. It's hard to know exactly how many were panhandlers, but anecdotal evidence says there were at least a few. "When Mr. Buckhorn left office, we didn't have one of the highest unemployment rates in recent memory," said coalition spokeswoman Lesa Weikel. "Yes, there probably was some panhandling going on, but obviously not to the extent that it is now." Joe Howden is a longtime Ybor City resident and business manager who considers Buckhorn a friend. He said that he appreciates Buckhorn's efforts to deal with panhandling, but "it's something that's never going to go away, in my opinion." "You just have to have the police keep pressure on people not to annoy people on the streets," he said. Tampa police statistics show 283 panhandling arrests in 2002 and 2003, which includes aggressive panhandling and illegal begging in medians. Police spokeswoman Laura McElroy called that a "totally different issue than what we're dealing with now. The more recent problem is just the large number of them." Buckhorn acknowledged on Jan. 18 that panhandling in Tampa wasn't wiped out. During the radio show, he said, he was referring to the fact that "panhandling wasn't permitted in the medians. This was median-specific." He added: "Panhandling has been around as long as human beings have been around. And it probably will continue to be." So Buckhorn clarified his radio interview comment when PolitiFact Florida asked him about it. But that doesn't change his original claim: "There was no panhandling when I left office." Several sources say that's just not true. There were plenty of people asking for spare change on Tampa's streets in 2003, though anecdotal evidence shows panhandling is up in Tampa now because of the bad economy and the ban in St. Petersburg. We rate Buckhorn's statement as False.	None	Bob Buckhorn	None	None	None	2011-01-21T16:56:40	2011-01-04	['None']
pomt-12656	Says "(Barack) Obama’s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/23/blog-posting/former-first-grandma-marian-robinson-caught-anothe/	Former First Grandma Marian Robinson just can’t catch a break from fake news. First Michelle Obama’s mother was wrongly accused in fake stories of drawing a federal pension for taking care of grandchildren Sasha and Malia. Now she’s the victim of a new round of false reports that claim she’s being charged with a crime for doing so since former President Barack Obama left office. "Obama’s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud," reads the headline on several Internet posts that started appearing on or after March 16, 2017. The posts all read roughly the same, claiming that Robinson was charged "for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses." The story stokes reader ire by admonishing Robinson for attempting to take money she didn’t deserve. "While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters’ ‘caretaker,’ she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name," the posts read. Several of these links were flagged by Facebook users for being potentially fake, as part of the social media company’s efforts to prune fake news from readers’ news feeds. The various links that repurpose the same post have been shared on Facebook at least 17,000 times. We know this particular claim is fake, because it comes from a website that makes up its content. It was originally posted on March 16 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. These kinds of posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." Moreover, the whole idea that Robinson was at all eligible for a federal pension for being a caretaker of the former first family’s children is entirely wrong. Robinson was a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to Michelle Obama and her brother Craig. She did move into the White House in 2009, and has helped raise her granddaughters. But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. Since she was never a federal employee, she doesn’t qualify for any government pension. The post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is building on a claim from October 2016 that originated on BostonTribune.com. That website said Robinson was allowed to collect the $160,000 pension once the Obamas left the White House. Despite the story being shared on several other fake news sites, there’s no actual pension for Robinson to collect. We rated that statement Pants On Fire! TheLastLineOfDefense.org report appears to acknowledge there is no pension for the first grandma (or at least not a legal one). Instead, the post unleashes outrage over Robinson’s alleged attempt to collect money not owed to her. What we have here is one fake news website posting a contrived follow-up to another fake news website’s false report. Robinson is not collecting a pension, and she hasn’t been charged with a crime for trying to collect a pension. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-00589	"You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun. The sun. I have people tell me, ‘Carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’ No, it doesn't. The sun warms the Earth."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jun/05/don-zimmerman/don-zimmerman-says-every-child-learns-sun-causes-w/	In April 2015, Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist, briefed the Austin City Council on the consequences of climate change on Texas. Scientists generally agree that industrial and auto emissions from the burning of fossil fuels contribute to global warming. But Don Zimmerman, the council member representing District 6, was dismissive of Hayhoe’s presentation, saying there’s "no way to have definitive science on something so nebulous and so foolish as climate change." "You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun," Zimmerman said. "The sun. I have people tell me, ‘carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’ No, it doesn't. The sun warms the Earth." We remember graphic textbooks – carbon paper inside! – and goggles in fifth grade. But we were not quite advanced enough at the age of 10 for climate science; that didn’t roll around till high school astronomy. We remember learning in that class that the sun is the chief source of energy in our solar system, but we also remember studying how greenhouse gases – like carbon dioxide – helped trap warmth from the sun. (We recall a textbook diagram showing rays from the sun smacking off the surface of the Earth before reflecting back into the atmosphere; aptly named greenhouse gases prevented all the heat from escaping.) SOURCE: Website, "Climate Change," Department of Ecology, University of Washington (accessed May 12, 2015) So, did we remember our science correctly? Or, put another way, was Zimmerman correct that "what causes the climate is the sun" and that the "sun warms the Earth," or was he just blowing hot air? We asked Zimmerman to elaborate on his statement. "It’s common sense," he told us, "that the source of energy that drives everything is the sun." By email, a Texas A&M University professor who doubles as the climatologist for the state of Texas, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us that, indeed, save negligible amounts of heat generated within the Earth, "the sun is the source of the energy that drives the climate system." Score one for Zimmerman! But, Nielsen-Gammon went on, everything from volcanic eruptions to carbon dioxide can also affect Earth’s climate. "If carbon dioxide concentrations increase, for example, the sun drives the Earth to a higher temperature because the solar energy that the Earth absorbs cannot escape to space as efficiently," he said. Score one against Zimmerman! Climatologist Steven Quiring, Nielsen-Gammon’s Texas A&M colleague, had a similar take: "The sun is important. It is the primary source of energy for the climate system." "However, the Earth's atmosphere is also very important," Quring said by email. For example, Quiring suggested, compare the temperature of the moon and the Earth. Both are about the same distance from the sun, but the moon has an average surface temperature of about 23 degrees Fahrenheit and the Earth has an average surface temperature of about 61 Fahrenheit. His point: If the sun were the only thing that mattered, both would have a similar average surface temperature. So why the large difference? "It turns out that having an atmosphere is very important," Quiring said. "In particular, the Earth's atmosphere contains a number of greenhouse gases that are very effective at absorbing energy (at certain wavelengths) and re-radiating it back to the Earth's surface. "If Mr. Zimmerman thinks that having an atmosphere does not matter, perhaps he should try to live on the moon for a while." In Texas, by the way, it’s not until Grade 8 that public school students are expected to "identify the role of natural events in altering Earth systems," according to state curriculum guidelines published by the Texas Education Agency, which state: "Students learn how interactions in solar, weather, and ocean systems create changes in weather patterns and climate." And it’s only toward the end of high school that students are meant to learn the "interacting components of Earth's system change by both natural and human-influenced processes." "Some human-influenced processes such as pollution and non-sustainable use of Earth's natural resources may damage Earth's system," the guidelines say. "Examples include climate change, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. The time scale of these changes and their impact on human society must be understood to make wise decisions concerning the use of the land, water, air, and natural resources. Proper stewardship of Earth will prevent unnecessary degradation and destruction of Earth's subsystems and diminish detrimental impacts to individuals and society." We bounced all this off Zimmerman, who stood by his solar statement. Our ruling Zimmerman said that as every child learns, the sun warms the Earth—and, he said, carbon dioxide does not. We remember: The sun warms the Earth. But Zimmerman’s bigger point--discounting the role of carbon dioxide in climate change--disregards international scientific consensus.

pomt-13171	In the Paula Jones case, Bill Clinton paid an "$850,000 penalty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/newt-gingrich/gingrich-misleading-call-850000-paid-bill-clinton-/	In a combative cable news interview that has gone viral, Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a prominent Donald Trump surrogate -- clashed over allegations that Trump had groped nearly a dozen women over the years. Among other things, Gingrich countered that the husband of Trump’s opponent, former president Bill Clinton, has gotten off light after being involved in sex scandals during the 1980s and 1990s. Here’s an excerpt of the Oct. 25 interview: Gingrich: "No, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’ I dare you. Say, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’ " Kelly: "Mr. Speaker, we’ve covered — excuse me, sir …" Gingrich: "Disbarred by the … Arkansas bar." Kelly: "Excuse me. excuse me." Gingrich: "Disbarred by the Arkansas bar; $850,000 penalty." We wondered about Gingrich’s assertion that Bill Clinton had paid an "$850,000 penalty." That was a figure Clinton paid in a settlement over alleged sexual impropriety with Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker when Clinton was Arkansas governor. Jones sued him over the alleged incident in a case that ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment battle. We found that not only is Gingrich wrong to call that sum a "penalty," but also that Gingrich is uniquely unsuited to argue that it was in fact a penalty. Let’s explore the details. Is Clinton’s $850,000 payment a ‘penalty’? Clinton did indeed pay Jones $850,000. But the payment in question does not fit the commonly accepted legal definition of a "penalty," legal experts said. Here’s how the Washington Post described the payment in its contemporary coverage in 1998: President Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones yesterday, agreeing to pay her $850,000 to drop the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to the worst political crisis of his career and only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in American history. After more than 4 1/2 years of scorched-earth legal warfare, Clinton and Jones brought a sudden end to the case with a four-page deal in which he acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. ... Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's chief attorney in the case, said the president still insists Jones's allegations of a crude proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite seven years ago "are baseless" but agreed to make the payment in the interest of finally putting the matter behind him. … The case was dismissed without a trial. So we know a few important things about the $850,000 payment. It came after the trial court had dismissed the case. It was made as part of an out-of-court settlement between Clinton and Jones. And as part of the agreement, Clinton made no acknowledgment of guilt. All of these things undercut the notion that the payment was a penalty, legal experts said. "A penalty is generally imposed by a governmental entity for a violation of a law, rule or regulation," said Brett Kappel, a lawyer who specializes in political ethics law with the firm Akerman. "Payments to resolve civil suits are treated as compensation for a harmful or wrongful act. They are not a ‘penalty.’ " Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that "it’s not accurate to call a settlement a ‘penalty.’ " Roosevelt said that penalties "are usually imposed without a party’s consent and on the basis of wrongdoing. ... individuals have no power to impose penalties on other individuals." Why Gingrich’s use of the term ‘penalty’ here is ironic As it happens, Gingrich has some experience with parsing the definition of legal penalties -- and not in a way that supports his case against Clinton. In 2012, a Mitt Romney-affiliated Super PAC said that Gingrich, then a Republican primary rival of Romney, had been "fined $300,000 for ethics violations" dating back to Gingrich’s tenure in Congress in the 1990s. In January 1997, the House voted to approve a committee’s report demanding that Gingrich pay a sum of $300,000 and admit that he had "engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives." (Here’s a timeline of the case.) We initially rated the super PAC’s claim True. However, after publication, one of Gingrich’s ethics lawyers in the case, J. Randolph Evans, demanded that we change our rating. He argued that Gingrich wasn't "fined" by the ethics committee but rather had to pay a "cost assessment." Given this linguistic technicality, we ended up downgrading our rating, but only from True to Mostly True, since legal experts told us that a "cost assessment" was not substantially different than a "fine." "Gingrich’s earlier position does undercut his current one," Roosevelt said. We reached out to the Trump campaign, Evans, and Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett but did not receive replies. Our ruling Gingrich said that in the Paula Jones case, Bill Clinton paid an "$850,000 penalty." According to legal experts, Clinton’s $850,000 payment does not qualify as a "penalty." It wasn’t imposed by a court (the court had dismissed the case); it was negotiated by the parties out of court; and it came with no admission of guilt.

pomt-04519	Says Adam Hasner said he will never accept a pay increase, but he voted to raise his pay four times.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/03/lois-frankel/frankel-says-hasner-promised-ill-never-accept-pay-/	Democrat Lois Frankel bashed her Republican congressional opponent Adam Hasner and portrayed him as a hypocrite in a recent attack ad. In the ad, Hasner says, "I'll never accept a pay increase." A narrator then notes, "But Hasner voted to raise his pay four times." In this fact-check, we will evaluate the ad's claim. We previously fact-checked a claim in an ad by the YG Action Fund, a conservative PAC, that Frankel "took a 40 percent pay raise" as mayor while West Palm Beach "lost jobs." We ruled that claim Half True -- she did get a 40 percent raise, but the ad misrepresented the employment picture. Hasner said he’ll reject a pay increase In Frankel’s ad, Hasner said, "I’ll never accept a pay increase." It’s not evident in the ad when he said that. The answer is that Hasner has repeatedly said it while running for Congress -- a federal job that currently pays $174,000 a year job. But Hasner’s pay raise votes relate to his former job in the state House, where he served from 2003 to 2010. In the state House, Hasner earned between $29,328 and $31,932 a year. When state workers get raises, legislators get automatic salary adjustments in July of the following year unless they pass a bill to prevent the raise. Both situations occurred during Hasner’s tenure: He got raises some years, and other years members prevented the raises or even took a cut as a symbolic gesture to voters amid an economic downturn. Frankel points to votes for pay raises Hasner took in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010. All four votes were appropriations bills that legislators must pass to pay for state workers’ salaries and expenses to keep government functioning -- they were not stand-alone votes on pay raises. We confirmed these votes, and found that the appropriations bills passed the House with wide margins. We agree with the first three votes cited by Frankel -- Hasner voted in favor of appropriations bills in 2003, 2005 and 2006 that led to salary raises between 2 and 3.6 percent for legislators. But the fourth vote -- the one in 2010 -- comes with a major caveat: lawmakers accidentally gave themselves a pay raise when they meant to take a pay cut, blaming it on a "drafting error," according to the Florida Times-Union. The article stated that Hasner, the majority leader, promised to fix the bill in negotiations with the Senate. Ultimately their salaries remained the same as the previous year: $29,697 Legislators voted for pay cuts in 2008 and 2009 that took effect that same year. Hasner also had a few years where his salary remained flat. Hasner claimed credit for the pay cut in 2008. The Sun-Sentinel wrote that the pay cut was proposed by state Rep. Ron Saunders, D-Key West, in a meeting and then by state Rep. Juan Zapata, R-Miami, on the House floor. Hasner, the House majority leader, told the Sentinel that he worked behind the scenes to get the pay cut: "Just because Juan Zapata was the name behind the amendment doesn't mean I wasn't a catalyst behind the idea. Leadership is more than just putting your name on something." Hasner gave PolitiFact a similar account: "You don’t put your name on every amendment when you are majority leader. ... I led the effort to cut my pay in the state Legislature when things got tough." (He reiterated that he led the pay cut effort in a September speech.) Overall, Hasner entered the House in 2003 making $29,328. His pay peaked in 2007 at $31,932. He left the House in 2010 making $29,697. Our ruling Frankel’s ad says Hasner said "I'll never accept a pay increase," but he "voted to raise his pay four times." We have several criticisms of this claim. For starters, Frankel didn’t make it clear that Hasner said he would never accept a pay increase if elected to Congress -- it's possible to view the ad and falsely think he said that while accepting pay raises in the state House. There is a significant difference between saying that he would freeze his own congressional pay at around $174,000 and voting for overall budget bills that included measly pay raises in the state House that took his pay from $29,328 to $31,932 (and then back down again). Also, Frankel omits that Hasner’s pay was frozen or cut for a few of his years in the House. And for one of those votes he did vote for a pay raise, but then House members said that was an accident, and they ultimately didn’t get a raise. Yes, Frankel says that he "voted" for the pay raises -- not that he "received" them. Right away Hasner said that was a mistake and would be fixed, and it was. There is a small kernel of truth here: Hasner did vote for three overall budgets that allowed himself to get a small pay raise. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10963	Tammy Baldwin "opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/20/leah-vukmir/sen-tammy-baldwins-patriotism-questioned-challenge/	Is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin opposed to schools displaying the American flag and having students say the Pledge of Allegiance and sing the national anthem in school? That’s a heavy-hitting claim from state Sen. Leah Vukmir of suburban Milwaukee, one of two major Republican candidates competing to face Baldwin in November 2018. The claim came in a June 1, 2018, tweet: "It’s clear Sen. Baldwin lacks pride in her country. She boldly opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms." Vukmir repeated the statement on her campaign website and during a July 6, 2018, interview on The Jay Weber Show on WISN-AM: "If you go back and look at some of the things she supported when she was in the Wisconsin Legislature, it’s embarrassing – boldly opposing displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge or singing the national anthem in our classrooms…" Is Vukmir right about Baldwin’s position on flag display, the pledge and national anthem in schools? In the end, Vukmir’s claim comes down to one vote from 22 years ago, ignoring other votes that Baldwin could pull out and cite as evidence of patriotism. Let’s take a look. The bill Included in Vukmir’s tweet was a link to the Assembly Journal for March 1996, which included a vote on Assembly Bill 667. Baldwin was elected to the chamber in 1993. The bill aimed to change some of the requirements around displaying the American flag, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing the national anthem in schools. They were as follows: In public and private schools, flags would have to be displayed in every classroom during school hours. At the time, schools had the option to display it on a flagstaff on school grounds or in the classroom. Public and private schools would have to offer the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem for grades 1 to 12 at the beginning of each school day. At the time, schools were required to offer the pledge to grades 1 to 8 once a week. A statement was also included saying if students or their parents objected, students couldn’t be forced to say the pledge or sing the anthem. So, the measure would have expanded requirements related to the pledge, flag and anthem that were on the books. It would not have created them, as Vukmir’s claim suggests. In the end, Baldwin was one of two Assembly members to vote against the bill. We could not locate any news articles from the time that included comments on why she voted against the measure. The Wisconsin State Journal did not have any record of coverage in its archives either. And Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt refused to comment on why Baldwin voted against the bill. In any case, Assembly Bill 667 died in the Senate. But language changing the grade levels where the pledge and national anthem had to be offered was later added to a budget bill, which passed in August 2001. By then Baldwin was in the U.S. House of Representatives. When asked for evidence to back up the claim, Mattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir’s campaign, pointed to the vote and basically repeated the words from the tweet. Gugel also emailed a statement from Vukmir: "This isn’t a belief of my campaign – it’s Baldwin’s voting record." Baldwin’s response The claim we’re examining is about a specific vote, and whether Vukmir characterized it correctly. However, it came in the context of a broad attack on Baldwin’s patriotism. Neidhardt, Baldwin’s campaign spokesman, said the attack was "despicable" and noted that Baldwin -- like other senators -- took an oath to uphold the Constitution when sworn into office. "Wisconsinites know that Tammy Baldwin is a dedicated leader who stands up for our country and its values every day, whether it's defending the display of the American flag, protecting the Pledge of Allegiance, or championing Buy American laws," Neidhardt said. He also cited three pieces of legislation Baldwin voted on related to the flag and pledge: In 2005, Baldwin voted in favor of Resolution 245, which urged the U.S. Supreme Court to "speedily find the use of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools to be consistent with the Constitution of the United States," citing two U.S. Court of Appeals rulings that were split on the issue. That same year, Baldwin supported the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005, which prevented condominium, cooperative, or residential real estate management associations from restricting members from displaying the American flag. In 2002, Baldwin voted in favor of a bill to reaffirm the phrase "one Nation under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance in 2002. Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin "opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms." She cited a Baldwin vote from more than 20 years ago. While the vote happened, the claim is presented in a way that ignores Baldwin’s other votes supportive of the flag and pledge. She portrayed the bill Baldwin voted against as one that would get rid of displaying the flag and offering the anthem and pledge in schools, when it was about changing specific requirements around them.

pomt-01774	Milwaukee County taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle a lawsuit over a decision by Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to use "untrained corrections officers" rather than deputies to patrol the lakefront.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/29/chris-moews/chris-moews-says-clarke-decision-lakefront-patrols/	Milwaukee County Sheriff’s candidate Chris Moews claims incumbent Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. compromised public safety and cost taxpayers $370,000 in a single decision. The decision: To have corrections officers patrol the lakefront. Moews, a Milwaukee Police lieutenant, made the claim in an interview July 14, 2014 on WUWM. Moews framed it as an example of mismanagement by Clarke, who he faces in the Democratic primary August 12, 2014. "One example of that is when he sent unarmed and untrained corrections officers down to the lakefront and out to our park-and-rides to patrol, last summer," Moews said. "A lawsuit was filed and the taxpayers had to write a check for $370,000 because of that single, poor management decision by the sheriff." There are many layers to this claim. So, let’s peel them apart. First, the $370,000 settlement that Moews referred to came in 2013. Why are we just hearing about it now? Turns out it was kept quiet -- at the county’s insistence. As part of the settlement, the Milwaukee County Deputy Sheriffs’ Association -- long at odds with Clarke -- promised not to publicize the settlement. Meanwhile, the matter did not go to the County Board. And Clarke said he had never seen the final settlement agreement and was surprised to learn, from PolitiFact Wisconsin, about its details. That said, the bottom line on Moew’s claim is that he’s got his facts jumbled. While the sheriff’s use of corrections officers cost taxpayers $370,000, Moews conflated two complaints that the deputies’ union brought against Clarke. Back to the beginning In 2004, Clarke started replacing deputies with corrections officers at the jail and House of Correction in an effort to save money. The corrections officers are paid less than deputies, are not sworn or armed and don’t have arrest powers. In June 2010, Clarke offered the corrections officers overtime shifts working crowd control for the the July 3 fireworks at the lakefront and at park-and-ride lots during Summerfest. The officers -- unarmed but in uniform -- were told to be on the lookout for troublemakers and alert dispatchers if they saw a problem. In the weeks that followed, the deputies’ union filed two unfair labor practice complaints with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The complaints, which were later combined, said Clarke gave work that had been previously been done by deputies to the corrections officers. Hearing examiner Stuart Levitan ruled in favor of the union in October of 2011. He ordered Clarke to bargain with the deputies union over the use of the corrections officers for the overtime duty. "Sheriff Clarke made a conscious decision to provide a lower level of public safety in exchange for cost savings," Levitan wrote in his decision. The practice of using corrections officers exclusively for the patrols ended with the case, said Mark Grady, deputy corporation counsel for the county. The other case It was an entirely different case that included the $370,000 settlement. In March of 2011, the deputies’ union filed complaint that said starting in January of that year, Clarke offered overtime at the jail and House of Correction only to the lower paid corrections officers. That led to arbitration before a state hearing examiner in 2012. In May of 2012, hearing examiner Raleigh Jones sided with the union. Jones said the decision to limit overtime -- estimated at 400 hours in one month, January 2011 -- violated the union contract. He ordered the county to reinstate the previous voluntary overtime practice, and directed the county and union to determine how much back pay the deputies deserved to cover lost overtime opportunities. The county and union settled the case with an agreement inked May 7, 2013. That agreement called for the county to pay the union $370,000 in wages, with the union determining who received the money. It was one of the largest arbitration settlements ever, according to union president Roy Felber. In addition, two unrelated discipline cases were resolved in that settlement. A 60-day suspension of one deputy was dropped to 10 days and a five-day suspension of another was reduced to one day. The settlement including this line: "The MDSA President Roy M. Felber further agrees not to contact the media regarding the terms of this agreement. The members of the MDSA shall only discuss the contents of this agreement as necessary." Felber said he gave Moews the bad information. "I mixed up the two cases," he said. "The principle is the same. The cases are different." Moews campaign manager Sachin Chheda acknowledged the jumbled information. "Chris does regret the error, but stands by the general thrust of his remark, that mismanagement by the sheriff is costing taxpayers unnecessarily," he said. Payments to settle matters such as grievances do not go to the County Board. "Corporation Counsel handles litigation, and details of this case were never shared." said Bill Zaferos, spokesman for the County Board. On that point, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and the comptroller’s office disagree. "The County Board was provided an informational update as to what happened in this matter over a couple of meeting cycles in mid 2013," said Steve Cady, policy and research director in the county comptroller’s office. Clarke’s view Clarke said he was unaware of the terms of the $370,000 settlement agreement. He said he didn’t know that it called for the reduced punishment for the two deputies, and didn’t know about the secrecy provision. "I welcome this being made public," he said. Clarke said the cases stem from his efforts to save money. He said that virtually all staffing at the jail is provided by corrections officers, and not deputies and that, until the grievance was filed, no deputies had sought overtime at the jail. "I think they (the union) exploited an opportunity," Clarke said. Clarke noted the deputies union initially sought $1.3 million -- the amount in overtime that had been paid to the corrections officers. Although the county paid $370,000 to settle the case, Clarke said: "I still saved taxpayers $1 million," by staffing jail overtime with the civilians. The sheriff said he urged the corporation counsel’s office to appeal the 2012 decision in the overtime case but they chose not to. The county and union then went about the business of hammering out the details of a settlement, a process that took more than a year. Inspector Edward Bailey, part of the Sheriff’s Department command staff, said he participated in early settlement discussions that included the union, arbitrator and county lawyers. "(The) $370,000 was unacceptable to this office, but they overruled us," Bailey said of the county’s lawyers. Both Clarke and Bailey said the gag order on the union included in the agreement did not come from them. Felber agreed: "That was (from) the county’s attorneys. I don’t think they wanted that amount to get out there." Our rating Moews claimed that taxpayers shelled out $370,000 because Clarke switched from deputies to lower paid corrections officers for lakefront and park and ride lot patrols. He got some of his facts and dates wrong, but the gist of his claim is correct. The union filed and won two complaints regarding the move to corrections officers, and county taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle one of them. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08750	On the mosque near ground zero.	no flip	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/30/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-makes-statements-about-mosque-near-gro/	The site for a proposed mosque near ground zero in New York may be more than 800 miles away, but that doesn't mean Georgia politicians are detached from the controversy. In an Aug. 19 article in The Marietta Daily Journal, candidates lined up to denounce its construction two blocks away from the scene of the Sept. 11 attack. Democratic nominee for governor Roy Barnes said it is too "painful and divisive" to build a mosque there. Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson called it "insensitive and inappropriate." Mike Crane, a Republican running for Congress, said it was "not appropriate, decent or honorable." Republican gubernatorial nominee Nathan Deal said this: "As governor, I don't want New Yorkers telling Georgians what to do with our land. I'll return the favor by staying out of their business." "Candidates differ on mosque near 9/11 site," the Daily Journal's headline concluded. That afternoon, The Associated Press posted an article with a different headline: "Barnes, Deal oppose mosque near ground zero." Deal called the mosque "an insult." Did Deal change his opinion on the mosque? AJC PolitiFact Georgia switched on our trusty Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a politician's position has shifted. Deal's opinion never wavered, his spokesman Brian Robinson said. As a candidate, he knows New York's decision is outside his purview. As an American, he finds it offensive. What Deal told the AP was simply more comprehensive than the view he expressed to The Marietta Daily Journal, Robinson said. To verify Robinson's assertion, we reviewed Deal's public statements and contacted Daily Journal reporter Jon Gillooly, who wrote the article. AJC PolitiFact Georgia searched for public statements by Deal on the mosque prior to the Marietta article. We found none. After the article ran, Deal made statements to the AP and WABE, Atlanta's public radio affiliate. Neither news outlet treated Deal's statements as a shift in his position. Both said his statements "went further" than those he made to the Daily Journal. When we approached Gillooly, he gave us a copy of his e-mail exchange with Robinson. He also described how he reported the story and the Deal camp's response to it. On Aug. 18, Gillooly e-mailed politicians asking what they thought of the mosque. The poll asked three questions: "Do you think a mosque should be allowed near Ground Zero?", "Why or why not?", "What’s the alternative?" Robinson and Gillooly confirmed the following: Robinson replied to the e-mail with Deal's two-sentence response. Gillooly did not ask a follow-up question. The paper printed the quote in its entirety Aug 19. That day, Robinson complained about the headline's use of the word "differ." He also asked whether Deal could expand on his statement for the online version of the story. The paper declined to change the article and gave Deal an opportunity to write a letter to the editor. Robinson said he didn't take the paper up on its offer. That afternoon, The Associated Press sent out its own story on the subject: "Barnes, Deal oppose NYC mosque." Deal said that as "a potential governor of the state of Georgia" he didn't have a say in what happens in New York. "I don't think government officials from one place should be telling government officials from someplace else what they ought to be doing," the Gainesville Republican said. "But as an American, I am absolutely opposed," Deal said. He called construction of the mosque two blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood "an insult." "It keeps the wounds of 9/11 alive," Deal said. Deal made a similar comment to WABE. So did Deal give an incomplete airing of his thoughts to the Marietta newspaper? Or did he actually switch positions? Although Deal's statements to The Marietta Daily Journal, Associated Press and WABE aren't identical, there is no evidence his opinion actually changed. There is also no indication he supported the mosque, or held no personal opinion on the mosque, prior to his interview with the Daily Journal. Plus, it's possible for Deal to say without contradiction that, as a governor, he would stay out of New York's business, but personally, he opposes the mosque. We rule there was no significant change in Deal's position. In other words, No Flip.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-08-30T06:00:00	2010-08-19	['None']
pomt-03775	"Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-three-10-texas-physicians-acc/	Saying Medicaid is a broken system that should not be expanded in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry and the state’s U.S. senators suggested many physicians decline to serve patients insured by the state-federal program. In an April 1, 2013, press release issued in conjunction with their joint Texas Capitol press conference, Perry and Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, all Republicans, said that nationally, Medicaid expenditures surged from 1990 to 2010, outpacing its caseload. Also, their press release said: "Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients." Elaborating in the press conference, Perry said: "And we fear that number may actually decrease if expansion went through." The 3-in-10 claim, brought to our attention by analyst Anne Dunkelberg of Austin’s liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, sounded familiar, especially after spokespeople for Perry and each senator said by email that it was based on a 2012 survey of Texas physicians by the Texas Medical Association. Preliminary results from the survey figured into one of our fact checks earlier this year. Final survey results are now compiled, Donna Kinney, the association’s lead researcher, told us by phone. Kinney said the results break out to 32 percent of Texas physicians saying they accept all new Medicaid patients and 42 percent declining all new Medicaid patients--with 26 percent limiting their new Medicaid patients. Put another way, the final results indicate that about four in 10 Texas physicians decline all new Medicaid patients while about six in 10 accept at least some new patients. "They may accept them only in the emergency room," Kinney speculated. "The limits could be anything." Early this year, we rated as Mostly True the association’s claim that only 31 percent of Texas physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared with 67 percent in 2000. The group’s Twitter post about the figure was missing clarification that the figure came from a survey. At the time, though, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission told us that some 67 percent of the state’s physicians had accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time. Goodman said then that she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients. Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s "preliminary findings" document says the respondents were a "representative sample" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, Kinney told us by email. The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. "For patients covered by the following payers," the question says, "does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?" According to the final results, Kinney said, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Some 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients, and 42 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared with 32 percent in 2010. For our previous check, Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit. We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone. For a "real-world" take, we ran the preliminary survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association. Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. Asked to appraise the Texas leaders’ declaration--that only three in 10 physicians accept new Medicaid patients--Kinney said: "The language does matter. They should have said ‘all’" new patients. In emails, Perry spokesman Josh Havens and Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin each said the leaders’ statement accurately reflected the association survey. Havens added that "you cannot continue to add context to manipulate the result you want." Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, also standing by the claim, said by email that the point is that Medicaid is a broken system. Our ruling Perry said only three in 10 Texas doctors currently accept new Medicaid patients. In a recent year, some 67 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim. More recently, 42 percent of the state’s physicians responding to a 2012 survey said they refuse all new Medicaid patients. Then again, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients and 26 percent said they limit such patients--signaling that 58 percent of physicians accept at least some new Medicaid patients.

pomt-14721	"We didn't go out and take" information from the Hillary Clinton campaign.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/22/bernie-sanders/Sanders-take-Clinton-voter-data/	It might feel like pure inside baseball, but the data breach that gave the Bernie Sanders campaign staff access to some of the Hillary Clinton campaign’s voter information goes to the heart of modern elections. At stake are the details that tell a campaign who is persuadable to the cause, and who’s likely to actually come out and vote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., apologized to the Democratic primary leader Hillary Clinton at a weekend debate in New Hampshire. Clinton accepted his apology and said it was time to move on. But in an interview the next day on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd pressed Sanders on exactly what happened when a software glitch allowed his people to see some of the Clinton data. The system is run by the Democratic National Committee, and the DNC had temporarily blocked the Sanders campaign from using its valuable voter information. "As a result of a breach caused by the DNC vendor, not by us, information came into our campaign about the Clinton campaign," Sanders said Dec. 20, 2015. "Magically," asked Todd? "We didn't go out and take it," Sanders replied. Really? In this fact-check, we’ll explore whether the Sanders campaign staff didn’t "go out and take" information from the Clinton campaign. A quick recap On Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2015, NGP VAN, the vendor that operates the system, released a software modification that had a bug. According to a lawsuit filed by the Sanders campaign, "several staff members of the campaign accessed and viewed confidential Information" that belonged to the Clinton campaign. The breach was reported within the Sanders campaign the same day. The staffer who had dug into the Clinton files, Josh Uretsky, told CNN that he had poked around in the system to document the extent of the software bug. By Wednesday, the DNC knew of the problem and contacted the Sanders campaign. Senior staff fired Uretsky at some point on Thursday. The DNC blocked the campaign from using the voter system pending an investigation. The Sanders campaign sued on Friday, and by Friday evening, access was restored. On Saturday, the Sanders campaign suspended two other staff members. Steps and missteps No one questions that a software error created the opportunity for the Sanders staffers to see what they shouldn’t. The press release from NGP VAN plainly says that. So then the question is, what did the Sanders campaign staff do? Thanks to a leak of the activity logs on the NGP VAN system, we have some idea. The Twitter user Iowa Starting Line posted them and you can see those logs here. No one has questioned their authenticity. Here’s one example: These logs show Sanders people spent a bit under two hours in the data. During that time, they called up information from about a dozen states. They queried the database for the number of voters who met certain criteria. The "Turnout" variable shows on a scale of 1 to 100 how likely a person is to vote. A voter with a high "Priority" score would be someone the campaign will make every effort to contact. The NGP VAN statement said the Sanders campaign could not see actual lists of voters. All that would be visible would be tallies of people. The sole exception was "a one page-style report containing summary data on a list was saved out of VoteBuilder by one Sanders user." That would correspond to the final item on the log above where at 11:41 a.m. there is a notation for "Hits counts and cross tabs 4 times." It is unclear if that page was printed out or copied. But it was created because a Sanders staff member took specific actions. Two people who know the NGP VAN system told PolitiFact that even the most minimal data gleaned from the Clinton campaign would have been valuable. David Atkins, a campaign consultant and county official in the California Democratic Party, told us that the information would give the Sanders campaign some idea of how the Clinton campaign was targeting voters. And it would offer "a sort of polling snapshot to see how well or poorly she was doing in certain states." Daniel Kreiss teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is the author of Taking our Country Back, which looks at Democratic online campaigning. "At the very least, topline numbers would provide a ballpark overview of the numbers the opposing campaign was working with in these states," Kreiss said. Not only could that open a window into the state of the race, it could help the Sanders campaign measure the accuracy of its own information. Atkins cautioned that to this day, only a handful of people actually know what took place. But the activity logs don’t help the Sanders campaign’s position. "What appears damning is that hours passed where they didn't contact the vendor immediately, which is what I -- and most campaign operatives -- would have done," Atkins said. We reached out to the Sanders campaign for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Sanders said that his campaign did not go out and take information from the Clinton campaign. From all accounts, it is true that the Sanders campaign did not attempt to break into the voter data of a rival campaign. The Sanders people stumbled upon a glitch. But rather than reporting the glitch immediately, they probed the database for a bit under two hours. At some point, the staff produced a page of information that at the very least would show the count of certain voters. Experts familiar with the Democratic voter data base say that the Sanders campaign would have gleaned valuable information. At the end of the day, they knew some things about the Clinton campaign that they hadn’t known before, even if they didn’t seek to crack into the Clinton data. We rate Sanders’ claim that the campaign didn’t "go out and take" information as Mostly False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-12-22T15:19:29	2015-12-20	['None']
pomt-10326	"I have little doubt that we've moved into recession at this point."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/25/barack-obama/he-probably-should-have-some-doubt-/	In a conversation with reporters en route from Chicago to California recently, Sen. Barack Obama expressed a bleak outlook on the nation's economy. "I have little doubt that we've moved into recession at this point," he said July 12, 2008. Aides said it was his most definitive judgment to date on the state of the economy. He made the point to support his call for a new economic stimulus package. "The sooner we can get money into people's pockets, the sooner that we can stabilize the housing market," he continued. "And the sooner that we can send a message to the markets that we're serious about creating an energy policy that will create greater energy efficiency over the next decade or so, I think the sooner we're going to get our fundamentals right." Prescriptions aside, we wondered whether his premise — that the nation is in a recession — was correct. There's ample reason to be concerned about the economy: home prices are down, automobile sales have slowed, unemployment is up, gas prices are sky-high, food prices are rising, and so on. But none of that necessarily means we're in a recession. By widespread consensus, the arbiter of whether this country is in a recession is the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit research organization based in Cambridge, Mass. What persuaded us of the bureau's status as the official recession referee was that countless economists said — both in interviews with us and in articles like this , this and this — that the profession as a whole defers to the bureau on the matter. And the bureau has not said we are in a recession. That's not to say we're not — typically, the declaration comes six to 18 months after the recession hits. "We have not said we're in a recession now, but that doesn't mean we're not in one because we always tell you after the fact," said Donna Zerwitz, spokesperson for the bureau. There's a widespread misconception, even among some economists, that the bureau defines recessions as two or more consecutive periods of decline in the country's gross domestic product. If that were the case, Obama would be wrong, because the GDP actually increased slightly in the first quarter of 2008. But recessions are not always marked by two or more consecutive periods of negative GDP growth, the bureau says. "Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them," the bureau explains on its Web site. "Our procedure differs from the two-quarter rule in a number of ways." Recessions are declared by the bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is made up of seven volunteer economists. They consider the depth as well as the duration of the decline in economic activity. And they use a constellation of indicators, not just GDP. Here's how the group defines a recession, as pulled from its Web site: "A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales." Bottom line: "It's unknowable at this point whether what we're going through is a recession," said Chad Stone, chief economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. "My opinion is that the formal definition of whether we're in a recession or not is less important than the fact that we have had a significant economic downturn." Still, Obama didn't say "downturn," he said "recession," a loaded term that can trigger an emotional reaction in an audience and, if it's uttered by the right person, a jittery response by stockholders and consumers. So we're holding him to it. Neither Obama's economic adviser Austan Goolsbee nor his spokesman Tommy Vietor returned calls to explain why Obama said what he did. Because the National Bureau of Economic Research has not ruled on the matter, we can't say for sure that Obama was wrong. But he implied that there is little doubt that we're in a recession, when in fact there is ample room for doubt. Remember, recessions typically include negative growth, and GDP actually rose slightly in the first quarter of this year. Obama may well have little doubt that we're in a recession. But it's difficult to conceive that his economic advisers, who surely have a handle on the technical nuances at work, had not informed him that there's room for plenty of doubt about that. So we rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14256	"Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/11/frank-luntz/frank-luntz-says-team-trump-has-accused-ted-cruz-f/	In a tweet, Republican consultant Frank Luntz lofted a claim about Donald Trump poking at Ted Cruz that made us wonder. Luntz wrote April 5, 2016: "States where Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud: Iowa Texas Colorado Oklahoma Louisiana Kansas Maine Utah Wisconsin" That’s a passel of accusations. Did Trump or his surrogates accuse Cruz of fraud in all these states? We remember that after Sen. Cruz prevailed over Trump in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, the New York businessman maintained that Cruz had deceived voters in part with misleading mailers about personal voting histories. We asked Luntz about the basis of all his bulleted states. On Twitter, Luntz said first that he didn’t have insider information. Then he guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, a website created for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. That’s a super PAC launched in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially another aspirant at the time, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to a Reuters news story. The post noted by Luntz touts the Trump Ballot Security Project which, the post says, is "investigating hundreds of complaints of voter fraud in the Utah Republican Primary won by" Cruz. The post also suggests fraud concerns in up to six additional states, starting with Cruz’s home state of Texas, whose GOP presidential primary he won. But, according to the post, the ballot-security project started "when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the" March 2016 "Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case," the post says, "votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio." The group’s Texas claim is unsubstantiated, we found. Pants on Fire! After the Texas primary, stopthesteal.org’s post says, the group "established a toll-free number to collect further reports of voter irregularities. Almost immediately," the post said, "there were over 300 complaints from Oklahoma. Only a week later the Kansas and Maine caucuses brought hundreds of more complaints including claims of double-voting by" Cruz "supporters." The post further says the project is "analyzing voter irregularities in Ohio and Hawaii. The Trump Ballot Security Project is committed to investigating all complaints of voter fraud. In the event a pattern can be determined, the seating of these delegations can and will be challenged before the Credentials committee of the Republican National Convention. We have dispatched lawyers and election-law experts to all of the states mentioned above to investigate and document voter fraud." From all that, we count seven states having or possibly having voting irregularities unhelpful to Trump: Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Maine -- with the Trump ballot-security project looking into fraud reports from Ohio and Hawaii. To be fair, the pro-Trump post explicitly names Cruz as the beneficiary (and possible miscreant) only in Texas, Kansas and Maine. Still, we spotted indications that Trump or his supporters have accused Cruz of wrongdoing in other states and heard as much directly from Stone. Other analyses The day we asked Luntz about his tweet, The Daily Wire -- which says its goal is to "unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public and devastate their funding bases" -- posted a story laying out instances of Trump expressing dirty-trick concerns about pro-Cruz results in states including Louisiana and Wisconsin. Its story starts with mention of Trump’s complaint about the Cruz campaign in Iowa tweeting incorrect information about then-candidate Ben Carson. Next, the story describes Trump later asserting Cruz’s camp had illegally coordinated with an anti-Trump super PAC on a Utah Facebook ad showing Trump’s wife, Melania, once posing nude. That coordination charge recently came out False on the Truth-O-Meter. Also, The Daily Wire story noted, Trump posted a tweet threatening a lawsuit after the Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz might pick up as many as 10 additional delegates in Louisiana despite Trump drawing more votes in its primary. In April 2016, Trump told a Wisconsin crowd that even though he outpolled the field in the Pelican State, Cruz was garnering more delegates. "It’s not fair, folks, it’s not fair," Trump said. "Because I’m the outsider. What they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going." According to a New Orleans Times-Picayune news story, Cruz had a chance after Louisiana’s balloting to pick up uncommitted delegates plus delegates who had committed to dropout Rubio. Meantime, Jason Doré, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said party officials would be prepared if Trump sued. The Daily Wire story also said that after Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement asserting an anti-Trump super PAC had coordinated its ads in the state with a pro-Cruz super PAC. In the statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Cruz was propelled to his win of the state by false advertising and he "was coordinating with his own super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him," Hicks said. The Daily Wire story noted too that Stone said in an April 2, 2016, appearance on the online Breitbart News Saturday: "Having worked very hard to collect evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Texas, frankly, they ought to put the handcuffs on him," referring to Cruz, "because the Trump people can go to credentials," meaning the July 2016 Republican National Convention’s credentials panel, "and challenge the seating of hundreds, literally hundreds of Ted Cruz’s delegates who were fraudulently elected." "Go to StopTheSteal.org," Stone instructed. "For over a month we have had an 800 number up, a toll-free number. We have collected and documented with sworn affidavits thousands of claims of voter irregularities in the states where Ted Cruz has won. And we’re prepared to present them to the credentials committee." Summing up, then, that’s eight states either named by Trump or advocate Stone as having voting irregularities that helped Rubio or Cruz, not counting Ohio and Hawaii, where stopthesteal.org says Trump backers are still investigating. Stone: ‘Over 2,200 affidavits’ Hoping for elaboration, we sent an email to Trump’s campaign and called the anti-fraud phone number on the group’s site. We didn't hear back from either. We had luck with Stone, though, who replied by email that the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness had no immediate plans to release what he described as over 2,200 affidavits documenting "voter irregularities" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. Stone said the sworn statements would be submitted to the convention’s credentials panel if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel "elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected" through "a pattern of voter fraud." "Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign," Stone wrote. Stone was dismissive when we told him Republican party officials in Texas had told us they were unaware of any irregularities affecting the results in that state’s primary. "Of course not," he wrote. "Why would they admit it?" GOP officials: Nothing awry Mike Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, had told us by phone that the party confirmed no irregularities in that state’s presidential primary. Also, our inquiries in a few other states, including searches of the Nexis news database, yielded no confirmed irregularities. At the Oklahoma Republican Party, spokesman Jake Parsons told us by phone there had been no irregularities in its March presidential primary or accusations by "Team Trump" against victor Cruz. Until we inquired, Parsons said, he hadn’t heard about any 300 phone calls (as mentioned on stopthesteal.org) suggesting pro-Cruz fraud. Parsons allowed, though, that individuals who failed to register as Republicans by a February 2016 deadline were upset at not being allowed to participate in the vote. "We actually have a great working relationship with the Trump and Cruz campaigns," Parsons said. We heard a similar refrain from Jason Savage, executive director of Maine’s Republican Party. "To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump's campaign," Savage said by email. "In fact, we enjoyed working with Mr. Trump's campaign and the other presidential campaigns for our caucus. Our process was fair, secure and each campaign had access to exactly the same information and opportunities." Savage said individuals "may have voiced complaints from one side or another, but none of the presidential campaigns raised concerns over fraud."In fact, I believe each of the campaigns praised our team's work and process in written or verbal form in the days following the caucus. Clayton Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said no Trump complaints have reached the party. Barker said he had seen Facebook posts suggesting busloads of Cruz supporters were able to vote in one county’s caucus and then hustle to vote in caucuses elsewhere but those were unconfirmed and, he said, party officials reviewed voter lists to ensure no one voted in separate caucuses. Our ruling Luntz said: "Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin. Trump or Stone, his former campaign operative, have raised questions about the results in these states and more. But we didn’t identify "Team Trump" charges of fraud against Cruz in all the Luntz-listed states. The most pointed charges single out Cruz for supposedly misleading Iowa voters and later conspiring with super PACs in Utah and Wisconsin. Mentions of double-voting or unspecified "irregularities" in other states hint at a Cruz role without adding up to fraud accusations. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07745	An illegal immigrant who gains admission at a public college takes class space away from students who are legal residents.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/28/don-balfour/lawmaker-says-illegal-immigrant-students-takes-cla/	This legislative session, many state lawmakers have Illegal immigrants on the brain. Bills under consideration at the Gold Dome aim to chase illegal immigrants from the state’s work force, prevent cities from offering them safe haven, and in the case of House Bill 59, block them from admission to Georgia’s public colleges. They’re taking up classroom space that could go to students who are legal residents, argued state Sen. Don Balfour. During a Feb. 15 committee hearing, the Snellville Republican told the story of two freshmen he said had trouble registering for classes at Gainesville State College and Georgia Gwinnett College because they were full. Both were legal residents. "If there’s one student that’s at Georgia Gwinnett College that’s not here legally, that student [the legal resident] is losing his position to someone who’s not here legally," Balfour said. Really? We thought the Board of Regents, which oversees the University System of Georgia, changed its policy in October to prevent this from happening. Starting this fall, no illegal immigrant will be allowed admission in any public school in the state that turns away qualified applicants, such as the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. That means no legal resident will be denied admission because an illegal immigrant has already filled his slot. House Bill 59, which Balfour backs, would bar illegal immigrants from enrolling in any public, postsecondary education institution in Georgia. Right now, Georgia’s public colleges may admit illegal immigrants, so long as the students pay full tuition instead of the much lower in-state resident rate. But not for long. In March 2010, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl, an illegal immigrant, was arrested on a traffic charge. School officials realized she was being charged in-state tuition. Her arrest prompted the Board of Regents to ban illegal immigrants from the state’s five most selective schools starting in fall 2011: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Georgia College & State University, and Georgia Health Sciences University. Gainesville State and Georgia Gwinnett grant admission to every student who meets basic admission requirements. Since every qualified person can enroll, none of them, legal or illegal, can be shut out. Getting into the classes students want to take, though, can be another story. PolitiFact Georgia talked to Balfour, who gave us more information about the freshmen who could not get into classes they wanted. He did not identify them. The Gainesville State student registered early for classes and went off to Army basic training, Balfour said. While he was away, a notice came in the mail saying he needed to pay an additional charge to complete registration. By the time the soldier returned, he had been dropped from his courses and had to sign up again. Class times he wanted were full. In the Georgia Gwinnett case, a student decided one month before the beginning of the term that he wanted to go to college and found most classes were already full, Balfour said. Balfour said he was not aware of specific cases where an illegal immigrant took the spot of a legal resident, but said that Colotl likely did so. That’s a sensible assumption. One month before the Colotl’s arrest, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that campuses were running low on courses and faculty. Kennesaw State students said they had to delay graduation because they could not get into all the courses they needed. Yet we found no specific evidence in that article or elsewhere of illegal immigrants keeping legal residents out of classes. Representatives from both schools mentioned by Balfour said that typically, a slot is open that term for the same course but at another time. Still, popular courses do fill up. After Colotl’s arrest, regents determined the number of what they call "undocumented" students in the University System. Of the University System’s more than 310,000 students, 501 were "undocumented," their data showed. That’s less than 0.2 percent. Fifty-two were Gainesville State students. Two attended Georgia Gwinnett. Some 8,800 students are enrolled at Gainesville State. Georgia Gwinnett’s enrollment is about 5,300. In 2010, leaders at several public colleges told the AJC that students can’t get into classes they want because the schools don’t have enough money to hold more classes. During the past 10 years, University System enrollment spiked by about 34 percent, according to state data, but the state Legislature increased funding by only about 12 percent. Balfour acknowledged to PolitiFact Georgia that in most cases, students are likely crowded out of classes because there isn’t enough space. Still, lawmakers shouldn’t overlook the potential problem posed by illegal immigrants, he said. Strictly speaking, Balfour’s initial statement is correct. If a single illegal immigrant snags a spot in a popular course that fills up, legal residents can miss out. However, Balfour’s statement does not acknowledge the fundamental problem, which is tight resources. Given the small number of "undocumented" students, it’s safe to say that most of the time, legal residents are taking the slots away from one another. Balfour’s statement is accurate but could have used clarification. Therefore it meets the Truth-O-Meter’s definition of Mostly True.

pomt-05169	Says her congressional district has 10,000 medical-device industry jobs and 1,000 will be lost because of health-care law tax.	mostly false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/17/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-says-health-care-law-will-lead-lo/	We’ll know later this month what the Supreme Court has done to the Affordable Care Act and which of its thousands of provisions will stand or be axed. Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is trying to nibble away at individual provisions. Several members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., recently gathered for a photo opportunity and to speak for repealing a health-care law provision that applies to a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and for a bill that would repeal it. "In my congressional district, we have about 10,000 individuals that are employed in the medical device industry," Blackburn said. "We have estimates from the Manhattan Institute that 1,000 of those jobs will be lost if this tax stays on the books." That sounded pretty drastic to us. We decided to check out the accuracy of Blackburn’s summary of the institute’s findings, and what went into the institute’s estimate. We first went to Blackburn’s press person, Mike Reynard, who sent us a YouTube video of Blackburn’s statement; LifeScience Tennessee’s Workforce Development Survey which includes as its third federal and regulatory priority "Medical Device Tax Repeal"; and, the Manhattan Institute’s 30-page analysis of "The Employment Effects of the New Excise Tax on the Medical Device Industry" by Diana and Harold Furchtgott-Roth. The Manhattan Institute is a conservative, market-oriented policy think tank based in New York City. It has received funding from the usually politically neutral Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Walton family foundation, but also from very conservative Koch and Scaife family foundations. LifeScience Tennessee is the non-profit advocacy group promoting the life science industry in the Volunteer State. Its survey uses slightly different numbers from Blackburn’s in describing the Manhattan Institute’s findings, saying it "predicts a loss of 1,000 jobs in Tennessee, which currently employs more than 9,000 workers directly and many more indirectly." Since we know some of those 9,000 jobs are in Johnson City, Chattanooga and and Knoxville and other places outside Blackburn’s 7th Congressional District, we can begin to quibble with Blackburn’s suggestion that 10,000 are in her district, which stretches to connect suburban Nashville to suburban Memphis. Figures for 2011 from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development indicate there were 236 medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties -- or more than 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed were in her own congressional district. Blackburn represents people in parts of two of those counties -- Davidson and Shelby -- and those counties employ 6,044 people, a majority of the jobs in that category. We also know that in Shelby County, a large majority of those jobs have long been located in the mostly urban 9th Congressional District, not the suburban-rural 7th. Three Medtronic and three Smith & Nephew operations all have addresses within the 9th Congressional District. Also worth noting -- because of re-districting, Blackburn will represent neither Shelby nor Davidson next year if she’s re-elected. Reynard, her spokesman, said Blackburn didn’t mean to say "in my congressional district," but rather that "she meant ‘state.’ " However, as of June 15, the video of the statement was still posted by the "RepMarshaBlackburn" channel on YouTube without any clarification, and other partisan websites were featuring it. PolitiFact policy is to rule on what is said, but to acknowledge when someone admits to a mistake and take that into account when making a ruling. Blackburn does make the point that anything affecting medical device manufacturing could have a significant effect on Tennessee employment -- many of her suburban residents do in fact work for firms like Smith & Nephew and Medtronic -- so let’s look at exactly what the Manhattan folks said. The study says Tennessee had 9,179 medical device manufacturing jobs statewide in 2009, nearly 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed. It then goes into a discussion from Macroeconomics 101 on the excise tax’s anticipated effect on the elasticity of demand for medical devices. It assumes that price-sensitive elasticity would send some manufacturing offshore. It breaks down the number of jobs lost by the effect of the tax on a shift in production offshore of 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, all the way up to 30 percent, where it says as many as 146,218 of the estimated 409,000 jobs nationwide might be lost. Table 11 on page 21 of the report indicates that in Tennessee 1,023 of 9,179 jobs would be lost statewide assuming a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore. But is that shift to overseas employment a reasonable assumption? We hear a lot of talk these days about penalizing, not rewarding, companies that use the overseas labor of low-wage countries. To the extent it’s not just talk, some politicians are seeing that some constituents thought they favored "free trade" until they saw that free-trade agreements may lower standards of living and manufacturing employment numbers of higher-wage countries. It’s safe to say this debate will rage on, but what’s less clear is the extent to which health-care spending is sensitive to fluctuations in price. How will those who need a catheter or a stent, or those who manufacture them, respond to the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax? If someone needs crutches, is a 2.3 percent rise in price a major consideration? A 2006 study cited by Businessweek in March indicates health-related spending is "relatively inelastic: When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much." The same Businessweek article notes that another study, commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed, also assumed that American manufacturers would ship 10 percent of jobs overseas in response to the tax. But since the tax applies to all devices -- those made overseas as well as domestic production -- there would be no incentive to move production out of the country, it says, describing a Bloomberg Government analysis. Devices manufactured in the U.S. for sale overseas are exempt from the tax. It also makes the case that the industry trade group underestimated the increased demand for medical devices from the 32 million more people who will be insured under the Affordable Care Act. Our ruling Blackburn exaggerates the number of medical device manufacturing jobs in her district and in the state while citing a free-market advocate’s 2009 study that says 1,000 jobs could be lost statewide. Some of the assumptions made by The Manhattan Institute study have been questioned, and the provisions of the bill itself mean there’s little reason to suspect there would be much off-shoring based on the excise tax.

pomt-01620	"In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-tax-share-paid-corporations-ha/	As politicians and commentators were criticizing decisions by companies to shift their corporate headquarters overseas in order to cut their tax bill to Uncle Sam, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., created a shareable meme to illustrate how much corporate tax collection has plunged over the past few decades. The meme says: "Want to better understand why we have a federal deficit? In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent. It’s time for real tax reform." A reader asked us to check his claim, so we did. First, we can confirm that corporate profits are very near an all-time high. This chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that corporate profits after taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product hit their historical peak in the third quarter of 2013, before dropping marginally since then. But what about corporate taxes as a percentage of all federal tax revenue? Sanders is basically on the mark here, too. Here’s the relevant historical data from the Office of Management and Budget. The first chart shows 1952. The first row features raw dollars and the second row shows the percentage of all tax revenues that particular tax represented: 1952 taxes Individual income taxes Corporate income taxes Social insurance and retirement taxes Excise taxes Other taxes Total tax revenue $27.9 billion $21.2 billion $6.4 billion $8.9 billion $818 million $65.3 billion 43 percent 33 percent 10 percent 14 percent 1 percent 100 percent And here’s the data for 2013: 2013 taxes Individual income taxes Corporate income taxes Social insurance and retirement taxes Excise taxes Other taxes Total tax revenue $1.3 trillion $274 billion $948 billion $84 billion $19 billion $2.6 trillion 50 percent 10 percent 36 percent 3 percent 1 percent 100 percent So, corporate taxes accounted for 33 percent of all tax revenue in 1952 but just 10 percent in 2013. The 2013 figure is slightly higher than what Sanders said, but his claim is basically accurate on the numbers. That said, the measurement Sanders used may not be the best. Economists told us that it would be more useful to know what corporate taxes were as a percentage of gross domestic product. But looking at it that way, the general pattern also holds. In 1952, corporate taxes accounted for 5.9 percent of GDP, a figure that has fallen to 1.6 percent today. So Sanders has a point that corporate tax collections have plummeted as a percentage of all taxes collected, even as corporate profits have hit record highs. But a range of economists offered two bits of cautionary context worth considering. • The year 1952 is somewhat cherry-picked. That year ranks third-highest in history for corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP. "It was a time when the U.S. was the colossus of the world economy and faced very little competition from foreign-based firms," said Daniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute economist. That said, even as recently as 1979, corporate taxes accounted for 2.6 percent of GDP, a full percentage point higher than today. So the decline is real, even if you use a subsequent year. • Today, most business income is taxed through the individual income tax code, rather than the corporate code. This concerns a distinction only a CPA could love. One type of corporation, a "C-corporation," pays corporate income taxes on its profits. Another type, the "S-corporation," pays taxes on its profits through the individual income-tax returns of the owner. "Changes in tax rates and rules for C- and S-corps contributed to more firms becoming S-corps and thus paying individual rather than corporate income tax," said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation. That has boosted individual income-tax collections and reduced corporate income-tax collections. Between 1980 to 2010, the category of businesses that includes S-corporations, sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs has increased by 10.9 million to over 30 million, while the number of corporations has declined, Pomerlau said. This means there are fewer corporations to pay the corporate income tax. In addition, the amount of business income generated by these types of businesses has risen as well, Pomerlau said. Between 1980 and 2010, this type of income has increased fivefold, from $320 billion to more than $1.6 trillion, he said. "In fact, most recent data shows that (these) businesses are earning more total net income than traditional C-corporations," Pomerlau said. "In 1980, it was the complete opposite." Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that looking at C-corporations alone produces a cloudy picture. "It's hard to say what share of revenue would come from corporate income tax today if those changes hadn't occurred," he said. Our ruling Sanders said, "In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent." Sanders is right if you use the official numbers, but it’s worth noting that the figure for individual income taxes now includes a significant chunk of taxes assessed on corporate profits. That muddies the otherwise clear picture Sanders tries to paint. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2014-08-28T17:16:41	2014-08-27	['None']

pomt-00629	About 85 percent of hotel guests who will pay the new $5 hotel/motel fee will be from outside Georgia.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/25/jay-roberts/will-out-staters-or-georgians-pay-most-new-hotel-f/	A new nightly $5 fee on hotel stays in Georgia won’t be collected for another six weeks, but the question remains just who will be paying it. Conservative estimates show the fee will pay close to 20 percent of the roughly $900 million that the transportation bill, House Bill 170, is expected to raise annually to tackle a backlog of transportation needs. Former state rep. Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, who spearheaded the bill, said about 85 percent of the hotel guests who pay the fee will be from outside Georgia. "This shifts some of the burden to visitors who will have to share the costs to modernize the transportation network in Georgia," said Roberts, now a planning director for the state Department of Transportation, during floor debate on the final bill. The state’s hospitality industry, though, was blindsided by the last-minute addition of the fee and has claimed it will hurt business and Georgians. The Georgia Convention and Visitors Bureau points to a survey of hoteliers that shows about a third of leisure guests are in-state tourists. Those people will already be paying an average of 6 cents more a gallon for gas when the law takes effect July 1. So who is right? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. First, remember we already checked a claim that the fee will hurt Georgia’s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state. We ruled Mostly True with a caveat: There is nothing that says the new fee must be passed along to hotel guests. In fact, looking at data from Savannah-area hotels, those businesses would be better off absorbing the cost – about $18.7 million a year, based on published occupancy rates – than passing it along and potentially chasing away 7.5 percent of room nights. That would cost hotels about $22.5 million. But if hotels pass them along to guests, where are those folks from? Roberts said he cited his figure based on memory of lawmakers’ debates on funding for the new Falcons stadium. "I remember … that we were told that approximately 85 percent of the people that stay in the metro Atlanta motels/hotels are from out of state," Roberts said. In fact, Roberts underestimated slightly. According to a website run by stadium advocates, 86 percent of overnight guests in the state’s largest hotel market are from outside Georgia. So where does the Georgia CVB get its figures? From the 2013 Georgia Longwood study that looked at both statewide figures as well as Atlanta, which has 94,000 of the state’s 177,000 hotel rooms. That report concluded 31 percent of leisure guests – that is, not including business travelers, conventioneers or people traveling with social groups like a church or school trip – were in-state travelers. For the Atlanta region, in-state travelers accounted for only 20 percent of the total. "Almost half of the state’s hotel rooms are in the Atlanta metro, so you need to look at the figures in other regions to get a more clear picture of how many Georgians are affected by this fee," said Julie Ford Musselman, head of the Georgia CVB. That picture is a bit fuzzy, given that there is no single way that regions reported where their guests were from and what kind of guests they were. Hotels in the Lake Lanier area, for instance, reported based on the number of leisure and group bookings, with Georgians making up 73 percent and 56 percent, respectively. "We have not done an aggregate study for every category, but looking at what we have, we can say that most definitely the $5 fee impacts Georgians more heavily than anyone realized when they passed this transportation bill," Musselman said. "The ability to book business and keep our existing customer base, in every market, is our concern." Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who had helped PolitiFact Georgia with the business costs in our previous fact check, agrees. More specifically, he said, the question of how the fee affects every region of the state is a salient economic point. And, while the hospitality industry cannot provide verifiable answers, neither could state lawmakers before passing the bill that included the fee. Even Atlanta, while less susceptible to the fee, could potentially see increased competition from out-of-state tourist or business spots. No one can say for sure, Seaman said, because there was no study. "There has not been enough careful analysis done on this," Seaman said. "There are clearly going to be differential regional effects. The numbers are plausible, but we don’t know what they will mean." Our ruling The state lawmaker who helped Georgia pass a nearly $900 million bill to tackle the state’s backlog of road and bridge work said a hotel fee in the bill would help shift the burden to out-of-state visitors. Jay Roberts was correct with his numbers, at least in the largest hotel market in the state. But hoteliers have a point that the fee could hit more Georgians in the state’s smaller cities and regions, even if the numbers vary by the type of visitors staying. Roberts implied the 85 percent out-of-state figure was statewide, even if his citation was clearly only for metro Atlanta. He was accurate, but the statistic needs more information to be fully understood. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jay Roberts	None	None	None	2015-05-25T00:00:00	2015-03-31	['None']
pomt-07232	Medicare "only has about 50 percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes, and the rest is deficit spending ... or debt spending."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/01/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-half-medicare-deficit-spending/	In an appearance on ABC's This Week on May 29, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty said the hard reality is that Medicare is "going broke." Medicare, Pawlenty said, "only has about 50 percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes, and the rest is deficit spending and debit spending, or debt spending. So we have to fix it." Medicare, which provides health care to about 50 million elderly or disabled Americans, is financed through a combination of funding streams: a Medicare payroll tax; general revenue (mostly from federal income taxes); premiums paid by Medicare users; and a tax on Social Security benefits and state payments toward the prescription drug benefit. We'll go a little deeper in the weeds. The program is financed through two separate trust fund accounts: the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. Medicare payroll taxes go to the HI trust fund, which is primarily used to pay for inpatient hospital stays (otherwise known as Medicare Part A). The SMI trust fund is used to pay for physicians visits, outpatient care and prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part B and Part D). The SMI trust fund is funded primarily (about 75 percent) through general revenue, with most of the rest coming from patient premiums. Let's start with the first half of Pawlenty's statement, that "only about 50 percent" of Medicare is paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes. According to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, Medicare expenditures came to $523 billion in 2010. Here's a breakdown of the revenue side of the equation: • Payroll taxes, $182 billion • Premiums, $61 billion • Taxation of benefits, $13.8 billion • General revenue, $205 billion • Transfers from states for prescription drug benefits, $4 billion If you break out premiums and payroll taxes, Pawlenty is correct that they covered about half the cost of Medicare in 2010. Okay, but what about the second half of the statement, that the rest of Medicare expenses came from "deficit spending ... or debt spending." Lisa Potetz of the Washington consulting group Health Policy Alternatives Inc. and co-author of a 22-page "Primer on Medicare Financing" in July 2009, said characterizing general revenue as "deficit spending" is misleading. Yes, she said, the government is spending more than it is taking in. But not all government spending is deficit spending. In order for Pawlenty's statement to be accurate, you’d have to assume only the deficit portion of the budget is used for Medicare. Using Pawlenty's logic, she said, you could instead put Medicare funding first and then say all of defense spending is deficit spending. Potetz also believes Pawlenty's comment misleads because from its start in 1965, the Medicare program was set up to be partially funded by general revenue. "His comment suggests that these things (payroll taxes and premiums) are supposed to pay for the program and aren’t doing their job," Potetz said. "It was never the case that it was going to be entirely funded through payroll taxes and premiums. It's a little misleading to suggest something went awry." In fact, for years, the HI trust fund ran a surplus and was used to fund other parts of the federal budget. To the extent you consider that "banked" money, there was a balance of about $344 billion as of last year. In recent years, however, hospitalization and nursing home costs have outpaced the amount coming in from payroll taxes (a problem that is expected to get much worse in coming years as more baby boomers reach retirement age). As a result, the HI fund has been "drawing down" its surplus, and is expected to deplete it within several years. At that point, the gap between what's taken in from payroll taxes and the actual cost of hospitalization would have to be picked up by taxpayers. The SMI trust fund -- again, the fund used to pay for physicians visits and prescription drugs -- was set up so that a portion is paid through patient premiums, but the majority is paid from the general revenue. Last year, the government paid $205 billion from general revenue into the fund. Cost projections for that program are cause for alarm, but the financing of the program was always intended to come primarily from general revenue, Potetz said. Medicare expert Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research, an independent policy group, said a shift from hospital care to more outpatient care and physicians services has put a strain on the SMI fund, as has the prescription drug benefit added in 2006. But it's misleading to call general revenues put into the fund "deficit spending," she said. We asked Pawlenty spokesman Alex Conant for some backup for Pawlenty's statement, particularly that the amount not covered by payroll taxes and premiums comes from deficit spending. Conant pointed us toward two sources. The first was a Dec. 1, 2010, NPR interview with Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office (and former chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign) who said, "If you look past the next eight to 10 years, Medicare is the deficit problem. And there's simply no way we can address our fiscal problems without coming to terms with Medicare's future." Conant also pointed to this warning from the 2011 annual report from the Medicare Board of Trustees: "The drawdown of Social Security and HI trust fund reserves and the general revenue transfers into SMI will result in mounting pressure on the federal budget. In fact, pressure is already evident. For the sixth consecutive year, a 'Medicare funding warning' is being triggered, signaling that projected non-dedicated sources of revenues -- primarily general revenues -- will soon account for more than 45 percent of Medicare’s outlays. That threshold was in fact breached for the first time in fiscal 2010." It's certainly true that the cost of Medicare is growing and that general revenue -- primarily from income taxes -- is shouldering a growing share of the load. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded the exploding cost of Medicare and other entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Social Security had put the federal budget on an "unsustainable fiscal path." One could argue that added Medicare costs to a budget that is already running a deficit is simply adding on more deficit spending. But inasmuch as Medicare has always been supplemented by general revenues, we think it's a little misleading to characterize anything not paid by Medicare payroll taxes or patient premiums as deficit spending. And so we rate Pawlenty's statement Half True.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2011-06-01T18:32:17	2011-05-29	['None']

pomt-06365	In Libya, "America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/03/joe-biden/biden-calls-libya-job-well-done/	Speaking Oct. 21, 2011 in Plymouth, New Hampshire, Vice President Joe Biden did not confirm the death of former Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, even as rumors of his death were flying. But the vice president was happy to credit the Obama administration with a job well done. "In this case, America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life," Biden told an audience at Plymouth State University. "This is more the prescription for how we deal with the world going forward than we have in the past," he said, arguing that the cost of the operation in Libya was low, both in lives and dollars, compared to other military operations. Biden is right about the fatalities. Few American soldiers set foot in Libya during the seven-month campaign, led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and certainly no fatalities were reported, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Robbins. But is he correct about the $2 billion figure? We decided to take a look. Reached for comment, Biden’s office conceded that the vice president’s numbers were on the high side, saying that he wanted to leave room for spending that might not be accounted for. Instead, the VP’s office deferred to the Department of Defense, which reports that total spending for the Libya intervention reached $1.1 billion through September 30, 2011. The Pentagon’s estimate covers the costs of daily military operations, munitions used, humanitarian assistance and the draw-down of supplies, according to Robbins, the department spokeswoman. But that figure likely doesn't include diplomatic and intelligence operations, among other costs absorbed by the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and other federal agencies, according to military analysts and academics. In most military engagements, the U.S. State Department absorbs some costs, including jet fuel for travel to meetings, among other diplomatic efforts, according to John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, an online security information database. "Any place that you are aware of that has uniformed military personnel, there were State Department personnel involved in getting them into it," Pike said. Further, the CIA. regularly conducts classified intelligence missions that are often not included in Pentagon estimates, Pike said. These costs, among others associated with military efforts, are nearly impossible to track. Neither the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office nor the White House Office of Management and Budget monitor these numbers, according agency media relations representatives. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does not differentiate costs by country, according to a NATO spokesman. Even if there are many peripheral costs, however, they pale in comparison to the Defense Department totals, according to analysts. The operational costs of war are typically so high -- $330 billion so far in Afghanistan and $708 billion in Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates -- that diplomatic, intelligence and other supplementary costs barely make a drop in the budget, according to Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a public policy research institute in Washington, D.C. "There could be additional costs to the operation outside the DoD budget. … However, these costs are likely to be small relative to the military costs of the operation," Harrison wrote in an email. "I suspect they would only add a few percent to the total cost." Our ruling: Biden’s numbers were high to leave room for unaccounted costs, as his office acknowledges. The vice president’s $2 billion figure is nearly double the $1.1 billion reported by the Pentagon and largely supported by military analysts. But, those same analysts note that there are other costs related to military actions that often are not reported. Nevertheless, even the higher number supports Biden’s deeper point. The military intervention in Libya -- in addition to not resulting in a single American military fatality -- cost the country less than 1 percent what the Pentagon has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rate Biden’s claim Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2011-11-03T15:24:40	2011-10-21	['United_States', 'Libya']
pomt-04028	"States have cumulatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/01/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-states-have-slashed-funding-/	As funerals proceeded for the 20 first-graders and six school employees massacred on Dec. 14, by a gunman at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, members of Congress including Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur took to the House of Representatives floor to decry the violence. Kaptur’s speech highlighted cuts in mental health funding during the recession, while urging a "more constructive federal role in assuring proper and early diagnosis and intervention of affected youth and appropriate treatment." During her speech, Kaptur said that "states have cumultatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century." PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the numbers. Kaptur specifically cited the National Alliance on Mental Illness during her speech as a source of information. Her spokesman said she was citing data from a report the mental health advocacy group released in March 2011, after a paranoid schizophrenic gunman shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others in a supermarket parking lot outside Tucson, Ariz. The report observed that "the public often focuses on mental illness only when high visibility tragedies of the magnitude of Tucson or Virginia Tech occur." "Between 2009 and 2011, states cumulatively cut more than $1.8 billion from their budgets for services for children and adults living with mental illness," it continued. The report said that cuts during that period kept thousands of Ohioans with serious mental illness from accessing care in their communities, resulting in their living on the streets, or ending up in more expensive settings like jails and hospitals. The NAMI report stressed that people living with mental illness are, on the whole, no more violent than the rest of the population and are more frequently the victims of violence than perpetrators of violent acts. But it said the "risks of violence among a small subset of individuals may increase when appropriate treatment and supports are not available." In an email, NAMI spokesman Bob Carolla noted the 2011 report that Kaptur cited was based on funding information available from states at the time the report was issued. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors subsequently determined that total cuts were much higher than the figures cited in the NAMI report - $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012. "The economic downturn has forced state budgets to cut approximately $4.35 billion in public mental health spending over the 2009-2012 period – the largest combined reduction since de-institutionalization," says a March 2012 report from the mental health program directors group. A year-by-year breakdown in that report says that $1.22 billion in was cut in FY 2009 in the 39 states that provided statistics to the organization; that $1.02 billion was cut in FY 2010 by 38 states, that $1.27 billion was cut in FY 2011 by 36 states, and $842 million was cut in FY 2012 by 31 states. Carolla said his organization accepts the accuracy of the mental health program directors group’s figures. He noted that de-institutionalization, which shifted mental health care from institutions like mental hospitals to community-based settings, "is generally considered to have begun with the passage of legislation under President Kennedy in 1963 - 50 years ago." That coincides with the half-century timeline cited in Kaptur’s speech. When asked for details on the comparison of current cuts with those that happened when de-institutionalization occurred, representatives of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said their funding statistics go back only 30 years. While they believe the statement about the cuts’ scope is probably correct, they can’t precisely compare the deinstitutionalization era’s budgetary cuts with today’s numbers. "It is by far the biggest cut in 30 years, but before that, the data doesn’t exist in a format where I can look at it and say it is apples to apples," says Ted Lutterman, the director of research analysis for the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. He said he did not provide the information on deinstitutionalization that Kaptur cited, and said that someone else must have inserted that tidbit into the group’s report. Robert Glover, who heads the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research, also could not provide details on the half-century figure that Kaptur cited, though he said the recent budget cuts are the largest he’s seen during his 40 years in the profession. He calls the $4.35 billion statistic that his group uses "very conservative" because it omits numbers from several states that didn’t provide the group with their budget figures. He observed that mental health needs rise when financial problems fester in a sour economy and that mental health service cuts make it harder for those with difficulties to get the help they need. Glover says Ohio has provided a bright spot amid the cuts, developing programs designed to integrate mental health care with physical health care. "There are pockets of restoration in some states," Glover said. Ohio Department of Mental Health Communications Director Trudy Sharp said her organization’s general revenue budget went down by $67 million between the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, then increased by $20 million in the 2011 fiscal year. She said her department trimmed its central office staff by 20 percent since 2008, and also shuttered three of the state’s nine psychiatric hospitals. Facilities in Cambridge, Cleveland and Dayton were closed and their beds absorbed by other hospitals, she said. Additionally, she said Ohio is consolidating its Department of Mental Health with its Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction services, and trying to stretch its mental health dollars by encouraging regional planning approaches between counties. So where does all this leave Kaptur’s statement? Kaptur accurately cited statistics about mental health budget cuts from a National Alliance on Mental Illness report. Those numbers appear to have downplayed the extent of cuts. But, her claim that "over $1.8 billion" was cut between 2009 and 2011 is accurate because the cuts surely exceeded $1.8 billion. Her contention that the cuts mark the "largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century," is harder to prove. She based her statement on information in a report produced by an often-cited authority on state mental health funding. While representatives of the group said they believe that statement is accurate, they acknowledged they didn’t have state funding numbers going back 50 years to document that assertion. That’s a point of clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates Mostly True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2013-02-01T06:00:00	2012-12-19	['None']

pomt-00874	"The vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/12/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-vast-majority-international-commitm/	The complicated process of forging international agreements has burst into the spotlight now that the Obama administration is trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. Recently, 47 Republican senators penned an open letter to Iranian leaders. It was structured as a civics lesson -- one intended to remind Iran that even if it is negotiating with the executive branch, Congress has powers to derail any deal it finds objectionable. Among other things, the March 9 letter said that the next president could revoke an agreement struck by Obama "with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time." (We rated that Mostly True.) The senators’ letter raised eyebrows, particularly among Democrats, for seeming to break with the precedent that the executive branch is the primary driver of foreign policy. Just hours after the senators released their letter, Vice President Joe Biden released a toughly worded statement taking issue with the senators’ perspective on how international agreements are negotiated. Biden said in part: "Around the world, America’s influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments. Some of these are made in international agreements approved by Congress. However, as the authors of this letter must know, the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval. And that will be the case should the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany reach an understanding with Iran." We wondered whether Biden was right that "the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval." So we took a closer look. As it turns out, it’s more complicated than it looks. The numbers game Several statistical tallies show that there is a large and growing reliance on what are known as "executive agreements," at the expense of approving treaties, which require a two-thirds vote in the Senate. The upside of pursuing an executive agreement is that they are easier to negotiate -- they don’t require approval from Congress, which removes a major obstacle. The downside of an executive agreement, however, is that it’s easier to reverse. Research published by Jeffrey S. Peake of Clemson University and Glen Krutz of the University of Oklahoma found executive agreements accounting for a steadily rising percentage of international agreements. • Between 1789 and 1839, about 31 percent were executive agreements rather than treaties. • From 1839 to 1889, the share rose to 52.5 percent. • From 1889 to 1939, it climbed again to 63.6 percent. • From 1939 to 1989, it rose even further, to 94.3 percent. They also found that since 1949, treaties exceeded 10 percent of all international agreements during just three two-year periods -- once under President Harry Truman and twice under President Bill Clinton -- and never exceeded 17 percent of agreements. The average for any given two-year period between 1949 and 2012 was 6 percent treaties, 94 percent executive agreements. When executive action needs Congress But if you use this data set, there’s a problem for Biden’s claim. While executive agreements are, as a whole, less reliant on congressional action than treaties are, that’s not the same thing as saying that all of them are entirely unaffected by congressional action. That’s because there are actually three kinds of executive agreements, each with a different degree of congressional input. Here’s the rundown: • Congressional-executive agreements. For these agreements, both houses of Congress are involved in the authorizing process by passing a statute through both chambers, according to the Congressional Research Service. The North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were done this way. • Executive agreements that follow an earlier treaty. For these agreements, the Senate has already had a say on the topic when it approved the earlier treaty. • Sole executive agreements. This type of agreement stems from the president’s constitutional authority, and does not require authorization by Congress. Peake estimates that the first two types of agreements account for 90 percent of executive agreements, with sole executive agreements accounting for perhaps 10 percent. This estimate is based on old data. It stems from a 1984 scholarly study by Loch Johnson titled, The Making of International Agreements: Congress Confronts the Executive. In the book, Johnson found that 87 percent of agreements fit into the first two categories. But Peake said that no updated study has been completed since, though he noted that in his conversations with State Department officials while writing his own book in 2006, they indicated that the figure had remained more or less constant since then. Using these figures, then, only a small percentage of international agreements escape congressional input entirely. These agreements may not be vetted by Congress in the same way, and to the same degree, as treaties are, but Biden’s phrasing fuzzes the differences. Biden’s response When we checked with Biden’s office, they said that looking at the question in this way is misleading. Biden’s staff said the numbers used by Peake and CRS refer to "binding" agreements and ignore "non-binding" arrangements. Because Iran’s nuclear program is a major geopolitical issue, we think many Americans would assume that any deal would at least be considered binding. But in the wake of the senators’ letter, the Obama administration has made clear in testimony to Congress that any agreement with Iran would actually fall into the non-binding category. This means the agreement isn’t binding under international law, though a State Department guidance adds that "a non-binding instrument may carry significant moral or political weight." Experts told us the distinction between binding and non-binding agreements is often lost even among professionals. And Biden’s staff emphasized to PolitiFact that non-binding arrangements aren’t trivial. For one thing, a number of significant commitments have been considered non-binding. Recent examples include the framework for disarming Syria of chemical weapons, greenhouse gas targets agreed to last year by the United States and China, and, just days ago, a joint statement of principles between Biden and the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Collectively, these are more common than binding agreements, which are the ones counted by Peake or the CRS, Biden’s staff said. Biden’s office added that non-binding doesn’t equal non-enforceable. The United States has methods to enforce them, such as sanctions. Independent experts said Biden has a point, but they expressed concern that he used the phrase the "vast majority of our international commitments" without being able to show his arithmetic. Without it, Biden’s claim is not much more than speculation. "The problem I have (with Biden’s claim) is that I have no idea how anyone would figure out how many non-binding agreements there are, or indeed what even counts as a non-binding agreement," said Michael D. Ramsey, law professor at the University of San Diego. "The president and his diplomats are constantly making arrangements with foreign officials on many issues large and small, but most of these are not extensively negotiated or directed to important matters." Our ruling Biden said "the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval." When looking at binding agreements -- the only types of agreements for which we have good data -- Biden is likely off base. While it’s true that formal treaties represent a small minority of all binding international agreements, most of the other types of non-treaty, binding agreements do have some congressional input, even if it’s less than treaties have. Biden may be on safer ground once you add in non-binding agreements. However, Biden’s office did not provide statistics to back up this claim, and independent experts said they aren’t aware that such a tally exists. So the claim that agreements negotiated without congressional input represent "the vast majority of our international commitments" is essentially informed speculation. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2015-03-12T14:53:03	2015-03-09	['None']
pomt-12112	Says Sen. Jon Tester "believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/21/matthew-rosendale/republican-senate-hopeful-claims-montana-sen-jon-t/	While declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. "Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government," Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana. We decided to investigate whether Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the opposite is true. What is a national gun registry? This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry. "When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned," said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control. An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era’s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers. While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that’s inconsistent with common parlance. Further, Rosendale’s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to "the people of Montana," and Rosendale’s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry. We asked Rosendale’s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate. Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners? Not even close. The campaign’s attempt to paint the Feinstein amendment as a national gun registry is absurd, and here’s why For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories. The Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI’s list to those on the U.S. government’s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun. The Rosendale campaign’s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry. Experts dismissed the notion that to deny gun sales to the government’s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners. "The terror watch list is not a gun registry," said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. "In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!" David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign’s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn’t add up. "This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry," Hemenway said. "He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is." So Rosendale’s central claim is flat wrong — but he didn’t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to "ask permission from the federal government" before they purchase a gun. Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim’s absurdity. The Rosendale campaign said further that Tester’s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However — leaving aside whether these bills would have done that — the reality is that Tester’s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries. Tester’s opposition to a national gun registry Tester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry. In 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry). He also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an "international gun registry." For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for "stand(ing) on the side of America's 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms." Our ruling Rosendale said Tester "believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government." Tester’s record shows opposition to a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and gun owners. To claim he supports this is absurd. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-05296	"Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool" under the new health care law.	false	/florida/statements/2012/may/21/crossroads-gps/crossroads-says-obama-broke-his-promise-health-car/	UPDATE: We have adjusted the statement to clarify that we are fact-checking the Crossroads GPS claim that "millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool." The ruling is unchanged. The conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS has a new ad that says President Barack Obama has broken his campaign promises. If you love your iPad, beware: The ad shows a tablet computer with its screen cracking apart. Each broken promise shatters the glass with a stomach-churning crunch. "President Obama’s agenda promised so much," the ad says, then launches into a litany of broken promises. One promise is about health insurance: The ad shows Obama saying, "If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan." "Broken," the ad’s narrator says. "Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool." We’ll fact-check the ad’s other claims in separate reports. Here, we’ll look at people losing their health care. Here at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president’s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about health care. Obama’s promise Obama often said during his 2008 campaign for president that if people liked their health insurance, they wouldn’t have to change it under his proposal, and he continued to say it as president. "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan," he said at a 2009 town hall meeting. What Obama was talking about was the way his plan left in place the current health care system in the United States. Instead of completely revamping the system, Obama’s plan put more regulations on insurance companies, and it offered subsidies to coverage for the uninsured so they could either buy insurance on their own or sign up for the existing program of Medicaid. Most significantly, his plan left in place both Medicare for seniors and employer-provided insurance for workers. The problem with the promise, though, was that some of Obama’s regulations will change how health insurance companies offer plans. It’s also likely it will change the decisions employers make about health coverage, at least to some extent. Some workers might see improved coverage, while others see more expensive coverage. Some might see major changes, while others might see trivial changes. In many cases, Obama’s law beefs up requirements on insurance companies. On the whole, we rated Obama’s statement Half True. Having said that, the health care law that Obama signed looks a lot like what he promised on the campaign trail. It leaves in place employer-provided insurance and Medicare. It puts new regulations on health insurance companies. It offers assistance to the poor and people of modest means to obtain coverage. (Want more detail? Read our story "Everything You Want to Know about the Health Care Law.") Millions lose coverage? The Crossroads ad adds a new wrinkle on this fear-laced claim: "Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool." Text on the screen sources the claim to The Hill’s "Health Watch" column of March 15, 2012. The Hill is a newspaper that covers Washington and Congress. When we dug into this claim, we found The Hill’s coverage referred to a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, a respected independent agency that conducts economic analysis of pending and existing law. Here’s how The Hill described the CBO report: As many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-provided coverage because of President Obama's healthcare reform law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new report Thursday. The figure represents the worst-case scenario, CBO says, and the law could just as well increase the number of people with employer-based coverage by 3 million in 2019. The best estimate, subject to a "tremendous amount of uncertainty," is that about 3 million to 5 million fewer people will obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022. We’ve looked into the CBO report ourselves for other fact-checks. CBO and other independent groups project that the number of uninsured will actually decrease because of the health care law. Estimates vary, but the CBO has projected that between 29 million to 31 million uninsured Americans will gain access to coverage. The law will cause some shifting around of how people get their insurance, though. That’s what the CBO report documents. Many of those people that leave employer-provided insurance would get coverage some other way, such as buying it on their own with help from a government subsidy. (Read a more detailed analysis of the CBO report here.) Actually, some of those people will prefer to buy insurance on their own in order to get health insurance that better suits their particular preferences. Significantly, the Crossroads ad doesn’t mention any of those specifics. Its point seems to be simply that a lot of people will lose coverage. This is deeply misleading, because the law will increase the number of people who have coverage. Then there’s the part of the claim that says millions would be "forced into a government pool." We couldn’t make heads or tails of this sentiment, but Crossroads responded to our questions by saying that people who buy insurance on their own are being "forced into a government pool." The exchanges are new virtual marketplaces where people who buy insurance on their own will be able to comparison shop for plans. And technically speaking, this is a pool, because people who buy on the exchange will be able to buy plans regardless of any pre-existing health conditions. Under the terms of the plan, some of the people will be buying insurance with a government subsidy, but some will be buying with their own money. But they’ll be buying plans from private insurance companies, to be treated by non-government doctors and hospitals. Given the contours of the health care debate over the past two years, the ad seems like it’s trying to confuse people into thinking they’ll be signed up for a government-run health plan like Medicare. That’s actually not the case. Our ruling The Crossroads ad says Obama "promised" people could keep their health plans, but "millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool." Actually, Obama’s plan leaves the existing health system largely in place. And "millions" of uninsured will actually gain coverage, according to independent analysis. Also, there’s no option for a government-run health care option under the new health insurance exchanges. The term "government pool" seems aimed at confusing this issue. In fact, the health care plan Obama promised on the campaign trail looks an awful lot like what was put into law: Leave the existing health care system in place, beef up regulations on insurance companies, and offer assistance to the uninsured to help them sign up for health coverage. We rate the statement False.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-05-21T18:37:05	2012-05-16	['None']
pomt-09309	"Dubai is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/20/bill-clinton/clinton-says-uae-only-middle-east-country-to-pass-/	In an April 18, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week, former President Bill Clinton spoke about how the unresolved Palestinian issue in the Middle East has been feeding the energy of terrorist organizations; and how a peace plan could lead to "a whole different world." Moreover, he said, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has deflected attention away from advances in the Arab world. "Dubai is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East," Clinton said. "And they've got women in the government. They have a joint public-private decision making process. Nobody knows anything about it. Why? Because of the Palestinian-Israeli thing." Human rights groups have long been highly critical of the treatment of immigrant workers in the United Arab Emirates -- where foreigners make up about 85 percent of the population -- and so we decided to check Clinton's claims about Dubai. First of all, as a point of clarification, Clinton erred when he referred to Dubai as a country. It is one of seven emirates and belongs to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is the country. But the real issue here is Clinton's claim that UAE is "the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East." Known for its awe-inspiring achitecture, the world's first seven-star luxury hotel and world-class malls and sporting events, Dubai has established itself as an international tourist hot spot. But in 2006, Human Rights Watch issued a scathing 71-page report called "Building Towers, Cheating Workers" that detailed the exploitation of immigrant workers and "the UAE federal government's failure to adequately address these abuses." "Behind the glitter and luxury, the experiences of these migrant workers present a much less attractive picture -- of wage exploitation, indebtedness to unscrupulous recruiters, and working conditions that are hazardous to the point of being deadly," the report stated. "UAE federal labor law offers a number of protections, but for migrant construction workers these are largely unenforced." At least in part due to international pressure stemming from that report, the UAE released new draft labor laws in 2007 to help protect migrant workers. In August of that year, the New York Times reported that regulators in the UAE have "enforced midday sun breaks, improved health benefits, upgraded living conditions and cracked down on employers brazen enough to stop paying workers at all." And in April 2009, Gulf News (UAE) reported that the Ministry of Labour planned to introduce "new rules for labor accommodation standards and a fresh mechanism to ensure payment of salaries, to protect workers' rights and improve their conditions." So that's the legislation that Clinton was referring to. But despite those new laws, immigrant workers are still being widely mistreated, several human rights groups contend. "The passing of these laws in the UAE has not given workers a 'better deal,' " stated Samer Muscati, Human Rights Watch researcher on the UAE and Iraq, in an e-mail interview with PolitiFact. "Especially with the current economic downturn, we see that migrant workers are still the most vulnerable in that society. Despite the passage of laws, we see little enforcement. Under UAE law, and international law, passport confiscation by employers is illegal but the practice is still widespread. The same for recruitment fees, the reason for migrant worker indebtedness." In January, Human Rights Watch issued another report saying the economic downturn had led to further deterioration of human rights for migrant workers. A news account of the report cited an official at the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying the report "has major drawbacks and fails to adequately record the positive steps taken by the UAE with regard to labor and human-trafficking issues, not just in 2009, but also in the last few years." The UAE was "not averse to admitting its failures", the official added, "but finds it unsettling when genuine efforts and constructive results find little or no recognition in reports such as the one released by the Human Rights Watch." However, in addition to Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the U.S. Bureau of Democracy and Human Rights continue to highlight the plight of foreign workers in all of the Gulf states, including the UAE, said Christopher M. Davidson, an expert on the region at Durham University in England and author of Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success. In an e-mail interview with PolitiFact, Davidson called Clinton's statement "heavy spin." The day after Clinton made his statement on This Week, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, criticized the treatment of an estimated 12 million foreign workers in the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE). "Reports concerning this region consistently cite ongoing practices of unlawful confiscation of passports, withholding of wages and exploitation by unscrupulous recruitment agencies and employers," Pillay said. "The situation of migrant domestic workers is of particular concern because their isolation in private homes makes them even more vulnerable to physical, psychological and sexual violence. They may also experience inadequate living and working conditions and violations of the right to health. Some are held in prolonged detention after they escape abusive employers, and may be unable to obtain access to judicial recourse and effective remedies for their plight." Said Davidson: "I would agree that despite some superficial legal protections that have been introduced in the UAE (and other Gulf states), these practices remain rampant." Pillay did give a nod to the efforts of the UAE and several of the Persian Gulf countries for attempting to address some these problems with new or amended labor laws, and enhanced inspections. In an e-mail interview with PolitiFact, Jim Krane, author of City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism agreed that "there have been some actions in Dubai to improve the lot of these 'imported workers' that make up most of the city's population. That said, their working and living conditions are still pretty bad and the legislation doesn't do anything about their appalling rates of pay." Nicholas McGeehan, founder and director of Mafiwasta, an organization for migrant workers' rights in the United Arab Emirates, called Clinton's statement "nonsense, pure and simple." The new labor laws drafted by the UAE in 2007 were highly criticized at the time as essentially no different from the existing labor law which dated from 1980, McGeehan said; and no new legislation was ever implemented. "The UAE does pass quasi-legal ministerial directives from time to time, largely in response to international criticism," McGeehan said. "These are of dubious legal character and have no effect. For example, a law was passed to fine companies who were making workers work through the mid-summer heat in 2005. No firms were ever prosecuted." "So to summarize," McGeehan said, "no legislation has been passed to protect workers, the situation has actually gotten worse, in contrast to the government's PR-driven rhetoric, and the U.S.'s political and business interests in the region compromise its public statements on the issue." Lastly, we draw your attention to the 2009 human rights report on the UAE issued on March 11, 2010, by the U.S. State Department (headed, of course, by Hillary Clinton). The report credits the UAE government making efforts to enhance protections for migrant workers. But overall, the report doesn't paint a pretty picture: • "Some women from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Philippines migrated willingly to the country to work as domestic servants, but some faced debt bondage to recruiters; conditions of involuntary servitude, such as excessive work hours without pay; verbal, mental, physical, or sexual abuse; and restrictions on movement. Men from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who came to the country to work in the construction industry occasionally were subject to involuntary servitude and debt bondage to pay recruitment costs. It was illegal but customary for employers to take custody of workers' passports." • "Some employment agents continued to bring numerous foreign workers to the country to work under forced or compulsory conditions, and there continued to be reports of worker suicides. Some women were brought to the country under false promises of legitimate employment and forced into prostitution. Low-paid unskilled and semi-skilled workers were also victims of contract switching, which occurred when a worker was offered a certain position but received a visa labor card for a different position." • "Foreign workers frequently did not receive their wages, sometimes for extended periods." The report noted that the Ministry of Labor sought to alleviate the problem of unpaid wages by requiring companies to direct deposit laborers' salaries into a bank. The deadline to comply is this May (though as of August 2009, just 500,000 of the 4 million foreign workers were paid this way). • "Despite efforts to improve housing facilities, some low-skilled and foreign employees continued to face substandard living conditions, including overcrowded apartments or lodging in unsafe and unhygienic 'labor camps,' which sometimes lacked electricity, potable water, and adequate cooking and bathing facilities. Construction of newer worker accommodations was ongoing." Several human rights watchers also took issue with Bill Clinton pointing out that Dubai has women in the government. It's true, Davidson said, that the federal government of the UAE has four female ministers, all appointed, "but most analysts concur that this was a UAE effort to pacify foreign observers." Added Muscati: "Having women in government is not indicative of women's rights. The UAE is not a democracy but a monarchy dominated by men." Davidson pointed to Pillay's statement from the Gulf states this week: "Discriminatory barriers continue to hamper women’s right to shape their own lives and choices, and fully participate in public life and be part of public debates that influence the direction of a nation." But again, our focus is the claim Clinton made about immigrant workers, and that the UAE is the only Middle East country that has passed legislation to improve the lot of a large population of imported workers. The UAE government did pass labor laws designed to help protect immigrant workers. But they aren't the only Gulf country to do so. Bahrain, for example, took the lead in changing sponsorship laws. And human rights groups say that despite passing the laws, the UAE has not done enough to enforce them, and that exploitation of immigrant workers is still rampant in the UAE -- perhaps even more so now than before the laws due to the economic downtown.

pomt-03840	"The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/15/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-chinese-government-provides-no-ac/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., painted a dire portrait of China in his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying the country is "trying to supplant us as the leading power in the world." "Let me explain to you who the Chinese government is. The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet," Rubio said on March 14. "The Chinese government will hold citizens prisoner without any right to recourse. The Chinese government coerces and tortures people until they get confessions from them." He gave a few more examples of Chinese coercion before asking, "We want that to be the leading country in the world?" The crowd shouted "No!" We wondered if Rubio was right about the Chinese government preventing its citizens from accessing the Internet. It’s not. By a wide margin, China leads the world in the sheer number of citizens accessing the Internet, with 538 million estimated users as of June 2012, according to Internet World Stats, which tracks Web use across the globe. The United States ranks second with about 245 million. About 40 percent of China’s population uses the Internet, placing it far below the penetration of many countries, including the U.S. at 78 percent. The major Internet providers in China are government-run telecom companies. Rubio would have been on more solid ground if he said the Chinese government censors the Internet. Although people in China can access the Internet through home computers, Internet cafes and smartphones, they face some censorship, said Adam Segal, a fellow who specializes in technology and development in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an email. Access to a number of American and foreign websites is blocked or filtered, such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, but there are some Chinese equivalents. "There can be very open discussion on Sina Weibo, which is a Twitter-like service," Segal said, "though they are then censored if they become too sensitive." The government blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg for reporting on the wealth of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao. And after the 18th Communist Party Congress got its start in November 2012, all Google programs, including Gmail and its search engine, could not be accessed in the country. In June 2012, Google unveiled on its Hong Kong-based search site a mechanism that identifies political and sensitive terms that may break the connection to Google, the Wall Street Journal reported. For example: the government has blocked the Chinese word for "carrot" which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao’s surname. The names of top leaders, dissidents and references to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square protests can also be blocked. To avoid that censorship, some people in China have referred to the date of the protests as "May 35th." According to the Times, all Internet traffic in China must pass through one of three computer centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, where computers known as the Great Firewall of China compare data with an updated list of keywords and Web address that are forbidden. Some Chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or VPNs that essentially allow users to "tunnel" out of the country to avoid the censors, but China also cracked down on those services, which its Communist-affiliated daily newspaper called illegal. Two years ago, the Beijing government clamped down on rules for microblogging, requiring users to register on sites like Sina Weibo with their real names, a move preventing anonymous commentary and criticism about the government and news events, according to the Wall Street Journal. In December 2012, the country’s congress adopted similar rules requiring Internet users to give their full names to service providers (while keeping pseudonyms on microblog posts) and Internet companies to report forbidden postings to the government, according to the Times. "China has the world's most robust controls, both technical and human, on the Internet," David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project website, said in an email to PolitiFact. "But this is by no means the full picture. Internet use is growing rapidly in the country, which currently has more than 570 million Internet users, 75 percent of which access the Internet on mobile devices." While many non-Chinese social media are blocked, homegrown versions are active allowing Chinese to even criticize authorities. "It is a messy picture, and Chinese leaders are constantly struggling to balance control, which is still a major priority, with the growing public demand for information," Bandurski said. Scott Edwards, an Amnesty International senior staffer based in Washington, D.C., said Rubio’s statement is up to a little bit of interpretation. Yes, the Chinese can access the Internet. But the government does not "provide" -- that’s the word Rubio used -- free and unfettered access. Plus, there is the undeniably wide divide in the country of access between the rich and poor. Internet use is also sometimes monitored, Edwards said. Rubio’s comment touches on the debate of the free Internet movement, Edwards said, which calls on the government to provide access to the Internet and that the government should not be interfering. In a policy that was even backed by China, the United Nations Human Rights Council affirmed that freedom of expression online is a basic human right. We emailed Rubio’s press team for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling In describing a litany of offenses by China’s Communist government, Rubio said, "The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet." This is not true. The Chinese can access the Internet, and they do it in numbers higher than any other country. However, the government blocks many popular Internet sites and censors content, limiting the access for Chinese people. We rate his statement Mostly False.

A website purporting to be the Chicago Sun-Times published a story headlined, "Queen Elizabeth Says: ‘Muslim Refugees Are Dividing Nationality, I Fully Agree With Donald Trump We Should…’(VIDEO)." The story posted July 16 on chicagosuntimes.live (the website for the real Chicago Sun-Times is chicago.suntimes.com) offers no video or any other evidence that backs its headline, because the monarch did not make that claim. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The false claim comes on the heels of Trump’s July 13 meeting with Queen Elizabeth II in England. Neither Trump nor the queen made public statements during their televised meeting. As head of state, Queen Elizabeth II "has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters" and the ability to make and pass legislation rests with Parliament, according to the monarch’s website. In a July 13 press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump linked terrorism to immigration, said immigration has "been very bad for Europe" and that it was "changing the culture." Trump won the U.S. presidential election touting a hard-line immigration stance, promising to ban Muslims from entering the United States and to remove Syrian refugees from the country (both promises are Stalled). There’s no evidence that Queen Elizabeth II made any comments about deporting Muslim refugees. We rate this fabricated story Pants on Fire!

pomt-08921	"Ohio’s electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/27/ted-strickland/ohio-gov-ted-strickland-says-states-electricity-ra/	Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland seems determined to be regarded as your energy governor. In his race for re-election this November, the governor touts his efforts toward energy reform at almost every opportunity. He was at it again during a campaign address on July 6 when he said, "The energy reform bill I proposed gave Ohio one of the nation’s most aggressive renewable energy policies and has pushed our utilities to innovate. "And while other states that failed to act saw electricity rates jump 70 percent," Strickland said, "Ohio’s electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average." Strickland’s spokeswoman, Allison Kolodziej, acknowledges that Ohio’s electricity rates were already well below the national average before Strickland took office in January 2007. But she said the governor’s push for Senate Bill 221 — which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing — prevented Ohio’s rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked. The question: Are Ohio’s rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor’s campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures. According to EIA’s most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio’s average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents. That means Ohio’s rate thus for 2010 for all sectors is about 8 percent below the national average — not 10 percent. In 2009, however — the last full year of available figures — Ohio’s average was 8.63 cents per kilowatt hour and the national average 9.75 cents, meaning a year ago the state was 11 percent below the national average. That means Strickland’s statement is not accurate today but was a year ago. Kolodziej said the campaign is relying on 2009 figures because the full 2010 year figures are not yet complete. The premise of Strickland’s statement is that Ohio is still trending below the national average when it comes to electricity rates, and thus is better off than many other states in terms of utility costs. The context of his point was accurate. But while the full 2010 figures are not yet available, there were more up to date figures the governor could have relied on during his speech that, while not as flattering as 2009, could have still effectively made his point — just more accurately. We rate this statement as Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2010-07-27T08:00:00	2010-07-06	['None']
pomt-08780	Says Barack Obama didn't keep his promise to have an immigration bill in his first year.	true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/21/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-barack-obama-broke-his-promis/	Texas Republicans descended on the Capitol en masse when President Barack Obama was in Austin last week. But they weren't exactly welcoming. At the GOP's Aug. 9 "Hands Off Texas" rally demanding that Obama, well, keep his hands of Texas, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson suggested Obama just tells voters what they want to hear. He rattled off a list of promises that the president has failed to keep. Immigration reform is a hot-button issue running up to the mid-term elections, so we wondered about Patterson's flip question to the crowd: "Remember when he said there will be an immigration bill in the first year?" Incidentally, when we asked Patterson to point to the promise in question, he pointed back at us. "Got that from the PolitiFact website, I think," he said. "The details are on there." The national PolitiFact site has endeavored to track the president's promises on its "Obameter." PolitiFact has compiled more than 500 promises Obama made during his campaign, which it then rates as Kept, Broken or a Compromise. Which brings us back to a pledge Obama made as a candidate in May 2008, during an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. "I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days," Obama said. "But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible." But well into Obama's second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by the president has been introduced in Congress. PolitiFact searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org, a nonpartisan website that tracks politicians' voting records, and turned up pages of speeches where Obama mentioned immigration reform. Notably, in April 2009, Obama said that he saw the immigration reform "process moving this first year" and in June 2009, he assigned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to put together a framework for comprehensive reform. In September 2009, he said he anticipated "that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting." Famous last words? The year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On Dec. 15, 2009, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, introduced a bill, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies told PolitiFact that it was not promoted or publicly supported by the Obama administration. To gain legal status under the bill, illegal immigrants already here would have to demonstrate they have been working, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other provisions, according to the New York Times. Saying he was frustrated with Obama for not leading an overhaul of immigration laws, Gutierrez, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' immigration task force, was arrested with other protesters after a sit-in in front of the White House on May 1. Gutierrez "said he believes he has a responsibility to point out that Mr. Obama has not fulfilled a campaign pledge to pass overhaul legislation, which is known to supporters as comprehensive immigration reform," according to the New York Times. This year, Obama has continued to push immigration reform in his speeches, like his State of the Union address Jan. 27: "We should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system — to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation," he said. In March, he announced that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had finished working on a bipartisan framework "to fix our broken immigration system." In April, Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, Schumer and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, issued a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called "a very important step." But the senators have not yet introduced a bill. And during a July speech at the American University, Obama sounded another call for bipartisan reform: "In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we've seen across America... Everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken." It's worth noting that many Republicans have said they won't consider comprehensive immigration reform until the federal government secures the borders — another promise Obama made as a presidential hopeful that PolitiFact has rated "In the Works," since the administration announced it was beefing up border security. On Aug. 13, Obama signed into law a $600 million bill funding 1,500 new border agents, additional unmanned aerial drones, and new Border Patrol stations on the border. Still, we're now in year two of the Obama presidency, with no comprehensive bill backed by the administration on the horizon. PolitiFact rated the promise Broken, and we rate Patterson's statement as True.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2010-08-21T06:00:00	2010-08-09	['None']

pomt-13099	"The Democrats are very sly. … (in New Hampshire) we have same day voter registration, and to be honest, when Massachusetts elections are not very close, they’re busing them in all over the place."	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/nov/05/chris-sununu/republican-candidate-governor-chris-sununu-says-ma/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu became the latest politician to question the integrity of the voting process this week. As a guest on the Howie Carr Show on Monday, Sununu responded to a question about New Hampshire’s long run of Democratic governors by accusing New Hampshire Democrats of changing election laws and participating in voter fraud using same-day registration. "The Democrats are very sly," Sununu said, before saying state Democrats changed election laws in the late 1990s or early 2000s to accommodate same-day voter registration. He then alleged that when elections in neighboring Massachusetts are not close, Democrats are "busing them in all over the place" and picking a phony address for people to use for same-day registration. "There’s no doubt there’s election fraud," he said. "I don’t want to use ‘rigged’ -- that’s the word you’re not supposed to use anymore -- but they have really gamed the system to their advantage." At a time when many people, including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are warning about "rigged elections" well before the votes are counted, we thought we’d check whether Sununu’s allegation was accurate. We found that while New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale, the state’s top election official says. And crucially for Sununu’s charge, he was unable to produce any evidence of buses of out-of-state voters coming into the state. "In every election since 2000, there’s been someone prosecuted for election fraud," said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Some out-of-state residents have voted in the state’s elections, while others have been New Hampshire residents voting in more than one town. Since 2012, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases and one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said. Gardner emphasized that fraud has not proven to be a widespread problem. "I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it," he said. Gardner said he used to have more qualms about out-of-state voters sneaking past election workers, but the state’s Voter ID law has reassured him. The law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people. "I said that three or four years ago; I wouldn’t say that now based on the safeguards that we have included in the process," he said. Sununu walked back his comments on Tuesday. "No, I don’t want to imply I see buses coming over," he said, when asked if he could name a specific instance of Democrats busing voters in to vote in New Hampshire elections. "It’s more a figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave." Sununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Those staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark’s address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled. Sununu said he would like to tighten the state’s election laws to "make sure that our votes, the true residents of NH are not being diluted by out of staters." We should also note that Sununu’s point about same-day registration being passed by Democrats was also incorrect. The same-day registration law was signed by Republican Gov. Steve Merrill in 1994. Gardner said Republicans at the time were far more supportive of same-day registration, which they saw as a preferable local alternative to the federal "Motor Voter" law that required state governments to offer voter registration opportunities when they applied for a driver’s license. Our ruling Sununu said Democrats take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration laws to bus voters in from out of state. While New Hampshire has experienced instances of voter fraud, the state’s top election official says they have been isolated and amount to one or two cases a year. More to the point, neither Sununu nor election officials could point to any instances of Massachusetts residents being bused across the border to vote on election day. The one piece of evidence Sununu pointed to was an instance of staffers of a Democratic politician registering to vote at the politician’s home -- but that practice was legal, and it did not involve Massachusetts residents being bused across the border en masse on Election Day. Sununu’s claim is ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Chris Sununu	None	None	None	2016-11-05T17:07:39	2016-10-31	['Massachusetts', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-13325	"In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/06/donald-trump/how-much-money-have-wall-street-and-hedge-funds-gi/	Attacking Hillary Clinton at a rally in Waukesha, Wis., one theme Donald Trump sounded repeatedly was: "Follow the money." And one of the attacks during Sept. 28, 2016 remarks was this: "In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds." That’s a colossal figure. Is it accurate? Hedging bets Clinton’s support from the financial sector has made news throughout the campaign. A week before the Trump rally, it was reported that George Soros and two other hedge fund managers had given a total of $5.5 million to Clinton’s campaign or to super PACs supporting her in August 2016. But that’s a long way from $100 million. If you think you’ve heard that figure before, perhaps it was from a February 2016 report by the Wall Street Journal. It estimated that since Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances. So, that doesn’t help Trump’s claim. The campaign figures The go-to source on this is OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The center generally considers "Wall Street" and hedge funds to be the securities and investment industry. However, other industries could be added, as well. Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us with evidence to back his claim. But we tried to view his claim broadly. We counted contributions to Clinton’s campaign as well as to super PACs that support her. And we counted contributions not only from the securities and investment industry, but also two related industries, as they are categorized by the Center for Responsive Politics. To be clear: The contributions don’t come from firms. Rather they come from individual employees or members of the organizations, or political action committees tied to the organizations. Here’s what we found (figures are rounded): Industry Contributions to Clinton campaign Contributions to pro-Clinton super PACs Total Securities and investment $7.23 million $51.4 million $58.6 million Miscellaneous finance $2.55 million $1.18 million $3.74 million Commercial banks $1.9 million $55,000 $1.96 million Grand totals $11.7 million $52.6 million $64.3 million Needless to say, $64.3 million is well short of $100 million. It’s also worth noting, as the Center for Responsive Politics has reported, that most of the "Wall Street" contributions benefiting Clinton "have come from a tiny group of ultra-wealthy, liberal donors who work in finance. Wall Street more broadly doesn’t have any outsized affection for Clinton, but a relative handful of donors who work in the industry have invested heavily in her." Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for Trump and super PACs backing him total far less than $2 million. (Trump has often said he is "self-funding" his campaign, a claim that’s been rated Half True. His campaign accepts contributions, but there’s no question he has funded much of the effort, which might explain in part why Clinton gets so much more money from Wall Street.) Our rating Campaigning outside Milwaukee, Trump said: "In her campaign for president," Clinton "has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds." The gold-standard source on this subject puts the figure at $64 million.

pomt-03796	"[A] 2009 USDA study found that 87 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for generic E. coli ... just prior to packaging."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/27/physicians-committee-responsible-medicine/does-chicken-claim-pass-inspection/	Before you finish eating that piece of chicken, you may want to read this article. A recent letter to a Georgia congressman made the birds sound downright unappetizing. "[A] 2009 USDA study found that 87 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for generic E. coli, a sign of fecal contamination, just prior to packaging," the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine wrote. The letter was sent to U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Democrat from southwest Georgia who is co-chairman of the Congressional Chicken Caucus. Yes, there is a Congressional Chicken Caucus. The Washington-based PCRM wants more rigid chicken inspections after the birds have been defeathered and before they hit supermarket shelves. The letter made news in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news outlets. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the physician’s committee was correct or if it ran afoul of the facts about contaminated chicken. The PCRM is a nonprofit organization claiming 150,000 members that promotes a vegetable-based diet, preventive medicine and alternatives to animal research. The poultry industry dismissed its criticism. "This petition is the latest misleading attempt by a vegan advocacy group to scare consumers in hopes of advancing their goal of a meat-free society," Ashley Peterson, the National Chicken Council’s vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, told the AJC. E. coli are bacteria found in the droppings and intestinal systems of some animals, particularly cattle, goats and sheep. Federal officials and food safety experts say the overwhelming bulk of chicken with high levels of E. coli is caught before it reaches the grocery store or restaurant. Most outbreaks in the United States have been associated with raw or undercooked food, even cookie dough. An estimated 100 Americans die each year from E. coli infections, primarily from a strain typically found in beef called O157:H7. Generic E. coli found in chicken carcasses are less dangerous and "not the type to make you sick," said Michael Doyle, director of the University of Georgia’s Center for Food Safety. Georgia may be called the Peach State, but it is also the Poultry State. Georgia produces more chickens for meat consumption -- 1.3 billion a year -- than any other state, the AJC said last year in an investigative report on food inspection. The AJC reported that federal inspectors would have one-third of a second to examine slaughtered chickens for contaminants under new rules proposed by the federal government. The USDA is still reviewing the changes, an agency spokeswoman said. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety group, described the inspection process is "antiquated." DeWaal and Doyle also want better testing for salmonella and campylobacter, bacteria that may have a greater likelihood to cause food poisoning. The PCRM, through the letter to Bishop and his caucus co-chairman, is hoping to put pressure on Congress to prod the USDA to improve its inspection process. "For whatever reason, the USDA knows what’s going on, but it’s not doing anything," said the PCRM’s Mark Kennedy, who wrote the letter. USDA officials counter that they used data from this and other studies conducted about the same time to make several improvements to poultry inspections since 2006, such as the agency tightening performance standards for poultry establishments. The PCRM has tried publicity campaigns before. Last year -- of all things! -- it warned Buffalo Bills football fans to stay away from Buffalo wings. Critics say the PCRM is truly a vegan group, has very few doctors in its membership and exaggerates the harm of meats while not focusing on the potential dangers of bacteria in vegetables. Its president, Neal Barnard, was quoted as saying chicken is "wrongly promoted as a healthful (food) choice" and that it carries "its load of fat and cholesterol." Fecal contamination can land on chicken feathers while they are transported, since the animals are kept in close quarters. Chickens are cleaned during the defeathering process, but some fecal contamination can still remain. Inspectors are charged with removing any chicken from the assembly line if they see contamination or signs of disease or infection. A few times a month, other inspectors take small samples of birds and mail them to federal labs, where they are tested for bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter. USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service researchers completed a report on E. coli in chicken that was released in April 2009. The report found 691 of 798 chickens studied tested positive for E. coli, which is 87 percent. The chicken came from 20 large slaughterhouses, and the research was done in 2005. In 2012, the PCRM conducted its own study of chicken from 15 grocery stores chains in 10 major cities. The study found that 48 percent of the chicken samples tested positive for fecal contamination. The National Chicken Council attacked the study, saying the sample study was too small and was not peer-reviewed. UGA’s Doyle said the more important number when it comes to E. coli testing is the amount per gram, not its mere existence. Higher concentrations of E. coli, he said, can lead to food poisoning. Doyle said the number of E. coli per gram has declined significantly in recent years. "The counts have gone way down," he said. Our conclusion: The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, as part of a campaign to reduce fecal contamination in the nation’s food supply, claimed that a 2009 USDA study found 87 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for generic E. coli just prior to packaging. The organization’s claim is based on accurate data. But we believe there’s substantial context missing.

pomt-05317	"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/may/17/craig-james/craig-james-says-barack-obama-and-hillary-clinton-/	Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James of Texas drew a standing ovation this week after warning that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seek an international agreement banning the use of guns on U.S. soil. James, sitting on stage at a Grassroots America candidate forum in Tyler on May 16, 2012, said: "I’m going to stand up because I want to make sure you don’t forget what I’m going to say right now." An Austin American-Statesman reporter recorded his remarks. "If anybody in this room has not been following this, the United States, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms," James said. "I want you to know that the Second Amendment is about to be busted and if we don’t stand up and stop this and scream and make sure that Washington, D.C. hears us, then we’re in trouble with the Second Amendment. "Where is the next part that they take away? This is insane," James said. He subsequently urged everyone to make sure friends and neighbors understand the U.S. is trying to ban and get rid of the Second Amendment, which says: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." "Don’t let them fool you any other way. We don’t want to wake up one morning and realize that we have to send our firearms (away) – and I’ve got a bunch of ‘em," James said. The ovation followed. Asked to elaborate, James’ spokeswoman Meredith Turney said the next day that James was probably referring to his support for legislation offered by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas. Turney guided us to a May 17, 2012, Senate floor speech in which Moran pointed out that a UN conference scheduled for July 2012 could lead to an international treaty regulating trade in conventional arms including tanks, helicopters and missiles. Whether the treaty includes limits on civilian firearms, Moran said, remains to be seen. He also said he expects any treaty impinging on domestic gun rights to fall short of winning the constitutionally required two-thirds’ Senate approval needed for ratification. Moran’s Second Amendment Sovereignty Act, introduced in March 2012, bars U.S. funds from being committed or spent in connection with treaty negotiations to restrict the Second Amendment rights of citizens or to regulate the domestic manufacture, assembly, possession, use, transfer or purchase of firearms, ammunition or related items. In his speech, Moran said his measure also is intended to back the Obama administration’s position that the U.S. will not agree to any treaty infringing on the constitutional rights of American citizens or to provisions that would alter or diminish existing rights to manufacture, assemble, possess, transfer or purchase firearms, ammunition or related items. Moran said he was referring to a letter he fielded from the State Department in August 2011. We failed to land a copy, but in a more recent, April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington, Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, summarized the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced. "We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment," Countryman said. "...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support." As we looked into James’ claim, we noticed our friends at FactCheck.org looked into a similar claim in December 2009. That analysis, headlined "International Gun Ban Treaty?," says Obama, reversing course from his predecessor, George W. Bush, agreed in 2009 to work with other UN member nations toward a conference possibly leading to an arms trade treaty. The article says that on Oct. 28, 2009, the UN General Assembly voted 153-1 to move forward in preparation for a conference, with the United States voting "aye." Critics including former UN Ambassador John Bolton aired suspicions that any such treaty would require nations to restrict the domestic ownership of firearms, FactCheck.org reported, though a related General Assembly resolution acknowledged the right of nations to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownership. Another provision, the story says, acknowledges that countries have a right to arms for "self-defence and security needs and in order to participate in peace support operations." Also noted by FactCheck.org: Two weeks before the cited General Assembly vote, Clinton insisted that any decisions at the conference on the treaty would be made by "consensus," meaning that every country would have veto power on the negotiated agreement, according to an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article, and it wouldn’t go into effect without the approval of all. In short, FactCheck.org said, no treaty will take effect if the U.S. disagrees. So, the United States plans to participate in a conference possibly resulting in a treaty regulating the international arms trade, but the Obama administration has said it won’t support limits on the Second Amendment. We followed up with Turney by asking if James had evidence of Obama and Clinton pushing to ban the use of firearms. She replied by email that James is "very concerned that citizens need to keep pressure on the administration to defend the Second Amendment, especially heading into UN treaty negotiations." Our ruling We found no evidence of Obama or Clinton indicating they want the UN conference on an arms trade treaty to ban the use of firearms; the recent speech by an administration underling states the government will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment. This claim runs so substantially counter to reality, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03367	"Twenty-four percent of doctors in Virginia currently don’t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/12/dave-schwartz/dave-schwartz-says-24-percent-virginia-doctors-won/	During a recent rally on the state capitol grounds, opponents of Medicaid expansion argued it is ridiculous to expand a health care program that they said is fundamentally flawed. Among the speakers was Dave Schwartz, Virginia director for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that organized the rally. He said Medicaid patients receive poor health care, in part because many doctors are unwilling to treat them. "Twenty-four percent of doctors in Virginia currently don’t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low," he said. We wondered whether Schwartz’s statement about Virginia physicians is correct. It’s an intriguing claim because if expansion is approved in the Old Dominion, 400,000 additional Medicaid recipients will be seeking the care of state doctors. Schwartz, who repeated his statistic in a June 18 op-ed in The Virginian-Pilot on June 18, said it came from a 2012 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Affairs.The article, written by an economist at the National Center for Health Statistics, broke down national data to show what percentage of office-based physicians in each state in 2011 accepted new patients. The NCHS extracted its state data from a from a survey of 4,326 U.S. doctors conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. Only 4 percent of those physicians said they did not take on new patients in 2011. Of that national sample of doctors, 31 percent said they did not accept new Medicaid patients. Of the Virginia physicians, 24 percent did not add Medicaid recipients -- the number Schwartz cited. But Schwartz glossed over some fine points in the study, creating two issues with his claim. First, the survey omitted doctors who practiced in hospital outpatient departments or clinics that are part of a hospital -- important sites of care for Medicaid patients. Thirteen percent of the nation’s physicians worked in hospital-based practices and 3 percent worked in community health centers, according to 2008 data from the Center for Studying Health System Change. Those numbers were not broken down by state. But they tell us that the proportion of all Virginia doctors that did not accept new Medicaid patients -- as Schwartz framed his statement -- had to be slightly lower than 24 percent. The second issue is that Schwartz said all of the Virginia doctors who declined new Medicaid patients did so "because the reimbursement rates are so low." But the survey on which the NCHS study was based did not ask physicians why they shunned new Medicaid patients. It did cite other national research that said reimbursement was a primary reason for doctors shunning new Medicaid patients, but not the only one. Two years ago, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a national study of the acceptance of Medicaid patients. It was based on the responses of 1,460 physicians to a survey conducted in 2008 by the Center for Studying Health System Change. Kaiser’s study said more than 90 percent of physicians cited multiple reasons why they accepted only some or no new Medicaid patients. The most frequently mentioned reason was inadequate reimbursement, at 89 percent, followed by billing requirements and delayed reimbursement, each at 76 percent. Other major reasons were that Medicaid patients often required a lot of clinical work and difficulties in arranging care for them from specialist physicians. Research has also shown correlation between the historic Medicaid reimbursement rates in each state and the willingness of its doctors to accept patients covered by the program. At the end of 2012, states, on the average, paid doctors treating Medicaid recipients 66 percent as much as the federal government paid them to care for Medicare patients, according to another Kaiser study. . Virginia reimbursed at 80 percent of the Medicare rate. Under Obamacare, the U.S. is paying to raise Medicaid payments for primary care providers to the level of Medicare fees in 2013 and 2014. After that, the Medicaid fees are expected to return to state control, according to Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Our ruling Schwartz said, "24 percent of doctors in Virginia currently don’t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low." The survey Schwartz cites to back his claim did not include primary care providers in hospitals and community clinics -- who very often are the doctors that care for Medicaid patients. So the actual percentage of all Virginia physicians not taking on Medicare recipients is slightly lower than Schwarz’s number -- exactly how much lower is impossible to say because no study has computed the number. Schwartz also is askew in claiming that every Virginia doctor who closed his or her door to new Medicaid patients did so because of low reimbursement rates. The survey he cited did not ask physicians about Medicaid rates. Other research has shown that U.S. doctors avoid Medicare patients for a variety of reasons that almost always include low fees. All told, Schwartz’s statement paints a generally accurate picture but needs elaboration. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Dave Schwartz	None	None	None	2013-07-12T11:01:53	2013-06-17	['Virginia']

pomt-04007	Says Gov. John Kasich can remove the president of the State Board of Education.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/07/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-says-/	Re-posting an item from a friend on Facebook led to calls for the resignation of the president of the Ohio Board of Education, Debe Terhar. Terhar, a Republican from Cincinnati, re-posted a photograph of Hitler with a caption reading: "Never forget what this tyrant said: ‘To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.’ — Adolf Hitler." The Columbus Dispatch, reporting the story, said the item originated "with the Facebook page of Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which features a variety of anti-Obama, pro-gun posts and pictures." After the story appeared, Terhar removed the material, and then closed her Facebook page. She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it. A little research might have saved a lot of trouble. Our friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote "is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered." (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler’s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.) Terhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted "the consequences of carelessly sharing" the posted material and would be "more selective in my use of social media in the future." Gov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action. "It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake," he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. "I’m glad that she’s come out and said she’s sorry about it, that it’s a mistake, and she’s not going to do it again." Ohio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement. "In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar," Redfern said, "Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office." A subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar's resignation carried the subject line, "Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!" PolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern's office. A party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state's most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial "no comment," and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern. Kurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor’s office. The state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich’s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich’s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier. Using that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president’s chair, he has the influence to make it happen. Removing her from the board altogether would be a different matter. The board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor. Terhar, self-described as "an early participant in the Tea Party," is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month. Her seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code. Under the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials. So what's the verdict here? Terhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can't rate. That includes calls for her resignation. Redfern's statement that Kasich "has a duty to remove" her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so. The Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern’s remarks, said the call for Terhar’s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That’s an important distinction. He acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich’s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor’s power over the board. We rate Redfern’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2013-02-07T06:00:00	2013-01-23	['John_Kasich']
pomt-13053	In Flint, Mich., "the pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/21/michael-moore/flint-water-still-problems-michael-moore/	After Michigan turned away from Barack Obama in 2012 and toward Donald Trump in 2016, Michael Moore, the liberal filmmaker and activist, said he understood voters’ frustrations. This could be seen, he said, even in Genesee County, which includes Moore’s hometown of Flint, where residents have been grappling with major water-contamination concerns. In Genesee County, Obama in 2012 won by a 62 percent-37 percent margin, yet in 2016, Hillary Clinton won by a significantly narrower 52 percent-43 percent margin. "Barack Obama, who I loved, and voted for twice, and I will miss dearly -- he showed up in Flint five months ago and he drank the water, when it was still not fixed," Moore said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "The pipes were still not replaced. He drank the water to say, ‘It's all okay, everyone.’ And it was like a knife in the heart of the people of Flint, a black city, to see the president do this. I saw everybody just deflate. The pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned. How many shows on Flint since he drank the water?" Is Moore correct that in Flint, "the pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned"? The frustration he’s channeling is understandable. But he glosses over the progress that has been made in ameliorating this long-lasting problem. (Moore did not respond to our inquiries.) Origins of the problem In Flint -- a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in the manufacturing industry -- the lead poisoning was precipitated by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder had campaigned on his managerial experience and had promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities. Under emergency management, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars. The day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn’t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used. Not only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city’s old pipes. Lead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing. After a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution. Water quality Since the problems emerged and remedial actions were taken, the Environmental Protection Agency has conducted several rounds of testing, most recently in July. These samplings have shown improvements in lead levels, as long as residents use filters that are being provided free of charge. In June, officials decided that levels were safe enough to lift restrictions on pregnant women and small children from drinking the tap water, as long as it was filtered. The main challenge is that "filter installation, operation and replacement are sometimes challenging, said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue. "While lead levels have fallen according to sampling tests, there is concern that there is still lead in the system, and it is unclear whether every residence has safe water," Kahn said. In September 2016, Mark Durno, deputy chief of the EPA's emergency response branch, told the Detroit Free Press that lifting the filter requirement before the end of the year is not likely, barring a dramatic drop in lead levels. Marc Edwards -- a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place -- told PolitiFact that the improvements are real even though filters are still needed. "Our recent data is indicating that the drinking water in Flint in terms of lead and other contaminants after the unprecedented intervention is now in the range of other cities with old pipes," Edwards said. "Obviously, that is nothing to brag about, and the state and federal government are erring on the side of caution, including not giving an ‘all clear’ until there is a reasonable margin of safety. … But it is incorrect to say that Flint water is worse than that of other cities, at present, and given that residents are being provided protection, I think Flint residents are actually better off than residents in many other cities." Water delivery infrastructure Progress on replacing pipes has taken longer, due in part to Congress’ inability to come to an agreement on funding. Flint has begun to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a "FAST Start program" that uses $27 million in funds appropriated by the state. Through mid November, pipes at 346 homes have been replaced. The city plans to replace pipes in a total of 788 homes this fall. The problem is that this is a small fraction of all pipes that will eventually need replacing. Bridge magazine, a Michigan publication that has been tracking the situation in Flint, has estimated that more than 17,000 homes may still need to be addressed, including homes with lead pipes and galvanized steel pipes, which entail similar hazards. A spokeswoman for the city of Flint, Kristin Moore, offered a similar number. "While continuing to provide residents with free bottled water and filters is a needed and important step, the mayor stresses that we know it is only a temporary fix," Kristin Moore said. "Therefore, doing what is necessary to eliminate the ongoing effects of the water crisis, including replacing all the lead-tainted pipes in the city of Flint, remains a top priority." Edwards of Virginia Tech acknowledged the long road ahead, emphasizing that speeding up the process -- and potentially cutting corners -- could lead to more problems. "While I know that lead pipe replacement sounds easy to a layperson, it is actually a very difficult and expensive process, and if done incorrectly can actually leave the problem worse than without pipe replacement," he said. "Realize that you are disturbing a very hazardous material that is dispensing water intended for human consumption. Even a very ambitious lead pipe replacement project would take five to seven years to complete." Edwards mentioned a "pipe replacement disaster" in Washington, D.C., as a precedent to avoid. The project involved 12,000 pipe replacements at a cost of more than $100 million over seven years — "and in the process they actually increased the incidence of childhood lead poisoning due to falsified science and government agency misconduct," he said. Edwards understands this will sound like cold comfort for residents of Flint. "Many Flint residents, with good reason, will never trust the safety of their potable water again, or the word of any government agency," he said. "A few of them will not even trust me (or my colleagues) even after we exposed the problem. We cannot and do not blame them for that, given their journey. But the facts do not support statements that say Flint water is any more poisonous than other cities, especially considering the provision of the free filters and bottled water that protect consumers from any lead problems that remain." Our ruling Moore said that in Flint, "the pipes still haven't been replaced. The water is still poisoned." It will take years to complete the replacement of Flint’s pipes. Officials have replaced a few hundred pipes, with thousands more to go. The tap water is still not safe to drink on its own. However, experts said the city has made progress here, and the water is considered safe when filtered, putting it on par with other cities with older infrastructure. While considerable hurdles remain, Moore has glossed over progress that has been made.

pomt-02383	Says Dan Patrick "supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/14/david-dewhurst/dan-patrick-suggested-every-family-get-5000-vouche/	A game show-themed TV ad that debuted just before the Texas Republican Party primary showed different viewers in shock as the unseen "host" declared objectionable "facts" about Dan Patrick, the Houston state senator who ended up drawing more than 40 percent of the primary vote for lieutenant governor. Patrick and incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst are slated to run off for the Republican nomination on May 27, 2014. The ad, sponsored by Dewhurst, included this curious claim: Patrick, the announcer said, "supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car." Did Patrick, a radio talk-show host and businessman who hasn’t served in Congress, do that? By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us Dewhurst’s backup document for the ad, which states that twice on CNN’s "Lou Dobbs Tonight," Patrick suggested vouchers for Americans to buy cars instead of the federal government bailing out automobile manufacturers. On the Nov. 25, 2008, edition of the show, Dobbs suggested an urgency to the then-proposed bailout and sought Patrick’s thoughts, according to CNN’s transcript. Dobbs: "This auto industry bailout, we got to have it. There's just no question. Whatever the reason is, national security, you name it. Three million people lose their jobs. We have got to do something. I don't get why Congress is so uptight about this idea after basically signing on for $8 trillion. Do you, Dan?" Patrick: "Well, I do get it from this standpoint, Lou, is until we see a plan that they're going to change their business model, we're bridging the gap until they eventually go bankrupt. I'm not in favor of any of these bailouts but I would rather see let's bail out the middle class that you had a story earlier in the show that's being hammered. Give each family a voucher for $5,000 that can only be used if they buy a new truck or automobile." "That will start moving inventory," Patrick then said. The Texan added: "We need some practical thinking on the main street level to help the average, American family. That's what we need to help get the economy rolling. Once the economy is rolling, everything takes care of itself but I'm tired of giving money to Wall Street, tired of seeing Congress have no transparency where this money is going. "Let's put it in the pockets of the people," Patrick said. "We got here, Lou, because once upon a time, the saying was, we're spending our children's money and our grandchildren's money. This government is now spending our great-grandchildren's money and the factor of inflation and debt is going to destroy this country." Earlier on the program, Patrick said: "Most people don't want to see General Motors fail but they also don't want their tax dollars and bail out a company that has had bad ideas and bad management." Patrick also brought up the voucher idea on the March 31, 2009, edition of Dobbs’ program, we confirmed from the CNN transcript. "Six months ago," Patrick said to Dobbs, "I was on your show here after the first stimulus, Lou, and I suggested that the government send a $5,000 check to every head of a household who had an auto registration and it could" only be "used to buy a car." (Patrick wasn’t that specific earlier, at least according to the 2008 show’s transcript.) Patrick continued in his 2009 appearance: "If we want to use stimulus money effectively, send a check for five grand to everyone in America, head of a household, that they can only use to buy a car. That will move cars." Later in the interview, Patrick said: "But instead of sending Detroit the money, send it to people" to go buy a car. Asked about the senator’s statements to Dobbs, Patrick spokesman Logan Spence pointed us to a Patrick campaign web page including a section declaring Dewhurst’s voucher claim a lie. "This is a misrepresentation of" Patrick’s "position," Patrick’s camp says. "He said that the money the federal government was playing with to bail out the auto industry would be better served being returned to their rightful owner—the taxpayer—for use of buying a car should they want to." Vouchers, Spence said by email, struck Patrick as a "better and cheaper idea." Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick "supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car." Patrick advocated such vouchers, but this claim fails to note that Patrick pitched them as a direct way of bolstering auto manufacturing instead of the federal bailout of manufacturers.

pomt-05466	The Buffett Rule "will bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/23/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-buffett-rule-would-raise-just-eno/	The U.S. Senate voted on the eve of Tax Day to reject the so-called "Buffett Rule" ensuring a minimum tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, but that didn't put the matter to rest. Democrats, who pushed the legislation, and Republicans, who blocked it, both believe that continued debate about taxes works to their advantage. That debate includes the Paying a Fair Share Act, which was named the Buffett Rule for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The bill would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on those whose individual adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million a year. Democrats say the legislation is about fairness and shared sacrifice to reduce the budget deficit. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, highlighted Republican criticism in a commentary for Politico on the day of the Senate vote. He called the Buffett Rule a political gimmick and a distraction from real tax reform with little impact of consequence. "For all the political chest-thumping surrounding this proposal," he said of the the Buffett Rule, "the new tax will bring in less than $5 billion per year. That represents 0.4 percent of annual individual income taxes paid — or enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt." PolitiFact Ohio had seen similar dismissals of the proposal, including the claim that it "raises virtually no money," but Portman's statement was weightier and more detailed. We asked his office how he backed it up. Press secretary Christine Mangi ran through the proof: On March 20, 2012, Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan body that estimates tax changes for lawmakers -- released a score of the Buffett Rule projecting $46.7 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, or $4.7 billion per year on average. Individual income tax receipts in 2011 totaled $1.09 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and $4.7 billion is 0.4 percent of that. The March 2012 CBO baseline of net interest spending in fiscal 2012 is $224 billion, which comes to $4.3 billion per week. The annual revenue of the Buffett Rule -- $4.7 billion -- would pay that one week’s interest. We followed the steps, checked the sources and confirmed the accuracy of Portman's figures. We also found that there is more worth knowing. In projecting future revenue from the Buffett Rule, the Joint Committee on Taxation followed its standard practice of using a "current law" estimate, which assumes that temporary tax cuts or increases take effect as planned under current law. Under the current law baseline, the so-called Bush tax cuts, which were extended in 2010, would expire at the end of this year. That scenario that would result in hundreds of billions in additional revenue from taxpayers, and the $47 billion would be on top of that. A "current policy" estimate, on the other hand, refers to what the revenue numbers would look like if the current rules continued -- if Congress again extends the Bush tax cuts, as it is generally expected to do. The current policy estimate says that if the Bush tax cuts are extended, then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year. That's more than three times as much revenue as the current law estimate. In relative terms, it is still a small fraction of the amount needed to achieve deficit reduction. "On the other hand," Washington Post policy columnist Ezra Klein observed, "any deficit-reduction package is made up of lots and lots of smaller policies that contribute to the bottom-line figure" -- noting that a proposal last year to defund public broadcasting for budget reasons "packed about one one-hundredth the deficit reduction of the Buffett Rule." Finally, in framing the value of the Buffett Rule, we note that there is a difference between deficit and debt. The deficit is the amount by which the government's spending exceeds its revenues in a year. The budget deficit for fiscal 2012 is more than $1.3 trillion. The debt -- the figure used by Portman -- sets a much higher bar. It is the sum of yearly deficits and is the total amount that the U.S. government owes. The current total debt figure is $15.6 trillion. Portman’s statement on the amount the Buffett Rule would raise and how that compares to interest on the national debt is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2012-04-23T06:00:00	2012-04-16	['None']
pomt-14562	"While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/feb/10/greg-abbott/abbott-claim-federal-fishing-rules-snags-facts/	In a 90-page call to action,"Restoring the Rule of Law With States Leading the Way," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Uncle Sam had usurped states’ authority to regulate fishing. Abbott’s January 2016 declaration added up to a sweeping denunciation of federal overreach in which he urged Americans to hold a constitutional convention to limit the authority of the Supreme Court and federal oversight of the states. "Over the last two centuries, the federal Congress has steadily expanded its reach into every nook and cranny of every Americans' life — and kicked the states to the curb in the process," Abbott said. Among examples, Abbott elaborated: "While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep." Anyone who fishes knows about minimum lengths. The rules are aimed at preventing anglers from removing young fish before they’ve had time to reproduce. So, have the feds really pushed the states aside as the arbitrator of minimum fish lengths down to the tenth of an inch? Abbott’s info In an email, Abbott spokesman John Wittman responded to our inquiry by pointing out a federal law providing minimum length limits for certain kinds of fish caught in ocean waters at issue in a federal case brought against Florida fisherman John Yates in 2007. The case made news when it hit the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, though the justices weren’t weighing the fish-length rules, according to a Feb. 26, 2015, New York Times news story; they were deciding whether Yates destroyed evidence of a crime when he dumped the fish overboard after a Florida state Fish and Wildlife officer working on behalf of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration measured them and found them too short. Wittman told us the officer determined that 72 of Yates’ red grouper measured between 18.75 and 19.75 inches — below the 20-inch minimum. Wittman said the officer was "thus, charging Mr. Yates with violating federal fish standard by literally fractions of an inch." State laws Though Abbott's comments about federal fishing regulations were not limited to Texas alone, it seemed appropriate to begin with the Lone Star State. With Abbott’s backup in hand, we called the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to ask if the federal government sets minimum fish lengths for everyone who fishes in Texas. Department spokesman Josh Havens said by phone that, to the contrary, Texas maintains its own regulations on minimum fish lengths for any catches in public waters. Also, he said, no length regulations apply to fish caught in waters wholly on private lands. Havens said he wasn’t sure when those regulations were first put in place, but that it was before his lifetime. According to the Handbook of Texas, by 1895 "it had become clear that some regulatory office was needed to control the depletion caused by overfishing," so the state established the office of the Fish and Oyster Commissioner. "By 1962 hunting and fishing activities in 129 counties were under full or partial control of the commission’s regulatory authority," the Handbook said. Here are the state-issued minimum length regulations for fish caught in Texas waters, according to the 2015-16 edition of the TPWD Outdoor Annual Hunting and Fishing Regulations: Federal laws We wondered still about the Abbott-cited federal case against Yates. At the federal level, NOAA spokeswoman Allison Garrett responded to our inquiry be emailing us links to federal web pages stating that federal fishing law only applies beyond a state’s maritime boundary. For most states, that boundary is three nautical miles offshore though for Texas and Florida, it’s nine miles. Havens agreed that federal fishery laws only apply outside of state waters. The TPWD website also said federal law "regulates species between 9 and 200 nautical miles (off Texas shores) under a Federal Fishery Management Plan." Next, we shared with Wittman our haul of information contradicting the governor’s claim. Wittman replied by email: "The point is that this entire area -- water, fish, fishing, etc. -- used to be an area of STATE regulation. Put differently, there were NO federal laws governing fish size. It’s the change from state to federal law that we are complaining about." History So, did the feds take control over what what the states once controlled? The web pages noted by Garrett laid out some history: The maritime reach of states dates to the time of the founding fathers, the NOAA webpage says, though that reach was never formalized. Rather, the three nautical mile limit was set according the 17th Century "cannon shot rule," which stipulated that the dominion of land ends where the range of weapons ends. In the 1940s, several states claimed jurisdiction over resources off their coasts, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck that claim down in 1947, saying states had no title to resources off their shores. Congress responded by codifying the maritime reach of states. In 1953 it passed H.R. 5134, giving coastal states jurisdiction over a region extending three nautical miles off their coasts, according to a "primer on ocean jurisdictions" posted online by the University of North Texas. That same legislation also established federal control over the vast region geologically defined as the offshore "continental shelf." According to the book Shore and Sea Boundaries, "Congress (in 1953) for the first time asserted jurisdiction over the vast submarine area that fringes our coasts." In 1959, the federal government sued the Gulf Coast states, which were attempting to assert more than the three-nautical-mile state maritime reach established in 1953. According to an opinion issued by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1960, Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845 claiming a maritime reach of three leagues (approximately nine nautical miles); that reach was confirmed in the Annexation Resolution of 1845, and could not be nullified or reduced by subsequent legislation, the court wrote. So, Texas maintained its nine-nautical-mile-reach, while most other states were allowed three. Then in 1976, Congress enacted laws establishing a federal fishery conservation zone within 200 nautical miles of U.S. shores, "with the inner boundary being the seaward boundary of the coastal states," according to a summary of legislation on the webpage of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The two compared So, states never actually ceded authority over fishing to federal rules. That is, as state and federal officials told us, the federal rules only pick up where the state’s authority ends, nine miles from the shoreline in the case of Texas. The federal rules do exist. Could they be overbearing and tyrannical anyway? To find out, we put the Texas and federal length limits side by side. They turned out to be generally the same, where applicable. Most federal minimum length limits are slightly shorter, but the feds measure to the inner crest of the fish tail while Texas officials measure to its farthest tip. Another distinction: Texas regulates more fish species than the feds. Havens said that’s because more fish are fishable in the shallow coastal region than in the deeper federally-regulated portions of the ocean.

Finally, no minimum lengths - state or federal - were specified to anything more precise than the nearest whole inch, meaning no tenths-of-an-inch restrictions. Our ruling In a January declaration promoting a restoration of powers to the states, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott complained, "While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep." According to authorities, both the state of Texas and the federal government set minimum lengths for keeping fish caught by anglers. The feds’ authority, however, only begins at nine miles from the coast of Texas, right where the state’s jurisdiction ends. In other words, the federal government has taken no regulatory authority away from the states when it comes to minimum fish lengths. Moreover, since the state of Texas and the federal government both set similar limits specific only to the nearest whole inch, the suggestion the feds’ rules are stricter doesn’t hold water.

pomt-03535	"Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/30/mark-pocan/us-constitution-not-explicit-right-vote-wisconsin-/	There was news out of the U.S. Capitol on May 13, 2013 that U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, proposed to amend the Constitution to ... Guarantee the right to vote. Wait, what? Pocan hasn't been in Congress even half a year. But he knows we have the right to vote, doesn’t he? In presenting his bill, which is co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., Pocan said he wanted to make it more difficult for states to impose rules on voting, such as having to present a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. We won’t take up here what impact their proposed amendment might have. But Pocan gave us pause when he said on the House floor: The right to vote "is so fundamental that most Americans, understandably, assume it is already enshrined in the Constitution" -- but "most Americans would be wrong." "While the right to vote is inherent throughout our founding document, and there are amendments prohibiting discrimination, nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote. We, as Americans, possess no affirmative right to vote." Words matter, and Pocan’s claim -- that "nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote" -- is precisely worded. Still, is he right? Pocan's evidence When we asked Pocan for evidence to back his statement, he told us to go read the Constitution. Just kidding. But we did wonder how he would try to prove that something doesn't exist. The existence of the 15th, 19th and 26th amendments, which prohibit discrimination based on race, gender and age, implies there is no explicit right to vote in the Constitution, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau told us. He also cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore, which effectively resolved the razor-thin 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore. "The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote," the high court observed, according to Lau. But that was only the first part of the quote -- the rest is: "for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College." In other words, the Supreme Court declared that the Constitution contains no right to vote for president, Alexander Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at Harvard University, told us. That’s OK as far as it goes; let’s go further. Other evidence A number of other authorities who back an amendment like the one Pocan proposes have cited the lack of the guarantee he cites: -- Keyssar, author of The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States, told us: "The basic fact is there is no affirmative right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. Never was." -- FairVote, which seeks to reform elections, says that while constitutional amendments prohibit discrimination based on race, sex and age, "no affirmative right to vote exists." -- In a 2012 piece for Salon.com, Yale law professor Heather Gerken wrote: "The Constitution does not guarantee Americans the right to vote. That always comes as a surprise to non-lawyers." -- In 2006, University of Baltimore law professor Garrett Epps, critical of photo ID requirements, made almost the same statement Pocan did, saying: "The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a right to vote." But what do other constitutional scholars say? Judith Best, distinguished teaching professor of political science at State University of New York-Cortland, told us the key phrase in Pocan’s claim is "explicitly guarantees." "It seems clear to me that the obvious intent" of the Constitution, she said, "is that the people are to choose their governments -- their representatives." Similarly, Roger Pilon at the libertarian Cato Institute -- who doubts Pocan’s amendment would have much impact, if adopted -- told us that amendments to the Constitution make it clear there is a right to vote. "It’s so implicit as to be all but explicit," he said. But intending or implying aren’t quite the same as an explicit guarantee. And in Pocan's opinion, an explicit guarantee would make it more difficult to put restrictions on voting. We’ll leave the final word to scholar Hans von Spakovsky of the conservative Heritage Foundation and author of Who’s Counting?: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk. "It is correct that there is not an explicit provision in the Constitution guaranteeing the right to vote," he said, "but several amendments guarantee the right to vote at age 18, free of racial discrimination, and protected by the Equal Protection doctrine." Our rating Acknowledging that the right to vote is inherent in the Constitution, Pocan nevertheless called for amending the document and declared: "Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote." Whether adding such a guarantee would have much impact is debatable. But Pocan’s narrowly constructed claim is accurately stated. We rate it True.

pomt-14446	"NAFTA, supported by the Secretary (Clinton), cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/bernie-sanders/sanders-overshoots-nafta-job-losses/	In a series of notably sharper exchanges between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., had both candidates emphasizing their fundamental differences. After Clinton laid out how she would boost industrial jobs in America, partly by going after companies that aim to shift production overseas, Sanders accused her of finding "religion on this issue, but it’s a little bit too late." "Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America," Sanders said. "NAFTA, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest." NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It significantly reduced trade tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada. Hillary Clinton obviously had no vote on the deal, but in 1996, during her husband’s presidency, she did say "I think NAFTA is proving its worth." Since then, she has said it "has not delivered" and should be fixed. Our focus is whether in fact, the trade deal caused the loss of 800,000 American jobs. Competing studies The Sanders campaign pointed us to work by the Economic Policy Institute, a research group that gets about a quarter of its funding from unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, "the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico." The author of that study, Robert Scott, said he went industry by industry and converted trade deficit and surpluses into an estimated number of jobs. Since the United States has a trade deficit with Mexico, it has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico. But other analyses say the impacts were much less dramatic. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, summarized a number of studies on NAFTA’s legacy. That report said it is difficult to tease out the effects of the trade deal by itself. Factors such as economic growth, inflation and changes in exchange rates cloud the waters. That said, the report struck a measured tone. "NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," the report said. "The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest." A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion. "The net employment effects were relatively small, although there were adjustments across sectors displacing workers," the report said. In other words, jobs in certain industries, such as cars and electronics, might have suffered, but overall, the job impact was nominal. Economist Martin Baily at the Brookings Institution said Sanders’ number "looks high," and observed that it’s possible that NAFTA has not cost the country any jobs. In 2014, a pair of researchers, Lorenzo Caliendo at Yale University and Fernando Parro at the Federal Reserve, drilled down to examine not just exchanges among the United States, Mexico and Canada, but how NAFTA affected trade around the world. In their model, if an industry exported more at a higher real price, then that was a win, or to use their terms, a positive impact on welfare. By that yardstick, NAFTA produced more gains for Mexico than the United States, but both countries were slightly better off. The China factor Economies are enormously complex systems and economists can reach different conclusions based on the factors they consider and the assumptions they bring to bear. Part of what makes the legacy of NAFTA challenging to assess is that in the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations. That overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA. A 2014 report published by the Federal Reserve Board linked that change to major job losses in the United States. It "reduced total employment growth by -19.5 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 versus the prior decade," the authors wrote. The impact was nearly twice as large for production workers than for non-production workers, but for both groups, the legislation reduced job growth. Our ruling Sanders said that NAFTA, which Clinton used to support, cost the U.S. economy 800,000 jobs. There is a report from a left-leaning policy group that reached that conclusion. On the other hand, many other nonpartisan reports found that the trade deal produced neither significant job losses nor job gains. This is a result of competing economic models and the challenges of teasing out the effects of NAFTA from everything else that has taken place in the economy. The report Sanders cited is an outlier, and his use of its findings ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False. Editor's note: Soon after we published, we heard from Robert Scott of EPI and added his comments.

pomt-09928	"A new poll shows 62 percent support the president's plan to reform health care. That means ... letting you choose between keeping the private insurance you have and a public health insurance plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/16/americans-united-change/62-percent-support-health-not-barack-obamas/	A new ad urges support for President Barack Obama's push for major health care legislation. Created by the liberal group Americans United for Change, the ad argues that 62 percent of the public supports "the president's plan to reform health care," and that Republicans in Congress should too. Here's the full script of the ad; you can also watch it via YouTube : "In the Senate, they call 60 percent support a supermajority. Well, a new poll shows 62 percent of Americans support the president’s plan to reform health care. That means lowering costs, so everyone has access to quality, affordable care, protecting your choice of doctor, letting you choose between keeping the private insurance you have and a public health insurance plan. So if the Republicans in Congress ignore what 62 percent of us support, you gotta wonder: Who are they listening to?" It's true that polls show solid majorities of the American public think the health care system needs change. But there's a big difference between general support for health care legislation and the particulars of Obama's plan. The ad from Americans United for Change cites a Diageo Hotline Poll of June 10, 2009, saying that it showed 62 percent support for "the president's plan to reform health care." The actual question was this: "Do you support or oppose Congress and the president enacting a major overhaul of the U.S. health care system?" That question gauges whether people broadly support the president and Congress working together to change health care. (The poll was a random sample of 800 registered voters, and the Hotline is part of the nonpartisan news group National Journal.) But the ad repeatedly cites the number in a misleading way. It makes it sound as if the 62 percent singled out the president's plan for support. It further distorts the poll by saying that same 62 percent backs a public health insurance plan, sometimes referred to as a public option. When the ad mentions the public option, a big "62%" flashes on the screen. A public option is controversial in Congress. Democratic advocates for it say the public option would act as an insurer of last resort for people who have problems getting private insurance. Some Republicans say it will be a Medicare-style plan that will pay doctors and hospitals significantly less than private insurance, thus undermining the private insurance system. The devil is in the details here, and Congress is debating what a public option might look like. The ad from Americans United for Change implies that 62 percent support a public health insurance plan. But the Diageo Hotline poll did not ask specifically about the public option. A poll that did, the Rasmussen Reports poll of June 15, 2009, asked the question plainly — "Would it be a good idea to set up a government health insurance company to compete with private health insurance companies?" — and found support split, with 41 percent answering yes, 41 percent answering no, and 18 percent saying they weren't sure. That's nowhere near 62 percent support. It's true that large majorities of the public do want health care reform. The Diageo Hotline Poll showed that an even larger majority — 94 percent — said it was important or somewhat important that health care legislation pass this year. But it's not accurate to say that 62 percent favor Obama's plan above and beyond other ideas being considered in Congress. And it's incorrect to attribute that specifically to the public option. The ad gives the impression that rock-solid majorities are in favor of the specifics of Obama's plan. But the poll doesn't say that. We find their statement False. Update, June 22, 2009: We ruled this statement False because the ad distorted the results of the poll. Several days after we published this item a New York Times/CBS News poll showed 72 percent support for a public option. But we're not changing our ruling because the New York Times poll hasn't changed the circumstances our the original fact we checked: The ad distorted the facts about the poll that it referenced.

pomt-07567	"Ultimately, after an exhaustive investigation," the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that a Minneapolis bridge collapsed in 2007 "because of an original design flaw dating back to the 1960s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/30/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-writes-ntsb-ruled-minneapolis-bridge-/	In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential Republican presidential contender in 2012 -- addresses the 2007 collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. The collapse, on August 1, 2007, came during Pawlenty’s second term as governor, so questions were raised about whether his administration bore any responsibility for the collapse. Pawlenty makes clear in the book that he believes his administration was vindicated. "Ultimately, after an exhaustive investigation," Pawlenty wrote, "the (National Transportation Safety Board) concluded the bridge fell because of an original design flaw dating back to the 1960s." We wondered whether Pawlenty characterized the findings correctly. So we turned to the NTSB report ourselves. First, some background on the NTSB. It’s an independent federal agency charged with investigating transportation accidents and making recommendations based on its findings. Pawlenty is certainly correct that the NTSB concluded that the "probable cause" of the collapse was a four-decade-old design flaw, specifically a flaw with "gusset plates" -- metal plates that secure several different pieces of the bridge’s truss (or structural support). The NTSB concluded that certain gusset plates in the I-35W bridge "failed under a combination of (1) substantial increases in the weight of the bridge, which resulted from previous bridge modifications, and (2) the traffic and concentrated construction loads on the bridge on the day of the collapse." The NTSB also concluded that a "contributing" cause of the collapse was "inadequate design review by federal and state transportation officials." This would have happened during the design and approval phase, which was in the mid 1960s. (The bridge opened to traffic in 1967.) In other words, the NTSB concluded that the most important factor and one of two contributing factors in the collapse were things that had happened four decades ago -- long before Pawlenty became governor. However, while the report does largely exonerate state agencies from blame in the collapse -- and in fact notes that officials were inspecting bridges more frequently than required by federal guidelines -- other portions of the report are somewhat more equivocal about the state’s role. The report found that another "contributing" factor was "the generally accepted practice among federal and state transportation officials of giving inadequate attention to gusset plates during inspections for conditions of distortion, such as bowing, and of excluding gusset plates in load rating analyses." The NTSB noted, for instance, that there was significant corrosion on certain gusset plates. While the investigation concluded that this corrosion was not a factor in the collapse, the NTSB did express concern about how inspectors had treated that wear over the years. The report said the NTSB "is concerned that the amount of corrosion … had not been documented in detail and had not been given particular attention during subsequent bridge inspections. Had the bridge remained in service, and had the corrosion and section loss continued to progress without mitigation, the ability of the gusset plates to safely carry loads would have continued to diminish, even if these particular plates had been properly sized." A more direct criticism by NTSB involved state officials’ role, or lack thereof, in guiding contractors on how to safely spread out construction materials on the bridge. Construction was under way on the day of the collapse, and the contractor had placed a large amount of material on the bridge in preparation for its work. The NTSB concluded that if the material had been spread more widely, even the flawed gusset plates would have held. But the material was instead gathered into a smaller area to facilitate traffic and construction work, and as a result, the weight became too much for the bridge to bear. The NTSB notes that the existing guidance by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials was silent on this particular risk. But the report also notes that on a previous occasion, contractors had asked the state agency to stockpile materials on the bridge and "had been given a response that they interpreted as permission." And while state officials told the NTSB that they would have denied the request that led to the collapse if the contractor had asked them, the report expressed some skepticism with that response, saying it was "impossible to know with certainty" that they would have denied the stacking request. "In the absence of formal and specific guidance, decisions about the placement of construction materials may be made on an ad hoc basis ... and may not take into account all the considerations necessary to ensure that temporary loads do not damage the structure or possibly even exceed the load-carrying capacity of the structure at its most highly stressed location," the NTSB concluded. The NTSB added that following the collapse, the state agency revised its standards for the storage of construction materials on bridges. A final note: Some outside experts believe the NTSB report underplays actions by state officials that could have contributed to the collapse. Barry B. LePatner, a New York-based lawyer whose practice specializes in engineering and construction, published a book in late 2010 -- Too Big to Fall -- that argues, among other things, that "shoddy maintenance, ignored expert repair recommendations, and misallocated funding" also helped cause the collapse. (In Pawlenty’s book, the former governor dismisses the notion that an unwillingness to spend money contributed to the collapse, writing, "It was untrue and of course overlooked the reality that we were spending millions of dollars to improve the decking, railing, and lighting on the bridge when it fell.") In any case, we’ll keep our fact-check tailored to the specifics of Pawlenty’s statement -- that "ultimately, after an exhaustive investigation the NTSB concluded the bridge fell because of an original design flaw dating back to the 1960s." We conclude that he’s right that the most important factor the NTSB pointed to -- plus one of the two contributing factors it cited -- were design-related flaws dating from the 1960s. But Pawlenty’s summary doesn’t acknowledge other questions the NTSB raised about the performance of state officials during his tenure as governor. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03130	"I’ve never supported legislation that invades people’s choices about contraception."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/16/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-he-never-backed-legislation-limits/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli is combating accusations that he’s tried to restrict the types of birth control Virginians could use. "I’ve never supported legislation that invades people’s choices about contraception," Cuccinelli told reporters on Aug. 27 while campaigning in Northern Virginia. His comment was reported by The Washington Post and The Loudoun Times. Cuccinelli made a similar comment during a July 20 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe when he was asked by moderator Judy Woodruff, "Would you again seek to make several forms of contraception illegal as you did several years ago?" "Well, I certainly didn’t do that several years ago," Cuccinelli replied. We examined Cuccinelli’s claim. At issue is his support of support of two "personhood" bills that sought to provide human embryos with legal rights. Both bills died in the General Assembly. Supporters say personhood laws provide a legal remedy to parents if an unborn child is killed by the negligent or criminal act of a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge abortion and contraception rights. In 2007, Cuccinelli as a state senator co-sponsored legislation that would have given pre-born humans the "right to the enjoyment of life" from the moment fertilization. Critics, including McAuliffe, say the bill would have outlawed birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. As attorney general, Cuccinelli last year spoke at a rally for a similar bill that would have extended to human embryos and fetuses, from the moment of conception, "all the rights available to others living in Virginia." Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s campaign, said her boss’s statements are accurate because the legislation he backed simply "defined life and had no language or reference to any form of contraception or any access to contraception." Nix added in a follow-up email that Cuccinelli "does not believe the government should regulate contraception and supported this legislation because he is pro-life, and this bill would protect innocent life." The debate on personhood’s effect on contraception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that condoms and other forms of birth control that merely prevent fertilization would unaffected by a measure to provide legal rights to preborn children. But various forms of FDA-approved contraception can also work to prevent the implantation of fertilized egg in the uterus. For example, although birth control pills mainly work to prevent fertilization by preventing the release of an egg, they can also make the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation after its fertilized, according to WebMD. Emergency contraceptives if taken soon after intercourse can prevent the release of an egg to prevent fertilization. But if taken later, they can prevent the implantation of an egg. Some abortion opponents believe life begins at the moment of fertilization and consider anything that prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus as tantamount to producing an abortion. That’s sparked concerns from supporters of contraceptive access that conveying rights to human eggs from the moment of fertilization could open the door to limiting birth control products that can prevent affect implantation. Nix, in her statement, did not spell out exactly how Cuccinelli defines "contraception." We asked if he includes in his definition any method that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, but didn’t get a clear response. "The pharmaceutical structure for contraception is one that changes with ongoing medical research," Nix said. "Ken Cuccinelli is not interested in legislating contraception." We should note that as a state senator back in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a Democratic measure that would have specified contraception does not constitute abortion. The bill, which passed the Senate but died in the House, defined contraception as methods that block fertilization or prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists weighed in on that debate last year warning that personhood laws being considered around the nation saying it threatened certain forms of contraception. "Although the individual wording in these proposed measures varies from state to state, they all attempt to give full legal rights to a fertilized egg by defining `personhood’ from the moment of fertilization before conception (ie. pregnancy/implantation) has occurred," ACOG wrote. That would make condoms, spermicides and natural family planning "the only legally allowed forms of birth control," the group said. In other words, the doctors said that only birth control devices that prevent sperm from joining an egg would remain legal. "Thus, some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures," ACOG said. Three days after ACOG’s statement, the Virginia’s 2012 personhood bill was approved by the Republican-led House on an almost straight party line vote. Democrats unsuccessfully offered an amendment that specified the legislation "shall not be interpreted as affecting lawful contraception." Two days later -- on Feb. 15, 2012 -- Cuccinelli endorsed the bill at rally on the Capitol grounds, although news stories contain no mention addressing contraception in his speech. The bill, however, died in the Senate. Both the 2012 and the 2007 measures may not have survived legal challenge even if they had passed. A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor, pointed out to us that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that couples have a right of access to contraception. Our ruling Cuccinelli, in a carefully-worded statement, says he’s never supported legislation that "invades people’s choices about contraception." While he’s never cast a vote on legislation that explicitly restricted birth control options, Cuccinelli for a decade has been one of the strongest anti-abortion voices in Virginia. He’s supported personhood bills that recognized life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization and bestowed human embryos with legal rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says such legislation could outlaw birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Cuccinelli’s wording also allows him to gloss over a vote he cast in 2003 against legislation that would have specified contraception does not constitute an abortion. So Cuccinelli’s claim has some accuracy, but omits his consistent support of bills that would have opened or protected legal avenues to challenge the use of certain contraceptives.

pomt-07114	Says 11 percent of the nation’s fatal car crashes in 2009 were attributed to distracted driving.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/20/judith-zaffirini/state-sen-judith-zaffirini-says-11-percent-fatal-c/	Advocating for a statewide ban on texting while driving, state Sen. Judith Zaffirini warned the practice can cause fatal crashes. "In 2009, 11 percent of fatal crashes — that's 995 out of 5,474 — in the U.S. were attributed to this kind of driving, distracted driving," the Laredo Democrat said on the Texas Senate floor on May 25. The proposal, which later won legislative approval, was vetoed Friday by Gov. Rick Perry. Still, we wondered if distracted driving really plays into more than 1 in 10 fatal car accidents. To back up the statistic, Zaffirini spokesman Will Krueger pointed us to a September 2010 "distracted driving" study by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The study says the department describes a "distraction" as a "specific type of inattention that occurs when drivers divert their attention from the driving task to focus on some other activity." In 2009, the study says, 45,230 drivers were involved in 30,797 fatal U.S. crashes. In those crashes, 33,808 people were killed. And, it says, distraction was reported for 11 percent (5,084) of the drivers involved in those fatal crashes. Notably, that’s not 11 percent of the crashes, which is how Zaffirini put it. It turns out, though, that distraction figured into a bigger percentage of fatal crashes in 2009 — 16 percent, according to the study, up from 10 percent in 2005. The vast majority of distracted-driving related fatalities — 84 percent — were associated with driving in a careless or inattentive manner. That could include using cell phones, eating or talking, according to the study. The study relies on fatal crash data that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System annually collects from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The study also relies on a sample of police-reported crashes from the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System. The study warns that data on distracted-driving-related crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities is limited because investigations are conducted after the fact and police accident reports vary across jurisdictions, creating reporting inconsistencies. For example, "some police crash reports" have a field devoted to identifying whether "distraction" led to a crash, according to the study, whereas other reports only give officers the chance to mention distractions in narrative accounts of the accident. Also, if a driver dies during a crash, law officers may not have enough information to judge whether distraction played a role. Lastly, we searched for other data on distracted driving. According to a 2009 distracted-driving fact sheet from the National Safety Council, more than 50 peer-reviewed scientific studies have identified risks associated with cell phone use while driving. The sheet cites two studies concluding that drivers who use cell phones are four times more likely to be involved in a crash — a 1997 New England Journal of Medicine examination of hospital records and a 2005 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study linking crashes to cell hone records. An April 2006 paper by the Canadian Automobile Association and the Traffic Injury Research Foundation summarizing the findings and recommendations from a 2005 International Conference on Distracted Driving notes that "crash-based studies are retrospective. They begin with the outcome (the collision itself) and endeavour to reconstruct what factors were associated with, or contributed to, the collision." Each method for analyzing the risks involved with distracted driving "has strengths and limitations and because of this no study is definitive," according to the report. "There is no single research approach or design that will answer all the questions about the magnitude and characteristics of the problem and the risks it poses." Where does that leave us? In warning against the dangers of texting while driving, Zaffirini misstated the percentage of fatal crashes attributed to distracted driving: It’s 16 percent, not 11 percent.

Barack Obama as untested in general elections, Sen. Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn asserted during a Feb. 11 conference call with reporters that the first-term Illinois senator has "never had a serious Republican challenger." Critics have frequently tried to hang the "short on experience" rap on Obama, but in this instance, Penn is correct. Obama's toughest battles at the state and national level have been in Democratic primaries. As a community organizer and civil rights lawyer on Chicago's South Side, Obama won his first political race in 1996 by successfully challenging the nominating petitions of four primary rivals in the overwhelmingly Democratic 13th Senate district. He faced no Republican opposition. In 2000, Obama made his first run for Congress by challenging incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush in a primary but got trounced, finishing with just 31 percent of the vote, compared to Rush's 61 percent. Four years later, Obama found himself on an unexpectedly easy path to the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Peter G. Fitzgerald. First, Republican multimillionaire front-runner Jack Ryan dropped out of the race amid allegations he pressured his wife to go to sex clubs. The GOP, desparate for a quick replacement, turned to social conservative Alan L. Keyes, who moved from Maryland to Illinois for the race. Obama wound up capturing 70 percent of the vote, buoyed by the national exposure he received from delivering the keynote speech for presidential nominee John Kerry at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Because Obama has faced only token Republican opposition, when he's faced any at all, we deem this claim to be True.

pomt-09977	"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/04/joe-biden/biden-wrong-way-germs-travel-through-aircraft/	Vice President Joe Biden went on the Today show on April 30, 2009, to quell concern about swine flu. But he didn't quite stay on message. Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. "We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move," Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, "Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ..." — Biden laughs here — "No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?" Biden: "I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing." That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to People magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: "On the Today Show this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick." We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. "Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing," said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. "The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings." We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze "might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that," Overfelt said. "They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said." "Quite a bit of research indicates that," he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: • A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to "a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis." • A 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were "clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft." • A 2005 study in The Lancet concluded, "The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk." That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to — you guessed it — rubbing your eyes. "If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles," Overfelt said. "With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane." If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was "When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft." That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2009-05-04T16:10:21	2009-04-30	['None']

pomt-05632	Says that in fiscal year 2010, "nearly 80 percent of women served" in the Texas Women’s Health Program received services from a provider other than a Planned Parenthood clinic.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2010-nearly-80-women-served-womens/	Gov. Rick Perry has been using statistics to help defend the state’s decision to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from a family planning program for low-income Texas women. Perry’s office suggested in a tweet posted March 15, 2012, that Planned Parenthood’s involvement in the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program is minimal, saying: "In FY 2010, nearly 80% of women served received WHP services from non Planned Parenthood providers." Scott Braddock, then hosting a Houston radio news program, responded with a tweet of his own, urging us to check whether Perry is right. We looked into Perry’s claim amid debate over the state’s decision, which has led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of federal funds for the program. And we found a weakness in the governor’s figure. The state started the Women’s Health Program in 2007. It offers free family planning services, including birth control, to low-income women between the ages of 18 and 44. The goal is to reduce the number of births paid for by Medicaid — the health insurance program for the poor and disabled that is jointly financed by the federal government and the state — by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies. In Texas, adult women generally aren’t eligible for Medicaid unless they are pregnant or disabled. The Women’s Health Program — which is largely financed by the federal government — extends family planning services to women who don’t qualify for Medicaid but whose future births would. Through the program, eligible women receive an annual family planning exam that may include a Pap smear as well as other health screenings. The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms and family planning counseling. To participate in the program, providers — including doctors and clinics — must be enrolled with the state as Medicaid providers and certify that they do not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood. So, is Perry correct that during the state’s fiscal year 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — nearly 80 percent of the women who received services under the program did so from a provider that wasn’t Planned Parenthood? For answers, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to the state’s Health and Human Services Commission. Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, told us that Perry’s "nearly 80 percent" figure is based on a data analysis that included three statistics for fiscal 2010: 1) The total number of women who were served under the program (106,711) 2) The number who received services from a Planned Parenthood clinic (49,162) 3) The number who received services from "all other providers" (84,805) To arrive at the "nearly 80 percent" figure, Perry’s office calculated that 84,805 (number of women served by "all other providers") is 79.5 percent of 106,711 (total number of women served). Alternatively, 49,162 (number served by Planned Parenthood) is 46.1 percent of 106,711. So, according to state data, Planned Parenthood served 46 percent of 2010 clients while other types of providers served 80 percent. That’s a total of 126 percent! How can that be? If you look at the numbers closely, you’ll see that when added together, No. 2 and No. 3 are greater than No. 1. In other words, the number of women who received services from Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 plus the number of women who received services from "all other providers" adds up to more than the total number of women served in the program that year. That’s because some women received services from both types of providers, so they were counted in both categories: 27,256 women, to be exact. Why the overlap? We found a couple of possible explanations. In an email, Frazier touched on one: Some women "see more than one provider in a year." While it’s true that about 40 percent of women saw a Planned Parenthood provider in fiscal 2010, Frazier wrote, it’s also true that almost 80 percent went to a provider that was not part of Planned Parenthood. Goodman told us that some portion of the 27,256 women served by both a Planned Parenthood clinic and another type of provider could have simply changed their providers during the year. Goodman said that can happen for many reasons. "Our clients tend to move more than most people — that’s a reflection of their income and the difficulty in maintaining housing," she said. Sarah Wheat, interim co-CEO of the Austin-area Planned Parenthood, suggested that some women might go to a Planned Parenthood center for Women’s Health Program services when they need to be seen immediately — for example, if they are having trouble with their birth control — and can’t get an appointment with their regular doctor. Wheat said that’s because Planned Parenthood clinics can often serve women more quickly than other types of providers. The other possible overlap reason: Goodman told us that a woman would be counted in both categories if she had an office visit at a Planned Parenthood clinic that was followed by the Planned Parenthood sending tests from the visit to an outside lab for processing. In that case, the only "services" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider would be lab testing. Wheat told us that it’s common for Planned Parenthood centers to send tests for Women’s Health Program clients to be processed at an outside lab. Goodman told us that the commission did not have data available that would show how many of the 27,256 women recorded as having been served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider showed up in the "all other providers" category for lab work alone, although she said it’s probably a significant number. Subtract the number of women in the "all other providers" category who were also served by a Planned Parenthood provider in fiscal 2010 and you get 57,549. That’s the number of women who got all of their Women’s Health Program services from providers not linked to Planned Parenthood — or 54 percent, not 80 percent, of the women served in the program in those 12 months. When we pointed that out to the governor’s office, Frazier told us via email that the 80 percent figure shows that Planned Parenthood can’t claim they service an entire 45 percent of women in the program. "Whether it’s lab work or an actual doctor’s visit, these non-(Planned Parenthood) providers are absorbing a large part of the services provided to women under the program," she said. Our ruling On its face, Perry’s statement is accurate. Nearly 80 percent of the women served in the Women’s Health Program in fiscal 2010 did receive a service from a non-Planned Parenthood provider. However, Perry’s statement implies that 8 in 10 program beneficiaries did not visit Planned Parenthood clinics, and that’s off-base. Thirty-two percent of the women swept up in the 80 percent statistic were also served by Planned Parenthood. And it’s likely that in some of those cases, the only contact a woman had with a non-Planned Parenthood provider was the processing of her lab work. The available state data show that 54 percent of Women’s Health Program clients in fiscal 2010 received all their services from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-03-23T12:00:02	2012-03-15	['None']

pomt-11049	"Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/27/houston-post/no-red-hen-owner-didnt-threaten-sarah-huckabee-san/	Editor’s note: After our fact-check appeared, some readers emailed us to ask about a comment by Sanders’ father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, about the Red Hen restaurant owner. He told Laura Ingraham on her radio show that that after Sanders and her husband left, the rest of her family went to another restaurant, and the Red Hen owner "followed them across the street, called people, and organized a protest yelling and screaming at them from outside the other restaurant and creating this scene." Huckabee made a similar statement to Trish Regan on Fox. Snopes, a fact-checking website, rated the claim Mostly False after interviewing businesses near the restaurant. Snopes found that Sanders’ inlaws went to another nearby restaurant, the Southern Inn, and at some point in the evening members of the group encountered Wilkinson outside on the street, but it’s not clear whether Wilkinson followed them there or simply happened to be passing by. PolitiFact contacted the Lexington, Va. police to ask if they had any reports of a threat against Sanders and did not get a reply. The Red Hen’s request for President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant has fueled some exaggerations on social media. "Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders after biz was destroyed by booting her," said a June 26 headline by The Houston Post, a pro-Trump website which has the same name as a now defunct newspaper. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the Red Hen owner’s decision to ask Sanders to leave led to a firestorm of both criticism and support, we found no evidence that she threatened Sanders. The Houston Post story doesn’t contain any information about a threat. Here’s what happened at the Lexington, Va., restaurant: on June 22, Stephanie Wilkinson asked Sanders to leave her restaurant after staff members raised concerns. Wilkinson told the Washington Post that Sanders works in an "inhumane and unethical" administration. "I'm not a huge fan of confrontation," Wilkinson said. But "this feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals." Sanders left without incident and later tweeted: "Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so." While we found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened anyone, The Roanoke Times reported that a man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after he tossed a bucket of chicken manure on the sidewalk beside the restaurant and shouted, "Make America great again," Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan. We found no contact information on the Houston Post’s website. We sent an email to The Red Hen and did not get a reply. The Houston Post wrote that "Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders." Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen, asked Sanders to leave her restaurant June 22. We found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened Sanders. We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	The Houston Post	None	None	None	2018-06-27T16:15:23	2018-06-26	['None']
pomt-12302	"I can say that the people that have been hired (for the independent Russia investigation) are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/26/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-calls-muellers-special-counsel-clint/	Robert Mueller’s appointment as a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has angered President Donald Trump, but he has so far restrained any urge to fire him. Trump has instead blasted angry tweets about the "witch hunt" and recently on Fox & Friends called into question the ability of Mueller’s team to do the job. "I can say that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton," he said of the special counsel staffers. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to look into the campaign contributions and employment history of the list of Mueller’s eight staffers that the U.S. Justice Department has made available so far. We found that of the eight, three have made campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton, none have worked for her, and one has defended the Clinton Foundation in court for WilmerHale, the law firm where Mueller was a partner, while another represented a Clinton aide, also for WilmerHale. "Under the Rules of Professional Responsibility, attorneys are permitted to participate in matters involving their former firm’s clients so long as they have no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation," said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesperson. "The department’s ethics experts have considered the relevant issues and determined that Mr. Mueller’s appointment as special counsel and those hired from his former firm are consistent with the rules of professional responsibility." This is why Mueller was allowed to work on the case, in spite of WilmerHale’s representation of several key White House players, including Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. On the question of campaign contributions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in his testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on June 20 he saw no problems with the political donations from some special counsel staffers. When Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether political donations are a reason to disqualify someone from working on the investigation, Rosenstein answered, "No, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not." According to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Congress has a longstanding concern about the possibility of partisanship in the federal workplace, leading it to place restrictions on partisan political activity through the Hatch Act. While the Hatch Act prohibits employees from campaigning for or against a subject of the investigation, financial contributions are permitted. "The Hatch Act places federal employees under two different categories, and some employees are subject to tighter restrictions on their partisan political activities," Clark said. That includes those working on Justice Department criminal investigations. "But even those folks … are permitted to make political contributions." "If someone has some kind of bias against someone or an association with or against, that’s not fair, and there’s a specific federal ethics regulation that requires federal officials who are participating in a proceeding like a criminal investigation to be able to be impartial and have the appearance of impartiality," she added. "Even staffers who have represented Clinton don’t fall into that category." Below, we’ve compiled a list of the special counsel staffers, their financial contributions and employment histories. Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s former FBI chief of staff, previously served as a senior counselor in the National Security Division, as an special agent in the FBI’s counterterrorism division, and as assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va. Following his various stints at the FBI, Zebley worked at WilmerHale, the same law firm as Mueller. There, he once represented Clinton aide Justin Cooper. FEC filings showed that Zebley did not contribute to any political campaigns. James Quarles, a former Watergate assistant special prosecutor, also worked at WilmerHale. He did not represent Clinton or any of her aides. He did, however, contribute $2,700 to Hillary for America, Clinton’s PAC, on Oct. 7, 2016. He also contributed $15,550 to Democratic congressional candidates since 2002; $2,000 to Democratic presidential candidates since 1999; $2,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; and $1,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2009. He is the only staffer who also contributed to a Republican congressional candidate. He gave $2,500 to U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015. Michael Dreeben was the deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, focusing on criminal matters before the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts. While a Michael W. Dreeben shows up in FEC files as having donated $1,000 to Hillary for America on June 27, 2006, this is a different Dreeben in Chicago. The deputy solicitor general has made no campaign contributions. Andrew Weissmann, the chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division fraud section, has also worked as the FBI general counsel, deputy and then director of the Enron task force, and an assistant U.S. attorney in New York. While he made no contributions to Clinton’s PAC, he gave a total of $2,350 to the Obama Victory fund in 2008. Jeannie Rhee was a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel and an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, prosecuting fraud and public corruption cases. She represented the Clinton Foundation for WilmerHale before a conservative legal activist who brought forth a racketeering lawsuit in June 2015. She also contributed a total of $5,400 to Clinton’s PAC in 2015 and 2016. Lisa Page served in the FBI’s general counsel office and as a trial attorney in the Justice Department’s criminal division’s organized crime and gang section. She made no campaign contributions. Elizabeth Prelogar is a former Fulbright scholar in Russia who served as an appellate attorney on detail for the Office of the Solicitor General and as an attorney at Hogan Lovells. She contributed $250 to Hillary for America in 2016 and $250 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2012. Adam Jed, an appellate attorney on detail from the Justice Department’s civil division, made no campaign contributions. Our ruling Trump said that members of Mueller’s team are "all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton." Three of the eight available Mueller hires made campaign contributions to Clinton, which undermines Trump’s statement that all are Clinton supporters. Furthermore, none of them have worked for Clinton directly. Two represented either the Clinton Foundation or an aide, never her, and working for WilmerHale, which has also represented key members of Trump’s White House. The Justice Department has looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of their hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. Trump’s implication is that the investigation is politically motivated, but we see nothing to support that. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-11415	An all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/20/blog-posting/no-it-was-not-all-female-company-built-bridge-coll/	Internet conspiracy theorists have claimed the deadly pedestrian bridge collapse at Florida International University, which killed six, was a consequence of having women lead its construction. A video blogger with the handle Wife With A Purpose titled her 30-minute YouTube video "Florida Bridge Collapse, All Female Company." The video is based on an article from the website Squawker that suggests a high number of female employees doomed the construction project to failure. The two companies involved in the construction were FIGG Bridge Group and Munilla Construction Management, though bloggers have focused on MCM as the key culprit. (But as our friends at Snopes point out, this choice is a somewhat ironic considering FIGG’s CEO is a woman.) A visit to MCM’s homepage clearly shows the company is not staffed exclusively by women — not by a long shot. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman. According to MCM’s website, the company is fully owned and managed by five brothers: Raul Munilla, Juan Munilla, Jorge Munilla, Lou Munilla, Fernando Munilla and Pedro Munilla (seen below, from left to right). As for MCM’s vice president? Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men, too. "Although the company has several women in very responsible roles, the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families," said Donald Silver, a spokesman for MCM. "It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful." To bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers, the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater, Florida International University. Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU, was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIU’s website about the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge. "It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build, too," Flores told FIU in an article that ran March 3, less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse. The Squawker article pointed to Flores’ quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior-ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety. The Squawker article characterizes Flores’ quote as follows: "Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters." But let’s set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores’ quote. An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that "Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity." Silver, the MCM spokesman, confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project. Our ruling A video blogger said an all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed. One of the two companies responsible for building the bridge — and the focus of the conspiracy theory — is MCM, which is owned and managed by five brothers. MCM’s vice president, manager of general construction and its Texas operations director are all men. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman. Furthermore, Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM, who has figured into the conspiracy theory as something of a scapegoat, had no involvement in FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, according to her alma mater FIU.

pomt-11480	"Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor? Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/mar/05/bruce-rauner/rauners-head-spinning-claim-arch-conservative-oppo/	As governor, Republican Bruce Rauner has waged a ceaseless battle with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. But in seeking re-election, Rauner also is fighting off a primary challenge from state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House. The deep-pocketed Rauner is now seeking to combine his two political enemies into one by portraying Ives as a Madigan stooge in TV ads. One ad intersperses clips of Ives speaking about Madigan with an announcer leveling damning accusations. "Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor?" the announcer asks ominously. "Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey. Jeanne Ives, she can’t serve you because she already serves him." Hyperbole and exaggeration are commonplace in political ads, but this one struck us as not just over the top but ridiculous. Ives is the ideological opposite of Madigan and his Democrats. How then could she be doing his bidding, as Rauner’s campaign asserts? We decided to take a closer look. Union’s cash, ideologue’s bounty We asked Rauner’s campaign to explain how it linked Ives to Madigan, and spokesman Justin Giorgio pointed to $6,900 in political cash Ives has received from a political action committee of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 in Countryside. The union represents heavy equipment operators and mechanics and industrial machinery operators. In an email, Giorgio described Local 150 as a "Madigan-aligned labor group." But Marc Poulos, executive director of the PAC, said it has donated to Democrats and Republicans alike who support road building and other construction projects. Ives, he noted, backed a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2016 that barred state officials from diverting transportation related tax revenue for other purposes. The group contributed most of its money to Ives before she announced her run for governor. Since 2010, the union PAC has given $13.9 million to Democrats and Republicans, state records show. Four political committees controlled by Madigan, including the Democratic Party of Illinois, have received more than $1 million from the labor group. But Republican legislative leaders, as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers like Ives, also received money. State records show that since 2010, the Local 150 PAC has showered $45,000 in campaign cash on current state Senate Republican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who is backing Rauner in the primary. Brady recorded receiving $5,000 of that as recently as March 1 at a time the Rauner attack ad on Ives was already airing. Another $32,000 in Local 150-connected donations have also been directed to Senate Republican caucus whip Karen McConnaughay of St. Charles. Meanwhile, House Republican leader Jim Durkin has been the recipient of $170,500 in Local 150 PAC donations since 2010, though the money flow has stopped in the current election cycle when the union broke with Durkin and began actively trying to defeat him. Rauner, however, has received no donations from the Local 150 PAC, records show. It’s interesting to note that Rauner’s campaign hangs its argument about Ives and Madigan on a tiny sliver of her political financing while making no mention of her main source of funding, Lake Forest businessman Richard Uihlein. Uihlein is the wealthy owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company and a major donor to an array of causes and candidates attractive to the far right of the Republican Party, including the failed Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. Records show Uihlein has donated $2.5 million to the Ives campaign for governor, about 70 percent of all money she’s raised since announcing her candidacy in December. Four years ago, Uihlein donated $2.6 million to Rauner for his initial run for governor. Also included in the Rauner campaign ad are video snippets of comments Ives made during a debate with Rauner earlier this year before the Chicago Tribune editorial board. At one point, she can be heard chastising Rauner for "picking on Mike Madigan again." At another point, Ives reacts to a Rauner comment about Madigan by saying, "I don’t think that’s any way to deal with the powerful speaker of the house, Mike Madigan." The context of her comments was far different from what the cherry-picked segments used in the Rauner campaign ad make them appear. The full video of the debate makes it clear Ives was not defending Madigan but rather criticizing Rauner for what she claimed was his ineffectiveness in working with and negotiating with the Democratic majority in the Legislature. Our ruling Rauner’s campaign ad said: "Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor? Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey." A political committee that has supported Michael Madigan and a number of other politicians of both parties gave money to Jeanne Ives. And records show the contributions to Ives total $6,900, a far cry from the $2.5 million she has received from a conservative businessman who once was a major donor to Rauner. Ives was once a loyal supporter of Rauner in the Illinois House, but broke with the governor last year because she claimed he had become too liberal on social issues. Central to her complaint was Rauner’s signing of abortion rights and immigrant rights legislation that Ives opposed and Madigan backed. That is hardly a portrait of a Madigan lackey. Indeed, it is the opposite. Rauner campaign claims about Ives and Madigan turn credibility and rational argument inside out. That is why we give them our lowest possible credibility rating, Pants On Fire!	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-03-05T07:00:00	2018-02-13	['Michael_Madigan']
pomt-08603	"We paid down the debt for four years -- paid down $600 billion on the national debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-his-administration-paid-down-deb/	UPDATE: This version corrects the percentage by which Clinton overestimated the amount his administration paid down the public debt. On the Sept. 19, 2010, edition of Meet the Press, former President Bill Clinton drew a contrast between his record on fiscal policy and those of the Republican presidents who preceded and succeeded him. Asked about the fiscally conservative tea party movement, Clinton said, "Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses. That is, they believe that for years and years and years, the people with wealth and power or government power have done well and ordinary people have not. That's true. They believe those in the Republican Party, believe that they've talked a good game about balancing the budget, but the debt was quadrupled in the 12 years before I became president, and then we paid down the debt for four years, paid down $600 billion on the national debt, and then my budget was abandoned and they doubled the debt again." After a reader sent us a blog post from NewsBusters, a conservative website, we were inspired to check Clinton's claim that during his tenure the U.S. "paid down the debt for four years -- paid down $600 billion on the national debt." In the NewsBusters post, associate editor Noel Sheppard took issue with Clinton's portrayal. Pointing to the interactive federal debt calculator at TreasuryDirect.gov, he challenged readers to find any year in which the debt declined between Sept. 30, 1993, and Sept. 30, 2001 -- the years in which the Clinton Administration was directly responsible for putting together the budget. "You can't, can you?" Sheppard wrote. "Want to know why? Well, because it never happened." So who's right? It depends on what the definition of "national debt" is. First, let's dispense with one common point of confusion. Every year, the federal government (or a business) either runs a surplus or a deficit. When there's a surplus, it means that more money came in than was spent; when there's a deficit, it means that more money was spent than came in. Deficits are typically calculated on an annual basis. But if you add up all the past deficits (and subtract all the past surpluses), then the resulting figure, if it's negative, is the "debt." Unlike deficits, which start fresh every year, the debt is cumulative and continuous. There are actually a few ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the public debt will reach $9.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2010. Add in the $4.5 trillion in debt held by the government, and you come up with a gross federal debt of $13.8 trillion. Now let's look at Clinton's tenure. Using the public debt figures, we see that the debt rose year by year during the first four fiscal years of Clinton's stewardship, then fell during each of the following four fiscal years, from a 1997 peak to a 2001 trough. So using this measurement, Clinton is correct that "we paid down the debt for four years," though he did overestimate the amount that was paid down when he said it was $600 billion. The actual amount was $452 billion -- which was equal to about 12 percent of the existing public debt in 1997. But what about gross federal debt? On this score, NewsBusters is correct: In each fiscal year from 1993 to 2001, the gross federal debt increased, because the increase in money in government trust funds exceeded the annual decreases in the federal budget deficit. So by one of these measures, Clinton is correct, and by another, he's wrong. "The discrepancy between the two concepts of federal debt in these years occurred because of program surpluses and the rapid growth of reserves held by the various trust fund accounts, such as Social Security," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. Social Security surpluses don't go into a "lock box" but are instead invested in government bonds; the proceeds of these purchases go into the general treasury, and when the bonds mature, the treasury is obligated to pay back the Social Security trust both principal and interest. "The growth of these surpluses meant the rest of the federal government did not have to issue as much debt to the public," Burtless said. "In fact, the federal government paid off more of its old debt than it issued new debt to the public. Therefore, net federal debt held by the public declined." So, is there any reason to prefer any single measurement? On this question, we couldn't find a clear consensus. The Congressional Budget Office wrote in a 2009 report that government-held debt, such as the Social Security trust fund, "has no direct, immediate impact on the economy. Instead, it simply represents credits to the various government accounts that can be redeemed as necessary to authorize payments for benefits or other expenses." By contrast, CBO wrote, "long-term projections of federal debt held by the public, measured relative to the size of the economy, provide useful yardsticks for assessing the sustainability of fiscal policies." James Horney, of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted that most key studies of the debt in recent years have focused on public debt. Horney gets support from a leading conservative, Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute. Public debt, Mitchell said, "is the key variable since it measures the amount of money the government is draining from private capital markets, or adding, in the case of surpluses. Government spending grew very slowly during the Clinton years, just 2.9 percent annually between 1994 and 1998. This was a very good accomplishment, and Bill Clinton, and the GOP Congress, should be proud. If we could do the same thing now, we could balance the budget in about 10 years and make all the tax cuts permanent." At the same time, economists on both the left and the right told us that they consider both measures acceptable yardsticks. "Both are reasonable measures," said liberal economist Dean Baker. "People most often do use the publicly held debt number, so I don't think Clinton can be blamed for using the standard figure. Of course it is not wrong to point out what happened with the gross debt, either." For his part, Sheppard, the NewsBusters blogger, stood by his decision to base his post on gross federal debt. "If the public debt during those years was bought with other debt -- meaning by the Social Security trust and the Federal Reserve -- we didn't actually pay down any debt, did we? If you take out an equity line of credit on your home to pay off your car loan, your debt didn't decrease. Furthermore, if you take out an equity line of credit to pay off your car loan and buy a boat, it would be deceitful on your part to say you reduced your debt, right? This is what happened those four years: We did retire some debt held by the public, but we did so by increasing debt held by the government and the (Federal Reserve). That's not retiring debt. That's just shifting it from one lender to another." We see merit in using both public debt and gross debt, so we are reluctant to declare that Clinton is definitively right or definitively wrong in citing statistics supported by the public debt figure. Clinton's phrasing -- talking about "the debt" and "the national debt" -- strikes us as vague enough to refer to either the public debt or the gross federal debt. So we are left with a statement that's correct using one measurement and incorrect using another measurement. In addition, Clinton overestimated by about one-third the dollar amount by which the public debt declined from its peak during his term, though he also correctly characterized the changes in the debt under Republican presidents. So on balance, we rule Clinton's statement Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2010-09-23T11:55:54	2010-09-19	['None']

pomt-09160	Barack Obama appeared in the video for 'Whoomp! (There it is!)'	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/08/blog-posting/obama-rumored-be-video-whoomp-there-it/	No need to go to Hawaii (or Kenya) to verify this Internet rumor. The evidence is on VH-1 (and now YouTube). Bumping and bouncing through the blogosphere Tuesday was the claim that President Barack Obama appeared in the 1993 music video for Whoomp! (There It Is), the catchy ode to raucous dancing and sexual promiscuity that became a fixture at sporting events. It includes the refrain "Can you dig it?... We can dig it." The speculation centers on an Obama doppelganger who appears in the video by the Atlanta rap duo Tag Team. He appears for just a few seconds during a scene where a wad of cash is shown resting next to a game of dominoes. (Not a campaign contribution, we hope, because the FEC frowns on cash.) With a Compton cap on his head, a stud in his earlobe, an array of gold rings on his hand and an antiquated, huge cell phone attached to his ear, the young black man flashes a wide grin that evokes Obama's toothy smile. But much of his face is obscured by a pair of wayfarer sunglasses. The image stirred impassioned debate on hip-hop and political sites such as Tha Corner, Gawker, The Huffington Post and Something Awful, with commentators overwhelmingly declaring that the unidentified baller must be a young Obama, or, at the very least, a passable look-alike. "Pay close attention to his ears poking out, the shape of his nose, and skin color," said a posting on Tennessee Sons of Liberty, a Tea Party blog. The discourse follows years of intense scrutiny and disagreement over Obama's background. Critics have claimed he continues to misrepresent his religion, country of birth and political beliefs despite evidence to the contrary, such as his birth certificate from Hawaii. The Tag Team postings were mostly good-natured musings. Many noted that Obama is a self-professed hip hop fan who drew wide support from rap artists during his presidential campaign, but some critics accused the bloggers of perpetuating racial stereotypes. "Are you sure that's not him? Because all black people look the same," deadpanned one Huffington Post commentator. We wondered: Could it be him? To paraphrase the Tag Team, we decided to go upside-down and inside-out and show you folks what it's all about. We tracked down half the Tag Team, the rapper DC the Brain Supreme who also goes by the name Cecil Glenn. He first heard of the Obama video rumor on Saturday, and has since received calls from New York magazine and Inside Edition. "This is like an episode of South Park," Glenn said. "You can't pay for that kind of publicity." Glenn recounted the taping of the video in Atlanta, saying he gathered extras through word of mouth. A friend also put out an open invitation on a local radio station. The video was filmed at an Atlanta fairground. Glenn said he doesn't think the man in the video is Obama. "It doesn't add up. It's hard to say he was in Atlanta and said, 'Ooh, I want to be in the Whoomp! (There It Is) video.' " But, Glenn said, "I can't be for sure because that was a real big video shoot and thousands of people showed up." Tag Team's label, DM Records in Miami Beach, said no one on staff could recall the name of the extra who showed up for the video shoot nearly two decades ago. President Mark Watson said he had seen the debated image on YouTube and could confirm its authenticity. "It doesn't look like it has been tampered with," he said. We tried to pin down Obama's whereabouts during the June 1993 video shoot. We didn't have a detailed calendar, but the timing didn't mesh with Obama's biography. In June 1993, Obama, a recent law school graduate, was working at Miner, Barnhill and Galland in Chicago, said Judd Miner, a firm partner. Miner didn't recall Obama, then 31, taking time off to travel to Atlanta that month. "I've never heard of this before," Miner said. Miner also couldn't link the earring-clad man in the video to the young lawyer that served for years at his firm. "Barack never had an earring." Finally, the White House put the issue to rest. Spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield declared the rumors untrue. "It is not him," she said. So alas, that's not the leader of the free world with the wayfarers and the three-pound cell phone. But we've got the meter shakin'! So for all you conspiracy theorists -- and you party people! -- Pants on Fire! Can you dig it?	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2010-06-08T17:45:41	2010-06-08	['None']
pomt-11873	"Hillary Clinton leaves the country as Mueller indictment is announced."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/31/freedomjunkshuncom/fake-news-site-claims-hillary-clinton-flies-ukrain/	A story that said former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton fled the United States after indictments were announced in Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election is fake news. An Oct. 29, 2017,, post on Morning-Herald.com ran with the headline, "Hillary Clinton leaves the country as Mueller indictment is announced." The same story appeared on other websites, too. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb the spread of fake news. The fake post said that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, flew to Lviv, Ukraine, on Oct. 27, which was the same day a grand jury approved criminal charges in the Special Counsel’s Office investigation. The announcement of who was actually being indicted didn’t come until Oct. 30, giving fake news purveyors a couple of days to peddle false stories. The story originated on Oct. 28 at FreedomJunkshun.com, which had written a series of posts implying Hillary Clinton was a potential target of Mueller’s probe. The site included a photograph of the Clintons at an airport, but that image was from the 2013 renaming of the airport in Little Rock, Ark., after the political power couple. The story notes that Ukraine has no extradition treaties with the United States, which is true. And Hillary Clinton has been to Lviv, but that was as first lady 20 years ago. In reality, Hillary Clinton was in Washington on Oct. 28, not Ukraine, for a speech at the Human Rights Campaign’s national dinner. She was then in the Chicago suburbs on Oct. 30 to sign copies of her new book, What Happened. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." The real indictments were for President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, who pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, also was indicted for lying to the FBI and pleaded guilty. This is another in a spate of fake news stories that claimed Democrats were among the people charged in the Mueller investigation. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-10036	Says former Clinton budget director Alice Rivlin said the stimulus bill "won't actually stimulate the economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/25/mark-sanford/sanford-incorrectly-describes-rivlin-comment-stimu/	To bolster his claim that the economic stimulus bill won't work, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said the bill had drawn bipartisan criticism and named Alice Rivlin, budget director in the Clinton administration, as a prominent Democrat who said the bill would not help. "From both sides of the political aisle — from conservative economist Martin Feldstein, who originally supported a stimulus, to former Clinton administration budget director Alice Rivlin — we hear that this particular bill won't actually stimulate the economy," Sanford, a Republican, wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post on Feb. 23. The mention of Rivlin surprised us because the stimulus plan has drawn strong support from Democrats. So we asked Sanford's office to show us where Rivlin had said the bill "won't actually stimulate the economy." They pointed us to an article in the Washington Post headlined, "Democrats Among Stimulus Skeptics," which was published Jan. 28. The article focused on concerns by some Democrats that the stimulus package "may fall short in its broader goal of transforming the American economy over the long term." It said Democrats were especially concerned that Congress was rushing to include elements in the bill focused on long-term change without a thorough discussion. The article cited congressional testimony by Rivlin and said she "suggested splitting the plan, implementing its immediate stimulus components now and taking more time to plan the longer-term transformative spending to make sure it is done right." It quoted Rivlin as saying, "Such a long-term investment program should not be put together hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession package. The elements of the investment program must be carefully planned and will not create many jobs right away." The risk, she said, is that "money will be wasted because the investment elements were not carefully crafted." But the focus of that comment was on the long-term plan and did not support Sanford's claim that she said "this particular bill won't actually stimulate the economy." We examined her full testimony and found that she made it clear that she thought the first phase of the stimulus package was urgently needed. She told the Budget Committee that "the government should act quickly to mitigate the downslide with spending increases and revenue cuts that will stimulate consumer and investor spending, create jobs and protect the most vulnerable from the ravages of recession." To make sure we were right, we called Rivlin. (This reminded us of that scene in Annie Hall where a man in line for a movie is making claims about media scholar Marshall McLuhan, and Woody Allen is so annoyed that he pulls McLuhan himself from behind the ticket counter and McLuhan tells the man, "You know nothing of my work...") Asked about Sanford's description of her comments in his op-ed, Rivlin told us, "I did not say that at all, anywhere. I can’t imagine where he got that." She said she believed the bulk of the bill was an effective stimulus to the economy but that she wished the smaller portion of the bill aimed at long-term investment had been discussed longer. But, she said, "to suggest I thought the stimulus is not effective is just wrong. That’s not true." So we find nothing to back up Sanford's claim and find his statement False. (Gov. Sanford's office initially stood by the claim, but just as we were about to publish this item, Sanford communications director Joel Sawyer called and said they had misinterpreted what Rivlin said. "In retrospect, we think we were wrong on that," he said.)	None	Mark Sanford	None	None	None	2009-02-25T18:15:36	2009-02-23	['Bill_Clinton']

pomt-13007	"We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-electoral-college-victory-was-not-ma/	Donald Trump won enough electoral votes on Election Day to become president. But he and his staff have been trying to make clear that they didn’t just win — they say they steamrolled Hillary Clinton. "We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College," Trump told Chris Wallace on the Dec. 11 edition of Fox News Sunday. That echoed earlier comments by the Trump transition team and a tweet by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway ("306. Landslide. Blowout. Historic"). We previously rated False the statement by Reince Priebus, Trump’s soon-to-be White House chief of staff, that Trump’s victory was "an electoral landslide." So what about Trump’s own assertion that "we had a massive landslide victory ... in the Electoral College"? (Trump’s transition office did not respond to an inquiry.) The claim remains well short on evidence Here is a chart showing the percentage of electoral votes won by every presidential winner since George Washington (who was the only president to win every single electoral vote). It’s drawn from research by John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. Trump’s victory is marked in red. He won 56.88 percent of the available electoral votes. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This chart makes it clear that Trump’s percentage doesn’t rank near the top. In fact, it ranks near the bottom, belonging somewhere between the lowest one-fourth and the lowest one-fifth of all Electoral College victories in history. "If your share of the electoral vote ranks behind Martin Van Buren's, then you did not win in a landslide," Pitney told PolitiFact. If you think that comparing elections 200-plus years ago to today is problematic, the math also shows that Trump’s share of the Electoral College vote is low by recent standards. Since the end of World War II, Trump’s percentage of the Electoral College vote is lower than 12 previous results (1948, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012). By contrast, Trump’s electoral vote haul was bigger than only five elections in the post-World War II era (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004). So Trump ranks in the bottom one-third by this metric. "If Trump’s election was a landslide, then the word ‘landslide’ has no meaning," said University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket. The popular-vote discrepancy in favor of Hillary Clinton further dampens Trump’s claim. As of Dec. 12, with a dwindling number of votes remaining to be counted, Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.84 million votes, or 2.1 percentage points. While there have been four previous occasions when a presidential candidate lost the Electoral College vote while winning the popular vote, Clinton’s margin of victory is notably large. Measured by raw votes, Clinton’s margin is currently more than five times bigger than Al Gore’s 2000 popular vote victory. Losing the popular vote "takes the shine off any Electoral College victory," political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Pitney of Claremont McKenna said he’s mystified about why the Trump camp is trying to make such a weak argument in the place of ones that would hold more water. "If they had just described the outcome as a ‘dramatic upset victory,’ nobody could reasonably disagree," Pitney said. Our ruling Trump said, "We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College." Trump won, but to call it a "massive landslide" in the Electoral College is not accurate by any reasonable definition. While Trump surpassed the required 270 electoral votes with room to spare, his margin ranks no better than the bottom quarter of Electoral College showings in American history, and no better than the bottom one-third of the showings since the end of World War II. Trump’s claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-12-12T16:41:09	2016-12-11	['None']

pomt-00618	Says Hillary Clinton "makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/28/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-hillary-clinton-makes-more-one-spe/	Conservative pundits are calling out Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for reeling in hefty speaking fees when she left the State Department, saying the big checks belie her message of addressing income inequality as she runs for the White House. "Let’s remember one thing about this woman of the people," conservative radio host Glenn Beck said on his May 13 show. "She knows a few things about making money. She makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year. Let me say that again: She makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year. But let’s have her lecture us about those out of control CEO salaries." A reader wanted to know if that was true. The Clinton presidential campaign did not comment for this fact-check. A spokesperson for Beck could also not be reached. Clinton’s pay Since leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton has earned millions of dollars from giving talks at universities, corporations and industry groups. So has her husband. The Clinton Foundation recently disclosed speaking engagements by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton that brought in between $12 million and $26 million for the foundation. The foundation counts 16 Hillary Clinton speeches without giving specific amounts, including nine in the range of $250,001-$500,000 and seven within $100,001-$250,000. Those fees go to the foundation. What about fees that go to the Clintons themselves? Hillary Clinton’s 2015 financial disclosure provides more specific information about 51 additional speeches in 2014 and 2015. The honorariums varied in amount, so here are some examples: On the lower end of the scale, Salesforce.com paid $125,000, the California Medical Association paid $100,000, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid $150,000. On the high end, Biotechnology Industry Organization and Qualcomm paid $335,000, eBay paid $315,000, and Cisco paid $325,000. More typical were honorariums around $225,000, such as from speeches to a Silicon Valley conference for women, Commercial Real Estate Women Network, SalesForce.com, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, Ameriprise and the National Council for Behavioral Healthcare, among others. With that background in mind, let’s compare her speaking fees to the average pay of CEOs. CEO pay There are a few ways of talking about CEO pay, and it comes down to how you define the average CEO. Workers with that job description can make anywhere from five to nine figures. Beck might be referencing a widely shared Washington Examiner story that compared Clinton’s "reported premium speaking fee of $300,000 per speech" to the earnings of the country’s top 10 highest-paid CEOs (as reported by Forbes). The Examiner broke down the CEOs’ total compensation by a federal standard of 2,080 yearly work-hours. The result: If you broke down CEO pay by the hour, they would earn $54,213 compared to Clinton’s $300,000 speaking fee (which is on the high side of what we found). The Examiner also points out that, realistically speaking, it takes more than an hour to make a speech happen — there’s also speech prep, travel, and time for meals and rest to consider, too. However, Beck’s statement did not include the hourly nuance at all. He simply compared one Clinton speech to the annual income of a CEO. By one measure from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, Beck is way, way off. The think tank found that CEOs of the country’s top 350 firms received average compensation of $15.2 million in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. The EPI researchers used data from Compustat, which pulls in chief executive salaries from publicly held companies as reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s several zeroes away from Clinton’s average $225,000 speech in 2014 and 2015. The AFL-CIO compiled a list of the 100 highest-paid CEOs in 2014. No. 100 was Dr. Leonard Bell of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, who earned $20 million. Naturally, the income of the average CEO decreases as you expand the definition of who is a CEO. Economist Mark Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute critiques the EPI methodology for neglecting CEO salaries on the lower end of the spectrum. The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies 246,240 people by the title of "chief executive." Looking at that group, as of May 2014, the average wages was $180,700. For the more than 21,000 employees within that group who work as managers of companies and enterprises, average annual pay was about $216,100. While those figures are less than the typical Clinton speaking fee, they’re an incomplete picture of what people who classify themselves as chief executives make. For one, as our colleagues FactCheck.org pointed out, the BLS data does not factor in stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically round out a CEO’s total compensation. Several reports back up that salary comprises at least less than half of total compensation for many CEOs. For instance, salary made up just 10 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2012, according to an Associated Press analysis of about 320 companies. A survey of 50 big-company CEOs for the Wall Street Journal found cash pay made up about 37 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2014. Expanding the pool, Equilar determined that of the S&P 1500 CEOs, 20.8 percent of the pay mix in 2014 was for salary. Also, the BLS averages include chief executives in Puerto Rico, as well as those who work in the public sector at schools and in government that might not fit the classic CEO definition. (Those groups, by the way, all see below-average wages, according to BLS.) Plus, counting every CEO’s pay overlooks that the vast majority employ few workers, said Lawrence Mishel, Economic Policy Institute president and an economist who worked on the executive pay research. "That’s cute but highly misleading," Mishel said of Perry’s criticism, "because it doesn’t reflect that the average worker works for a large firm, and the average CEO works for a very small firm." The CEOs of small- to mid-sized businesses also often own large chunks of their businesses that can be sold as capital gains or passed down to heirs, which would not be counted as compensation, said Kevin Murphy, University of Southern California finance professor. The debate about who counts as a typical CEO could also be applied to the worlds of professional athletes, musicians and actors. "The fact is that, in many occupations with ‘superstars,’ the distribution of pay is highly skewed in the sense that the pay for the top earners may be many multiples of the pay for the median person in that occupation," Murphy said. "Perhaps it’s best for us to always qualify ‘CEO’ with ‘Superstar CEO’ or ‘S&P 500 CEO’ to avoid confusion." Our ruling Beck said Hillary Clinton "makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year," in the context of Clinton criticizing "out of control CEO salaries." This is an example of imperfect data. What’s clear is Clinton earned north of $200,000 for a typical paid appearance. But what’s complicated is comparing that one-off event to what a CEO makes in a year. Looking at CEOs of large companies, Beck’s claim completely falls apart. The data that puts Beck’s claim in the best light, from BLS, is incomplete. It doesn’t include stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically make up an executive’s compensation package. Nor does it account for CEOs of small and medium-sized business who have ownership stakes. At the same time, it includes people classified as chief executives in the public sector, as well as in Puerto Rico — groups that drag the average salary down. Beck's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00685	"The United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/05/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-ranks-just-65th-world-gend/	Hillary Clinton, who wants to become the first woman ever to win the presidency of the United States, gave an address recently at the Women in the World Summit that touched on the gap in pay between men and women in the United States. It’s "hard to believe that so many women are still paid less for men than the same work, with even wider gaps for women of color. If you doubt what I say, look to the World Economic Forum, hardly a hotbed of feminist thought," Clinton said at the April 23, 2015, summit. "Their rankings show that the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay. Imagine that. We should be No. 1." That sounds pretty bad for a nation that’s considered the world’s economic superpower. We wondered whether the United States is really that far back in the pack. We found a more complex picture than Clinton’s comments showed. One study that surveyed executives supported her point, but another study of wage data actually undermined it. Framing the wage gap question PolitiFact has written frequently in the past about how much of a pay differential exists for working men and women in the United States. While the exact phrasing has sometimes made a difference in our ratings, we’ve generally rated Mostly True the claims that women earn 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man does, while we’ve generally rated Mostly False the claims that said women earned 77 or 78 cents for every dollar a man earned for the same work. That’s because the 77 to 78 cent figure refers to earnings by men and women irrespective of the specific job held. The 77 to 78 cent statistic reflects that men and women tend to choose different professions and work different numbers of hours per week -- factors that may be noteworthy for policymakers, but which do not directly reflect wage discrimination on the part of employers for women and men who hold the same job. When you compare men and women who hold the same or similar jobs, the pay gap shrinks significantly, though it does not disappear entirely. Global comparisons The new wrinkle in Clinton’s comments is the international comparison. The study she referred to was released by the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based group that describes itself as "committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation." It is best known for its annual meeting of world economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The group’s Global Gender Gap Report 2014 says it quantifies "the magnitude of gender-based disparities and tracks their progress over time." The group explained that the gender gap index looks at "the relative gaps between women and men across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics." The primary yardstick in the report ranked the United States 20th out of 142 countries. By contrast, the 65th place ranking comes from one of the subcategories. Specifically, that 65th-place ranking came from a survey in which executives were asked to rate on a numerical scale their answer to the question, "In your country, for similar work, to what extent are wages for women equal to those of men?" So Clinton engaged in a bit of cherry-picking. By focusing on the United States’ 65th-place ranking, rather than its 20th-place ranking, Clinton painted a much grimmer picture. In addition, the particular data point she used is based on a survey of several hundred business executives in the United States. That means it’s based heavily on perceptions of how much gender-based wage bias exists, not just on hard data showing actual wage differentials. Those executives’ perceptions may or may not be based on accurate assumptions. That said, Clinton does have some justification for citing the ranking she did. On the question of cherry-picking, it does appear that the 65th-place data point is the one most directly focused on gender-based wage discrimination; the other data points refer to elements that are less directly related, such as labor-force participation rates and overall compensation. And on whether it’s appropriate to use a survey rather than wage statistics, doing so does at least has the advantage of recording answers from executives in a wide range of countries across the globe. There does not appear to be comprehensive wage data for all or most countries by gender. The Clinton campaign expressed confidence in the value of the World Economic Forum survey and emphasized that it involved a larger number of countries. Hard data on the "unexplained" gender gap However, the more limited hard data that does exist puts the United States in a more favorable light on wage equity than Clinton’s talking point would suggest. That data comes from the International Labor Organization, a division of the United Nations. The group’s Global Wage Report 2014/15 compared data from 29 developed countries, plus Europe as a whole. This data looks not just at gender-based wage gaps, but at how much of that gap can be "explained" by demographic factors unrelated to employer discrimination, such as education, experience and the divergent career choices made by men and women. Once you remove the "explained" portion of the wage gap, what’s left -- the "unexplained" portion of the gender gap -- is considered a more direct approximation of how much discrimination is occurring against women when compared to men who hold the same job. And on this score, the United States rates well. Of the 30 nations studied, only Germany has a smaller "unexplained" wage gap than the United States does. By this measure, the United States outpaces such advanced industrialized rivals as the United Kingdom, France, the Scandinavian countries and Europe as a whole. That’s a much less dire picture than the one Clinton painted in her speech. Our ruling Clinton said "the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay." She has cited a finding from one international survey of executives, but other data -- including actual wage data from more than two dozen advanced countries -- shows the United States second only to Germany in the lack of gender-based wage discrimination for men and women who hold the same job. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-15102	Annexation would lead to overcrowding at Decatur’s city schools.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/16/internet-commenters/annexation-or-no-decatur-schools-are-overcrowded/	The specter of annexation still floats around DeKalb County, even as voters decide in two months whether to form the cities of LaVista Hills and Tucker. If approved, the cities would share a border roughly along the eastern edge of I-285. Depending on how those votes go, the decisions could revive Atlanta’s failed effort to annex Druid Hills and a bid for Decatur to take in key commercial areas such as Suburban Plaza and the Kroger shopping center on DeKalb Industrial Way Decatur’s proposal drew vigorous opposition from residents in the neighborhoods surrounding some of those shopping plazas, since the city would get the tax dollars but avoided taking more students into its school system. Some Decatur residents have insisted any annexation plans limit residential units, arguing that would lead to overcrowding its small school system. Those claims have taken on urban myth status, reviving again this month in comments on local blogs. A reader asked us to answer, once and for all, if annexation would overcrowd Decatur schools. Quite simply, no. First, it’s worth noting that LaVista Hills and Tucker, if created, would not have their own school districts. They would remain under DeKalb County’s schools. The Atlanta expansion in Druid Hills was largely fueled by residents there who wanted to join the city’s schools after DeKalb school leaders rejected the idea of a charter cluster to give them control over several schools. Decatur’s annexation plan, meanwhile, was designed, in part, to accommodate a school system already growing at an unprecedented rate. A joint letter from the city and school district in November, was blunt: Student enrollment would grow by about 550 students by 2020, even without annexation, based on low-growth projections. An annexation before a new city was adjacent to Decatur’s borders would allow the city to add to its tax base, and find land for new school facilities that would be needed, the letter said. The school board reluctantly signed off on annexation plans in December, with the conditions that a new school site be identified for Decatur, a densely populated city with about 20,400 residents in just 4.6-square miles. Another condition called for current and future city leaders to be "cautious" about rezoning commercial areas into residential zones. Those caveats suggest worry about overcrowding through annexation is a concern even to district leaders. But the enrollment numbers don’t bear those worries out. District spokeswoman Courtney Burnett provided us with a 10-year history of system enrollment. On Aug. 30, 2005, a total of 2,091 students were in the city’s four elementary schools (including the fourth- and fifth-grade academy), one middle school and one high school. This year, enrollment on Sept. 10 was at an all-time high of 4,662. That’s a 123 percent increase in a decade in a district that today includes six elementary schools (including a new fourth-and fifth-grade academy to replace the existing one, which was converted to a K-3 school), a middle school and high school. The high school alone, which houses grades 9-12, has 1,159 students. That puts it at 8 percent over the Georgia Department of Education’s enrollment capacity of 1,073 students. That growth occurred when the city’s last major annexation, in April 2014, brought in just 75 homes and 14 students from the Parkwood neighborhood. "Until we see what happens after the Nov. 3 election, the whole question of our annexation plans are on hold," said Decatur City Manager Peggy Merriss. "But we know that neither annexation nor apartments is spurring the growth of our student population. It’s mostly generational turnover in single-family housing." In other words, more young families – with kids – have decided to call Decatur home. For instance, the 2015 edition of the city’s newsletter, Focus, notes that only 45 students are registered for the current school year from the six multi-family developments that have been erected since 1999. Annexation would, of course, bring some new students to Decatur schools. Enrollment is projected to grow to 8,145 students by 2020 under last year’s annexation maps. But even without those annexed areas, the district projected as many as 7,300 students by 2020. Today, there are about 550 more students in the city’s four K-3 schools than already packed into the over-capacity high school, Burnett said. That’s part of why the school board has placed a bond referendum on the November ballot, for up to $75 million to pay for new construction and expansion of various schools. "The bond is designed for the low-growth, without any annexation, most conservative projection we have of our continued growth," Burnett said. "We have to do something for our growth, now. And that’s if not one more student enters our buildings." Our ruling If DeKalb County voters decide to create two new cities in the November election, it could have ripple effects on how existing cities in the county grow. Decatur’s annexation plans had previously called for more land, but not necessarily more residents, for its school system. Some leaders and residents alike continue to repeat that annexation will crowd the small city’s well-regarded school system. Adding people to the city would, no doubt, translate into more students. But any claims that annexation would crowd the schools ignore the already burgeoning classrooms. The schools are already overcrowded. Decatur school enrollment has exploded by more than 100 percent in the past decade, all without any major annexations. We rate the claim that annexation would crowd the schools as False.

pomt-11666	"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/05/donald-trump/did-author-michael-wolff-have-access-white-house/	The Trump administration has scrambled to control damaging headlines based on Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which was rushed to shelves Jan. 5 over threats from President Donald Trump’s attorneys. For his part, Trump sought to undermine Wolff’s credibility by calling into question the author’s access to the administration’s highest levels. "I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!" Trump tweeted Jan. 4. "I never spoke to him for book." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to dissect Trump’s tweet by sifting through what’s known about Wolff’s White House access. We can’t know everything that goes on behind the scenes, but even the public record shows that Trump’s statement is inaccurate. Wolff’s access to the White House Trump’s tweet could give the impression that Wolff was denied access to the White House entirely. But as Trump’s own press secretary has acknowledged, the author had more than a dozen interactions with administration officials at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Wolff claims that over an 18-month period, he conducted more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff. In the course of reporting his book, Wolff said he was able to take up "something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing." Trump never explicitly allowed his visits nor barred him from the White House, Wolff said, which allowed Wolff to exploit this "non-disapproval" to gain access through "various senior staffers." Here’s the author’s account of his access, as written in the Hollywood Reporter (the circumstances of which we could not independently verify): "Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around — checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the ‘system,’ and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch." As excerpts of Wolff’s book began to circulate, journalists were eager to have the White House weigh in on the incendiary headlines. During a White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced questions about Wolff’s access from one journalist who recalled seeing Wolff in the building multiple times. Here’s their Jan. 3 exchange: Margaret Brennan, CBS News: "Sarah, can you clarify? Because many of us here have seen Michael Wolff at the White House on multiple occasions. We’ve seen him first-hand. So we know he was here. Who gave him access to the White House? What was he here for? Can you explain any of that since we don’t have access to the logs?" Sanders: "Yeah. So far, from what I can tell of the roughly just over a dozen interactions that he had with officials at the White House, I think close to 95 percent were all done so at the request of (former adviser) Mr. (Steve) Bannon." Sanders underscored that Wolff had not been given unfettered access to the White House, saying he had been denied more than 30 requests for access, including at least two dozen requests to interview the president. However, she did not dispute that Wolff had been "seen often" with Bannon in his White House office. "I know there were a number of times where he met with Steve. And I think they have both said and repeated that that happened," she said in a Jan. 5 interview on Fox & Friends. "We looked at the logs. We know that they met on multiple occasions. He was frequently seen meeting with him. So I think that's a pretty indisputable fact on that front." So, while it may be the case that Trump did not personally grant Wolff access, his own press secretary says the author had access to administration officials at the White House. Did Wolff and Trump talk? To the casual reader, Trump’s tweet could give the impression that he and Wolff never spoke — but that’s far from the case. While it may be the case that Trump never talked to Wolff with the express understanding that their discussion would later be incorporated into a book, the two men certainly spoke, though the length and nature of their conversations is not entirely clear. Wolff said he spent about three hours with Trump over the course of the campaign and at the White House. "Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record," Wolff said in a Jan. 5 interview on NBC’s Today. "I spoke to him after the inauguration, yes. And I had spoken to, I mean I spent about three hours with the president over the course of the campaign and in the White House, so my window into Donald Trump is pretty significant." For her part, Sanders does not dispute that the two men spoke. According to Sanders, their only conversation since Trump became president took the form of a brief phone call, which, at that time, was not related to Wolff’s book. "There was one brief conversation that had nothing to do, originally, with the book," Sanders said at a Jan. 3 White House press briefing. "It was, I think, around five to seven minutes in total since the president has taken office. And that’s the only interaction that he’s had." Our ruling Trump said, "I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book." The president may not have personally authorized it, but Wolff had more than a dozen interactions with officials at the White House, according to Trump’s own press secretary. Press corps members also spotted Wolff at the White House on multiple occasions. Sanders also said Wolff and Trump spoke by phone for "five to seven minutes" after Trump became president, which contradicts Trump’s artful phrasing as to their communication.

pomt-09562	"Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions" on health care.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/29/tom-price/price--obama-health-care-no-ideas/	During an exchange with President Barack Obama at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Georgia, complained that Obama has been hostile toward GOP suggestions on health care. "You have repeatedly said, most recently at -- at the State of the Union, that Republicans have offered no ideas and no solutions," Price said on Jan. 29, 2010. "I don't think I said that," Obama replied. "What I said was within the context of health care -- I remember that speech pretty well. It was only two days ago. . . . I said I'd welcome ideas that you might provide. I didn't say that you haven't provided ideas. I said I'd welcome those ideas that you'll provide." Price then said, "Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions, in spite of the fact that we've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions to all of the challenges we face, including energy and the economy and health care." Because Price appeared to correct himself after Obama's reply, we decided to focus on the second claim, that people in Obama's administration have made "statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions." Price spokesman Brendan Buck provided a couple of examples and we found a couple of our own: • At a picnic with labor officials in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 7, 2009, Obama complained that the critics of health care reform -- he didn't identify them as Republicans, but it was clear he was referring to them -- were not offering their own solutions. He said, "I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? What's your answer? What's your solution? And you know what? They don't have one. Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing." • A White House blog post attacking the Republican health care plan said it offered "no ideas." (The posting appears to have a typo. It reads: "The Republican bill offers new no ideas.") • White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on April 19, 2009, described the Republicans as "the party of never . . . the party of no new ideas." (He was referring not just to health care, but also to fiscal discipline.) • At a White House briefing April 28, 2009, press secretary Robert Gibbs made a similar comment: "I think you heard me and others say that you can't just be the party of no or the party of no new ideas." The White House doesn't dispute that aides have portrayed Republicans that way, but a spokeswoman said the Democratic health care plan includes many amendments that were proposed by Republicans. Still, Price is right. Obama and his aides have said the Republicans have no ideas on health care and other issues. We rate Price's statement True.

pomt-05969	Florida's economy "became a bad economy ... because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-2008-spike-oil-prices-caused-fl/	In a Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., candidate Rick Santorum said building oil rigs and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico was "the best way to create a good economy for the state." In fact, high oil prices were what had weakened the state's economy in the first place, he said at the Jan. 23, 2012, debate. "What threatens the tourist industry in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy, and a very bad economy that became a bad economy why?" he said. "Because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008." We remember 2008 — that was the year that housing prices were falling, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch collapsed, Lehman Bros. filed for bankruptcy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were on life support, credit dried up and the Dow Jones index dropped nearly 800 points in a day. Average Americans started to hear terms like "credit default swap" for the first time. Meanwhile, the average price for a gallon of gas jumped above $4. In July, oil hit $150 a barrel. We wondered: Did Florida's economy falter because of a "huge huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008?" Tourism vs. drilling The subject arose in the debate in Tampa — an area where a gulf oil rig gusher off the coast of Louisiana in 2010 had idled fishing boats and scared off tourists — when panelist Beth Reinhard of the National Journal asked about oil drilling and the economy. "The state's most optimistic estimates say more drilling would create 5,000 jobs, but an oil spill would threaten Florida's tourism industry, which employs nearly 1 million people," she said. "Is that worth the risk?" Santorum replied: "What threatens the tourist industry in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy, and a very bad economy that became a bad economy why? Because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008. So energy is absolutely key to keep all of our country healthy, specifically Florida, which is a destination place." What role did volatile oil prices in 2008 play in Florida's economy? "Oil price spikes clearly hurt, but Florida was already mired in recession by then," said Mark Vitner, senior economist with Wells Fargo, who tracks trends in the state. "Florida's housing markets began to weaken considerably in 2006, and the recession likely began in the state by the spring of 2007." Even during a wider economic downturn, energy markets still managed to attract attention. The Palm Beach Post named "oil prices" one of its top 10 national stories of the year, along with "economic meltdown." But oil prices didn't make its list of top local and state stories. Two that did make it? "Florida budget crisis, economy worsen," and "foreclosure, credit crunch hurt state's real-estate market." In June, economists credited higher gas prices for rising unemployment. Higher fuel costs were pushing up prices on food and other goods. That might have been driving more teens and stay-at-home mothers to re-enter the workforce, University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith told the Times. At the time, the unemployment rate in April 2008 was 4.9 percent and rising. Oil prices peaked in July. In Snaith's August 2008 forecast, oil prices were mentioned only as a welcome development — they were falling. The state's long-range financial outlook, released in the fall, noted the flagging economy, saying: "Largely, these changes were related to Florida’s troubled housing market and the worsening national outlook." The only mention of oil or gasoline prices in the report were gas prices' causing a downturn in Lottery ticket sales. By October, as the wider economy worsened enough to invite comparisons with the early 1970s, another Times story noted differences between the two downturns: "The 1973 turndown was fueled by a crippling oil embargo and extended by surging inflation. This one had its roots in a housing bust and the ripple of bad mortgage loans. It was pushed into overdrive by fearful financial institutions that cut off the flow of credit." At the time of the article, gas was already expected to drop below $3 a gallon. By December, that $150-a-barrel oil had dropped to $33 a barrel. But the state's unemployment rate had soared to 8.1 percent. The biggest culprit noted in a story by the Times? The housing downturn. We sought out Scott Brown, chief economist for Raymond James Equity Research in St. Petersburg, Fla. "Higher gasoline prices were a factor in the economic downturn, but the collapse of the housing bubble and deleveraging were much bigger issues," he said. (As for gas prices' influence on tourism, there is some, Brown said. "However," he concluded, "the 2010 oil spill had a clear negative impact.") Economist Tony Villamil, dean of the business school at St. Thomas University, called oil prices "a minor factor." Our ruling Rick Santorum said Florida's economy "became a bad economy ... because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008." He's right that an oil price peak in July 2008 did drive up other costs and perhaps bumped up the unemployment rate as more strapped Floridians sought to work to help cover prices at the pump. But a burst housing bubble already had Florida's economy flailing. And as oil prices dove the second half of the year, collapses in housing and banking drove Florida unemployment into far more dire territory, creating the "bad economy" Floridians still face. Were oil prices a factor? Sure. But scarcely a significant one, as Santorum made it sound. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-24T15:34:19	2012-01-23	['None']

pomt-01338	Six convictions are connected to an allegation by prosecutors "that Gov. Scott Walker is at the center of a criminal scheme."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/23/mary-burke/mary-burke-ad-leaves-impression-scott-walker-cente/	A new Mary Burke TV ad strikes a weary tone, with a narrator describing Gov. Scott Walker’s term as "four years of political fistfights, criminal convictions … and secret donations. Tax cuts for the wealthy 10 times the size of yours, and a jobs promise -- broken." In the middle of the narrator intoning the list of ills, there is an audio snippet from a TV newscast -- "The criminal convictions of six Walker aides or supporters..." -- and mugshots of the six appear on the screen. But the ad’s real gut punch is a silent blow. Above the mugshots, the ad spotlights a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel headline: "Prosecutors allege Scott Walker at center of criminal scheme." The ad is referring to two separate criminal investigations: a now-closed one that snared three top Walker aides and three others from his days as Milwaukee County executive; and a currently stalled probe into whether his campaign coordinated with nonprofit groups during the 2012 recall election. But the ad mashes together the two investigations -- neither of which have led to actual charges of wrongdoing by Walker -- to leave a false impression for viewers. Let’s untangle the ad. About the investigations Both investigations were sought by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm. And both used what is referred to in Wisconsin as a "John Doe" investigation, which allows prosecutors to compel people to testify and produce documents and bar them from talking publicly about the probe. As such, they have become known as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The first began in May 2010 and actually grew out of a request by Walker’s county office to Chisholm to probe whether money was stolen from Operation Freedom, a Walker-run event for military veterans. From there, the investigation went in several directions. By the time it closed in February 2013, there had been five convictions for charges ranging from theft tied to the veterans event to campaigning on public time and illegal donations to Walker’s campaign. A sixth person, the domestic partner of a Walker aide, was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a child for exchanging sexually explicit text messages with what turned out to be a 17-year-old boy. Walker set up a criminal defense fund during the investigation. He was not charged. Three of those convicted worked in key jobs in Walker’s county office, and the conduct under investigation dated to 2010 and earlier. Back to the ad. The headline concerning prosecutors alleging that Walker was at the center of a criminal scheme was from a June 19, 2014 Journal Sentinel story. That’s well over a year after John Doe 1 shut down. The story referred to a subsequent investigation, the so-called John Doe 2, which concerned Walker’s time as governor, not Milwaukee County executive. Prosecutors launched the second John Doe probe in August 2012 in Milwaukee County and in 2013 expanded it to four other counties. There is some overlap in the subjects of the two investigations, and sources have told the Journal Sentinel the second probe grew out of evidence prosecutors found in the first one. But the probes are legally separate and cover different territory and time frames. In the second probe, prosecutors are looking at whether Walker illegally coordinated fundraising among conservative groups to help his campaign and those of Republican state senators facing recall elections during 2011 and 2012. One of the groups has sued prosecutors, and the probe was halted by two court rulings. In January 2014, John Doe Judge Gregory Peterson quashed subpoenas that had been issued in the investigation, ruling he did not believe anything illegal had transpired. The decision effectively shut down the investigation. Later U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa in Milwaukee blocked the probe, only to be overturned by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Various appeals are pending. In court documents unsealed in one of the lawsuits, the prosecutors laid out what they consider an extensive "criminal scheme" to bypass state election laws by Walker, his campaign and two top Republican political operatives. But it’s important to note this was, in effect, their theory of the case. The word "allege" in the headline is not tied to charges, as viewers may assume. None have been filed. Walker has denied any wrongdoing and has charged that Chisholm, a Democrat, has acted in partisan fashion. When asked to back up the ad’s linkage, the Burke campaign told us its intent was not to conflate the two investigations. Rather, spokeswoman Stephanie Wilson said, the campaign believed tackling multiple topics from Walker’s four years in one 30-second ad required condensing the references to the criminal investigations. But the screen’s imagery speaks for itself. Our rating Burke’s TV spot leaves the impression that six convictions are connected to an allegation by prosecutors "that Gov. Scott Walker is at the center of a criminal scheme." Investigations have marked Walker’s four years in office. And the prosecution theory in one case has Walker at the center of campaign violations, as the ad notes. But no charges have been filed in that case, with a state judge throwing out subpoenas prosecutors requested. The probe has been stalled by various lawsuits.

pomt-03498	"There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/07/tim-griffin/no-rise-applications-triggered-irs-actions-says-ti/	One of the lines of defense in the current Internal Revenue Service controversy is that the agency stumbled under a heavy workload of applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status. Steven Miller, the former acting IRS commissioner, made this point in a piece he wrote for USA Today, describing "a sharp increase" in applications. The day after an audit critical of the agency went public on May 14, 2013, the IRS posted on a question-and-answer page that "the number of applications has more than doubled in recent years." The agency connected that directly to the singling out of tea party groups, writing "this inappropriate criterion was used as a shortcut to centralize similar cases." Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., took issue with that argument. At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, he spoke about myths being "thrown around." "There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010," Griffin said. It’s possible to check whether a flood of paperwork was a contributing factor in the IRS missteps and we can see if Griffin is on solid ground. The IRS keeps track of its workload and according to the inspector general’s audit, IRS staff was on the lookout for tea party-type groups at least six months before we see a jump in the number of applications. In fact, the data tell us that the volume of applications had dropped a bit from the year before the screening began. Here’s how the activity breaks down for 501(c)(4) applications, the sort of tax-exempt group where political activity is allowed: 2009: 1,751 2010: 1,735 2011: 2,265 2012: 3,357 The inspector general’s report said these figures came from the IRS Exempt Organizations office and were for the fiscal year. As a reminder, the government’s fiscal year starts in October, so FY 2010 begins on Oct. 1, 2009, and runs through the end of September 2010. The inspector general’s report also provides a detailed timeline that tracks when the tea party screening began. On about March 1, 2010, a manager asked a staffer to tally the number of tea party-related applications. According to the report, the staffer "used Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12 as part of the criteria for these searches." The earliest that there might have been a jump in applications would have been in October 2010. That is well after the IRS began its effort to give selective treatment to tea party groups. The IRS is correct in saying that the number of applications doubled, but that happened later -- from 2011 to 2012. We contacted the IRS and nothing we learned changes the numbers or the sequence of events. Reporters for the Chronicle of Philanthropy and the Washington Post have sifted the facts, too, and reached the same conclusion: The rise in applications for 501(c)(4) status came after the IRS began treating tea party-type groups differently. Our ruling Griffin said there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010, and the numbers from the IRS back him up. The timeline in the Inspector General’s audit shows that the selective treatment of groups based on their ties to the tea party movement began before any rise in the IRS workload.

pomt-00897	A federal judge said President Barack Obama’s executive action on immigration is "unconstitutional."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/05/david-jolly/federal-judge-called-obama-immigration-action-unco/	A recent Texas federal court decision has given congressional Republicans new hope that they can stop President Barack Obama’s executive action to delay the deportation of some illegal immigrants. Here’s how U.S. Rep. David Jolly, a Florida Republican, put it Feb. 26, 2015, during House floor debate: "I understand there's disagreement over the president's executive order last September. I think it was wrong. Members on the other side don't," Jolly said. "A federal judge has said it's unconstitutional. The president of the United States said over 20 times he didn't have the authority to do it, and yet he did it." Jolly was talking as Congress was wrestling with a proposal to defund Obama’s execution action as part of a larger proposal to fund the Department of Homeland Security. House Republicans eventually passed a bill funding the homeland security agency without the immigration rider. What caught our attention was the claim that a federal judge labeled Obama’s action "unconstitutional." Turns out, it is not as simple as that. The executive action Obama announced Nov. 20, 2014, that immigration officials would delay deportation of unauthorized immigrants for the parents of children who are citizens or have green cards, as long as the parents have been in the country for more than five years and met other criteria. (Jolly said September, but his spokesman said he had simply mixed up the dates with a press conference about Syria.) The 2014 action, referred to as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (sometimes called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, or DAPA for short), let qualified immigrants apply for work permits and to avoid deportation for three years at a time. The applicants had to pass background checks and pay a fee. More than 4 million people were estimated to qualify under the DAPA executive action, which built upon Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That initiative protected "dreamers," people who had been brought to the United States illegally as children and had no criminal record. DAPA in the courts As of this writing, the November executive action is on hold indefinitely. On Feb. 16, a day before the action was to take effect, Texas U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunction stopping the action from being carried out. He was hearing a Texas case that included 26 states (including Florida) challenging Obama’s announcement. Hanen said the change would be a burden on states, writing "no statute gives the DHS the discretion it is trying to exercise here." This is the portion of the ruling Jolly first cited when we asked him what he meant. Hanen had ruled "that the president and his secretary acted legislatively by creating new law regarding immigration enforcement," and thereby violated the constitutional separation of powers, Jolly told PolitiFact Florida in a statement. But several experts in immigration policy and constitutional law disagreed with Jolly’s assessment. The impression a reasonable person could make from Jolly’s statement is that a federal judge ruled the action unconstitutional, which is not the case. The states bringing the case did argue the action was unconstitutional -- a point Hanen discussed at length in his opinion, but explicitly said he would not rule on. Hanen said Texas had proven its grievance enough for the case to proceed, but not because the action was unconstitutional. Instead, the judge said the action violated something called the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, which Hanen interpreted as specifying the president should have formally posted a public notice in the Federal Register about the action and held a public comment period before enacting it. The Justice Department will take the case to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. "The more correct formulation would be that ‘A federal judge has said it’s illegal,’ " Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian said. We did find a separate instance in which a federal judge said Obama’s executive action was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab in Pennsylvania said in a Dec. 16, 2014, ruling that "President Obama’s unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and, therefore, is unconstitutional." That case, though, was about whether Obama’s executive action applied to the defendant, a Honduran immigrant who was in the process of being deported for being in the country illegally. Schwab said the defendant could change his plea and face trial under the executive action, but the immigrant declined and was deported because the action doesn’t apply in criminal cases. Schwab’s position doesn’t set precedent, Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky said, because it’s just the judge’s opinion and not a ruling. (Jolly said he agreed with Schwab’s characterization after we asked about it.) Lastly, Washington D.C. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rejected the argument of Schwab and others in December when she threw out a lawsuit from Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, in which the sheriff called Obama’s executive action unconstitutional. Howell ruled Arpaio couldn’t prove the action harmed the sheriff’s department and that deferred action was a congressionally approved method of enforcing policy, and therefore constitutional. "Any party can raise an alleged constitutional violation," Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said. "Only when the Supreme Court rules on the executive action’s constitutionality will that issue be resolved once and for all." Our ruling Jolly said a federal judge called Obama’s executive action on immigration "unconstitutional." A reasonable person may think Jolly meant a judge ruled the action violated the Constitution, but that isn’t accurate. A federal judge in Texas said the government was acting outside its authority by issuing the order. But the actual ruling said the state of Texas had a chance to win a case based on a procedural misstep, not the action’s constitutionality. Another federal judge in Pennsylvania really did call the action unconstitutional, but that was an opinion in a ruling on a deportation case in which the action didn’t apply. Jolly's statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	David Jolly	None	None	None	2015-03-05T14:10:42	2015-02-26	['None']
pomt-11574	Under President Barack Obama: 4 million jobs lost, unemployment rose from 7.8% to 9.9%, the S&P 500 was 1,115.1 and the GDP went down 2.8%.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/02/markwayne-mullin/gop-congressman-distorts-obamas-economic-record/	The day President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address, Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., posted an image on Facebook that showed why he was "proud to have a president that’s putting America first and investing here at home." Mullin’s post was a side-by-side comparison of Trump and President Barack Obama. While it didn’t say so, the statistics were for the first year of each president. Against the gains under Trump, the image had these grim numbers for Obama: Jobs lost: 4 million Unemployment: Rose from 7.85 to 9.9% S&P (500): 1,115.1 GDP Change: Down 2.8% Mullin’s office told us they got the numbers from a CNN Money article and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We checked the original sources – the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the S&P 500 index, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The numbers are right, and in fact the latest numbers for Trump would look even a little better. The message, however, is thoroughly deceptive. The CNN Money article Mullin's office cited points out the danger of judging any president based on his first year alone. It quotes historian Douglas Brinkley saying, "It's not after year one or two that people judge a president. That can affect midterm elections. But what presidents are remembered for are the numbers when they leave office." The examples in the article make that quite clear. President Jimmy Carter’s first year had 3.1 million more jobs, falling unemployment and a GDP of 4.6 percent. But by his last year, the country was in recession. Unemployment had gone from a low of 5.6 percent to a high of 7.5 percent. Annual GDP was a negative 0.2 percent. President Ronald Reagan’s first year had anemic job growth of 130,000 and rising unemployment that reached 8.3 percent. But when he left, the country had gained nearly 16 million jobs, unemployment was down to 5.3 percent and GDP growth was 4.2 percent. President George H.W. Bush took over with an economic wind at his back, but a downturn hit and while the economy recovered, it wasn’t enough to win him a second term. GDP growth stood at 3.7 percent when he came in and bottomed out at negative 0.1 percent. Unemployment started at 5.4 percent and climbed to 7.4 percent in his last year. President Bill Clinton had a moderately good first year, but closed out with impressive GDP growth of 4.7 percent, an unemployment rate of 4 percent and a net gain of almost 23 million jobs. President George W. Bush had a poor first year and disastrous last one, as the country slipped into the Great Recession. GDP growth in 2001 was 1 percent. When Bush left, it was a negative 0.3 percent and unemployment had gone from 4.2 percent to 7.3 percent. When we apply the yardstick of where things stand from the beginning to the end of a president’s tenure, Obama looks quite different from the picture Mullin paints. When Obama took office, GDP was falling at a rate of 2.8 percent. When he left, GDP was growing by 1.5 percent and it had reached 2.9 percent the year before. The country had 11.2 million more jobs. Unemployment had gone from a high of 10 percent during his first year to 4.7 percent when he left. "As most nonpartisan economists recognize, you cannot blame a new president for the economic conditions that prevail when he or she takes the oath of office," economist Gary Burtless of Brookings told us. "Those are the responsibility of the previous administration. The highly partisan comparison (in the Facebook post) does not reflect this simple reality." Obama inherited an economy in collapse, Burtless said, while Trump took over when economic conditions were strong. Our ruling Mullin compared improvements in the economy during Trump’s first year with negative statistics during Obama’s. The post doesn’t note it, but Obama’s numbers are for only his first year in office. While those numbers are accurate enough, they ignore that Obama took office as the country was sliding into the depths of the Great Recession. In contrast, Trump inherited an economy on the upswing. Mullin overlooks the gain of 11 million jobs and an unemployment rate that fell by more than half under Obama. There’s some accuracy to the stats in this statement, but they aren’t labeled clearly.

pomt-02761	The town of Cumberland has "its highest bond rating in history."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/13/daniel-mckee/cumberland-ri-mayor-daniel-mckee-says-town-has-hig/	When Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee launched his campaign for lieutenant governor Nov. 13, he cited the town’s financial progress during his administrations. As evidence of his managerial capability, McKee claimed that his administration restored his town’s credit rating after it dropped into junk bond territory in 2001. "Our town has recovered from a five-point bond downgrade and now enjoys its highest bond rating in history," he said in his candidacy announcement, a claim he has repeated multiple times. First, some background. McKee has been mayor of Cumberland for 11 years -- a four-year stretch from 2000 to 2004, and then again from 2006 until the present. The bond rating recovery claim dates to his first four years in office. Bond ratings are important to municipalities. When a city or town wants to build a new school or an addition to a police station, it raises that money by selling bonds to investors. Ratings services such as Moody’s analyze the issuer’s tax base, budget stability and financial management, coming up with a grade that reflects their opinion of the issuing municipality’s ability to pay the investors back. An ‘A’ rated bond would be considered a safe choice, attractive to risk-averse investors who may be willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for a surer return. A lower rated ‘B’ bond, however, would be seen as less safe and the issuing town may have to pay a higher interest rate to attract buyers. When he was initially elected in 2000, Cumberland had already been in financial trouble for three years. In 1997, the town had drained a $1.4-million surplus fund to cover a deficit and still wound up $147,940 short That prompted Moody’s to drop the town’s bond rating from A1 to A3 in 1998. The rating company uses a letter system to rate bonds, with multiple steps. The best rating is Aaa1. The lowest is C3. Aaa bonds, in Moody’s words, "demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness." Below Baa level is junk bond status. During its bankruptcy, Central Falls was rated Caa1, signifying "very weak creditworthiness." Cumberland’s municipal finances were struggling in 2000. A series of news reports noted that revenues were not coming in as expected, the town’s audit reports were late and one estimate predicted a deficit equal to a tenth of the town’s overall budget, "which is an enormous amount," an analyst at Moody’s told The Providence Journal at the time. In January 2001, barely three weeks into McKee’s first term, Moody’s cut the town’s bond rating five steps, to Ba2. Ba rated bonds, in Moody’s words, "demonstrate below average creditworthiness." A Moody’s-rated Ba bond is familiarly known as a "junk bond." The crawl back began in March 2002. A completed audit showed revenues coming in better than expected, and the town implemented a series of cost-cutting measures as well as centralized management of town departments’ spending. Moody’s upgraded the rating to Baa3, one step out of junk bond status. By December 2004, the rating had improved to where it was in 2000, before the downgrades began. McKee said that was important to him because it came as he was leaving office, and it fulfilled a campaign promise. Two years later, in 2006, McKee won the mayoralty back and has been there since. In April 2010, Moody’s classified the town’s bond rating as A1, the top of that classification, where it remains. But is that the highest in its history? Checking back in Moody’s records, David Jacobson, a Moody’s spokesman, said Cumberland had an A rating in 1996, but that was before the firm added the three numbers to each letter grade. He said a direct comparison to a 2004 rating would not be exactly apples-to-apples. He said that was also the case with the Cumberland’s April 2010 upgrade to A1. It was because of an adjustment of the standards, not a change in Cumberland’s finances, he said. Our ruling Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee said the town has "its highest bond rating in history." We found that, as far back as comparable statistics can be found -- about 17 years -- he’s right. The facts also support his claim that the bond rating improved five points under his administration. In addition to the Moody’s A1 rating in May, the city got an AA- rating from Standard and Poors in August. McKee said that during his 30 years in local government, he has no memory of the town ever getting an AA- rating from that service. But Cumberland has been a town for 267 years. It’s possible that at some point in that history, the town had a credit rating that, by some contemporary measure, was higher than its current rating. McKee cited evidence going back a few decades, not for two centuries of history. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05940	"The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/27/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-us-gun-homicide-rate-20-times-h/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran marked the first anniversary of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona with a call for more gun control. "The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations," Moran, D-8th, wrote in a Jan. 10 column that ran in the Falls Church News-Press. That statistic caught our eye. We wondered if Moran is right. A Moran spokeswoman told us the congressman’s claim is based on a study of the homicide rates of wealthy nations in 2003, conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health. The report, published in 2010, uses data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide, gun-related suicide and unintentional and undetermined gun deaths for all ages and both sexes. Vital statistics from the U.S. were compared to those from 22 other high-income countries with populations over 1 million people that reported causes of mortality to WHO for 2003. Researchers relied on The World Bank’s definition of a high income nation, which included countries that had a gross national income per capita of $12,276 or more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. In addition to the U.S., the study included Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and United Kingdom (Scotland). Researchers determined that the rate of homicides with guns in the U.S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people; the same rate combining the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 in 2003. The rate of homicides using guns in the U.S. was 19.5 times the rate of the other countries. Moran, rounding up, correctly repeated that factoid. We decided to see if there were more recent numbers than 2003. U.N. and national statistics for those same countries showed the gap closed. The most recent data, mostly from 2009, shows a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 in the 22 other countries used in the firearm fatality study. The U.S., with its decrease, had a rate around 15 times those of other countries. Next, we moved away from numbers for a second and examined the terminology Moran used in his column. It is imprecise. The congressman wrote that the U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher "than other western nations." But in fact, he was comparing them to them a selective group of wealthy nations. And not all them -- such as Japan -- are typically considered a "western nation." The term "western nation" is not listed in Webster’s New World College Dictionary and we found a range of definitions online. Most commonly, the term is used to describe countries where Western Europeans have settled or have influence. We tried to come up with a list of such nations and settled on the 28 countries that are NATO members. The most recent gun-related homicide rate for the U.S. was 3.0 per 100,000 compared to an 0.3 for the rest of the NATO nations. The U.S. rate was 10 times higher. Our ruling: Moran, calling for stronger gun regulations, wrote "The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations." Moran used the right number from a report based on 2003 data. But the researchers did not claim to analyze "western nations," they compared gun homicide rates in 23 "populous, high income" countries, including Japan. If you compare the most recent data on the same group of nations, mostly based on 2009 statistics, the U.S. gun homicide rate is 15 times higher than the other countries. The number fell to 10 times as high when we defined the inexact term of "western nations" as countries belonging to NATO. So Moran’s figures are outdated and on the high side. His terminology is loose. But his point -- that gun homicide rates in the U.S. tower over those of other wealthy European nations -- holds up. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-12061	"We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/06/rick-santorum/has-legal-immigration-hit-record-high-rick-santoru/	In a discussion over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, prior to President Donald Trump’s announcement to repeal it, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said immigration laws should be vigorously enforced. That’s because legal immigration has hit a record high. "We have record levels of legal immigration… We have over a million people a year, more than at any time in the history of this country," Santorum said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 3, 2017. "We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country." Are more immigrants coming into the United States legally than at any other time in history, and are they on track to outnumber previous immigrant populations? The number of annual legal immigrants has been higher in the past. But Santorum has a point that the United States is on pace to surpass general immigration proportions (although it’s not there yet). Annual legal immigration A total of 1,051,031 persons were granted lawful immigration status in 2015, the latest year recorded by the Homeland Security Department. Over half of those were already living in the United States. That encompasses those who received a green card, were admitted as temporary nonimmigrants, were granted asylum or refugee status, or are naturalized. That is over a million, as Santorum said, but it’s not the highest it’s ever been. There were 1,090,172 legal immigrants granted status in 1989; 1,535,872 in 1990; and 1,826,595 in 1991. Between 2001 and 2014, there were 11 years in which lawful immigrants also surpassed 1 million, eight of which surpassed the 2015 rate. And it’s not a recent phenomenon. Between 1905 and 1914, there were six years in which legal immigration surpassed 1 million. Four of those had higher immigration rates than 2015. And that’s significant because it was a much larger percentage of the population compared to today. Immigration law largely explains the trends above. The lack of numerical restrictions on entry before 1924 (except for Chinese immigrants) meant that nearly every immigrant was legal, making the early numbers more representative than the current ones (as illegal immigration is unaccounted for in the chart). It also meant fewer deportations than today. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants, reflected in the spike between 1989 and 1991. And more recent spikes are explained by the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, the Real ID Act, and backlog reductions at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. If Santorum had been talking about both illegal and legal immigrants combined, the number of annual immigrants would be slightly higher today, but still not a record. The Census Bureau found that nearly 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants had arrived in the United States in 2014, but 1.66 million arrived in 2000. The total 2015 number isn’t yet available, but it was projected to reach 1.6 million. Largest percentage of immigrants? On the overall number of immigrants, Santorum is correct. The Census Bureau estimates there are 43.3 million foreign-born people in the United States, which beats all previous records. Pew Research Center places that number at 45 million. But the overall population of the United States has more than tripled from 1900 to 2000, which means we should also look at percentages of the population. The immigrant share of the U.S. population was 13.5 percent in 2015. That still doesn’t surpass the record high immigrant shares in 1910, 1890 and 1870, which were 14.7 percent, 14.8 percent and 14.4 percent respectively. Data collection began in 1850. The percentage of the overall population that was foreign born was only a little higher back then (while the absolute number of immigrants was high) because proportionally, more people went back home and immigrants, like citizens, suffered a higher death rate than today. As Santorum said, we are on track to beat the record. The Center for Immigration Studies projects the United States will surpass the 14.8 percent marker in 2023, driven largely by legal immigration. Pew projects the fast-growing immigrant population will push the share of the foreign-born U.S. population to a record of 18 percent in 2065. When asked if recent changes in immigration policy could alter those projections, Center for Immigration Studies director Steven Camarota said they likely wouldn’t, as the immigrant percentage of the population has never grown as exponentially as it has since 1970 (from 4.7 to 13.5 percent). Columbia University immigration historian Mae Ngai said we should be wary of population trend predictions to begin with, as they are based on assumptions that don’t always hold true. Our ruling Santorum said, "We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country." While we do have over 1 million annual legal immigrants, it’s been surpassed multiple times in both recent years and at the turn of the twentieth century. We are still a few years away from exceeding the record from last century of the share of immigrant population, and that’s based on projections. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-12489	"Sarah Palin in a coma after hit and run."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/01/blog-posting/reports-sarah-palin-coma-after-hit-and-run-acciden/	A fake report spread on the eve of President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was in a coma after a car accident. "Sarah Palin in a coma after hit and run," read the headline on an April 28, 2017, post. We first saw it on FreedomCrossroads.us, a website registered in Maine. But the post appeared on several other websites across the Internet without being attributed to an original source. Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to clear out fake news from user news feeds. The fake story said that Palin had been driving on the Pacific Coast Highway (with no state given) that morning when she was run off the road by another, unspecified vehicle. The post said her SUV rolled several times and stopped in a drainage ditch. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The image used to illustrate the rollover was actually of a fatal 2015 accident in Mississippi. Palin was "currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh," according to the post. Authorities were searching for the other vehicle, which was caught on camera, the article said. The FBI had reportedly been dispatched, too. Palin had been tweeting right before noon and even later in the day, and posts kept appearing both on her Twitter and Facebook accounts through the weekend. We attempted to reach her office through her website, SarahPalin.com, and by email, but received no response. There was no coverage by any legitimate media outlet of an accident involving Palin, which you’d figure would be spotlighted on cable news. The sensational nature of the story, misappropriated photo and lack of specifics made it obvious this was fake news. But the Internet wasn’t done, because a follow-up post appeared on April 30. That story again was shared on multiple websites, including FreedomCrossroads.us. It said Palin had woken up and was able to identify who ran her off the road. That story said the California Highway Patrol traced a license plate back to a car rented with a fake ID, with video from a security camera at rental company in Silicon Valley. The post described a white man in his 30s. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Several websites used the same image, but it was actually of a robbery suspect at an Oklahoma hotel in 2012. But since the first story didn’t happen, the second one didn’t, either. The only wide coverage Palin had received as of late was a well-publicized visit to the White House on April 19. There’s zero proof this happened, despite what fake news websites said. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-07487	On federal stimulus money for expanding rail service.	no flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/13/scott-walker/Twists-and-turns-but-no-flip-on-central-funding-qu/	(Editor’s note: PolitiFact has a policy of correcting errors of fact and, when appropriate, reviewing conclusions we have reached based on relevant and persuasive new information. After this item ran April 13, 2011, aides to Gov. Scott Walker asked us to reconsider our original ruling of a Half Flip, specifically as it relates to Walker’s statements on the use of stimulus money for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link. We asked editors who were not part of the original ruling panel to review the item. Based on their view and additional discussion we have decided a rating of No Flip is warranted. This item has been rewritten to fit that ruling.) When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced March 29, 2011, he would seek federal funding for upgrades to Amtrak’s Hiawatha train service between Chicago and Milwaukee, it stirred plenty of attention. After all, Walker was asking the feds for a portion of the same $810 million in stimulus money for a Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed rail link he campaigned against, and then refused. And some of the money for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee upgrades was included in the earlier grant. The Hiawatha makes seven round trips a day between Milwaukee and Chicago and has seen steadily increasing ridership, with 741,000 passengers in 2010. Wisconsin is seeking $150 million to buy two additional train sets and eight locomotives as part of the upgrades. Among others, Milwaukee Ald. Bob Bauman, a supporter of the original grant, criticized Walker for seeking the new money, calling the move "rank hypocrisy." So, did Walker change his tune on trains? Time for a visit to the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Here’s our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter doesn’t measure whether any change in position was good policy -- or good politics. It just looks at whether a politician has been consistent along the way. In this case, we are focusing on the statements that relate to the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link and the use of stimulus money for it. Walker intertwined the two when he announced the application. As with the Madison-to-Milwaukee link, the stimulus money is for high-speed rail service, though the upgrades that have been discussed would not bring to that status until years from now. To be sure, there are numerous ironies involved in the hotly debated issue, from Walker’s past criticism of the federal stimulus program in general to now seeking some of the money he once rejected. What’s more, a portion of the federal money Walker is now seeking would be used to build a maintenance facility in Milwaukee at the Talgo factory in Milwaukee. Talgo is the company that had a contract to build the trains that would run between Milwaukee and Madison -- a contract Walker criticized in 2010 as a gubernatorial candidate. After the federal government yanked funding for the Milwaukee-to-Madison project because of Walker’s opposition, Talgo said it would complete work already under way and then move production work out of Milwaukee. Now, the Talgo factory is a key part of Walker’s plan. The new state application includes $50 million to $60 million for the maintenance facility. That’s up from $30 million that the state previously agreed to spend on the facility. Walker says spending more on the maintenance facility will save state taxpayers $20 million. Here’s the reasoning: The state’s existing contract with Talgo committed the state to spending at least $30 million on a maintenance base. That was to have been located in Madison, as part of the now-dead train service. The new application calls for a bigger facility at the Talgo plant in Milwaukee. Walker wants the feds to pay at least 80 percent, or $48 million, toward the base. The state would pay $10 million to $12 million. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said that means taxpayers are saving between $18 million and $20 million, because if the state does nothing, it’s already on the hook for $30 million under the previous deal with Talgo. Of course, Wisconsin residents who pay federal taxes would still be doing their part to foot the bill. Let’s return to the core question: With the new application, did Walker switch tracks? Walker certainly didn’t want to extend the service to Madison. But he and virtually everyone else -- including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and the business community -- likes the Milwaukee-to-Chicago service. Here are a couple of examples of what Walker said about that train: In September 2010, he told the Journal Sentinel: "I will continue state support for the Hiawatha, but believe the state simply cannot afford to take on additional maintenance costs for new rail lines." In November 2010, Walker he reiterated that point, saying in an interview with Mike Gousha of WISN-TV he backed continued state support for the Hiawatha. He also said he’d prefer spending the rejected train money for highways but added he and his staff "looked at options relative to rail," and mentioned the Milwaukee-to-Chicago line. Indeed, in his news release announcing the application, Walker framed the new application as a money saver -- in contrast to his view the Milwaukee-to-Madison extension was a money loser for the state, which would have had to pay an ongoing subsidy. So, there’s nothing inconsistent on this part of the question. But what about the use of federal stimulus money? In February 2009, Walker was critical of the stimulus program in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, saying: "As popular as the federal ‘stimulus’ package is with Washington politicians, it is more popular among state and local politicians who view federal money as a cure for their fiscal woes." In the piece, Walker -- then Milwaukee County executive -- said he would refuse to make a list of projects he would seek to fund with stimulus cash. In an earlier opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker pushed some of the same themes, but said infrastructure projects "may be worth considering" if several criteria -- such as no local match requirement -- were met. Those statements both came in early 2009 -- a year before the state’s application for high-speed train money was awarded. In the context of that debate, in at least one spot -- the interview with Gousha -- Walker talked about the possibility of using the rejected money for the Milwaukee-to-Chicago line. So, while Walker took a stance broadly against the stimulus program -- and scored some political points for doing so -- he also left himself some wiggle room, specifically when it came to the $810 million high-speed rail grant that started this whole debate. That may be shrewd politics. But that doesn’t make it inconsistent. Indeed, he had not ruled out any use of stimulus money and was on the record as supporting using it for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link before the new application was announced. We rate this No Flip.

pomt-07632	Says his bill, HB 97, would prevent the use of taxpayer dollars on abortions.	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-health-care-bill/	State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, has brought back a provision of a bill vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that would prohibit the use of federal or state funding to provide abortion coverage. And with the bill, he's restating a common and complicated misconception about the federal health care law -- that the bill signed into law by President Barack Obama includes taxpayer-funding for abortions. Speaking to a House subcommittee on March 16, 2011, Gaetz explained that part of the rationale behind HB 97 was to keep the government out of the business of funding elective abortions. "I am admittedly pro-life," he said. "But I would think that even for those who are pro-choice, this (elective abortions) would not be the most appropriate use of public funds." That's not exactly how it works, though. Abortion in the health care law The federal health care law -- if it withstands court challenges -- will create state-run health insurance exchanges in which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of purchasing a plan in the exchange -- a group of about 19 million people, the government estimates. The subsidy for their coverage would go directly from the government to the insurer, and look like a discount to the policy holder. How abortion would be handled as part of the health care law predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's very passage, and several alternatives were considered. To pass, the health care bill had to appease anti-abortion conservative Democrats. The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allows insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But with a big caveat. Nelson's provision specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account. On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose. That's what Gaetz's HB 97 attempts to do. Section 1 of Gaetz's bill states, "A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion... A policy is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied." The language is identical to a provision inserted into HB 1143, which also would have required most women to have an ultrasound performed before having an abortion. That bill was vetoed by Crist. The rhetoric on this issue can be tricky. The federal law allows tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chooses a plan that covers abortion. So it would certainly be fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be given tax subsidies, and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion services. (But then the law says that states can opt out from that). But it's not fair to say that taxpayers are paying for elective abortions. Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion. During the March 16 hearing on Gaetz's bill, Rep. Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, said the bill was unnecessary because "there is no public funding of abortion right now." Berman offered an amendment to keep abortion services a part of at least one plan created by the exchange, but the amendment failed. In an interview later, Gaetz said his bill is attempting to close a loophole that could allow taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion coverage. He noted that policy holders still would have the ability to purchase optional, additional coverage for abortions. Our ruling Abortion foes like Gaetz argue the federal rules are little more than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion. But we think it's misleading to call it taxpayer-funded abortion when the law requires abortions be paid solely through a portion of the premiums (not tax dollars) paid by people who choose a plan that covers abortions. We rule Gaetz's statement False.	None	Matt Gaetz	None	None	None	2011-03-17T16:33:20	2011-03-16	['None']
pomt-15305	Georgia has more than 700 law enforcement agencies, and fewer than 20 percent of them are state-certified.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/21/police-chief-billy-grogan/dunwoody-target-claim-about-police-department-cert/	The 6-year-old Dunwoody Police Department was recognized July 13 for achieving state certification. Billy Grogan, Dunwoody’s police chief, said the certification validates that his department’s standards are in line with national best practices. "Members of the Dunwoody Police Department have faithfully served Dunwoody for over six years, and I hope this achievement will instill even greater public confidence in our agency and staff," Grogan said in a press release issued July 14. "There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia, and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status," the release said. That statistic caught our eye. Georgia is second in the nation only to Texas in the number of counties, with 159. All those counties have sheriffs and sheriff’s departments. At least a dozen mostly metro counties also have county police forces. Scattered throughout those counties, according to the Georgia Municipal Association, are 538 cities of varying sizes, 352 with police chiefs. That doesn’t count the host of state law enforcement agencies, including the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and State Patrol. With all those law enforcement agencies in Georgia, could fewer than 20 percent be state-certified? We decided to do a little investigating. First, some background about the voluntary, 18-month to two-year process of becoming state-certified. The process begins with the agency undertaking a self-assessment. The department then goes through the time-consuming process of ensuring that all its policies and procedures conform with state laws and follow best practices in eight key areas. These include training, personnel, evidence, warrants, victims and witnesses, said Mark Bender, the director of state certification for the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police. Before a department is awarded state certification, an independent team of assessors, typically from another law enforcement agency, makes an onsite visit to determine whether the department’s officers and staff are adhering to those policies and procedures, Bender said. State certification is good for three years and renewable after a re-evaluation. Costs are about $650 for the initial certification, $375 a year for each subsequent year, Bender said. Officers in a state-certified department can take pride in knowing they’ve set high standards of professionalism for themselves and have voluntarily agreed to be reviewed every three years to see that they’re living up to those standards, he said. The state recognition can increase a community’s respect and support for a department, Bender said. The department also can benefit financially: A 20 percent discount is offered on premiums for state-certified police departments if their cities are part of the GMA’s property and liability insurance pool. Fifty-five agencies are currently receiving the discount for a combined savings of $261,000, said Amy Henderson, a GMA spokeswoman. The first state certification was issued in 1997, and 118 law enforcement agencies are currently state-certified through the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, Bender said. They include city police departments, sheriff’s departments, county police departments, campus police departments, the GBI and the Georgia World Congress Center. The Atlanta Police Department and Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett county police departments are all state-certified. Frank V. Rotondo, the executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, said the reasons vary why local law enforcement agencies don’t pursue state certification. The process requires going "through a lot of extra hoops, and some don’t want to do it," Rotondo said. "Some don’t have the extra money to do what’s required." For instance, he said, a state-certified police department is expected to maintain a statistical evaluation to justify its traffic enforcement efforts, and some are too small to take on this extra work. "We wouldn’t want 100 percent," Rotondo said. State-certified agencies should be "better than most," he said. So what about the specific claim that out of 700 law enforcement agencies in the state, fewer than 20 percent are state-certified? That statement is based largely on an often-repeated statistic from the police chiefs association that indicates there are about 700 law enforcement agencies in the state. Rotondo told us that’s an estimate. An exact count would be difficult, he said. For instance, one small city police force in Middle Georgia is currently looking at dissolving and allowing the county sheriff’s office to take over, Rotondo said. The Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council gave PolitiFact data showing the state has 1,178 law enforcement agencies and 58,413 law enforcement personnel. But Rotondo said many of those agencies do not qualify for state certification. He suggested we stick to the 700 estimate. When we do, we come up with roughly 17 percent (or 118) are state-certified. Our ruling The Dunwoody Police Department recently was recognized for becoming state certified. The city press release said: There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status. But the bar also has to be high here. Claims need to be based on data or disclose, as in this case, that they are based, in part, on estimates. That’s missing context. We rate the statement Mostly True.
