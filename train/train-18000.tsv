pomt-06268	"Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/27/new-jersey-tea-party/new-jersey-tea-party-blames-barack-obama-unemploym/	Black and recently unemployed? Blame President Barack Obama, says the New Jersey Tea Party. "Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs," the Tea Party retweeted to its followers on Sept. 2. The original tweet came from Ken Gardner, a junior fellow for The Right Sphere, a conservative website, and was retweeted by Jeff M. Weingarten, president of Morristown Tea Party Organization. Pinning a race’s employment status solely on the president of the United States seemed rather strong so PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statement. Turns out the unemployment statistic in the tweet is accurate, but blaming the president is less clear. First, let’s break down the different elements of the statement. The number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, DC. The number of employed whites for the same time frame dropped by 2.15 million. But that doesn’t matter, Weingarten said in a phone interview, because the percentage of unemployed blacks is disproportionately higher than that of whites, which has a larger population. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks, but doesn’t blame Obama, said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy. Both Shelton and the U.S. Department of Labor noted that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help blacks get more jobs. But Weingarten said other issues need to be addressed. He said Obama "is squarely to blame" for the employment decrease among blacks because of programs such as "Obamacare" and unwillingness by corporations to spend money in a still-shaky economy. "When you are the commander in chief and leader of the country, you are the one that promulgates and sees to it that policies are enacted or not," Weingarten said. Issues critical to the black community, including jobs, has always been on Obama’s radar, according to a recent Associated Press article. Appearing at a daylong White House summit of black business, community and political leaders on Nov. 9, Obama said the current 15.1 percent unemployment rate among blacks is "way too high," and that other problems that plagued black communities before he took office, such as housing and education, have worsened. The White House also disputed arguments that Obama has not targeted problems faced by blacks, according to the article. "Since day one, the president has fought for the policies that matter to the African-American community," White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said. Shelton said Obama has attempted to address unemployment for all races but a number of bills have stalled or failed in Congress, or couldn’t get committee hearings. Given that, blaming the president seems disingenuous, Shelton said. "It’s almost like someone deciding to knock you down and then blame you for falling," he said. But blame can be placed on Obama, said Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives. "Does Obama represent the government of the United States? If he represents the government of the United States then the answer is yes, unequivocally so, disgracefully and shamefully so, but not because he’s black," Massie said. "He is a poor example of leadership, and his profound ignorance of what it takes to rally an economy and his even more vacuous understanding of free-market enterprise and how it contributes to the creation of jobs." Our ruling The Tea Party blames Obama for an additional half million blacks being unemployed since he took office. The group’s number of 540,000 unemployed is correct, and the NAACP concurs that blacks are among Obama’s biggest supporters. We heard varying opinions on whether the president is to blame for that job loss and it’s clear there are a variety of factors at work -- some under the president’s jurisdiction, some not. Partially accurate claims that leave out important details fits the definition of our ruling: Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11187	"BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/17/true-american/ohio-opioid-crisis-real-headline-misleading/	An alarming headline stated there was a sudden massive death wave in Ohio, but the facts show there was no one-day wipeout. "BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio," said the May 13 headline on True American, a website with a lot of clickbait headlines. The story is a ripoff of the same misleading stories that appeared in June 2017 on multiple websites. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline could lead viewers to believe there was a sudden one-day death toll in Ohio, but the story actually refers to ongoing deaths from opioids in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located. "The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in," the story stated. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But later in the story, it said that the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner confirmed that 60 people died in February "from the same alarming cause." The story quoted a news report by FOX - 8 WJW (Cleveland, Ohio) about the overdose deaths. While the True American story has a May 2018 dateline, the TV report was from March 2017 and refers to February 2017 data released by the medical examiner. The TV station reported that "at least 60 died from heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two, bringing this year's total to 109." The report said that the number could rise as toxicology results were received in additional cases, but the 60 deaths outpaced the previous one-month record of 57 drug fatalities in September 2016. The data came from information released by the medical examiner to the media. Christopher Harris, a spokesman for the medical examiner, told PolitiFact that the final number for February 2017 for opioid-related deaths was 65. For all of 2017, there were 727 total drug deaths; 553 opioid related. In 2018 so far, there have been at least 137 suspected opioid related deaths: Ohio is one of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Our ruling A headline said, "BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio." The scare-tactic headline creates a false impression that something catastrophic happened to cause 60 people to suddenly drop dead. In reality, the Cuyahoga Medical Examiner initially found that 60 died from overdoses in February 2017, and later reported the final number was 65. So the number is also incomplete and outdated.

pomt-13869	"The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/06/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-average-holding-time-stocks-has-f/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner joined the ranks of Wall Street critics during a recent radio interview, by complaining that investors increasingly are focused on reaping quick profits from companies at the expense of long-term value. "The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months," he said during an interview on "Cat’s Roundtable," a New York City radio talk show hosted by John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman. We wondered whether Warner, D-Va., is right about the plunge in share-holding time. Warner’s office sent us a variety of articles by academics, investment strategists, newspapers and magazines that contained similar statistics to the ones cited by the senator. The source of the historic data is the New York Stock Exchange which, for most of the 20th century, was the dominant U.S. stock-trading venue. Here’s the NYSE’s average holding period for stocks at the start of each new decade, beginning at Warner’s mark in 1960: •1960, eight years, four months; •1970, five years, three months; •1980, two years, nine months; •1990, two years, two months; and •2000, one year, two months. But many new trading venues have opened and expanded in recent decades - E*Trade and NASDAQ, for example - and the New York Stock Exchange’s dominance has diminished. About 25 percent of all U.S. trading now occurs on the NYSE, which has high financial requirements for the companies it lists and generally deals with large, stable stocks. In 2004, the NYSE changed its formula for calculating average share-holding periods to focus on its own listings. Credit Suisse that year began computing share-holding data that reflect the broader U.S. stock market. Credit Suisse figures show that in 2008 and 2009, when the nation was mired in the Great Recession, shares turned over an average almost five times a year. That’s slowed to about three times a year since 2013 or, as Warner put it, once every four months. The World Bank offers more conservative figures, saying U.S. shares, on average, turned over four times a year during the Great Recession and that slowed to 1.65 times a year in 2015 - or about once every eight months. Stock market analysts and academics note a variety of reasons for the quickening turnover of shares. Many say the days of small ma-and-pa investors have given way to an era of mutual funds and hedge funds that exert strong pressure of companies to produce short-term profits. The growth of e-trading also is cited; so are federal laws passed in 1993 that tied the bonuses of executives to their achievement of measurable performance goals in order for the bonuses to be tax-deductible for their companies. Warner said the consequence of "activist investors" is that corporations pay less attention to training workers and to research and development. He said Congress should explore offering tax incentives to companies that embrace those long-range goals. Many activist investors, to the contrary, say their actions have been beneficial and note that the stock market has continued to rise over the decades. Our ruling Warner said, "The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months." The gist of Warner’s statement is undeniable: The average holding period for stocks has eroded greatly during the past 56 years. The specifics of Warner’s statement, however, need a little elaboration. Estimates by Credit Suisse jibe with Warner’s claim that shares, on average, now are held for four months. The World Bank estimates the holding period now is about eight months. So we rate Warner’s statement Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2825f4d2-7663-4da5-8b09-70db1503d5e3	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2016-07-06T00:00:00	2016-06-19	['None']
pomt-09860	Seniors and the disabled "will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/10/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-barack-obama-death-panel/	Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, urged her supporters to oppose Democratic plans for health care reform on her Facebook page. "As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and we’re saying not just no, but hell no!" wrote Palin in a note posted Aug. 7, 2009. She said that the Democrats plan to reduce health care costs by simply refusing to pay for care. "And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil." We agree with Palin that such a system would be evil. But it's definitely not what President Barack Obama or any other Democrat has proposed. We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's "level of productivity in society" to determine whether they are "worthy" of health care. Palin's claim sounds a little like another statement making the rounds, which says that health care reform would mandate counseling for seniors on how to end their lives sooner. We rated this claim Pants on Fire ! The truth is that the health bill allows Medicare, for the first time, to pay for doctors' appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues with their physicians. These types of appointments are completely optional, and AARP supports the measure. Palin also may have also jumped to conclusions about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for "worthiness." Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others. The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall "conduct, support, and synthesize research" that looks at "outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically." The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research. Obama has said he believes a comparative effectiveness commission should advise health care workers, not require them to follow certain treatments. "I actually think that most doctors want to do right by their patients. And if they’ve got good information, I think they will act on that good information," Obama said during an interview with the New York Times on April 28, 2009. He also specifically addressed end-of-life care for seniors, discussing the last week of his grandmother's life in 2008, and how her family and doctors decided on treatment for her. "It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels," Obama said. "And that's part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance. And that's part of what I suspect you'll see emerging out of the various health care conversations that are taking place on the Hill right now." And in fact, the House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission, "Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select. Palin's statement seems extreme, but other Republicans, like Newt Gingrich, are backing her up. "You're asking us to trust turning power over to the government, when there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards," Gingrich said in an interview on This Week with George Stephanopolous on Aug. 9, 2009. We've looked at the inflammatory claims that the health care bill encourages euthanasia. It doesn't. There's certainly no "death board" that determines the worthiness of individuals to receive care. Conservatives might make a case that Palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day morph into such a board. But that's not what Palin said. She said that the Democratic plan will ration care and "my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." Palin's statement sounds more like a science fiction movie ( Soylent Green , anyone?) than part of an actual bill before Congress. We rate her statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-07647	In fighting collective bargaining changes, Democrats are trying to "protect a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/15/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-unionized-government-workers-a/	Republicans fighting the opinion battle over their push to weaken government unions often have sought to contrast the compensation of public-sector workers with that of America’s private workforce. Now they are spotlighting public vs. public. As in unionized government workers vs. non-union ones. In a $750,000 national cable TV ad blitz, Crossroads GPS, a conservative issues advocacy group affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove, portrays government unions as self-serving bullies collecting mandatory dues to influence liberals such as President Barack Obama. Against a backdrop of newspaper headlines on the Wisconsin fight over union rights, the 60-second ad asks why Democrats are "shutting down state capitols" with protests. The ad’s answer: "to protect a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers." That’s an eye-popping number. As the intense protests continue over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s successful push to limit collective bargaining in the public sector, we decided to check it out. For support for the number, Crossroads GPS spokesman Jonathan Collegio cited a Cato Institute bulletin from March 2010. The bulletin from Cato, a libertarian think tank, explicitly calls on states to ban collective bargaining in the public sector. "Collective bargaining is a misguided labor policy because it violates civil liberties and gives unions excessive power to block needed reforms," Chris Edwards, the institute’s director of tax policy studies, wrote in the bulletin. That quote leaves no doubt about where Edwards is coming from. Let’s turn to some of his numbers. He presents 2009 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and concludes that "unionized public sector workers have much higher average wages and benefits than non-unionized public sector workers." Specifically, Edwards wrote that union members have a 31 percent advantage in wages and a 68 percent advantage in benefits. An accompanying table of statistics combines the wage and benefits advantage into one number: total compensation. Total compensation is 42 percent higher for the union workers, Edwards concluded. The same figure -- 42 percent -- is cited in the Crossroads ad. Case closed? Not exactly. As Collegio, the spokesman for the group, notes, the ad pulls a hard number directly from the study. But there are some problems. First, the ad says the system "pays" union workers a 42 percent premium. It makes no mention of benefits, even though the Cato report combines the two to get the 42 percent gap. That confuses the comparison right from the start. That point -- "pay" vs. "total compensation" -- didn’t bother Edwards. But the use of the 42 percent number did. It troubles us, too. Edwards says the number is taken out of context and the more accurate total compensation gap is lower, perhaps by a considerable amount. Let’s home in on part of the equation, wages. The study showed a 31 percent gap favoring union members by that measure. But that number, based on raw government data, has not been adjusted to make the comparison across states more valid. Edwards noted the study concludes that part of the union-nonunion gap stems from general labor market variations across states. "States with generally higher wages tend to be more unionized," the study says. "Analyses that hold constant such cross-state differences find that public-sector unions increase average pay levels by roughly 10 percent." That’s a far cry from 31 percent. And the 31 percent was critical in arriving at the 42 percent. How far off is the 42 percent figure? Edwards said it’s impossible to say. While wages have been studied effectively, he said, studies on benefits are rare, partly because benefits vary so much from place to place. We found another study by a libertarian think tank that supports Edwards’ contention that a much lower wage number is more accurate. The Freedom Foundation, based in Washington state, published a study in 2010 that put the gap at 11 percent to 12 percent for state and local government workers, union vs. non-union. Freedom Foundation, which supports Walker’s union move in a petition drive on its website, compared comparable employees, and controlled for state effects, demographics, experience, education, marital status and occupation. Meanwhile, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers found an even smaller wage gap of about 5 percent. Economists Keith Bender and John Heywood collaborated on an April 2010 study on compensation. Bender, a public sector labor expert, told us that a large body of research has put the figure around 5 percent. So, whatever the true figure, it would substantially reduce the 42 percent used in the ad. Let’s take a final look at a related point. Edwards also took issue with wording in the ad that might lead some viewers to think that the ad is comparing government workers to private employees -- not public union workers with public non-union workers. Let’s take a look back at the ad’s language (italics added): "a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers." Would some readers or listeners think Edwards is comparing public to private because the ad fails to modify that second "workers" with the prefix "government?" We suppose they could -- and critics have said it could be a tactic to pit private workers against government workers. But the entire context of the ad is public sector. Let’s review. Crossroads GPS, a conservative group seeking to illustrate the cost of public sector unions says unionized government workers are paid 42 percent more than non-union workers. The study it cites for backup does contain that figure, but the number is misleading because it is not adjusted for important differences between states. Even the author of the study makes this point. There is a gap of some size. So, the ad contains an element of truth in highlighting a pay gap, but uses an inflated number. That rates a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03170	Says every day of a special session costs taxpayers $40,000.	false	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/05/sal-esquivel/do-special-sessions-set-oregon-back-40000-each-day/	While Gov. John Kitzhaber has been considering whether he’ll call the Oregon Legislature back for a special session to look at further cuts to government pensions, some lawmakers are making their opinions known. Rep. Sal Esquivel, a Medford Republican, thinks a special session is a bad idea and wrote an opinion piece about it, which appeared in The Mail Tribune, a paper in southern Oregon. "This sounds like a good idea and an admirable goal on the surface, but it also raises any number of questions," he wrote. "The most important is obvious — why wasn’t this done during the five-month legislative session that we just adjourned?" Esquivel lists a number of arguments, but one caught our attention straight away: "Every day of a legislative session costs Oregon taxpayers $40,000. That includes paying staff, as well as per diem for legislators. And given the governor’s historically poor track record when it comes to special sessions, that is probably not the best use of our limited resources." We vaguely remembered the last special session, when lawmakers convened to give Nike a tax break, but we didn’t remember the bill being so high, so we decided to check it out. First we looked through some of The Oregonian’s articles about the late 2012 special session to see what we’d reported as the cost as then. According to politics reporter Christian Gaston, the per-day cost (and it only lasted a day) of that session was $13,000. That’s a long way from what Esquivel quoted. We shot Esquivel a quick email to see if he could point us toward his sources. The price, he said through a staffer, had come from the "Legislative Finance Office." We checked in with Sandra Rierson, the manager of the Financial Services department, who explained that the price depends on the kind of session you’re talking about. The cost per day of the longer regular sessions comes in at $34,901 a day but a special session is considerably less expensive at $13,000. Both numbers do not include the basic costs of keeping the Capitol running, which would get spent with or without lawmakers in the building. So why the difference? Given the short time frame of a special session, there aren’t nearly as many hires. "We try to use existing staff as much as possible," Rierson said. We called Esquivel to get his response. He said he based the statement on numbers he’d been given years ago. "I was told in the past by LFO that it was $36,000 per day and that was (six) years ago. I am assuming that that number did in fact go up so I concluded $40,000." The figure we received, however, was the most recent average-per-day cost available from the finance department so we’re sticking with it. In an opinion piece arguing against a possible special legislative session, Esquivel said a legislative session costs $40,000 a day. In fact, it’s closer to $35,000, and that’s for regular legislative sessions. Esquivel, however, was making the argument against a special session. The cost per day for that comes in at a much lower $13,000. Because his opinion piece addresses special sessions in particular, there is no truth to his statement -- not to mention the fact that he didn’t use current numbers for regular sessions.

pomt-03617	Employees in "workplace freedom" states make more money	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/may/07/ron-maag/state-rep-ron-maag-says-employees-earn-more-money-/	Only hours after two Statehouse Republicans unveiled legislation to make Ohio a "right-to-work" state, GOP leadership shot it downas a distraction lacking support. "We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery," Senate President Keith Faber said in a statement, "and right-to-work legislation is not on that list." But the legislation's co-sponsors, Rep. Kristina Roegner of Hudson and Rep. Ron Maag of Lebanon, depicted their proposals as a matter of "workplace freedom" that would attract jobs. And contrary to a frequent argument of opponents, Maag asserted that workersin so-called right-to-work states make more money. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how that claim is backed up. Maag's staff pointed us to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a "free market" think tank based in Midland, Mich., that strongly supports right-to-work laws. Its "Michigan Worker Freedom" website says: "Workers in right-to-work states make more. When adjusting for cost of living, workers in right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than workers in non-right-to-work states." The source for that is a posting by James M. Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center. He writes that he calculated the adjusted per-capita personal income using a state-by-state cost of living index, and converted personal income figures for all 50 states to the value of Michigan dollars. "Right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than non-right-to-work states," Hohman says. That conclusion is not widely held, however, even though the evidence is at best mixed on the effect that right-to-work laws have on paychecks and local economies. Noting that it is difficult to isolate the impact of a single policy, two economists for the generally pro-union Economic Policy Institute conducted an analysisof right-to-work laws using a regression model that controlled for more than 40 factors in addition to the cost of living in different states. Their analysis found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than those elsewhere -- for everyone, not just union members. They concluded that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less per year than a similar worker elsewhere. In states with a right-to-work law, the Wall Street Journal reportedlast December, "wages tend to be lower, but job growth stronger, than states that don't have the law. But gauging how much of this divergence in paychecks and employment is a result of the laws is difficult to do." The Journal said that employees in right-to-work states earned 9.8 percent less than workers in states without such laws, according to an analysis of Labor Department data that did not include health-care and other benefits -- "but proving cause and effect on wages is difficult, since many factors influence what workers are paid in a given locale, such as whether the mix of businesses are concentrated in higher-paying industries." The meticulously nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a studylast December examining right-to-work laws. Using data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, it found that wages in what it called "union security states" were 16.6 percent higher than in right-to-work states. Among CRS's conclusions: "Wages are lower in right-to-work states than union security states" -- and that "historical research has suggested that right-to-work laws have little influence on these differences." Where does that leave Maag’s statement? Some economists who support right-to-work laws say wages are comparable or higher in right-to-work states when cost-of-living differences are taken into account. And Maag correctly cited that research. But federal data from a nonpartisan government research arm shows that employees in right-to-work states earn less. So does another analysis that tries to hold other things equal. None of it shows a definitive relationship between right-to-work laws and economic outcomes, even though (as the Wall Street Journal noted) the laws were first adopted in the South as part of a larger drive to lure factory jobs from the heavily unionized and better paying North. Maag’s statement, like others we have seen surrounding the highly charged right-to-work issue, suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that is not supported by any evidence. We rate the statement as Mostly False.	None	Ron Maag	None	None	None	2013-05-07T18:47:38	2013-05-01	['None']

pomt-07963	"New England already has access to ample supplies of natural gas."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/23/jack-reed/senator-reed-says-new-england-has-ample-supplies-n/	For years, Weaver’s Cove Energy, the company that wants to develop a liquefied natural gas terminal in Fall River, has battled critics in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, who have fought the project on several fronts. Opponents say the terminal -- and massive tankers making regular trips through Narragansett Bay -- would pose a serious safety risk to communities on Mount Hope Bay and cause widespread environmental damage. They also say the region already has enough natural gas and doesn’t need a new terminal. The four U.S. senators from the two states, who all oppose the terminal, cited the supply argument in a letter they sent in November to a key Senate appropriations committee, urging it to prohibit the Federal Regulatory Commission from using federal money to approve the terminal. With temperatures plummeting –– and the Weaver’s Cove project far from resolved –– we thought this was a good time to delve into the issue, focusing on the senators’ claim that New England has ample supplies of natural gas, and therefore doesn’t need the new terminal. We chose Sen. Jack Reed as the speaker for this item because he issued a news release about the letter. The senators cited an analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) that was summarized in a Nov. 16, 2009 letter the department sent to federal regulators: "DOER asserts that it is unclear to what extent, if any, Weaver Cove’s LNG supply is needed to meet the region’s gas supply needs. . ." In the letter, the Massachusetts energy office staff reported that within the past year, two new or expanded LNG facilities were completed in the Northeast, adding to the "large excess supply already in the natural gas market." They also cited other increased supplies and a drop in demand for natural gas. Those were among many changes in the region’s electricity and natural gas marketplace that occurred since the Weaver’s Cove project was first initiated in 2002, they said. As a result, they said, "it is unclear why there would be demand for additional LNG infrastructure." We then found Damien Gaul, an analyst for the Energy Information Administration, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. Gaul referred us to a recent administration projection showing natural gas demand nationally increasing from 23 trillion cubic feet in 2008 to 26.4 trillion cubic feet in 2035, a growth rate of .6 percent annually. "We don’t believe the U.S. has a need for more LNG deliveries," said Gaul, who emphasized his agency does not issue opinions on specific LNG proposals. "We currently have the capacity to handle five times the demand we have now. Does the U.S. need more LNG? Probably not. Does the Northeast need more? Probably not." The natural gas supply issue also arose at a hearing for electric utility National Grid before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission on Oct. 20, 2010. Elizabeth D. Arangio, U.S. director of gas supply planning for National Grid, said several new sources of gas have been created in the Northeast, with more to come soon. She concluded: "So at this point, the market doesn’t technically need more supply in this area in addition to those projects ..." At the same hearing, Bruce Oliver, a consultant hired by the PUC, said the recession has reduced the demand for LNG. "That is, the overall demand in the region has declined due to the economy and other factors, energy-efficiency activity, etc. That activity negates a lot of the factors that were driving the need for a Weaver’s Cove type of supply." So why would Weaver’s Cove spend millions of dollars fighting to develop a project to deliver a product to a market that doesn’t need it? We asked Gordon Shearer, president of Hess LNG LLC, who has spearheaded the Weaver’s Cove project. He responded with a question: If New England has enough gas, he asked, why are prices for natural gas here much higher than in the rest of the country? (Gas prices vary widely across the country; the EIA finds prices in New England are generally several dollars higher per thousand cubic feet than the national average.) The high prices, Shearer said, show the region needs more gas. He also said the Massachusetts Energy Office used faulty arithmetic in its study and failed to note that existing pipelines don’t have enough capacity to handle much of the new LNG supplies. He also dismissed the federal reports, saying commercial forecasters tend to see a need for more imports. But documents Shearer provided told a mixed story. For instance, a report from Spectra Energy described the company’s efforts to pipe more gas to the Northeast, but it said nothing about the need for more gas from other sources. Another report, the 2010 Statistical Guide by the Northeast Gas Association, reports that "an era of abundant supplies appears to have arrived" and that is having a positive impact on natural gas prices. The rapid development of shale gas supplies in New York and Pennsylvania are expected to produce substantially more gas for the U.S. market, the report said. It noted that some proposed LNG projects, including one offshore of New Jersey, have been withdrawn recently because of the changing market conditions. To summarize: The Massachusetts and federal energy offices say there is an ample supply of natural gas. So does National Grid, the largest local utility. Weaver’s Cove contention -- that the region’s relatively high gas prices prove there’s not enough supply -- may make theoretical sense. But it hasn’t convinced the regulators so far. Nor us. We find the claim by Reed and the other senators to be True. Update: The original version of this item incorrectly reported that National Grid, a major supplier of electricity and natural gas, burns natural gas to produce electricity. National Grid buys and sells electricity but does not generate it.	None	Jack Reed	None	None	None	2011-01-23T00:01:00	2010-11-04	['None']

pomt-09135	Ninety percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/15/donna-brazile/brazile-says-clinton-loved-90-percent-arkansans/	Sen. Blanche Lincoln's narrow victory in the Arkansas Democratic primary was a big topic on ABC's This Week on Sunday, June 13, 2010. Organized labor poured $10 million into the campaign of her opponent, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, while Bill Clinton, who served as Arkansas governor before becoming president, came out in strong support for Lincoln. This Week host Jake Tapper began the conversation by showing a clip of White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticizing the unions for not using that money to help in the general election. Tapper asked Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, "Is the White House risking alienating labor with that kind of talk?" Brazile responded that the White House should be careful about alienating labor because unions provide key grass-roots support. Brazile said that "Blanche Lincoln ran a great campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did make her the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and she pulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, but she ran a very smart, strategic campaign." Brazile added, "And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of the people in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out the stops to get her elected." We were curious about the claim that 90 percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton. That number seemed high, so we e-mailed Brazile to ask her source. She replied that she was referring to the "base of the Democratic party" and not ALL people. It was a Democratic run-off and I did not set it up right (in the comment on the show) because we had so many races to cover." Brazile said she was sorry about not providing the context and that she thought it was clear she was talking about Democratic primary voters. But we watched the clip and thought many people might think she meant Clinton was popular with 90 percent of all people in Arkansas. His nationwide numbers are significantly lower. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll dated from October 2009, 64 percent of those polled said that they had a favorable opinion of Clinton. We would expect him to be more popular in his home state, but we doubt his popularity would be 26 points higher. Brazile acknowledged that would be highly unlikely "in this highly charged partisan environment." But for Democratic primary voters, Brazile is on solid ground. She sent us a poll from Lake Research Partners of likely Democratic primary voters in Arkansas that found 86 percent had a favorable approval rating of Clinton. So Brazile was very close with her number, but she left out an important detail -- that it applied only to Democratic primary voters. Still, it was made in the context of a discussion about the Democratic primary. So we find her claim Half True.

pomt-12133	"Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/puppetstringnewscom/post-wrongly-says-charlottesville-police-arrested-/	Police in Charlottesville, Va., arrested an Ohio man in connection with the hit-and-run death of a woman protesting a white supremacist rally, but an online post alleged authorities were covering up for the real culprit. An Aug. 12, 2017, post on PuppetStringNews.com carried the headline, "Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of efforts to combat fake news. Police arrested James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio, after a 2010 Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a "Unite the Right" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested. PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said police had the wrong man. The post said the Challenger actually belonged to a Michigan man named Jerome Vangheluwe (pronounced "vangelloway," with a hard g), who had a son named Joel Vangheluwe, who was "a known Antifa supporter." Antifa is shorthand for antifascist demonstrators that organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. "This James Alex Fields subject is simply being used to make it look like a Right Wing attack, when he has no ties to the Dodge Challenger that was used...Unlike the Vangheluwe family who owns the car," the post read. But the post, which appears to get its roots from an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories, is based on inaccurate information. Here’s what we know. A statement from the city of Charlottesville said the Challenger rear-ended a sedan, which in turn hit a minivan, pushing the minivan into an intersection filled with pedestrians. "The Dodge Challenger fled the scene, but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police," the statement read. Fields was identified by police as the driver and was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14. Fields was photographed at the Charlottesville rally, and news reports said he had told his mother in Ohio that he was going there. A former high school teacher also noted Fields had shown an unusual interest in Nazi history. But what about the car supposedly belonging to the Vangheluwes? We checked vehicle records and found that it did once belong to Jerome Vangheluwe, who bought it in 2009. Joel Vangheluwe had posted a photo of the Challenger on Oct. 16, 2011, with the caption "My car when I turn 16." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But Jerome Vangheluwe sold the car in 2012. It then went to another owner for almost three years. It was sold again on May 13, 2016, and registered under its current Ohio license plate, GVF 1111, which has been shown in photos from Charlottesville. News reports concur the car is registered to Fields. After the posts blaming Joel Vangheluwe started appearing, he posted Facebook status updates on Aug. 12 denying he was the driver. "im not the one, im from fucking michigan you idiots," he first posted. His Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home. Vangheluwe followed that with, "i drive a 2009 chevy impala, not a challenger, fuck the internet" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe. Our ruling PuppetStringNews.com said, "Virginia Police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters." The website alleged that the Vangheluwe family owned the 2010 Dodge Challenger used in the Charlottesville tragedy. While they did own it years ago, records show it is currently registered in Ohio, where Fields lives. There’s no evidence to indicate police arrested the wrong person, or that they were covering for Vangheluwe, who lived in Michigan. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-12492	"For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-only-modern-president-fill-s/	President Donald Trump told National Rifle Association members that 100 days in, he’s already fulfilled a major promise he made to them on the campaign trail: nominating a conservative justice to the Supreme Court to replace Antonin Scalia. In fact, he said he’s the first president since 1881 to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in his first 100 days. "I kept my promise, and now with your help, our brand new justice — and he is really something very special — Neil Gorsuch sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court," Trump said at the group’s annual meeting April 28. "For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. Now, we won't get any credit for this, but don't worry about it." Trump has his history right. He is indeed the first modern president to fill an open Supreme Court seat within the first 100 days. The last president to do so was Chester A. Arthur, who took office Sept. 19, 1881, and nominated Horace Gray to the bench the following December. But this isn’t as big of an achievement as it might seem. The reality is that very few presidents are presented with the opportunity to appoint and confirm a new Supreme Court justice within their first 100 days. Other than Trump, just four presidents since 1900 have had that chance: Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Harry Truman and Warren Harding. And Trump is the only one of the group who entered office with a vacant Supreme Court seat from the start — meaning he had a full 100 days to nominate and confirm his pick. For both Harding in 1921 and Truman in 1945, the Supreme Court seat opened up about 11 weeks into their respective presidencies. For Clinton, it opened up about eight weeks in. (One hundred days is about 14 weeks.) None of them nominated and confirmed a replacement until after the 100 days were up. Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, before Nixon took office the following January. But Warren said he would stay on the bench until his replacement was confirmed, so there was no actual vacancy. Nixon didn’t get a replacement confirmed until June 1969. For a good overview of Supreme Court nomination timelines going back to 1900, see this report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Our ruling Trump said, "For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days." Before Trump, the last time a president nominated and confirmed a Supreme Court nominee within his first 100 days was Arthur in 1881. However, Trump’s statement leaves out the important fact that it’s rare for a president to have the opportunity to nominate a justice in those first 100 days. Trump and Nixon are the only presidents since 1900 to have entered office knowing they have a seat to fill imminently. Three others learned of an opening near the end of the 100-day benchmark. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-04-28T18:48:17	2017-04-28	['None']
pomt-12135	"Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/14/david-perdue/sen-david-perdue-half-immigrant-households-benefit/	One argument supporters make for limiting legal immigration is that a significant share end up on social welfare programs. "The majority come here on family-based visas, without regard to their skills or our needs. As a result, half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system," wrote Sen. David Perdue in an Aug. 8 op-ed in USA Today, co-bylined with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Perdue and Cotton sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, or RAISE Act, which President Donald Trump has endorsed. Currently, the country accepts about 1 million new immigrants a year. Research has found that about 50 percent of households headed by an immigrant (living here legally or illegally) do benefit from government assistance programs. In many of those households, it’s a U.S.-born child who is eligible for a program. Research on social welfare programs Perdue’s and Cotton’s offices told us their claim relied on a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. Using data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, the study found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported having used at least one welfare program during the year, compared with 30 percent of native-born households. The study factored in the following programs: Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); Women, Infants, and Children food program (WIC); free or subsidized school lunches; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as the Food Stamp program); Medicaid, and public housing and rent subsidies. The report said a household was using welfare if any member used a program during 2012. An immigrant household included foreign-born individuals (such as naturalized U.S. citizens, green card holders and unauthorized immigrants) as well as U.S.-born children who were eligible for a welfare program. Some immigrant households also had members who were native-born adults. Though there is a 1996 law restricting immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a "qualified alien" (the classification includes lawful permanent residents), the majority of authorized immigrants have been here for more than five years, the study said. As a result, that law "has only a modest impact on the share of immigrant households receiving one or more welfare programs," Camarota wrote. Compared with native-born individuals, immigrants have higher levels of poverty primarily because they are relatively less likely to be employed and on average earn lower wages, and it takes time for the newly arrived "to move up the job ladder and for the poor among them to lift themselves and their children out of poverty," said a 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Leighton Ku, a health policy professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, criticized the report from the Center for Immigration Studies for using an overly broad definition of benefits that most people probably would not think as welfare. All school lunches, for example, get some federal subsidy, whether full price or not, Ku said. "Does this mean that all school children are getting welfare?" he asked. Ku in 2013 co-authored a paper concluding that low-income immigrants use public benefits at a lower rate than low-income native-born citizens. Ku’s and Camarota’s methodology differed. For instance, Ku’s analysis focused on individuals by immigration status, not on households headed by immigrants. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told us that the school lunch program isn’t like other programs traditionally considered welfare. It’s a nutrition program, and does not have the same work, citizenship or other requirements that actual welfare programs do. And it’s not always means-tested, as for example some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students," she said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But excluding school lunch recipients doesn’t change the numbers that much. Camarota in his study said that if subsidized school lunch was excluded from the equation, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent (compared with 28 percent for native households). That’s only slightly lower than Perdue’s claim that about "half" of immigrant households receive welfare benefits. The National Academies report found similar numbers of about 45 percent when looking at various public benefits. It examined benefits used by immigrant and U.S.-born households, both with children. The report found that "cash assistance" such as SSI and TANF was low for both sets of households, around 6 percent. "Cash assistance is what we generally think of as ‘welfare’ for households with children in which the adults cannot work or have difficulty finding jobs," Mittelstadt said. But food assistance and Medicaid participation was much higher for immigrant households than for U.S.-born households, she said. About 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and 46 percent Medicaid, according to the report. Our ruling Perdue said, "Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system." Cash assistance for immigrants is very low, about 6 percent, but there are other programs from which immigrants benefit, and Perdue cited benefits broadly. Research from the Center for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported to have used at least one welfare program during the year. That percentage includes a broad definition of welfare, including school lunch. Excluding subsidized school lunches, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent, according to the study. The study included as welfare beneficiaries immigrant households in which a U.S.-born child is benefitting from a welfare program. Another report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and 46 percent had Medicaid. Perdue’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05225	"There is no record of congresswoman Betty Sutton ... ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/07/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-has-never-held-town-/	Since becoming a member of Congress last year, Rep. Jim Renacci has held numerous "town hall" style public meetings, even though he recognizes that hostile political entities are videotaping all his remarks in hopes that he’ll make a gaffe they can exploit. A redistricting plan that eliminated two of Ohio’s congressional seats put Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, into the same congressional district as Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democratic from Copley Township, prompting a November face-off. The upcoming contest has made both Renacci and Sutton top political targets. In a news release announcing Renacci will hold a town hall meeting for Rocky River on June 14, Renacci’s re-election campaign chided Sutton for not holding such meetings herself, and claimed it was part of a "disappearing act." "In a stunning and stark contrast, there is no record of Congresswoman Betty Sutton, who has been in office for the better part of a decade, ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public - and she certainly has never done so while running to represent the 16th District," the news release said. Has Sutton really never held open meetings with constituents? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim, particularly since it has seen news releases about town hall meetings that Sutton had scheduled during her three terms in office. For example, a 2007 release that’s still available online announced events in Akron and Elyria. "Sutton will open the event with brief remarks, introduce her district staff, and spend the majority of the event responding to questions," the news release said. " Those interested in attending and/or submitting a question for the Q & A period should RSVP to the email address below or contact either of Sutton's district offices in Lorain or Summit County." The Plain Dealer also published at least one article that mentioned Sutton conducting a town hall meeting. That meeting occurred in July 2009. At that time of the August 2009 article - when opponents of proposed health care reform legislation were disrupting congressional meetings around the country - Sutton told The Plain Dealer that many of her constituents said they didn’t want to attend such a meeting because "they would fear for their safety." Afterwards, she announced that she’d hold a constituent meeting on the subject by teleconference, and invited callers to dial-in. In light of that evidence, PolitiFact Ohio asked Renacci’s campaign for the basis of its claim that there’s no record of Sutton ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public. Spokesman James Slepian responded that the campaign is certain that Sutton has not conducted such a town hall meeting since she announced her run against Renacci last year. He said Sutton had announced she’d hold a semi-public June 3 event in Renacci’s hometown - Wadsworth - but canceled it. An email to The Plain Dealer about the Wadsworth event indicated it was not a town hall meeting, but a fundraiser that a local Democratic party group had scheduled at a restaurant near Renacci’s campaign headquarters. The fundraiser was cancelled because of a scheduling conflict. Slepian said the campaign was "unable to find a clear record of her holding such an event at any other time during her career in Congress. And by clear record, I mean some record detailing when and where the town hall occurred, was it open to the public, did Sutton field questions from the audience (all the same information that is readily available about the town halls that Mr. Renacci holds regularly)." Slepian accused Sutton of repeatedly announcing town hall meetings and then cancelling them, citing as evidence August 2009 posts from conservative and Tea Party websites that expressed disappointment that Sutton opted to hold a teleconference phone call with constituents about the health care bill instead of in-person meetings. Slepian said the news release that announced the Sutton’s 2007 event did not constitute "proof" that it occurred, and he could find "no record" that the July 2009 town hall meeting referenced in the August 2009 The Plain Dealer article had actually happened. "In addition to the clear differences in their respective voting records, another glaring difference between Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton is that while Jim Renacci believes he owes it to the voters to answer them regularly and in person as their voice in Washington, Betty Sutton feels no such obligation to the people of Northeast Ohio," Slepian said in an email. Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo said Sutton has recently conducted seniors listening tour events, which are open to the public, and where constituents can ask Sutton questions and offer comments. "That’s what a ‘town hall’ is," DeAngelo said. An article on the North Royalton Post website chronicled much of what Sutton said at an April 2 "listening tour" event that Sutton held at the North Royalton branch of the Cuyahoga County Public Library. The article, accompanied by photos from the event, said it was attended by "less than a handful of seniors." To Renacci’s credit, he has held regular town hall meetings with constituents even as hostile videographers have doggedly recorded them. And his staff could have argued that they think he meets with constituents more often or that Sutton does not hold town hall meetings often enough. But his claim that "there is no record" of Sutton "ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public" does not stand up to scrutiny. News releases that have announced such events and newspaper articles about those events provide sufficient evidence that they occurred. On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci’s claim rates False.

pomt-12742	Says "people who come to" their dissent actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Ron Johnson's office.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/02/citizen-action-wisconsin/group-falsely-claims-gop-sen-ron-johnson-sends-cea/	A website posting on Feb. 28, 2017 spurred a bashing the next day of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, with charges that the Wisconsin Republican was cracking down on free speech. Tweets such as these: Sen Ron Johnson sends constituents a "cease and desist" letter so as to not hear their concerns! Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has sent "cease and desist" letters to constituents trying to meet with him. Sen Ron Johnson orders citizens to "Cease and Desist" pleading for #ACA! What we found is that the posting by Citizen Action of Wisconsin -- which claimed that "people who come to" the group’s actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Johnson's office -- is overly broad and misleading. The claim Milwaukee-based Citizen Action describes itself as an "issue-focused coalition of individuals and organizations committed to achieving social, economic and environmental justice." The posting it put on its website said: Dissent is patriotic, that's what we believe. That's why for months we've been showing up to Congressional offices, calling every day, writing letters/emails/postcards & more. And it's why our members took part in town halls and rallies across the state last week during the Congressional Recess, including a 500+ person rally in Greenfield and 150+ in Wausau. Complete with empty chairs for, and a large cardboard cutout of, Senator Ron Johnson. And what do the people who come to our actions get? A "cease and desist" letter (click for full letter) from the Senator's office (signed "staff"). Senator Johnson is trying his best not to hear our concerns about the future of healthcare, about the future of our country and the fate our of families. The post ends with a reference to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the chance to sign an online petition saying "we will not cease and desist." By the morning of March 2, 2017, the count was more than 2,800 signatures. Citizen Action included with its post a link to a photograph of a Feb. 27, 2017 letter on Johnson’s official Senate stationery. The name of the recipient of the letter is blacked out, but we confirmed that the letter was sent to Earl Good, a 72-year-old Milwaukee retiree. The letter The Johnson letter to Good, which is signed by "Staff," says: This Cease and Desist letter is to inform you that any further communication from you to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s office can only be done in writing. This means that you are not to call or visit any of Senator Johnson’s staff or any of his offices at any time. Our office has done all that we can to assist you with your concerns. This letter acts as a written notice of our expectation for you to discontinue your unwanted telephone calls and office visits. If you fail to comply with this notice, then we will have no other alternative but to contact the United States Capitol Police and report your noncompliance. Perspectives Good told the Journal Sentinel that since the November 2016 elections, he has been calling Johnson's office on various issues and has joined others who visit Johnson's Milwaukee office to raise concerns about issues such as health care. He said that in mid-February, he called Johnson's office 40 times on one day and 83 times another day. He said he kept calling until someone answered the phone rather than letting his call go to voicemail. He said he is persistent but has always been polite when interacting with Johnson's staff on the phone or in person. Kevin Kane, the organizing director for Citizen Action, told us Good has been involved in recent months in the group’s initiatives, including visits to Johnson’s office in an effort to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Kane said he has observed Good as being persistent but respectful. But Kane said he was not familiar with all of Good’s interactions with Johnson’s staff and that Good is the only person involved with Citizen Action that is known to have received a cease-and-desist letter from Johnson. Finally, here’s what Johnson staff members Patrick McIlheran and Ben Voelkel told us (they would not identify Good as the recipient of the letter, but confirmed the letter is legitimate): The letter was sent to Good because of repeated behavior over the previous two months, in person, that was harassing and threatening to Johnson's staff, not because of any dissent voiced by the resident about politics or policy. They would not provide more details. Johnson's staff believed the man was acting on his own and the staff was not aware of whether he was involved with Citizen Action or any other group. The behavior led Johnson's office to contact the Capitol Police, which suggested that the letter be sent. Johnson's office has sent four or five cease-and-desist letters since Johnson took office in January 2011, and this was the first since the November 2016 elections. Our rating Citizen Action says "people who come to" their dissent actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Johnson's office. Despite the broadness of the claim, the group produced a cease-and-desist letter written to only one person who it says has been involved in Citizen Action initiatives such as preserving the Affordable Care Act. The letter demands that the man stop visiting or calling any of Johnson’s staff or offices, but says written communications will be received. And Johnson’s staff says it issued the letter, on the advice of the U.S. Capitol Police, because the man had been harassing and threatening to staff, not because he protested any of Johnson’s actions. We rate the statement False. Editor's note: Four days after this fact check was published, Citizen Action posted an apology about its claim against Johnson.

pomt-00757	Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, "nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/15/jeb-bush/which-state-most-gun-permits/	Facing a long list of GOP presidential contenders at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush touted his own pro-gun rights record. Bush took a friendly jab at another potential presidential contender in the room: "Today there are well over 1.3 million law-abiding Floridians with a valid concealed weapons permit, 1.3 million. That’s the most in the nation -- nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas. Sorry, Gov. Perry." Yep, Florida does have 1,384,756 million concealed weapon permit holders as of March 2015. It’s not surprising that Florida would be among the top states for the number of gun permits since it is now the third most populous state in the country. But does Florida lead the nation in gun permits and is that nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas? We were fired up to find the facts. Comparing state permit figures A spokesman for Bush’s PAC referred us to an August 2014 article in the Washington Times, which stated Florida led the nation with 1.3 million in concealed carry permits while Texas came in second with just over 708,000. We sought to independently find current statistics. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, last studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state in 2012 based on data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases. It found Florida was No. 1 with 887,000 permits at the time, followed by Pennsylvania 786,000, Georgia 600,000 permits and Texas with 519,000 permits. Looking for more current numbers, we found Florida had nearly 1.4 million permit holders as of March 2015, while Texas has 825,957 as of December 2014, according to each state's official count. Florida’s number is about 1.7 times higher than Texas, which is close to Bush’s words of "nearly double." To determine if Texas is No. 2, we tried to find a more current number for gun permits in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Those two states don’t make such data as readily and publicly available as Florida and Texas. Pennsylvania has 1,064,360 active carry permits, State Trooper Adam Reed, a spokesman for the state police, told PolitiFact. So Pennsylvania, not Texas, is No. 2. In Georgia, 159 probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses to the Administrative Office of the Courts; however, some judges fail to report the number of applicants, resulting in no firm number. PolitiFact Georgia found that the state’s compiled number was in the ballpark of 500,000 in 2012, but the numbers have been increasing. Other estimates we have seen are higher, but none exceeded the total in Texas. (The courts sent us the total number of applications in 2013 which was about 169,000.) Some caveats about conceal carry laws and Bush’s claim While Bush’s claim is based on the sheer number of permits, another valid way to measure access to gun permits is to look at the rate in each state. The 2012 GAO report, using 2010 Census data for the adult population, shows Florida’s rate at 6.2 -- equal to Connecticut but less than Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The rules about conceal carry and each state vary, so it’s worth mentioning some caveats we have noted before. Several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. As of March, about 192,000 out-of-state residents have Florida permits, representing about 13 percent of the total. Two populous states are notably absent from the top of the list: California and New York. Those states are considered a "may issue" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That means it is harder to get a permit there than in a state such as Florida which is a "shall issue" state. We interviewed John R. Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center which compiles data on gun permits in states. Lott, an academic and Fox News columnist, published the book More Guns, Less Crime through the University of Chicago in 2010. He said there are four factors that influence the number of gun permits in a state: the amount of fees, hours of required training, how many places people can or can’t carry their firearms and how many years the rules have been in effect. For example, Pennsylvania has one of the lower fees, while Florida has higher fees but close to average in terms of training requirements. Our ruling Bush said Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, "nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas." There are three parts to this claim. On the first one, Bush is correct that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of gun permits -- the most current figure is nearly 1.4 million. However, eight states have a higher per-capita rate of gun permits than Florida. When he says that Florida has "nearly double" the number of permits as Texas he is in the ballpark -- Texas has about 826,000. So Florida has about 1.7 times as many permit holders. Where Bush misses the mark is when he says that Texas is the second state in terms of gun permits. Current data from the Pennsylvania state patrol showed slightly more than one million permits -- so more than Texas. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This report has been changed to clarify that probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses, not completed licenses. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f425cb8a-e580-4991-b7b0-a9dba110f4bc	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-04-15T15:46:52	2015-04-10	['Texas']
pomt-08379	Says Julie Parrish is "one of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzlies."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/25/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/oregon-house-democrats-try-tie-julie-parrish-sarah/	Oregon seems to have missed most of the tea party fever sweeping the country these days. There aren’t any serious political contenders in Oregon who fit the bill, anyway. But that hasn’t stopped the Oregon House Democrats from trying to tie one local candidate to Sarah Palin and her "rogue" ways. In a recent Democratic mailer, Future PAC proudly proclaims that "Oregon isn’t grizzly country." On the reverse it says that Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate for House District 37, is "one of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzlies." "Recently," it goes on, "Julie Parrish received national attention after she was singled out by Fox News as one of Sarah Palin’s ‘Mama Grizzlies.’ "We don’t really want one of Sarah Palin’s Mama Grizzlies making decisions for us, do we? "Don’t think so. Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin." Well, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work. First up: Is Oregon "grizzly country"? That all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they’re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s. If, however, they’re talking about "Grizzly Bear," the popular indie band, they’re way off. The band played in Portland last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a quick listen to "The Knife," our favorite song of theirs.) Seriously, we might have to leave the whole "grizzly country" designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer. Is Parrish really one of Palin’s mama grizzlies? To get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a video of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look. The anchor frames the TV spot as follows: "Well, Sarah Palin says they're like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time." There’s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says "It's kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half." Then we’re back to the anchor, who says, "And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies." We got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. "The focus was supposed to be moms and politics," she said. "I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that." Still, you can find the video on her website, and she didn’t object on the air. But is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren’t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn’t even endorsed her, as far we can tell. So where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There’s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a "mama grizzly" in that she’s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent. We rate this claim Bearly -- oops! -- Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03095	Mental health provisions related to mass shootings "got over 90 votes in the Senate."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/sep/24/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-says-mental-health-amendment-gun-bill/	U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is again backing programs aimed at identifying mentally ill people who pose a risk for mass killings. Ayotte, saying she has strong bipartisan support, has co-sponsored a bill geared toward education, awareness and intervention relating to mental illness since the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. Ayotte introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act in January 2013, which never made it past a congressional committee. However, elements of that bill went into the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act that was part of the gun control legislation the Senate voted down in April. Two days after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September 2013, Ayotte and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, issued a joint statement to Senate leadership advocating programs to educate teachers in recognizing symptoms of mental health illness and how they could defuse potentially dangerous situations. Soon after, she appeared on CNN’s The Lead With Jake Tapper. She said a bill that addresses mental health issues would pass the Senate easily. Ayotte said the mental health amendment that was attached to last April’s gun-control legislation passed easily. However, it was not enacted because the gun bill itself lost. "I actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed because of the mental health provisions. It got over 90 votes in the Senate and very little gets 90 votes around here," Ayotte said. We wondered whether the mental health amendment really got such overwhelming support. We looked at the official roll call vote on the amendment and found that it had indeed passed by a 95-2 vote on April 18. Despite voting for the mental health amendment she co-sponsored, Ayotte later became one of 41 Republicans who voted against the gun control proposal sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have expanded background checks. Five Democrats also voted against it. The mixed messages these votes sent drew sharp criticism from critics. Ayotte responded with a statement that said: "I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales." Our ruling Ayotte said that mental health provisions related to mass shootings "got over 90 votes in the Senate." While an early version of the bill never made it out of committee, the Senate did eventually vote, 95-2, for a mental-health amendment to a gun control bill. The full bill lacked enough votes to pass and was pulled from the floor, but she is correct that the amendment did get 90 votes. We rate her statement True.

"There appears to be a flooding problem at #HOUSTONairport here at #heathrow we would just squeegee of the runway," London-based tweeter @v7dge wrote.

See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com None of the users identified whether the image was supposed to show Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport or the smaller William P. Hobby Airport, but it’s neither. The image is a fake. While it does show an airport — New York’s LaGuardia Airport in Queens — it’s actually a digitally manipulated photo that was used to show the effects of sea-level rise. A 2013 article on ClimateCentral.org credited the image to an artist named Nickolay Lamm, saying it was made to illustrate what a 25-foot increase in sea level would look like at LaGuardia. (There are other images showing the change at 5 feet and 12 feet.) Both of Houston’s major airports were shut down by the storm, canceling thousands of flights over several days. Bush and Hobby airports were both expected to resume flights by Aug. 29. An Aug. 27 tweet from Houston’s ABC affiliate said, ".@HobbyAirport says about 500 people are trapped.

"Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget," Obama said. Fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt — which is now more than $9-trillion in total — often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year’s deficit of $318-billion. The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct. We rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-07T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['John_McCain']
pomt-13385	Says Hillary Clinton’s energy agenda "will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-clinton-energy-plan/	Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton on energy issues at a campaign stop in Virginia just two days before the two were set to go head-to-head at the first presidential debate. "Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work," he said. "Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion." Trump’s claim about Clinton wanting to shut down natural gas production is not accurate, but what about his claim on the cost of her energy agenda? The claim is misleading as $5 trillion refers to the cost of implementation, not the cost to the economy. What’s more, the researcher who produced the figure told us the investment will actually help the economy. The $5 trillion figure The Trump campaign referred us to a 2016 working paper by Columbia Business School professor Geoffrey Heal entitled "What Would it Take to Reduce US Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80% by 2050?" Heal, who is in favor of climate change action, estimated a cost of $42 billion to $176 billion per year in required investment in production capacity, energy storage, energy transmission and battery-powered vehicles. On the low end, that comes out to $1.3 trillion over three decades and, on the high end, $5.3 trillion over three decades. This, however, does not refer to a loss in GDP, but rather the amount needed to update the U.S. energy system and technology infrastructure. "It’s not a GDP loss at all," Heal told PolitiFact. "This is infrastructure investment." He pointed out that Trump and Clinton have both called for long-term infrastructure investment. Spending the $5 trillion on cutting emissions is a "relatively inexpensive way with a good rate of return," Heal said, and the $5 trillion will have a "multiplier" effect that will help the economy become cleaner and more productive. Heal also told us to take his estimate with a grain of salt because there a lot of uncertainties, such as the price of technology. Overall, he actually supports Clinton’s "sensible" energy and climate change policies. "She’s pushing for the right things," he said. "I certainly don’t think they’ll bankrupt the country." What’s more, it’s not entirely accurate to say 80 percent by 2050 is Clinton’s "regulatory agenda." Clinton has proposed various energy policies to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels. She said her plan will "put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050," a goal established by President Barack Obama and found in this year’s Democratic Party Platform. In other words, the analysis offered by Heal doesn’t apply to her actual policies but an aspiration the Democrats share. A 2014 paper by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, which brings together energy researchers from around the world, found a similar result: an investment cost equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP. But the researchers note that this price tag is "incremental" and has a great level of uncertainty "because they depend on assumptions about consumption levels, technology costs, and fossil fuel prices nearly 40 years into the future." They also stipulate that the cost assumes little to no technological change nor does the estimate include benefits like avoided health and infrastructure costs. Economic cost of energy policies If we look at specific policies rather than a 30-year goal, the economic cost of Clinton’s energy agenda is dramatically less expensive. In a speech to the Shale Insight conference in Pennsylvania, Trump specified that the $5 trillion refers to the President Barack Obama’s Climate Action Plan and Clean Power Plan. Obama’s Climate Action Plan proposes new regulations, investments in renewable energy and international cooperation to cut carbon emissions. That plan includes the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan of 2015 (which requires power plants to reduce their 2005 emission levels by 32 percent within 25 years) and the Paris agreement (in which the Obama administration pledged to cut national 2005 emission levels by 28 percent within 20 years). Those plans are currently in limbo. The Supreme Court ruled in February 2016 to halt the Clean Power Plan’s implementation while the Paris agreement has yet to go into effect. Clinton has vowed to defend and implement Obama’s climate change policies, including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate agreement. Critics of these policies — namely the oil and gas industry, business groups and free market oriented think tanks — say they’ll impose costs on businesses and consumers alike. But these estimates do not come close to $5 trillion. According to a 2015 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation — which opposes the plan — the Clean Power Plan will lead to a loss of $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030. Here’s table breaking down the estimates we found, all from groups that are opposed to the plans or that have concerns about them: Group Policy Estimated cost Year of analysis Heritage Foundation Clean Power Plan $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030 2015 Heritage Foundation Climate Action Plan $1.47 trillion in national income by 2030 2013 Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation Clean Power Plan $660 billion in GDP loss by 230 2016 American Action Forum, a center-right advocacy group Paris agreement and existing climate change-oriented regulations $562 billion by 2030* 2015 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Clean Power Plan $510 billion in GDP loss by 2030 2014 *American Action Forum estimated that altogether, existing climate change-geared regulations cost $28 billion annually while the Paris agreement, which kicks in 2020, would raise that number to $45 billion annually. Estimated benefits of climate change policies On the flip side, the Environmental Protection Agency and others argue the Clean Power Plan actually leads to economic gains when health and environmental benefits are included in the analysis. Curbing carbon emissions would reduce health hazards, such as asthma and heart attacks, associated with particle pollution, saving the public $34 to $54 billion per year by 2030, according to the EPA. Factoring in the EPA’s own projected costs of $8 billion per year, that’s an annual net gain of $26 billion to $46 billion. A 2016 cost-benefit analysis by Harvard researchers resulted in a figure in the same ballpark: a net $38 billion per year in net benefits by 2020. Meanwhile, the National Resources Defense Council had even rosier projections. The environmental group estimated that the Clean Power Plan would deliver benefits worth $55 billion to $93 billion, outweighing the costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion. " The Clinton campaign also pointed us to several papers on the cost of not reducing emissions. For examples, researchers estimated a 23 percent reduction in global incomes by 2100 if climate change is unmitigated. "Climate change is a serious issue for the economy. It could inflict damages that will add up," Heal said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton’s energy agenda "will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion." The Trump campaign said Trump was referring to one study that looked at how much it would cost to reach Clinton’s climate goal; it referred to a high-end, 30-year estimate of implementation costs. The study did not actually measure the effects on the economy. Critics of the plan say it will reduce GDP by as much as $2.5 trillion. Supporters say it actually will have a net-positive effect. Trump’s statement is not accurate.

pomt-11920	"The cost-sharing reductions (were) a gift (that) they gave the insurance companies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/18/donald-trump/trump-mislabels-obamacare-subsidy-gift-insurers/	The current sword hanging over the Obamacare health insurance markets is the future of one of the subsidies in the system. It’s called cost-sharing reduction and it cushions lower-income people from out-of-pocket costs when they see a doctor. This makes up a small slice of the total insurance picture, but President Donald Trump brought the matter to a head Oct. 12 when he canceled all payments. They are worth an estimated $10 billion next year and the move sent a jolt through the individual and small business market. Premium hikes of 20 percent were suddenly a real possibility for policy holders. Trump touted his decision at a cabinet meeting on Monday. "I knocked out the CSRs (cost-sharing reductions)," Trump said Oct. 16. "That was a subsidy to the insurance companies. That was a gift that was, frankly, what they gave the insurance companies." The very next day, two key Republican and Democratic senators announced a deal to keep the payments flowing. At first, Trump seemed at ease with the compromise. "It is a short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period -- including a dangerous period for insurance companies by the way," Trump said Oct. 17. "For a period of one to two years, we will have a very good solution." Then, about eight hours later, at a Heritage Foundation dinner, Trump raised doubts about where he stands. He praised the bipartisan effort, but then returned to his theme about insurance companies. "I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies," Trump said. Amidst these head-snapping shifts, we asked, are those cost-sharing reduction payments a bailout, a "gift" to the insurance companies? We couldn’t find an economist who thought they are. In fact, while Washington would be sending insurers those checks, Trump’s statement missed the point that the money doesn’t end up in the companies’ pockets. Here’s why. This piece of Obamacare was designed to protect lower-income families from hefty out-of-pocket costs. The policies they bought on the Obamacare exchanges came with deductibles and co-pays, but instead of paying those themselves, the insurance companies do. Who gets the money? The doctors, hospitals and labs that provide the services. At the end of the day, the federal payment covers the insurer for footing the bill. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines for insurers spells this out pretty clearly. It defines cost-sharing reductions "as expenses on behalf of an enrollee for essential health benefits, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance." The actual process of figuring out how much to pay each insurance company has a few bumps and turns. Washington pays companies an estimated amount up front, and then trues-up the books every quarter. Companies "must report the amount they paid for each eligible medical claim, the amount enrollees paid for the claims, and the amount of cost sharing that would have been paid for the same services under the corresponding standard plan," the guidelines say. Martin Gaynor at Carnegie Mellon University said in no way does this amount to a subsidy for insurance companies. "It’s not like we were just handing them a pile of money for an expense they didn't incur," Gaynor said. "It’s supposed to keep things neutral. You paid this out on behalf of the enrollee, and now here’s money from Uncle Sam that’s intended to keep you whole." We asked economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California San Diego, and finance professor Scott Harrington at the Wharton School. They both agreed -- the cost-sharing reduction is no gift because if you look at the full picture, the insurance companies are no better off at the end then they were at the start. The only wrinkle that Harrington saw was legal. Due to a court ruling, Trump had the right to cancel the payments. So long as he didn’t do that, that was good news for the insurers. But all that said, the cost-sharing reductions make insurance more affordable to people at or near the poverty line and that increases the number of policies insurance companies can sell. The value of the cost sharing is about one sixth the size of the premium tax credits, which do the heavy lifting to keep insurance affordable, but still, the impact is there. We asked the White House about this and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump called the cost-sharing reductions payments a gift to insurance companies. In reality, the money pays the insurers for payments they make to health care providers. It is a pass-through. Every health care economist we reached said if the companies don’t gain any cash from the transaction, then there is no gift, no bailout or whatever term one might use. The one grain of truth is that anything that makes insurance more affordable increases sales, even if by a small amount. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11609	Says President Barack Obama advocated "fathers in the home" as the solution to gun violence.	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/26/jeanne-ives/illinois-rep-says-she-shares-obamas-view-gun-viole/	On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Republican governor candidate Jeanne Ives was asked a question about reducing gun violence. "The problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly," Ives told a public forum for candidates. "And you know how you’re going to solve it? Fathers in the home." After reportedly being booed at the event, Ives, an Illinois state representative from Wheaton, repeated "fathers in the home," according to the Chicago Tribune. The Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to media that "many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama." The Ives statement quoted from a 2008 Father’s Day speech in which then-candidate Obama, himself raised mostly by a single mother and her parents, called on fathers to own up to their family responsibilities. So is Ives seeking to further an idea that was earlier championed by Obama? Did Obama say fathers actively raising their children will solve the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago? We decided to check. What Obama said Obama’s Father’s Day speech received a lot of attention, analysis and scrutiny at the time. PolitiFact rated one of the dramatic claims in the speech as True: "More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children." Neither Ives in her Martin Luther King Jr. Day comments nor her campaign in its follow-up explanation explicitly mentioned race in connection with the responsibilities of fathers. In fact, the campaign statement sought to draw a link between her assertions and those of Obama by directly quoting from his 2008 Father’s Day speech, yet omitted passages that specifically discussed African-American families. One Obama quote cited by the Ives campaign expressed concern about the absence of too many fathers from homes and families: "We know the statistics — that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison." What Obama didn’t say Peniel Joseph, founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the University of Texas, said Ives was off the mark in trying to link Obama’s sentiments to her take on solving gun violence. Joseph, also a professor at Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs, said he knows Obama’s Father’s Day speech well and the soon-to-be-president "never connected that (speech) specifically to ending gun violence. It was more of an observation on black families." Obama did cite crime as one of the outcomes of broken homes, but Joseph said gun violence can be linked to a broad range of factors. "It’s connected to the drug trade, unemployment, segregated schools," he added. Joseph said he could not recall a time when Obama, in that speech or others, said fathers staying home with their families will reduce gun violence. During his presidency, Obama made several major speeches about gun violence. In a 2013 report, released weeks after a school massacre that killed 20 youngsters in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama proposed a multi-pronged approach to addressing the issue — including improved background checks and other ways to strengthen restrictions on criminals buying guns. Not listed among Obama’s solutions was an emphasis on more two-parent families. April Zeoli, a gun violence expert at Michigan State University, disputed Ives’ prescription for curbing gun violence. "I haven’t seen this as a real, viable intervention for gun violence in Chicago," said Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice. In the Ives campaign statement, the candidate also stressed that Obama was just one of "many" others who had drawn a link between absentee fathers and gun violence. She did not name other names than Obama’s, however. When we asked her campaign to elaborate, it provided a list of advocacy organizations such as The National Fatherhood Initiative, The National Center for Fathering and The Fatherhood Project. Also on the list provided by the Ives campaign was disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing retrial in Pennsylvania on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted a woman. Our ruling Ives claims she was echoing comments from former President Obama as she declared recently that the solution to curbing rampant gun violence would depend on more fathers taking responsibility for their families. In his 2008 speech, Obama drew a link between children from fatherless homes and those who stray into crime. But Ives took it a lot further than Obama ever did. Her sweeping claim is not supported by the passages from Obama’s speech that her campaign pointed to as evidence. A reading of the full speech doesn’t support Ives either. As president, Obama made several speeches about the proliferation of guns and violence, and also laid out an array of proposals to deal with the problems. In his public pronouncements, however, Obama did not make statements linking the problem of absent fathers with gun violence. Ives is taking the message from Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech out of context. We rate her statement False.	None	Jeanne Ives	None	None	None	2018-01-26T07:00:00	2018-01-15	['None']
pomt-10369	Says Obama opposes innovation, the electric car and "clean, safe, nuclear energy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/27/john-mccain/this-007-claim-is-out-of-ammo/	A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign portrays Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of electric cars, nuclear power and energy "innovation." With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhouette and the words "Barack Obama Is Dr. No." The words change to "No To Drilling Offshore Oil" while Obama is heard saying, "Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today." The screen says, "No To A Gas Tax Holiday" while Obama says, "I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea." "No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car" then appears, while Obama says "In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks." The screen says "No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy" while Obama says "I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent." The ad ends with the message: "Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security." The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. The ad has a kind of split personality. While the drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we explain in this item, the other claims were strikingly wrong. In this item, we'll examine the claims about electric cars, nuclear power and innovation. Let's take electric cars first. To back this up, the McCain campaign cites Obama's statement that McCain's $300-million prize for improving car batteries was "a gimmick." But that doesn't prove Obama said "no" to electric cars. (As our friends at FactCheck.org have pointed out, the McCain campaign ignored an Obama remark in which he was criticizing McCain for not doing more than the battery prize.) In fact, Obama has said his energy plan will lead to more electric cars. In a speech on June 16, Obama said his proposal to invest $150-billion in energy programs would lead to new jobs "that will be created when plug-in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in Michigan." In a speech on May 14, he praised Chrysler for "working to develop a system that integrates electric motors with a fixed-gear transmission." That doesn't sound like "no" to us. Against innovation? To back that up, the McCain campaign cites the same line that McCain's battery plan was a gimmick. But Obama last October proposed a decade-long, $150-billion energy program that would increase research and create new jobs developing "climate-friendly energy supplies that will move us toward energy independence." An 11-page account of his plan, titled Barack Obama's Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader, includes incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and "safe and secure nuclear energy." That sounds to us like a pretty significant attempt at innovation. Which brings us to the McCain ad's last point, that Obama said "No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy." To the contrary, it's right there on page 4 of Obama's energy plan: "Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy." It's not a blanket endorsement — Obama says it's important to protect the security of nuclear fuel and waste and determine how to store the waste — but it's still a part of his plan. So McCain is way, way off with these charges. It's not that he's just missing nuances or exaggerating; he has completely distorted Obama's positions, falsely claiming that Obama opposes research and innovation on the most significant political issue of the summer. He portrays Obama as a impediment to energy research when the Democratic candidate has been at least as assertive on the issue as McCain has — and has been touting his energy plan since last October. It's so wrong we have to set the meter ablaze: Pants on Fire.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-27T00:00:00	2008-06-25	['None']
pomt-10420	A gas tax holiday is a gimmick that "every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/21/barack-obama/obama-goes-too-far-to-make-his-point/	Speaking to garment workers in Missouri on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said he would fight for real economic improvements "instead of gimmicks like a tax – a gas tax holiday – that every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies." He was referring to proposals by Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton to suspend the 18.4 cent-a-gallon federal gas tax for the summer travel season. It's true that economists have found oil companies don't pass the full benefit of gas tax holidays on to consumers. For that and other reasons, the vast majority of economists who have opined on the issue – in fact, every single one that we could find – oppose the holiday (aside from one outlier who liked it because it would benefit the oil industry). In fact, 308 economists have signed a letter opposing the holiday. But to say every economist believes the break would just go to the oil companies is an exaggeration. Even harsh critics of a gas tax holiday said consumers would see some benefit. Obama takes a fact in his favor – that the nation's economists have come down on his side in the gas tax debate – and stretches it a bit too far. Obama made his comments in a freewheeling question-and-answer session in Cape Girardeau, Mo., but his campaign has issued similarly unequivocal claims in television ads. "Experts say it'll just boost oil industry profits," a narrator intoned in one ad early this month. A 2006 study of a state gas tax holiday in Illinois in 2000 found that three-fifths of the benefit went to consumers. In the case of a federal gas tax break, drivers would reap a smaller share, but would still probably see more than half the benefit, said Joseph Doyle Jr., co-author of the study and an associate professor of economics at MIT. "My best guess is if you got rid of the 19-cent tax the price would go down by 10 cents," Doyle said. Other studies suggest a similar result. In a 2007 paper in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy (published by the Berkeley Electronic Press), economists Hayley Chouinard and Jeffery Perloff found that consumers and oil companies share the burden of the federal gasoline tax – that is, consumers end up paying 9 to 12 cents of the 18.4 cent tax and oil companies pay the rest. That suggests that if the tax were lifted, consumers might see a price reduction in that range over time. In an interview, Perloff said they had studied a 20-year time frame, and cautioned that his findings might not provide an accurate picture of what would happen during a temporary, three-month gas holiday. William Polley, an assistant professor of economics at Western Illinois University who reviewed much of the relevant economic scholarship on his blog , wrote that "it is safe to say that we (economists) stand firm in agreement that this (gas tax holiday) is a bad, bad idea." But he also said: "The benefit to the consumer would probably not be literally zero." While Obama's statement accurately expresses the dominant view of the low worth of this gas tax proposal, he rhetorically overstates his point. For that, we rule Half True.

pomt-02518	"Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/11/george-will/george-will-says-social-security-was-created-1930s/	The issue of Americans’ choices about whether to work attracted wide attention last week when the Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting that President Barack Obama’s health care law would lead to people deciding to work less. The CBO projection was spun -- largely incorrectly, in our estimation -- into claims that the health care law would kill more than 2 million jobs. But as commentators of all ideological stripes grappled with the complexities of this headline-grabbing statistic, discussion branched out into the question of whether a worker’s individual decision to work less was something positive, negative or a mixture of the two for the economy as a whole. Obama supporters suggested that the opportunity to buy health insurance outside a job was a boon to workers who hated their job or who wanted to work less so they could spend more time taking care of children or aging relatives. The president’s critics saw it as an example of the government essentially using tax dollars to encourage people not to work. This topic came up during a roundtable on the Feb. 9, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. During the segment, syndicated columnist George Will told host Chris Wallace, "People forget Social Security was advocated ... in the 1930s, as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country." We’d always believed Social Security stemmed from a desire help keep the elderly out of poverty, so we decided to take a look. (Will’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) We checked with eight historians who have written about the 1930s, including several who have studied the Social Security legislation that President Franklin D. Roosevelt shepherded into law in 1935. They told us there’s little evidence that Roosevelt or his administration sold Social Security as a way to get people to quit working, thus opening up jobs for younger, unemployed workers. However, several historians pointed to a different pension proposal that was popular in the United States at the time. This proposal, known as the Townsend Plan, did make that argument, more or less -- and its popularity was strong enough that it’s credited with prodding Roosevelt into advancing the more modest, compromise proposal that would ultimately become Social Security. The Townsend Plan In 1933, during the depths of the Depression, a doctor from Long Beach, Calif., named Francis E. Townsend came up with a plan to support the elderly. Under the proposal, the government would provide a $200-a-month pension to citizens age 60 or older, funded by a 2 percent national tax on transactions. To receive the benefits, a citizen would have to be retired and not a "habitual" criminal. And they would need to spend all of the money within 30 days. This appears to be the source of the notion that Social Security stemmed from efforts to get older Americans to retire. The Townsend Plan "was explicitly supposed to free up jobs, as well as stimulate the economy through spending," said Edwin Amenta, a University of California-Irvine sociologist who wrote the 2006 book, When Movements Matter: The Townsend Plan and the Rise of Social Security. "It was meant to end the Depression and bring permanent prosperity." The plan became wildly popular. "Dr. Townsend published his plan in a local Long Beach newspaper in early 1933, and within about two years, there were 7,000 Townsend Clubs around the country with more than 2.2 million members actively working to make the Townsend Plan the nation's old-age pension system," according to the Social Security Administration’s historical office. Public opinion surveys in 1935 found that 56 percent of Americans favored adoption of the Townsend Plan. This is not to say that the plan made much sense economically (Townsend was not a trained economist.) More plausible projections suggested that the tax rate would have needed to be between 6 percent and 14 percent -- not 2 percent -- to cover the cost of $200-a-month pensions. And there was no guarantee that the money spent by beneficiaries would exceed the amount that would have been spent by the taxpayers from whom it was taken -- a problem if you are trying to increase the amount of overall economic activity in the economy. And those $200-a-month pensions? They were double the typical monthly pay of ordinary workers. "It may well have been the most generous retirement pension promise of all time," according to the Social Security Administration’s historian. Roosevelt’s Social Security The Townsend Plan may have been economic pie in the sky -- but it had serious political influence. The strength of the grassroots movement that supported it is credited with pushing Roosevelt to fast-track an alternative. Roosevelt’s Labor secretary, Frances Perkins, wrote in her memoir The Roosevelt I Knew that the president said Congress "can't stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we are studying social security, a solid plan which will give some assurance to old people of systematic assistance upon retirement." Roosevelt’s more cautious plan was based on Americans being taxed on their earnings from work, then qualifying for old-age benefits based on how much they had paid into the system. By contrast, under Townsend’s plan, workers did not have to pay into the system, and the benefits they received were identical, regardless of how wealthy or poor they were. "The administration contrasted its proposal with the utopian and fantastic schemes of the Townsend Plan, and there was no suggestion that these pensions would end the Depression or significantly solve unemployment problems" of the ongoing depression, Amenta said. Indeed, Social Security was not designed to pay out benefits until 1942 -- seven years after passage. While that was eventually moved up to 1939, the delay in offering benefits undercuts the notion that the government wanted to force people to retire quickly and en masse. "Restoring the financial condition of the elderly in a way that did not bankrupt the country was a primary motivation for the program," said Edward Berkowitz, a historian at George Washington University and the author of several books about the history of Social Security. "Getting Americans to quit was only an indirect motivation." Indeed, in its public rhetoric, the administration played up the program’s ability to help the elderly, not on its larger macroeconomic impact. That seemed to mesh with public expectations. "The idea of creating a public pension system for the general population had been around since the 1920s or even earlier on the political left, but they faced three successive Republican presidents who were uninterested," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "So, nothing happened until there was a Democratic president with a large congressional majority backing him up." When Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, he said, "Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled. … We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age." Where the evidence supports Will’s claim While Will’s statement is largely unsupported, several historians said he has a partial point. Other pieces of Roosevelt’s agenda, including establishment of the National Recovery Administration from 1933 and 1935 and his reemployment agreements in 1933 "had goals of reducing weekly hours while maintaining or increasing employment" -- a mission not all that different from Will’s scenario, said Price Fishback, a University of Arizona economist. "Those fears were still there in 1935." Some scholars have also argued that the creation of Social Security actually helped crystallize the previously unfamiliar concept of "retirement." In an influential if somewhat controversial 1980 book, A History of Retirement: The Meaning and Function of an American Institution, 1885-1978, historian William Graebner wrote that Social Security grew out of a broader movement in industry toward the notion of retirement as a life stage, "one of whose functions was to move older people out of the workforce, partly for reasons of job availability and partly for reasons of efficiency," wrote Kathleen W. Jones, a Virginia Tech historian. Graebner, she wrote, saw Social Security as a way to reduce unemployment among the young. On balance, though, scholars say it’s important not to overplay the idea that Roosevelt intended -- or "advocated," to use Will’s word -- for Social Security to be a tool for transitioning the elderly out of the work force. What Will pointed to "is part of the story, although not the whole story by any means, because the crisis of the elderly was so severe," said Michael Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. "All major institutions and policies have multiple, not always consistent purposes." Our ruling Will said, "Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country." The idea that old-age pensions would transition older Americans out of the labor market and usher in younger, unemployed workers was a goal of the Townsend Plan (and of some other Roosevelt policies). But judging both by its design and by the rhetoric used to sell it, Roosevelt’s Social Security Act was targeted more at alleviating poverty among the elderly than at shaping the demographics of the labor market. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, Feb. 12, 2014: After we published this fact-check, a reader pointed us to an April 28, 1935, "fireside chat" by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that seemed to provide clearer support for George Will’s claim. Roosevelt said, "The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. … It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age." When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt’s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record. "Promoting retirement was a minor goal at best of the old-age parts of the legislation," said University of California-Irvine sociologist Edwin Amenta. Historian Jeff Shesol cited "the near-absence of this argument, not only in Roosevelt’s many remarks over the years but also in the internal deliberations, as recounted by multiple participants, over the Social Security framework." Since our original analysis had already acknowledged that transitioning older workers out of the labor force was "part of the story" of Social Security -- just not the main part -- we are sticking to our ruling of Mostly False.

pomt-06666	"Mike Trainor...still owes $250,000 to the state."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/11/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-chafee-staffer-michael-trainor-still-o/	Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. recently referred to a member of Governor Chafee’s staff as "the guy who still owes $250,000 to the state." Cianci’s jab at Michael F. Trainor, aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPRO’s "The Buddy Cianci Show." Because it wasn’t the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had "discharged" most of Trainor’s debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into. Trainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the state’s high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafee’s successful 2010 run for governor. But Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation. According to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents, here’s what happened: The duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution & Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters. Trainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees. But the business was short-lived. Just two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded. Trainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy. By then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainor’s house. The partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723. In September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainor’s petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. An explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: "The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.’’ The EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldn’t recover any money from its lien on Trainor’s home because the mortgage balance exceeded the property’s value. In December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, told The Providence Journal that he had not walked away from his obligations, saying he’d like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC. Governor Chafee discussed Trainor’s situation on Channel 12 "Newsmakers" in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. "[We’ll] make sure Mike does that,’’ he said. So it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money. Chafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235. That month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property. Six months later, in July, the bank sold his house at a foreclosure auction. Trainor served seven months as Chafee’s spokesman before he was transferred, in August, to the Department of Higher Education. His salary has dropped to $88,177. So, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims? "That debt was discharged,’’ Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. "(He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.’’ In other words, Richardson said, there’s no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan. But other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently. "Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt … but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesn’t destroy the debt at all,’’ Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. "It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.’’ The American Bankruptcy Institute was founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues. In other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable. So if the debt remains but Trainor isn’t obligated to repay it, does he really "owe" the state money? We called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term "owes." Trainor’s bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesn’t change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000. "Maybe it was discharged,’’ he said, "but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it." Said Richardson, the trustee: "I think it depends on whose point of view you’re looking at, the creditor or the debtor.’’ We agree. Practically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainor’s home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money. But even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said they’d make an effort made to repay the EDC. After all, a debt can be owed even if it’s never collected. For that reason, we rule Cianci’s statement Mostly True.	None	Vincent "Buddy" Cianci	None	None	None	2011-09-11T00:01:00	2011-09-01	['None']

pomt-09117	"Oil companies showered regulators (at the Minerals Management Service) with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/17/barack-obama/obama-blames-mms-being-captive-oil-industry/	In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address responding to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama touched on the dysfunctional record of the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office responsible for both collecting revenues from resource extraction on federal property and regulating drilling companies on those lands. "One place we’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service," Obama said. "Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves. At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations." We decided to focus on Obama's claim that "oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations." To analyze this statement, we decided to break it down into three parts. • Did oil companies offer "gifts and favors" to regulators? There's ample evidence that they did, at least in one Gulf coast office that was investigated. The most recent report of the Interior Department's Inspector General, released on May 25, 2010, found that employees of oil companies regulated by MMS footed the bill for a wide range of perks for employees of MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office. These included hunting and fishing trips; football games; and lunches. In a number of cases, the IG report named specific employees who acknowledged receiving gifts. This year's report followed a series of other IG reports that found a pattern of ethical violations -- including MMS employees' acceptance of free travel, sports tickets and ski outings -- in the agency's royalty-in-kind office. That office oversaw the collection of royalties from oil companies but did not do the kind of industry safety and environmental regulation that Obama was referring to in his Oval Office speech. Either way, this claim by the president seems to be based on solid evidence. • Were oil companies "essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections"? There's also evidence that this happened, from testimony before a joint hearing conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the MMS after the spill began. In an account of the hearings, the Washington Post reported that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sunk "was registered in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific archipelago that like many jurisdictions, authorizes private organizations such as ... Det Norske Veritas to inspect vessels that operate under its flag. The owners of the oil rigs decide which of those organizations to hire, and they pay for the services." The Post reported that when Thomas F. Heinan, deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands, was asked whether that arrangement presented a conflict of interest, he answered, "In some persons' minds it might, but it's been a long-standing facility that's been in place for years." The Post also reported that Coast Guard Capt. Verne B. Gifford testified that while the U.S. Coast Guard inspects oil rigs, "it relies on the private inspectors to do the bulk of the work" when those rigs are foreign-flagged. For those platforms, Gifford testified, the Coast Guard "goes onboard the vessel just to verify," a process that "usually takes maybe four to eight hours," the Post reported. This addresses inspections overseen by the Coast Guard, but there's also evidence -- somewhat less solid -- that something similar may have been happening with MMS, which was the main target of the president's comments. The IG report on MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office said that a confidential source "told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form." But while the confidential source's allegation was credible enough to include in the report, the IG's office stopped short of confirming the allegation, saying that their investigation of the original forms failed to assure them that the over-writing they found stemmed from fraudulent actions. • Were oil companies allowed to write their own regulations? This one is the murkiest of the three. In a May 10, 2010, article for McClatchy Newspapers, reporters Les Blumenthal and Erika Bolstad wrote that nearly 100 standards put together by the American Petroleum Institute -- the oil industry's trade group -- have made their way into federal offshore operating regulations. When we asked Blumenthal and Bolstad for their original source, they pointed us to a Jan 11, 2010, issue of the Federal Register. The Register -- the official daily listing of notices from federal agencies -- reported that the MMS "is incorporating by reference the Eleventh Edition of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Subsurface Safety Valve Equipment (API Spec 14A) into its regulations." It went on to explain that "we currently incorporate by reference 97 private sector consensus standards into the offshore operating regulations." We asked experts in federal regulation whether this sort of industry-agency collaboration was unusual, and whether it supported the president's assertion that the petroleum industry was writing its own regulations. James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that this sort of technical standards-writing "happens all the time." "It is quite common for regulatory agencies to adopt standards drafted, or already in use, in the private sector," he said. "It is especially common in very technical areas where specific expertise in the technologies involved is needed. Agencies, of course, should be wary of self-serving or anti-competitive provisions in such standards, and should use their own judgment in adopting them. But that doesn’t make the use of such standards generally inappropriate." Cynthia R. Farina, a Cornell University law professor and the principal investigator for the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, agreed, saying, "It's not unheard of for agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards for the content of federal regulation." It's also worth noting that the API's standards weren't slipped into federal rules at midnight in some smoke-filled room. The proposed rule was published on June 12, 2008, and for the next two months, the public had an opportunity to comment. Farina added that the regulation in question was put into place using a process that requires the Interior Department to consult with a variety of other government entities. As it turns out, only two entities did offer comments on this rule -- Baker Oil Tools and the Offshore Operators Committee. Farina calls this "a huge problem with rulemaking in general. Certainly the absence of comments from environmentalists and neutral researchers in the area would exacerbate concerns about industry 'writing its own regulations.'" Still, MMS can't be blamed for poor response to its call for comments. That's why we think that while Obama was on solid ground with his accusations that MMS regulators were "showered ... with gifts and favors" and that oil companies "were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections," the notion that industry wrote its own regulations is not a slam-dunk. While Obama is technically correct that the oil industry did in several dozen cases "write their own regulations," our experts agreed that industry/regulator collaboration is common across federal agencies, at least for technical matters, and that it was done in an open way that included the opportunity for public comment. As a whole, then, we rate the president's comment Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-06-17T18:44:23	2010-06-15	['None']
pomt-03647	"Every Florida teacher gets a pay raise."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/	Update: We updated this story to reflect updated budget proviso language that leaders agreed to May 1. These changes include removing the requirement that raises be delayed until June 2014 and giving boards the option to come up with their own merit-pay plans. Gov. Rick Scott declared "victory" after legislative leaders announced they included $480 million in the 2013-14 budget for teacher pay raises. Scott, who made a $2,500 pay raise for every teacher one of just two priorities this legislative session, announced the news on his Facebook page April 29: "Our teachers are some of the best in the nation and they deserve to be rewarded for their great work. Today I am proud to announce that every Florida teacher gets a pay raise." He included a photo of a male teacher with can’t-miss-it, all-caps text that reads "EVERY FLORIDA TEACHER GETS A PAY RAISE! IT’S WORKING." He’s over-simplifying it. The truth is, the Legislature’s offering of $480 million for raises may be in the amount Scott wanted, but he’s glossing over the fine print for how they want it spent. Earlier in the session, House and Senate leaders weren’t keen on Scott’s idea because it does not align with 2011 legislation they pitched and Scott signed implementing a merit pay system for teachers. But with a week left in session, leaders found a way to please both sides. Here are three details not included in Scott’s Facebook post, which last we checked had more than 2,400 likes: The raises would not be limited to just teachers. They are not immediate. And they are not a guarantee. You can find the conditions the Legislature placed in its bill implementing next year’s budget (page 21). House and Senate leadership agreed to allow for salary increases not only for school district and charter school classroom teachers, but for guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists, librarians, principals and assistant principals. The throng of education workers would not see an immediate raise. Initially, the budget was written so they would have to wait until June 2014 before getting a lump-sum payment for the 2013-14 school year. Hearing negative feedback on this provision, House and Senate changed this language so that school boards can distribute salary increases anytime before June 2014 "as negotiated with collective bargaining units and educators." But that’s if they qualify. The raises are based on merit. Lawmakers suggested school professionals be judged based on 2013-14 performance evaluations to be determined by school districts and approved by the state Department of Education. For education personnel deemed "effective," lawmakers recommended salary increases of at least $2,500. Those rated "highly effective" are eligible for up to $3,500. New language that lawmakers added May 1 gives districts the options to come up with their own merit-pay plans, a move the FEA applauded. But there is still no mandate that every teacher get a raise. Factors that districts could use in their evaluations may include results on Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate assessments, as well as SAT, ACT, FCAT and end-of-course exam results. For those who don’t teach courses with standardized tests, districts will develop separate evaluation criteria. The Legislature took a different approach for state workers, awarding them $1,000 or $1,400 pay hikes (plus a chance for $600 more for some based on merit) depending on their income starting in October. Law enforcement officers would get their raise this summer. The caveats for teachers disappointed the Florida Education Association, which praised Scott for his efforts but dinged the Legislature for the strings attached, as well as Miami-Dade and Broward county superintendents Alberto Carvalho and Robert Runcie. The superintendents said they could not afford to give every teacher $2,500 on top of paying the "unfunded mandate" of raises for principals and staff. (Carvalho said the updated language is a positive move.) The South Florida superintendents said even though the Legislature will increase per-pupil funding by $1 billion statewide ($134 million for Miami-Dade and $93 million for Broward), there would still not be enough money to pay for raises, other benefits and healthcare, and other earmarks from the state, according to the Miami Herald. "The math simply does not add up," Runcie said. Based on the 2011-12 evaluations, just about every teacher would qualify for a raise. Of the teachers who were evaluated, 22.6 percent of teachers were highly effective and 74.6 percent were effective, leaving just under 3 percent of teachers with ratings of needs improvement or unsatisfactory. Ten percent of the state’s teachers were not evaluated. The numbers were similar for non-classroom personnel measured by merit pay, though 27.2 percent were not evaluated, according to Department of Education data. Even with the merit requirements, Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said it’s not realistic to think unions and districts won’t try to get money to all teachers. The budget language is written flexibly enough so that districts are not precluded from using money from the state to award every teacher a raise, even if they do not qualify for merit pay or are rated below effective. Miami Rep. Erik Fresen, who is in charge of House education appropriations, told the Miami Herald "we provided $480 million for districts to provide much-deserved salary increases to whom they determine meet their criteria of effective." His Senate counterpart, Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, told us while the raises are not guaranteed to every teacher, "At the end of the day, there should be something for everybody." But it’s not up to Scott, or the Legislature for that matter. Florida law says the state cannot dictate teacher salaries. Teacher salaries are negotiated between the school districts and teachers union. So even though legislators approved a half-billion dollar pot of money for teacher raises, there is no guarantee that every teacher will get a raise. School districts in talks with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises, who doesn’t and how much. All the state and Scott can do is strongly suggest how school districts dish out the extra money they’re getting. "However, it must be kept in mind that other funding increases are being provided to school districts," said FEA spokesman Mark Pudlow. "Presumably, that money could be bargained for increased salaries, so technically, every Florida teacher ‘may get a pay raise.’" Our ruling Rick Scott said "every Florida teacher gets a pay raise." Will every Florida teacher get a pay raise? It seems likely, with the influx of money poured into education this year. But Scott can’t decree it, and the budget is written so that it applies to high-performing educators. Plus, some superintendents have said the inclusion of non-instructional personnel will make it harder if not impossible to award every teacher a raise. We rate Scott’s statement Half True.

pomt-03404	If it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/01/bill-maher/bill-maher-said-immigration-bill-will-make-border-/	On a recent episode of his HBO talk show, comedian Bill Maher said it was outrageous how much the Border Patrol is poised to expand due to an amendment to the Senate immigration bill. Maher was referring to an amendment sponsored by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add "19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border." The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.) If the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy." A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The bill is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI" The amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts, this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000. The most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That’s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it’s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees. Want an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies. The FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment’s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.) So, however you slice it, Maher’s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted. "You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet" According to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet. Doing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher’s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate. Needless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn’t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher’s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet.

pomt-14809	For NATO exercises, "we don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/25/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-united-states-lacks-military-equipme/	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush called for using ground troops against the Islamic State and beefing up our military the week after the Paris terrorist attacks. Bush criticized President Barack Obama and Congress for weakening the military through "careless, chronic neglect," summing up the lack of sufficient personnel and equipment with a single anecdote. "To conduct training exercises under our NATO obligations in Europe, American forces have been borrowing helicopters and other vehicles from our allies. Really," Bush said in a speech at The Citadel on Nov. 18. "We don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers. That’s just not unsafe — that’s embarrassing for the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Whatever challenges we face in Europe or elsewhere, we’re not going to meet them with borrowed equipment." China, however, has been spending heavily on new military equipment, Bush said. We wanted to know if the U.S. military is so hard up that it’s borrowing choppers from the Brits. Borrowed equipment Military experts told PolitiFact that the decline in equipment and personnel dates back to the end of the Cold War, so it’s not entirely the fault of Obama and Republicans in Congress. However, the cuts have been stepped up over recent years as part of sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a budget agreement. A spokesman for the Bush campaign sent us two October 2015 news articles quoting Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the Army’s commanding general in Europe, talking about his equipment shortages. As the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe has dropped 35 percent since 2012, the Army has reduced some equipment or relocated it, the New York Times reported. It’s possible for the Army to bring equipment to Europe from bases in the United States, but that is expensive and time consuming. "I don’t have bridges, I don’t have the trucks that can carry tanks, we don’t have enough helicopters to do what we need to do," Hodges told the New York Times. "Practicing with British helicopters here is an essential part of it. Using British and German bridges, using Hungarian air defense is part of it." A spokesman for the Army, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said Hodges has consistently said that his forces lack sufficient airplanes. "Whether this is 'embarrassing' or simply a reality of Army force structure relative to global conditions is a matter of opinion," Buccino said. He confirmed that the Army has been sharing equipment — as it did during a multinational exercise in Europe in August. "This is not a new development," Buccino said. "Our forces often train with partnered militaries using host-nation equipment. In fact, training with NATO allies across platforms and equipment allows us to develop interoperability across the alliance, which would be crucial if we have to fight in the European theater." The United States started scaling back in Europe about 25 years ago, a strategy "predicated on the notion of benign or at least non-hostile Russia," said Mark Cancian, a retired colonel with the Marines Reserve and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "What’s happened in the last two years has upset those assumptions, and everybody recognizes that." Obama "gets a little credit" for trying to beef up the military in Europe, Cancian said. The Obama administration put together the European Reassurance Initiative, which includes $985 million for 2015 and requested $789 million in 2016. Steve Saideman, a professor at Carleton University in Canada who recently wrote a book about NATO, said the whole idea of NATO exercises is to improve working together, so it makes sense that it would include riding in another nation’s airplanes. Plus, it can be cheaper than sending them in from overseas. "I really don’t see the problem with this," Saideman told PolitiFact. "It is a way to grandstand on the issue, but it has no real substance. The larger issue facing the military is the unpredictability produced by sequestration, and Bush’s party represents half or more of the sequestration problem." Lisa Samp, a Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow, says that Bush’s statement sounds like a bit of semantics. "If in a multinational training exercise we put U.S. soldiers on another nations’ troop transport vehicles or aircraft, are we ‘borrowing’ their equipment or simply conducting joint training?" said Samp, who served as director for NATO and European Strategic Affairs at the National Security Council from 2014-15. Samp said that there is a disconnect between our stated commitment in Europe and the forces we have there. "The good news in Europe is that we have allies to help fill gaps; this is not so much a sign of weakness (as Bush suggests) but of a working alliance," she said. The decline of American forces in Europe is an outgrowth of the planned pivot to Asia, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. And as PolitiFact Florida has previously noted, the military is in the process of buying and upgrading all sorts of military equipment, including the largest aircraft procurement ever: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. One final note on China, which Bush said is increasing its military capability. The United States spent as much on the military in 2013 as the next eight countries combined, including China. "Jeb Bush claims the United States military risks sliding to inferiority. Inferior to who exactly?" said Matthew Fay, a defense expert at the libertarian Niskanen Center. "By the best available estimates, the United States spent over $300 billion more than China and Russia combined in 2014." Our ruling Bush said, for NATO exercises "we don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers." The U.S. Army in Europe has used military equipment of allies as part of NATO obligations. However, Bush omits that the U.S. military has been cutting back in Europe since the Cold War, so cuts over eight years are nothing new. Experts say the equipment sharing isn’t as problematic as Bush makes it seem because the military is working with allies as part of NATO. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09121	Says the Republican “state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/17/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-believe-it-or-not-republican-state-c/	Warming up for last week’s Republican State Convention in Dallas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made a Texas-sized boast in a video posted on his campaign Web site Wednesday. “It may be hard to believe, “ Dewhurst said, “but our (Republican) state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention.” Getouttahere! Dewhurst’s campaign spokesman, Mike Walz, said in an e-mail that Dewhurst’s calculation was based on comparing the number of delegates and alternates to this June’s state confab and the number of delegates and alternates chosen to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minnesota. First, Walz pointed to About.com and CNN Web posts, both stating there were 2,380 delegates to the party’s national convention. Next, he noted a recent Dallas Morning News article stating 12,000 GOP activists went to the state convention and a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article stating more than 10,000 delegates and alternates were expected. We also asked the Republican Party of Texas about its count of 2010 convention attendees. Spokesman Bryan Preston replied that “we have just under 12,000 delegates & alternates. Add the guests and VIPs and we’ll hit” 15,000 to 16,000 participants. Why so many people? For decades, state party rules have provided one delegate for every 300 votes cast for the Republican nominee in the latest governor’s race, which explains why the biennial gatherings are held in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio; other cities don’t have halls big enough to cram such crowds into one space. Driven by the ratio, the party’s potential turnout of delegates and alternates surged from nearly 10,000 in 1984 to more than 17,000 in 2004, according to research by Clint Moore of Houston, a longtime member of the party’s Rules Committee. The number of permitted delegates and alternates dipped to 11,500 in 2008 because Gov. Rick Perry saw a drop in his vote haul in 2006 while fending off three major challengers. Does that mean the total delegate count could keep rising election after election, mostly because of population growth? Nope. Delegates voted at last week’s convention to cap delegates at 9,000 starting with the 2012 state convention. The decision ensures that Fort Worth, intended site of the next two conventions, can comfortably serve as host city. The local convention center has a fixed-seat capacity of about 10,500, according to Eric Opiela, a former party executive director just elected to the executive committee. Nevertheless, the Texas delegate count this year far surpasses the 2008 national convention’s count. We wondered if there’s another way to compare the sizes of the state and national gatherings. Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, guided us to a study of the economic impact of the 2008 convention on the host cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul. The study, by the Minneapolis-St. Paul 2008 Host Committee, states that 45,000 “guests” came to the Twin Cities for the four-day gathering, driving more than $150 million in spending. Separately, the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau told us the recent state convention delivered a local economic impact of more than $6.3 million. Riggs also noted a news article published in May by the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times stating that 50,000 delegates, protesters and reporters are expected to attend the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. So how does Dewhurst’s statement shake out? This month’s GOP state convention drew more delegates than the 2008 national convention, but economic and other indicators suggest the national convention ultimately draws more people. Similarly, though Dewhurst’s boast is justified by one measurement, by another it doesn’t add up. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00170	"For perspective, Special Session costs you $50k, every single day. That’s roughly the average teacher’s salary in NC."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/chaz-beasley/dems-claim-session-costs-much-teacher/	It’s been a hectic few months for North Carolina lawmakers, starting with debate in a special session over six constitutional amendments Republicans had placed on the ballot. A panel of judges then ruled the ballot language for two of these amendments unconstitutional. So another special session of the North Carolina General Assembly was held to rewrite the amendments before elections, over the objections of Democrats. Those weren’t the only special sessions. Gov. Roy Cooper called for another session after Hurricane Florence devastated much of Eastern North Carolina. Taxpayer money is financing these special sessions. And during the second session, some Democrats expressed their displeasure by sharing the daily cost of their work in Raleigh. Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Democrat from Charlotte, tweeted: "Special Session costs you $50k, every single day. That’s roughly the average teacher’s salary in NC." Beasley is not the only one putting this number into the Twitterverse. Another tweet by Lisa Mathis, a Democratic candidate from Sanford, said: "Raleigh politician John Sauls is helping to flush another 50k down the drain w/ the #specialsession." Beasley told PolitiFact he got his information from a WRAL report from 2014. The report says $50,000 is an estimate from Financial Services staff since the General Assembly does not provide what the exact costs are. The actual cost is closer to $42,000, according to figures provided by Paul Coble, the legislative services officer at the General Assembly. Coble sent PolitiFact the cost of operations for the General Assembly from 2005 to 2015. "An average daily cost of a session is approximately $42,000. This number would be the same for a regularly scheduled day of session, or an ‘extra session,’" Coble wrote in a letter to PolitiFact. That’s the amount that the state spends in addition to the money it would normally spend when lawmakers aren’t in session. More recent years have been even more expensive. The average daily cost of sessions in the 2014-2015 fiscal year was about $46,000, closer to the number Beasley is using. The information Coble provided does not go beyond June 2015. Politicians have been using the average salary of teachers as a benchmark to compare the daily cost of special sessions. Beasley used the $50,000 number to make the point that it’s about the same as the average North Carolina teacher’s salary in 2018. The average teacher salary is $51,144, according to a report in February 2018 by the state Department of Public Instruction detailing the state education budget. What if we want to compare the cost of session in 2014-2015 to the average teacher salary in the 2014-15 school year? According to the National Education Association, teachers in North Carolina were making about $48,000 at the time. That’s extremely close to cost of session per day. The daily cost of a session goes towards numerous things, such as fiscal research, building maintenance, food services and much more. And as reported by The News and Observer, legislators were being paid $104 for every day they were in session to cover the costs of lodging and food. With the exception of the House and Senate leaders, who are paid $38,151 annually, legislators are paid $13,951 annually. Our ruling The daily cost of operations for the General Assembly, using the most recent numbers available, is about $46,000 if the legislature is in session. That is close to the number Beasley and other Democrats have been using. However, their statements refer to information from almost three years ago, and we have been unable to attain data for this year’s session. And it’s not far off from the average teacher salary. We give this statement a Mostly True rating.

pomt-01390	Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour "will destroy between half a million and one million jobs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-hike-would-destr/	In the first and only debate of Kentucky’s U.S. Senate race, Sen. Mitch McConnell was peppered with questions about his opposition to a proposed minimum wage hike. In response, McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, said raising the minimum wage in already difficult economic times would hurt employment. He cited a Congressional Budget Office study that he claimed said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would "destroy half a million to 1 million jobs." "That’s not the way to grow our economy," he added. His Democratic challenger, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, countered that the report also noted a minimum wage hike would lift, "over a million Americans out of poverty." (In a separate fact-check, we rated that Mostly True.) We’re taking a look at McConnell’s claim in this fact-check. The report in question from the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for Congress, came out in February 2014. It took a look at President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 in 2016. The report found most low-wage workers "would received higher pay that would increase their family’s income." But the report said there’s a downside as well. Some people could lose their jobs. Why? An increase in wages would increase companies’ costs. That causes companies to raise their prices, which means fewer people want their goods or services, leading to less production and fewer workers needed to get the job done. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers also encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing more productive higher-wage workers. For example, it might be cheaper to pay more for new machines that can replace workers, than to pay higher minimum wages. The net impact of this? The CBO estimates a total reduction in the workforce of about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. How, then, did McConnell get between "half a million and 1 million jobs" would be destroyed? The CBO is very careful to note that 500,000 is a rough estimate and the midpoint of the range of likely outcomes. The report said, "There is about a two-thirds chance that the effect would be in the range between a very slight reduction in employment and a reduction in employment of 1 million workers." Instead of quoting the halfway point or — most accurately — offering the full-range of estimates, McConnell presents the top half of likely outcomes as though it’s fact. It’s just as likely that there are somewhere between very few and 499,999 jobs lost, but you would not get that impression from McConnell’s statement. Our ruling McConnell claimed that a Congressional Budget Office report said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour "will destroy between half a million and one million jobs." The report said "roughly" 500,000 workers could lose their jobs if the minimum wage went up. But the CBO added that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. McConnell focuses on the high-end of the spectrum on a range of potential outcomes. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2014-10-14T17:35:14	2014-10-13	['None']

pomt-12054	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand "no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/08/american-israel-public-affairs-committee/gillibrand-still-opposes-boycott-israel-despite-fl/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand no longer supports a bill she originally co-sponsored that would punish people for boycotting Israel. "I am going to urge the authors of the bill to change the bill, and I will not support it in its current form," Gillibrand said at a town hall meeting in Queens. The bill targets individuals and companies who participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led effort to remove international support for Israel by asking global leaders and businesses to cut ties with the country. Offenders could face heavy fines and even jail time under the bill. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent an email to its supporters about Gillibrand’s flip a few days after the event. "New York’s junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.720), sending a powerful message to her constituents that she no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel," the email said. AIPAC is one of the most influential lobbying groups for pro-Israel interests in the U.S. Each major party candidate for president spoke at its conference last year. Gillibrand has taken a lot of flack since the email blast, including from Jewish leaders and online publications. A letter to the editor published in the New York Daily News claims Gillibrand now supports the BDS movement. Pro-Palestinian groups have even thanked Gillibrand for opposing the bill. Does her new stance on the bill mean she supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement? Gillibrand in context Gillibrand said she changed her position after meeting with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the bill. "We went through their reading of the bill and why they believe it says — it chills free speech, which means the bill is ambiguous," Gillibrand said at the town hall. The bill would fine individuals or companies anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million for engaging in any activity that supports the BDS movement, according to the ACLU. Violators could also face up to 20 years in prison. Gillibrand changed her position because, in her view, individuals should not face that kind of punishment for expressing their opinion. "I’m against BDS but I think anybody who’s in favor should feel very comfortable speaking on any stage, anywhere in America, saying exactly why," Gillibrand said. "That is what free speech is about, and I fully support it." Gillibrand said she does support penalizing companies that participate in BDS. Gillibrand responded to her critics more than a week later in an opinion piece on Forward, a Jewish news website. "Some have suggested that I suddenly began supporting the BDS movement when I took my name off the bill. This accusation has popped up on the Internet in recent days – both from Israel’s supporters and from Israel’s detractors. This is just plain false," Gillibrand wrote. "I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement." Our ruling AIPAC told its supporters Gillibrand "no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel." AIPAC did not respond to a request to clarify its statement. Gillibrand has made it clear, both during the town hall and after, that she still opposes the BDS movement. She does not support the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in its current form because she believes it violates individual liberties. The claim misleads readers who may now believe Gillibrand supports the BDS movement. We rate it False.

pomt-07111	"President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine’s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/20/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-senate-group-says-tim-kaines-stimulus-failed-c/	As Democrat Tim Kaine campaigns for the Senate, Republicans are hoping to link him with the stimulus bill passed by Congress in 2009. Kaine was governor of Virginia and had just become chairman of the Democratic National Committee when President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Feb. 17, 2009. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the Senate, is saying the stimulus failed to put Americans back to work. "President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine’s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs," the NRSC said in a June 3 press release. Did the stimulus really fail to create jobs? Lots of Republicans are saying that, and we thought we’d take a look. Chris Bond, a spokesman for the NRSC, said the statement is based on Kaine’s assurances in February 2009 that the stimulus would save or create 3 million jobs. Bond also noted that the unemployment rate is at 9.1 percent and has been above 8 percent for 28 months in a row. But the NRSC press release says nothing about 3 million jobs. The statement simply charges that the stimulus "failed to create jobs." This is an old Republicans charge. Earlier this month we gave House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, a False rating when he said the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." Let’s review some of the evidence we found then. The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus. Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans. White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools. Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the state’s department of education, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money. A March report by the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: *CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. *IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. *Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. *Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. A side note: We also found it a stretch that the NRSC is giving Obama and Kaine equal ownership of the stimulus. Kaine was governor in 2009 and never voted on the bill nor participated in its drafting. Later, he did emerge as a key spokesman for stimulus as Obama’s hand-picked DNC chairman. Let’s review. The NRSC says the stimulus "failed to create jobs." The stimulus may not have created as many jobs as Republicans and Democrats hoped. But there’s no doubt it put many people back to work and preserved the jobs of many more. We rate the NRSC statement False.

pomt-05591	If Rhode Island raises the meal and beverage tax to 10 percent, it would be the "fourth-highest in the nation."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/01/john-elkhay/providence-restaurateur-john-elkhay-says-if-rhode-/	At a recent rally in Providence against a proposal to raise Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax, restaurant owners and staff gathered with dozens of other protesters on the State House lawn and marched to Waterplace Park, where they "dumped" 30 pounds of tea into the Woonasquatucket River. This was no Boston Tea Party -- the tea was sealed in a plastic bag and attached to a rope so it was easily retrieved from the river -- but the protesters at the March 21 rally shouted their message for all to hear: Governor Chafee’s plan to hike the tax from 8 percent to 10 percent would discourage people from eating out and harm the state’s hospitality industry. Providence restaurateur John Elkhay, of the Chow Fun Food Group, was at the head of the march, leading the crowd in chants against the tax increase. At one point, he yelled out that a 10 percent meal and beverage tax in Rhode Island would be the "fourth-highest in the nation." The Ocean State has developed a reputation for high taxes. We’ve already written about the property tax burden in the state, specifically Providence’s dubious distinction of having the second-highest commercial property tax burden in the country. But we hadn’t heard claims about the state meal tax before. We left a message for Elkhay, whose restaurants include XO Cafe, Rick’s Roadhouse and Luxe Burger Bar. Then we did our own research. Meal taxes are also sometimes known as "restaurant taxes" or "prepared-food taxes" and are generally levied on top of sales taxes. Meal taxes do not refer to taxing groceries, or "non-prepared food." In fact, groceries are completely or partly exempt from sales taxes in nearly all states, including Rhode Island. The General Assembly created Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax in 2003 as a way to tamp down local property tax increases. The 1-percent tax is imposed on top of the state’s 7-percent sales tax. Revenue from the 1-percent tax goes to cities and towns while revenue from the 7-percent tax goes to the state. Add the taxes together and diners pay an 8-percent tax when eating out in Rhode Island. Chafee’s plan is to raise the meal tax to 3 percent for a total tax of 10 percent. Most other states allow a similar tax but it’s more commonly levied by individual municipalities. For example, at the height of the recession in 2009 the state legislature in Massachusetts passed a bill allowing cities and towns to impose a 0.75 percent meal tax on top of the state’s 6.25 percent sales tax. By the following year, more than 70 communities had adopted the meal tax to supplement their budgets. Elsewhere in New England, New Hampshire and Vermont both have a statewide meal tax of 9 percent. Maine’s is 7 percent. Connecticut, where the sales tax is 6.35 percent, has no special meal tax. Because meal taxes are generally levied on the municipal level, the studies we found compared rates in cities rather than states. The most recent study was released earlier this month by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C. It examined the tax in the 50 most populous cities in the nation (35 of which don’t have a special meal tax, just a sales tax). At the top of the list was Minneapolis, which imposes a 3 percent meal tax on top of the city’s 7.775 sales tax for a total tax of 10.775 percent. Chicago was second with a 1.25 percent meal tax on top of a 9.5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.75 percent. And Virginia Beach was third with a whopping 5.5 percent meal tax on top of a 5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.5 percent. Washington, D.C., and Seattle were tied for fourth with a total tax on restaurant meals of 10 percent -- the same rate Rhode Island would have under Chafee’s proposal. We asked the Tax Foundation if it could break out the states that impose a meal tax statewide so we could make an apples-to-apples comparison with Rhode Island’s rate, but the foundation did not have that information. The Washington, D.C.-based National Restaurant Association gave us a different national study on meal taxes, this one done by researchers at the University of Denver in 2007. Although its ranking was similar to the one done by the Tax Foundation, parts of it were outdated. So for this item, we’ve chosen to rely on the Tax Foundation study. It’s important to note that Rhode Island’s high ranking for its meal tax is driven by the state’s high sales tax. At 7 percent, Rhode Island has the second-highest statewide sales tax in the country, behind only California. Slap on another 1 percent -- or 3 percent with Chafee’s latest proposal -- and you’re in double digits when it comes to meals. Other states do assess higher taxes for meals. In Virginia, localities are allowed a meal tax of up to 6.5 percent on top of a 5-percent sales tax. In Richmond, which isn’t large enough to have made the lists from the Tax Foundation or the University of Denver, the total tax is 11 percent. Eight other small municipalities in that state levy the full 11.5 percent tax. When a spokeswoman for Elkhay got back to us, she said that he got the information on meal taxes in other states from the same sources we found -- the recent Tax Foundation study and the older report from the University of Denver. Our ruling Restaurateur John Elkhay says Governor Chafee’s proposed 10-percent meal and beverage tax would be the "fourth-highest in the nation." Most meal taxes in other states are applied by cities and towns, so a comparison should take in those localized rates. And according to the most recent study from the Tax Foundation, a 10 percent rate in Rhode Island would be tied for fourth-highest in the nation. But shoehorning Rhode Island into the list is imperfect, because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. And there’s another issue, too. The Tax Foundation list considered only the 50 most populous cities in the nation, so it didn’t take into account every meal tax imposed in every locality. In Virginia alone, we found nine smaller communities that would make it to the top of the Tax Foundation list. Elkhay’s statement is partially accurate -- increasing Rhode Island’s meal tax would make it one of the highest rates in the country. But we can’t say definitively that it would be fourth-highest. Because the claim "leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rate it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13275	Says Pete Gallego "went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress."	false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/12/national-republican-congressional-committee/republican-group-says-fired-pete-gallego-turned-ar/	Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, wants Pete Gallego of Alpine back in the U.S. House, according to a TV ad from a Republican group backing the incumbent in the seat representing the 23rd Congressional District sprawling south and west from San Antonio. And why, the ad’s narrator says? He says: "Because Gallego is the insider’s insider. Career politician. Went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress." Fair enough on the politician part; Gallego, a lawyer, was a Texas House member for more than 20 years before winning election to Congress in 2012. Two years later, though, he lost re-election to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes, who’s now trying to win his second term. The National Republican Congressional Committee ad shows Gallego smiling as he strolls what looks like a major Washington, D.C. avenue. Text simultaneously flashes: "Career politician," then "Gallego lobbied" with these words in smaller type at the bottom of the screen: "City of Austin, 2015." https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/505c2984-7393-475b-aac6-534c66d2f87d SOURCE: Screen grab, TV advertisement, "She’s a Fan," National Republican Congressional Committee, YouTube, Oct. 4, 2016 Gallego might be in legal trouble if he went to lobby right away on Washington’s infamous K Street where lobbying firms marshal forces. A 2007 law bars former House members from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving the body. Then again, news reports including a July 2016 Politico story suggest that despite the "cooling off" mandate, former senators and House members continue to enjoy lucrative careers trying to influence lawmakers. As of October 2016, too, the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that 49 percent of the former members of the 113th Congress, which was in session through 2014, had already gone to work for lobbying firms. Its list, though, didn’t link Gallego to any firm. And asked to share the basis of the lobbyist claim, NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter, who confirmed the ad video showed Gallego strolling in Washington, pointed out Gallego’s August 2015 federal personal financial disclosure indicating he was paid $55,000 that year to work for Austin’s city government. Hunter also emailed us 10 documents that appeared to come from Gallego’s city employee personnel file. City officials: Gallego didn't lobby We confirmed the authenticity of the city-connected documents by asking a city spokesman, David Green, for the public portions of Gallego’s employee personnel file. Those documents indicate Gallego was employed in "government relations" for 40 hours a week from March 2, 2015, through Aug. 21, 2015, at an hourly rate of $56.26. At our inquiry, Green also shared the financial calculations that bear out the city ultimately paying Gallego $55,359. For part of that time, through June 1, 2015, the Texas Legislature was in session. So, might it be that Gallego proved helpful to the city by lobbying legislators? To the contrary, Green and a former Gallego superviser each told us Gallego had been hired not to lobby legislators but to advise the city on legislative and legal matters. Gallego, Green said by email, "advised the government relations officer on policy and legislation and assisted in document preparation and strategy." Green told us John Hrncir, then the government relations officer, was one of Gallego’s supervisors. When we called Hrncir, who retired in May 2015, he said he’d recommended that the city consider adding Gallego to its government relations team after Hugh Brady left city government to work in President Barack Obama’s administration. According to Brady’s entry on LinkedIn.com, he was a special assistant city attorney and legislative counsel to the city until March 2014 when he became general counsel in the executive office of the president. In his city role, Brady’s entry says, he advised city officials and drafted "state and federal legislative instruments involving taxes, land use, water, government finance, regulatory authority, redistricting, collective bargaining, pensions and telecommunications." By email, Hrncir wrote that "in a typical legislative session the city is potentially impacted by 25% or more of the bills considered. The city usually has to pay attention to the 1,200 to 2,000 bills impacting it the most of the five to seven thousand filed. Deciding which legislative provisions to amend, pass, or defeat, and the time and effort to spend on each action, is a constant process, and decisions are revised, sometimes hourly, until the final gavel at sine die. "Pete Gallego is an experienced former (legislator) who had demonstrated exceptional ability at solving problems by finding solutions palatable to multiple factions of legislators--both parties; rural and urban reps; business and environmental advocates; etc. The constant triage for bills and amendments is critical to the city's success and I was confident that Gallego's advice to the team would be invaluable in maximizing the city's resources." Gallego responds In gauging this claim, we also queried Gallego’s campaign. By email, spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez said the implication that Gallego was a Washington lobbyist doesn’t hold up. Gallego, Rodriguez said, was a temporary in-house employee of the City of Austin for approximately a six-month period of time" and not among the city’s outside paid lobbyists, she wrote, noting that he also didn’t register as a lobbyist with the Texas Ethics Commission, which we confirmed from records listing outside lobbyists paid by the city to lobby in 2015. Gallego, Rodriguez wrote, "reported directly to the city attorney and provided the city attorney with opinions on legislative language and process. Pete also reviewed legislation, during and after session, to determine its impact on the city." Following up, we asked if Gallego in 2015 testified before a legislative committee or perhaps registered a position on behalf of the city; those are the kinds of duties often fulfilled by a lobbyist. "He did not," Rodriguez replied. We also reached Brian Yarbrough, among outside lobbyists paid by the city, who told us by phone he wasn't aware of Gallego directly lobbying for the city that year and didn't recall even seeing him in the Texas Capitol. Our ruling The pro-Hurd Republican group says Gallego "went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress." For half of 2015 including three months of the legislative session, Gallego worked in government relations for Austin’s city government. But the NRCC didn’t provide nor did we find evidence he was working as a lobbyist--either in Austin or Washington, which the ad arguably implies. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01645	The No. 1 cause of death for African-American males 15-34 is murder.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/24/juan-williams/juan-williams-no-1-cause-death-african-americans-1/	Amid ongoing protests in Ferguson, Mo., the national conversation about racial justice and police force has ignored a critical point that needs to be discussed, said Fox News pundit Juan Williams Civil rights activists and black leaders have failed to address the very thing that’s fueling conservative, white backlash — the high crime rate among the black community, particularly among young black men, Williams said on Aug. 24th’s Fox News Sunday. "I think there’s fear of intimidation, harassment being legitimized by the fact that there is a high rate of crime, especially among young black men," Williams said. "No. 1 cause of death, young black men 15 to 34 — murder. Who’s committing the murder? Not police. Other black men." Last year, PolitiFact found that 93 percent of murder victims were killed by someone who shares their race. This time, we want to check out Williams’ claim that homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old. Unnatural causes We looked at numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists the leading causes of death across all demographics. Experts said that CDC data, compiled from coroner reports, are in line with FBI numbers, sourced from police reports. The CDC does not distinguish between the types of homicide (criminal, justified, etc.) or the types of accidents (auto accidents, falls, firearm discharge, etc.). The numbers for 2011, the most recent CDC findings, are consistent with data from previous years. According to the CDC, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011. Accidents ranked second in causes of death, and suicide claimed the third amount of black male lives between 15 and 24 years old, while heart disease ranked third for men 24-34. Leading causes of death among black males 1st 2nd 3rd All ages Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 1-4 Accidents Homicide Congenital malformations 5-14 Accidents Malignant neoplasms Homicide 15-24 Homicide Accidents Suicide 25-34 Homicide Accidents Diseases of the heart 35-44 Diseases of the heart Accidents Homicide 45-54 Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 55-84 Malignant neoplasms Diseases of the heart Cerebrovascular diseases 84-older Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Cerebrovascular diseases Source: CDC Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died. Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered. In 2011, black males 15-34 were 10 times more likely to die of murder than whites of the same age group. Sources: CDC, PunditFact calculations For men of all ages, homicide was ranked fifth in leading causes of deaths for blacks (4.6 percent), seventh for Hispanics (2.8 percent), and ninth for American Indians (2.3 percent). Homicide was not one of the top 15 causes of death for whites 15-34. Color lines Why are so many young black males dying from homicide? As the laws of aging go, younger men are less prone to fall victim to natural causes of death, so they are more likely to die of unnatural causes. And the racial disparity between those causes has partially to do with the likelihood of getting into car-related accidents, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. "Suburban whites drive more than urban blacks, and putting in more miles on highways — that’s important because not a lot of people are going to get killed in fender benders in neighborhood streets," Fox said. "There are relatively few auto-accidents in black urban areas." Beyond driving habits, the criminal homicide rate among young black males is significantly higher than other groups. This, experts agreed, has to do with poverty and geography. The difference in social structures, access to jobs, educational opportunities, and many other factors between impoverished black neighborhoods and others is often a matter of life and death, according to Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "The (homicide) numbers highlight the condition in minority areas, where a lot of violence occurs and the whole way of life is further intensified because police surveillance is always trying to track down people," he said. "People have heightened survival instincts, will do anything to survive, and they’ll seek retribution for anything...because they don’t trust law enforcement." Though it is tempting to pinpoint one cause as more impactful than others, Silverman cautions against singling out poverty or drugs or any other factor as the cause, because all of them intermix and interact. Our ruling Williams said that the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old is murder. CDC data supports the claim. Out of all causes of death, homicide claimed about 40 percent of black lives between 15 and 34 years. This was significantly higher than the national average for males of that age group, and all other racial groups. We rate Williams' claim True.

pomt-10773	Nearly half of Hispanic voters in Arizona's last election supported four measures that were "very tough on illegal immigration."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/19/hillary-clinton/<p>-hes-stretching-the-story</p>/	The full quote from Tom Tancredo's interview: "In Arizona, in the last election, what we saw was a really amazing thing, that they had four issues on the ballot in Arizona, all of them were very tough on illegal immigration, one was an English only, I think, amendment of some sort. There were four issues, 47 percent of the Hispanics in Arizona voted for them. And by the way, they all passed overwhelmingly. So you cannot say that it is a monolithic voting block." The congressman goes beyond the facts at hand to make his point that not all Hispanics vote the same. We found that 48 percent of Hispanic voters in Arizona supported Proposition 103, which requires all formal state government action to be in English, with some exemptions. That's according to Edison Media Research, which conducts exit polling for the national election pool, including CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the Associated Press. But as far as the three other "tough on illegal immigration" measures on the Arizona ballot last fall, we don't know how Hispanics voted. Edison didn't poll on those, and neither did anyone else we could find. "He's taking our number and extrapolating to four propositions," said Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research. "We can't support that. . . . He's accurate on the one, but the other three he's guessing." Tancredo is correct that all four measures passed overwhelmingly, each by at least 71 percent of the overall vote. Tancredo's campaign offered no supporting information for his statement about how Hispanics voted on those issues, but suggested we call the Arizona Secretary of State's office. We did. Deputy Secretary of State Kevin Tyne said, "We're precluded from tracking that kind of information." But just to be sure there wasn't another source for Tancredo's numbers, we talked to Quin Monson, assistant director at the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University; to John A. Garcia, a University of Arizona political science professor who has done extensive polling of Hispanics; to Earl de Berge, research director at the Behavior Research Center, a public opinion firm in Phoenix; and to Fred Solop, a Northern Arizona University political science professor and pollster. Not one knew of data to support Tancredo's statement. That's why we can only give him a Half-True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-10-19T00:00:00	2007-10-19	['Arizona']

pomt-09260	“We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/may/02/jerry-patterson/land-commissioner-says-state-getting-most-ever-oil/	UPDATE, May 3, 2010: Oil production totals below for 1972, 2007 and 2008 have been corrected to make up for our initial misreading of a state chart. As originally noted, however, oil production in Texas still topped out in 1972. The corrected production figures don't affect our rating of Commissioner Patterson's statement. Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state’s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: “We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.” Even though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops? When we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million. The state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31. Total state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion. And when did oil production peak? According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission. R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: "Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that’s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early ‘80s than in the ‘70s (and reached all time highs in 2008)." So how does Patterson’s statement shake out? He gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s. But he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas "right now." That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.

pomt-10800	"The reality is, with a $2 trillion-a-year health care budget, we're spending more on health care, nearly 17 percent of our gross domestic product, versus 3.8 percent of GDP on the entire military budget."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/05/mike-huckabee/apples-and-oranges/	Mike Huckabee illustrates a need for overhauling our health care system by comparing what is spent in the U.S. on health care versus what is spent on what he calls the entire military budget. There are two problems with Huckabee's statement. Here's the first one: The number Huckabee quotes for U.S. military expenses is only what the U.S. Department of Defense spends, which at about $520 billion in 2007 is 3.8 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. But defense spending is spread across many other budgets. According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the nation's entire 2007 national defense budget — which includes atomic energy and defense-related activities in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Commerce — is $570 billion. That's about 4.2 percent of GDP. So, Huckabee's off, but not by much. Here's the bigger problem. In his statement, Huckabee seems to be comparing federal government spending on the military to total spending in the U.S. on health care. Not just government money, but also private spending. His campaign didn't return phone calls to explain what he meant or from where he drew his statistics. But his 17 percent of GDP most closely resembles a figure cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for administering health programs. It reported in January 2007 that the U.S. is projected to spend about 16.2 percent of GDP on national health expenditures this year, or about $2.3-trillion. But that's everything. What the federal government spends, what state and local governments spend, what private citizens spend. The same study shows that if you subtract private sector money from the equation, health care expenses by the federal government drop to 5.5 percent of GDP. Add in state and local government spending and you get to 7.6 percent of GDP. Of course, "we," all of us, make up the private sector. So Huckabee has every right to include the private with public expenses when citing the true cost of U.S. health care in proportion to GDP. But comparing that with government-only spending on the military, or anything else, artificially inflates the disparity between the two costs. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06887	Michele Bachmann's legislative record is "offering failed amendments."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/28/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-michele-bachmanns-legislative-re/	It's not every state that has two candidates running for president, but this year Minnesota has both Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann competing for the Republican nomination. But the state's "Minnesota nice" reputation doesn't seem to apply to presidential politics. Bachmann, a member of Congress, has been attacking Pawlenty, a former two-term governor, for not being conservative enough. Pawlenty, meanwhile, has said Bachmann has few legislative accomplishments and wasn't known for getting results. We checked part of Bachmann's attack in separate fact-check. She accused Pawlenty of saying in 2006 that "The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive." We looked into the history of Pawlenty's comments and rated her statement Mostly True. Here, we're looking at Pawlenty's response. He said that while he was "elected twice in a very blue state, Congresswoman Bachmann was giving speeches and offering failed amendments," among other things. Pawlenty also said in an interview on July 10, 2011, that Bachmann's "record of accomplishment in Congress is nonexistent." Here, we wanted to check Pawlenty's statement about Bachmann's record of accomplishment. Is it as thin as he suggests? To check, we turned to the federal legislative database THOMAS, media accounts and other public records. We found Pawlenty was largely correct: Bachmann does not have many legislative victories under her belt. Instead, Bachmann seems to prefer offering legislation that makes a bold statement. This year, she proposed making the Bush tax cuts permanent, stripping President Barack Obama's health care law of funding, overturning new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs and repealing the financial regulatory overhaul that passed just last year. None of those bills has received a vote from the full U.S. House of Representatives. Bachmann has served in Congress since 2006, and hasn't sponsored anything that's become law. Her most successful proposals were a 2008 resolution expressing support for agencies that provide services to foster children and a 2009 resolution to designate September as "National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month". (Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull, leading to brain swelling, which can be fatal.) Both measures were approved by the House but not the Senate. We went looking for other accounts to either confirm or refute Pawlenty's charge. (We contacted Bachmann's campaign for comment and didn't hear back.) We knew from previous reporting that sometimes a legislator's bill is incorporated into other larger legislation with a different sponsor. We wanted to make sure were weren't missing giving Bachmann credit for a case like this. Instead, we found more confirmation that her legislative record is thin. Here's how POLITICO summarized its review of her record: "Now in her third House term, Bachmann has never had a bill or resolution she's sponsored signed into law, and she's never wielded a committee gavel, either at the full or subcommittee level. Bachmann's amendments and bills have rarely been considered by any committee, even with the House under GOP control. In a chamber that rewards substantive policy work and insider maneuvering, Bachmann has shunned the inside game, choosing to be more of a bomb thrower than a legislator." MinnPost.com, a nonpartisan Minnesota-based news website, concluded: "She has had a few amendments passed, among the most famous of which aimed to prevent groups like ACORN from sitting on a proposed consumer advisory panel on financial protection and making them ineligible for certain federal grants. But most of her legislation, like her health-care reform bill that would make all health care costs tax deductible and allow the purchase of insurance across state lines, has been introduced and referred to committee, never to be heard from again." In February 2010, the St. Cloud Times newspaper of Minnesota asked Bachmann about her legislative achievements. Here's the question and her response: St. Cloud Times: "Name three bills or amendments that you have gotten passed that are the most beneficial to the people of the 6th Congressional District." Bachmann: "I was involved in a foster care amendment to support and encourage people in foster care. It is a very important issue. Sen. Mary Landrieu, (D-La.) and I are working on the Haiti situation. We are trying to put together initiatives so that children can actually go into homes and not stay in institutions their whole life. I was able to pass this resolution honoring people in foster care. I am in the deep minority in Congress and a fairly new freshman, so I don't have substantive bills that I have passed. I would love to. The very first bill I introduced was the Health Care Freedom of Choice Act." We should note that Bachmann's point about being in the minority has some merit. It's often difficult if not impossible for legislators in the minority to get bills passed. But Republicans did regained the majority this year. Also, she's right that new members of Congress often don't get legislation passed, though Bachmann was in her second term when she made her comments to the St. Cloud Times. But even Bachmann supporters seem to admit that passing legislation isn't really her thing. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, told POLITICO that Bachmann has had "a profound effect on the debate," comparing her with Winston Churchill. "It doesn't mean you always win. In fact, as we know, Churchill lost and lost and was a voice of reason in Great Britain for a long time before people finally realized he was right," Gohmert said. Finally, we checked in with two political watchers in Minnesota to see if we were missing anything from Bachmann's record. "Pawlenty more or less got it correct in terms of saying her legislative record is insubstantial. She has never been known for doing real legislative work or in really moving legislation. She is better at giving speeches," said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics. And though Bachamnn was in the legislative minority for a time in Congress, Schultz said, she never chose to create a legislative record. "Thus, it did not surprise me that once this year she became part of a majority in the House, she opted to run for president. I do not think she was prepared actually to govern and do real legislative work." Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College, said that Bachmann "has defined herself during her political career as a public advocate, not an executive or legislator. Her goal has been to draw bright rhetorical lines and marshal support for her purist conservative positions." In ruling on Pawlenty's statement, he said that Bachmann's record was one of "failed amendments" and "nonexistent." There's a little bit of exaggeration there. In addition to failed amendments, she had failed bills, and those measures did, in fact, exist, even if they didn't pass. But his larger point that Bachmann hasn't had many legislative accomplishments is correct. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14382	As a sign of "extraordinary progress," "there are half as many (primary-age) children out of school today as there were 15 years ago."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/mar/17/gayle-smith/usaid-head-overshoots-gains-getting-more-kids-scho/	The new head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Gayle Smith gave policymakers a first look at her vision of what USAID should be doing. As she steps into the early rounds of defending the administration's budget request, Smith said in a speech on Capitol Hill that she’s grateful that most of America’s foreign assistance debate enjoys a lot of bipartisan support. She listed a number of fronts where this has helped lead to global progress, from curtailing the spread of HIV/AIDS to reducing extreme poverty. Smith also mentioned successes in education. "I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress," Smith said. "Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago." We wanted to fact-check Smith’s claim about how many children are out of school. For the record, the first part of Smith’s statement about boys and girls enrolling at equal rates is largely on the money. According to the World Bank, most parts of the world are at or close to parity in terms of seeing equal percentages of girls and boys who go to school. The two regions that lag behind are Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, but the gap is not enormous and they have made a lot of progress since 2000. Now, are there half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago? Benjamin Edwards, spokesman for USAID, told us that Smith’s source was the United Nations 2015 Millennium Development Goals report. In the section on education, it says, "Currently, 57 million children of primary school age are estimated to be out of school, down from 100 million in 2000." And in a list of bullet points, the report says the number has "fallen by almost half." We note that if you do the math, the actual estimated decline is 43 percent. So what we have is a sort of statistical glide. The writers of a UN report massaged 43 percent to make it "almost half," then someone at USAID moved things a bit further by dropping the qualifier "almost" and Smith ends up saying "there are half as many children out of school." This might not matter, except there’s reason to question the underlying estimate in that UN report. In fact, while the gains since 2000 are significant, current trends could be negative, not positive. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, better known as UNESCO, is the keeper of the original data. The most recent information goes only to 2013. Based on UNESCO's actual figures, the number of out-of-school children fell by 40 percent from 2000-13, as we can see in this table: 2000 2013 Change 2000-13 World 98,654,408 59,256,395 40% Caucasus and Central Asia 358,127 342,111 4% Latin America & the Caribbean 3,330,636 4,066,213 -22% Northern Africa 1,935,001 232,304 88% Sub-Saharan Africa 42,873,204 32,960,434 23% Western Asia 3,039,656 2,045,168 33% Eastern Asia 5,924,921 2,680,949 55% South-Eastern Asia 4,745,734 3,636,624 23% Southern Asia 33,849,211 10,349,757 69% Oceania 330,316 188,308 43% So based on hard data, the gains look less and less like "about half." On top of that, in its 2015 report on out-of-school children, UNESCO flagged that there has been largely no progress since 2007. That year, about 60 million young children were not in school. And the agency warned that the situation could deteriorate. "Progress has stalled and there are serious concerns that unless something changes — and fast — hard-won achievements on primary enrollment could begin to erode," the report said. A 2015 UNESCO policy paper put the problem in starker terms. It highlighted that the number of out-of-school children has been rising since 2010. That is true for both primary and secondary school-age children. Curiously, the writers of the UN Millennium Development Goals report had this information and posited that progress, at least globally, would continue. We looked at their statistical annex and found no explanation for this positive forecast. Elaine Unterhalter, professor of education and international development at University College London, told us there’s even more reason today to doubt that steady progress is under way. "The gains are based on data before the large-scale refugee crisis engulfing Syria and Iraq, and the internal displacement in Nigeria and Sudan," Unterhalter said. "So, while definitely there are gains, we must be cautious about over-claiming." Uneven gains and stalled progress While Smith’s figure is a bit high and runs counter to the trends since 2010, a further flaw is that it masks enormous regional variation. Southern Asia, which includes India, drove down the number of out-of-school children by nearly 70 percent. Northern Africa, reaching from Morocco to Egypt, had far fewer children to educate but saw nearly a 90 percent decrease in those that were not in school. Those gains stand in sharp contrast to the numbers for Latin America and the Caribbean where the problem grew worse, not better. In Sub-Saharan Africa with the largest number of young children, the decline was only about 25 percent. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a particular challenge. It is a region where the rising population of school-age children is rapidly outstripping the capacity of governments to expand their education systems. In its 2015 report, UNESCO said that decreases in just 11 nations accounted for over half of the global decline. Nicole Bella, a senior policy analyst at UNESCO, told us a key factor in those gains was pretty basic -- money. "Low- and lower-middle income countries have allocated a higher percentage of Gross National Product to education since 1999, and aid to education has more than doubled in real terms," Bella said. Governments built more schools, hired more teachers and cut or eliminated school fees. Bella said some also started feeding students and passed laws designed to reach kids who live in poorer households. She noted that the poorest children are "four times more likely not to go to school than the richest children, and five times more likely not to complete primary school." But Bella told us that government efforts to get more children into school have slowed. Unterhalter said that there’s no simple solution to dealing with the remaining out-of-school children. The issues are many, and so a wide range of strategies would need to be brought to bear. Major hurdles The UNESCO study found that the single greatest reason why children aren’t in school when they should be is war and other forms of armed conflict. Fighting destroys schools, scatters students and teachers, and often draws teenagers directly into the conflict as fighters themselves. Following the impact of war on schooling, the report cites "entrenched gender roles" that systematically reduce the opportunities for girls to go to school in the first place, or to remain in school if they start. The demand for child labor, and the family’s need for a child to work, also diverts children from an education. One of the original Millennium Development Goals was to ensure that every child would be able to complete primary school. That goal has not been met and according to UNESCO, there is a real risk it will slide further out of reach. Our ruling Smith said that there are half as many primary-age children out of school today as there were 15 years ago. That’s a bit high. Smith took the words in an UN report that described the gains as "almost half" and dropped the qualifier. That would be a minor issue except the UN language itself was based on a projection that runs counter to the findings of the UN’s main agency on education, UNESCO. Based on hard data, the actual number is about 40 percent, and most important, the trend since 2010 is negative. We also note that the global figure masks large regional differences where progress has been absent or much more limited. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Gayle Smith	None	None	None	2016-03-17T15:59:28	2016-03-09	['None']
pomt-07095	The U.S. is spending "one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/23/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-said-1-6-defense-dollars-are-spent-af/	Jon Huntsman announced June 21, 2011 that he is running for the Republican nomination for president. Huntsman was previously governor of Utah but also recently served in the Obama administration as ambassador to China. How is it that Huntsman is running against a president he served? Huntsman has said several times that when a president asks him to serve his country, he serves. He expanded on the point on Wednesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "The president is a good man. He's earnest, he's hard working, he's a great family man," Huntsman said. "But I got to say on the economy, we're not near where we should be, and internationally we're in places I believe we should not be, spending one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan. And I'm here to tell you that America's future is not going to be won or lost in the prairies of Afghanistan. It's going to be won or lost based upon our ability to compete in the 21st century crowds of Pacific." We were interested in fact-checking Huntsman's statement, which he repeated in other interviews, that one out of every six Defense Department dollars goes to Afghanistan. To do that, we turned to government budget data and an array of defense spending policy experts. It turns out there are a number of ways to slice up the defense budget, and you get slightly different numbers depending on which you choose. You could consider the current fiscal year, 2011, or the one that starts in October, which is 2012. You could also consider authorizations (the legal limits for spending) or appropriations (the money actually approved within the legal limits). We contacted the Huntsman campaign for its source, and it referred us to testimony from Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank. Haass testified at a U.S. Senate hearing in May; he opposed continuing the war in Afghanistan, which he said had now evolved into a war of choice. "Just to be clear, wars of choice are not wrong per se. But before undertaking one, it is essential to demonstrate that the likely benefits of using military force will outweigh the costs and produce better results at less cost than other policies. Afghanistan does not meet these tests. It is not a major terrorist haven, and it should not be assumed it will again become one even if the Taliban make inroads," said Haass in his written testimony. Haass said that if terrorists renewed their activities in Afghanistan, the United States could respond as it has done in countries such as Yemen and Somalia. "At the macro or global level, Afghanistan is simply absorbing more economic, military, human, diplomatic and political resources of every sort than it warrants. The $110 to $120 billion annual price tag -- one out of every six to seven dollars this country spends on defense -- is unjustifiable given the budget crisis we face and the need for military (especially air and naval) modernization," Haass said. We ran the one-in-six number by several defense spending experts who said Huntsman was either correct or close to it. "He is correct. In the current fiscal year (fiscal year 2011), Congress has appropriated a total of $689 billion for the Department of Defense. Of that, $113.5 billion is for operations in Afghanistan," said Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, via e-mail. Another expert, Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said you could choose to exclude money that goes to the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons budget as well as money that goes to military construction, and then the Afghanistan spending would be between one sixth and one fifth of Defense Department dollars. Huntsman said we're spending "one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan." Budget numbers and defense spending experts said that's a reasonable extrapolation, though there are slightly different ways to calculate it as a little more or a little less. Still, Huntsman's number is a legitimate calculation. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06126	"As speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/27/restore-our-future/ad-claims-gingrich-favored-federal-funding-some-ab/	A pro-Mitt Romney super PAC is keeping up its attacks on Newt Gingrich with just before the Iowa caucuses. An ad posted to YouTube on Dec. 20, 2011, asks, "Know what makes Barack Obama happy? Newt Gingrich’s baggage." Suitcases adorned with Gingrich campaign stickers slide down an airport baggage carousel as a female voice launches into a list of attacks on the former House speaker’s record. Here, we’re checking this one: "As speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions." What we found is a case of cherry-picking his words to paint him as supporting abortion rights, which he clearly does not. The ad and what’s behind it Airing in Florida and Iowa, the ad is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any candidate or campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney. For reference, the ad cites NewtFacts.com, where a list of supporting material for its claims is displayed. On the abortion charge, NewtFacts.com quotes news stories from April 1995, when Gingrich appeared on the CBS show Face the Nation. He had just completed his first 100 days as speaker and was talking about his next priorities, particularly regarding social issues. "What about the abortion issue?" asked Gloria Borger, then of U.S. News and World Report. "There are people in your Republican conference and Republican presidential candidates who believe that there should be no federal funding at all, even in the cases of rape or incest. Do you agree with that?" "No," Gingrich responded. "First of all, I think you should have funding in the case of rape or incest or life of the mother, which is the first step." Gingrich was taking the position of many moderates, who believe abortion should be allowed only when a woman is raped or impregnated through incest, or if carrying the pregnancy to term threatens her life. He went a step further in saying federal money, such as through Medicaid, should be allowed to pay for such abortions. What else? So Restore our Future is right about what Gingrich said on Face the Nation. But we also wanted to look at his overall legislative record on taxpayer-funded abortion. We contacted NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group that advocates for abortion rights and considers Gingrich anti-choice. NARAL researchers found that Gingrich voted for an amendment to the 1984 Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that would have prohibited Medicaid funding for abortion care in all cases. More recently, he voted repeatedly to prohibit the District of Columbia from using public funds to provide abortions for low-income women, NARAL said, and he supported rules that barred abortion coverage from health care plans for federal employees. In 1993, he voted for the Hyde Amendment, an attachment to the annual federal spending bill first introduced in 1976 by Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde and employed each year since. Although its language changes from year to year, the amendment generally (including in 1993) bans the use of public funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest and when the woman’s life is in danger. The Hyde Amendment is widely considered a legislative achievement by groups that oppose abortion rights because it keeps taxpayer money from being spent on most abortions. The National Right to Life Committee, a prominent antiabortion group, lists it as one of the tests for where candidates stand on protecting life. In its presidential candidate scorecard, Gingrich is noted as having voted for the amendment. Gingrich’s own website, Newt.org, devotes a section to "setting the record straight" on his record, citing a 98.6 percent Lifetime Pro-Life Rating from the National Right to Life Committee. (We reached out to the Right to Life Committee but did not hear back.) He has signed the Susan B. Anthony List Pro-Life Leadership Presidential Pledge, in which candidates promise to "permanently end all taxpayer funding of abortion in all domestic and international spending programs." Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond recently told the Des Moines Register that Gingrich remains opposed to abortion with the exception of cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. But he has changed his position on using taxpayer money and now opposes funding abortion no matter what the circumstances. Our ruling Restore Our Future’s ad said that "as speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions." His remarks on Face the Nation in 1995, when he said "I think you should have funding in the case of rape or incest or life of the mother," align with that statement. While he was serving in Congress, he voted for the Hyde Amendment, which bans public funding of abortions except under those three circumstances. That’s a position widely embraced by those who want to restrict abortion. The ad implicitly portrays Gingrich as opposing those interests. While its wording is accurate, its message is misleading.

pomt-11680	The Senate seat won in a special election by a Democrat had been "held for more than thirty years by Republicans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/03/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-length-time-gop-held-alab/	When comments by Steve Bannon from a forthcoming book surfaced on Jan. 3, it created a media storm — and a rift between President Donald Trump and Bannon, his former chief strategist. Among the blockbuster quotes that Bannon gave journalist Michael Wolff referred to a meeting that included Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to news reports of an excerpt. "Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s---, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately," Bannon said, according to the book. Hours after news of the book’s contents broke on Jan. 3, 2018, the president released a statement critical of Bannon. Here’s a portion: "Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. "Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans." It wasn’t the most noteworthy part of Trump’s statement, but when he said that that Bannon that the Alabama seat had been held "for more than thirty years by Republicans," he was off by almost a decade. The seat in question is the one in which Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore weeks earlier. It was the subject of a special election because its previous elected occupant, Jeff Sessions, left to become Trump’s attorney general. (By coincidence, Jones was being sworn in as the state’s new senator on the same day that the news of Wolff’s book was dominating political discussion.) Seeing Trump’s statement, several political observers, including the Washington Post’s Paul Kane and Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, noted that the last Democrat to occupy the seat had been Sessions’ predecessor, Howell Heflin. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Heflin retired in 1996, making the actual period of Republican control 21 years, not 30. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The late Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala. As for Alabama’s other Senate seat, it has been held by Richard Shelby since his first election victory in 1986. Shelby was elected as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican Party shortly after the GOP took control of both chambers of Congress in November 1994. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. One last bit of trivia: Earlier in his career, Jones worked as an aide for Heflin, who died in 2005. On election night, Jones called Heflin his "mentor." Our ruling Trump said the Senate seat won by Jones had been "held for more than thirty years by Republicans." It hasn’t been that long. It’s been 21 years since Democrat Howell Heflin retired, paving the way for his successor, Sessions, and Sessions’ elected successor, Jones. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04558	"Barack Hussein Obama will ... force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/26/government-not-god-pac/newspaper-ad-says-barack-obama-will-force-christia/	An ad placed by the socially conservative group Government Is Not God in the Sarasota, Fla., Herald-Tribune and other newspapers in Florida and Ohio claims President Barack Obama will "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers." Is that accurate? William Murray, the group’s chairman, said the ad was a prediction that states "what we believe Obama will do in a second term" based in part on his current policies. We are fact-checking the ad because it is a representation of Obama's actual policies and proposals. The ad even says its claims represent Obama's "true agenda." (The Sarasota newspaper has apologized for publishing the ad, saying it did not meet the paper's "standards for fairness and accuracy.") In the claim about hiring teachers, Murray offered two articles that indicated it was largely based on on a Supreme Court case, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School vs. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The case involved a teacher at a Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod school named Cheryl Perich, a "called" teacher trained in theological requirements who taught mostly secular courses as well as some religious ones. In 2004 she developed narcolepsy and started the school year on leave with a disability. She wanted to return to the classroom in 2005, but the principal said the school had already filled the position for the year and had concerns about her illness. The congregation asked Perich to resign, offering her a "peaceful release" from her call. She wouldn’t, and eventually the church fired her for insubordination and also for threatening legal action against the church. She filed an EEOC complaint that asserted she lost her job in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision on Jan. 11, 2012, ruled that her lawsuit should have been dismissed under the First Amendment’s "ministerial exception" protection for religious organizations to make their own decisions about their leaders. "The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way," wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the opinion. The federal government was a party to the case -- the solicitor general’s office filed a brief and made an oral argument on behalf of the losing side. And so the Government Is Not God PAC is relying on the government's arguments as evidence for the ad’s claim that Obama will "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers." This raises two questions. First, if the solicitor general’s office makes an argument before the Supreme Court, does that mean that the arguments are those of Obama himself? And second, did the federal government actually argue in Hosanna-Tabor that the government has the right to "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers"? We’ll take these two issues in order. Does Obama "own" the Supreme Court arguments made by federal officials? Experts told us this is a bit of a gray area. On the one hand, "the solicitor general is tasked with representing the United States and not solely the president of the United States," said Douglas W. Kmiec, a constitutional law professor at Pepperdine University and a former Justice Department official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. "It is therefore erroneous to ascribe the views of the solicitor general to those of the administration." There is a strong tradition, he said, "for the solicitor general to give an objective reading of the law." In addition, this case involved a federal statute and a federal agency, which gives a strong presumption that the federal government -- regardless of who occupied the White House -- would get involved, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who argued against the government’s position at the Supreme Court oral argument for Hosanna-Tabor. "The federal agency had won the case in the court of appeals, and the solicitor general pretty much had to defend that win," Laycock said. "This was not an administration decision. … Occasionally, in very high-profile litigation, the White House gets involved and tells the solicitor general what to argue. But that is a rare event, and I don’t believe it happened here." That said, some legal experts said that the administration can’t fully disown what the solicitor general’s office was arguing. For one thing, it is not unprecedented for an administration to decline to defend a federal law (the Obama administration has already taken that course with the Defense of Marriage Act). It did not do so in this case. And even if the solicitor general’s office didn’t have much choice about taking the case, it would have had some latitude in the specific arguments it would make. "The solicitor general has some discretion in terms of the position to take," said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Did the government argue that it had the right to "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers"? There’s some nuance here, too. On the one hand, the administration took a more aggressive stance on behalf of government prerogatives in church-related conflicts than some legal observers had expected. Indeed, it was a view that was so aggressive that it was rejected by a unanimous court, including two appointees of Obama himself. Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor who wrote a brief countering the government’s view in Hosanna-Tabor, calls the solicitor general’s arguments in the brief and oral argument "extreme and misguided." The solicitor general’s argument, he said, was that the plaintiffs should be able to use federal discrimination laws to challenge employment decisions by Christian schools regarding teachers, and that the First Amendment’s religion clauses do not provide any shield against government second-guessing of such decisions. "At oral argument, ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ justices alike were surprised" at the reach of the government’s argument, Garnett said. That said, Garnett said it’s a stretch to say the solicitor general argued that the government should be able to "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers." He and other experts said that the question of religious institutions being able to hire people of certain religions is settled law and an issue that the government did not quarrel with. "It’s not so much that the administration would come in and say to a Christian school, ‘You must hire a non-Christian teacher,’" Garnett said. "It’s that, if a teacher were fired by a Christian school, then that teacher’s employment-discrimination lawsuit should be able to go forward as if the Christian school were any other (non-religious) association." Roosevelt makes an even more forceful case. Basing the ad on the argument in Hosanna-Tabor, he said, is "totally false." "That’s not what the case was about, the solicitor general never suggested it, and the law clearly allows Christian schools to hire Christian teachers," he said. Even Laycock, who faced off against the solicitor general at the oral argument, said the ad is misconstruing the solicitor general’s argument. The solicitor general "never implied or said that Christian schools would have to hire non-Christian teachers," Laycock said. "The statute is absolutely clear that religious institutions can discriminate on the basis of religion, and of course they never questioned that. The issue was whether religion teachers could sue their churches alleging other kinds of discrimination – disability in this case. We said no, the solicitor general said sometimes yes, when the case could be decided without interfering in the church’s religious mission. We didn’t think that was a workable standard. The disagreement about disability discrimination would have applied to sex discrimination and age discrimination as well, but it clearly did not apply to religious discrimination -- that was common ground." Murray also cited an article about Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor appointed by President Obama to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that said she has written that society should "not tolerate" any "private beliefs," including religious beliefs, that may negatively affect homosexual "equality." But Murray did not provide any evidence that her actions at the EEOC would force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers. Our ruling The ad claims that Obama will "force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers."

pomt-06432	Says the national heath care reform is "a government takeover of health care."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/23/chris-christie/chris-christie-slams-health-care-reform-government/	As Gov. Chris Christie proved last week, some lies never die. Having endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie has been addressing what he considers illegitimate comparisons between Romney’s health care reform in Massachusetts and the national health care reform led by President Barack Obama. The governor discussed the differences between the two reforms Wednesday on The Dom Giordano Show on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT. "Secondly, what I’d say to the President is, in Massachusetts, we didn’t propose to raise taxes, as you proposed to raise taxes a trillion dollars to pay for a government takeover of health care," Christie told Giordano. "Third thing is that ninety-three percent of the people in Massachusetts had private insurance then and have private insurance now. That’s not what’s gonna happen under Obamacare. It’s gonna be a government takeover of health care." By referring to the national reform as "a government takeover of health care," Christie was repeating a claim that’s been debunked numerous times by various news organizations. In fact, our PolitiFact colleagues recognized that claim as the 2010 Lie of the Year. PolitiFact New Jersey contacted seven health care experts from across the country and reached the same conclusion: the national reform greatly expands federal involvement, but the law is largely built upon the existing private health insurance industry. By no means is it a government takeover. "I respect Gov. Christie a lot and like his style, but in this case he seems to speak off a talking point coming out of Washington more so than from a conviction forged by his own cerebrum," Princeton University professor Uwe Reinhardt said in an email. The governor’s office did not respond last week to requests for comment. Now, let’s explain how the private market remains intact under the health care reform. It’s true that the national reform imposes more government regulations for individuals, employers and private insurance companies. The reform also expands the Medicaid program. Insurers must adhere to various new provisions, such as providing coverage for dependent children up to 26 years old and not restricting coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Insurers also can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges, but they must follow certain benefit standards set by federal officials. But despite those and other additional regulations, the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform, according to various experts. "People will have choices of all these different private insurance companies," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University. Richard Bonnie, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and an expert on public health law, said the reform allows for a larger federal presence in health insurance regulation, but not a takeover of the market. "It left the existing structure in place and tried to bring more people under the tent," Bonnie said. Based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the reform will allow more people to become enrolled in private insurance plans. Under the reform, the federal government will provide subsidies to individuals at certain income levels to purchase coverage through the exchanges. By 2021, an additional roughly 24 million non-elderly Americans are expected to purchase insurance through the exchanges, according to the budget office. About an additional 17 million will be enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the budget office stated. Still, according to the budget office, most of the non-elderly population with health insurance will continue to be covered under private plans through their employers. Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Virginia, said the reform seeks to improve upon the private market, in part by making coverage more affordable through federal subsidies and by making insurance more competitive through the exchanges. "It’s not a government takeover," Jost said. Our ruling On a radio show last week, Christie claimed the national health care reform was "a government takeover of health care." While the reform gives the federal government a larger role in the health insurance industry, it doesn’t eliminate the private market. In fact, the reform is projected to increase the number of citizens with private health insurance. We know Christie doesn’t like the national health care reform, but he should know better than to call it a "government takeover." That’s been proven wrong over and over again, making his claim simply ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12956	"Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/jan/04/travis-allen/lawmakers-claim-about-california-legalizing-child-/	Did California really legalize child prostitution? That’s the startling question our audience asked after reading a misleading op-ed by Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen in the Washington Examiner. Allen’s opinion piece has been shared widely on social media and led several readers to ask PolitiFact California to check it out. We decided to fact-check the first line of Allen’s column, which largely reflects the rest of the piece: "Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right." The op-ed is headlined: "California Democrats legalize child prostitution." UPDATE: Allen repeated his claim on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News on Jan. 4, 2017, saying at the end of his interview that "The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California." &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Our research Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 1322. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said it’s designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals. It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts. People caught having sex with minors, soliciting sex with minors or arranging clients for them can still be charged with crimes. "The key is that the children involved are not liable, not that the conduct has been legalized," said Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis School of Law, who analyzed the law upon our request. Chin added that under the new law "child prostitution is treated just as, say, the production of child pornography is." Adults involved are subject to criminal prosecution, while the children, who are seen as victims, are not, he said. Representatives for Allen did not respond to our questions. Allen, who represents Orange County, told KQED public radio he rejects the criticism he’s received over the column. "I don't care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it," Allen said in the radio interview. After his initial claim in the op-ed that "prostitution by minors will be legal," Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement can’t "arrest" underage workers for soliciting sex. A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement can’t "interfere" with minors engaging in prostitution. The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed. Bill’s author responds Democratic state Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, who authored Senate Bill 1322, responded on Twitter to the mischaracterizations of the law. "I denounce false claims made by Republicans on my bill #SB1322 that decriminalizes sexually exploited minors," she wrote. "I proudly authored SB 1322 to protect minor victims of human sex trafficking from being further charged as criminals for commercial sexual exploitation." "This notion, perpetuated by Assemblymember Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), that my bill legalizes prostitution and commercial sex for minors is categorically untrue," she added. "It remains unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to consent to sexual intercourse in the State of California and the law remains in effect and is not changed with the implementation of my bill." California state Sen. Holly Mitchell responded to Allen's claims on Twitter. The Sacramento Bee’s fact-checking team PoliGRAPH also examined Allen’s op-ed. It described it as a "misleading column" and rated its assertions "False." Our ruling California state Assemblyman Travis Allen claimed in a recent column that "Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California." His claim profoundly distorts a new state law that treats minors engaged in commercial sex acts as victims, but does nothing to legalize prostitution. Young people under age 18 who solicit sex won’t be arrested and sent to juvenile hall. Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention. It also says officers shall report the circumstances of minors engaged in prostitution to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. The law does nothing to change the fact that it is illegal to have sex with minors, solicit prostitutes or arrange clients. Allen’s specific claim, and the column in general, is grossly misleading.

pomt-11545	In Georgia, "25 percent of rural residents" are "without access to high speed internet."	true	/georgia/statements/2018/feb/12/brian-kemp/does-25-percent-rural-georgia-lack-access-high-spe/	Many rural Georgians have been left behind because they don’t have access to high-speed internet, said Brian Kemp, a Republican seeking to become Georgia’s next governor. "With 25 percent of rural residents without access to high-speed internet, bringing this access to all of Georgia is a fundamental component of our plan to strengthen rural Georgia," Kemp said on his campaign website. High-speed internet can help small businesses, improve access to quality healthcare and spur economic development, said Kemp, currently Georgia’s Secretary of State. We wondered if Kemp was right about the share of rural Georgians without high-speed internet and found that he accurately cited information stemming from a 2016 Federal Communications Commission report on broadband deployment. FCC’s high speed internet standard, progress reports High-speed internet is a term often used interchangeably with broadband. Broadband "commonly refers to high-speed internet access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access," according to the FCC. (Dial-up uses a modem and standard phone line to establish an internet connection.) Broadband technologies include Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, cable modem and fiber. The FCC benchmark for fixed (not mobile) broadband internet is speeds of 25 Megabits per second for downloads and 3 Megabits per second for uploads. A section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to determine annually whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans "in a reasonable and timely fashion," and if not, to take immediate action to accelerate deployment. Regarding Georgia’s rural population without high-speed internet access, Kemp’s campaign referred us to a May 2017 presentation from the House Budget and Research Office given at a House Rural Development Council meeting. Part of that presentation said an estimated 626,070 individuals, or 25 percent of the rural population, were without access to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps internet. Those figures trace back to the FCC’s 2016 Broadband Progress Report, which also found that 39 percent of all rural Americans did not have access to broadband internet. "The largest factor preventing access to unlimited ‘high-speed’ broadband is the cost of buildout for the infrastructure," said Eric McRae, associate director of the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia. Depending on the technology being implemented, cost can range from $18,000 to $30,000 per mile, McRae said. "Many carriers are developing new technologies (wireless) to help drive down the cost of buildout to make it a more cost-effective endeavor in the rural portions of the state," he said. A more recent FCC report on broadband deployment, released this month, found that 71.9 percent of rural Georgians had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, suggesting 28.1 percent did not. The new report also looked at populations’ access to mobile internet, but said it was not establishing a benchmark for mobile, as it does for fixed services. While both fixed and mobile services enable access to information and entertainment, there are notable differences between the two technologies and limitations in the FCC’s data collection, the report said. Mobile broadband speeds can vary based on capabilities of consumers’ devices and transmissions can be subject to environmental factors that fixed services may not face, the FCC said. Generally, FCC reports have shown that rural communities tend to be at a disadvantage in receiving high-speed internet. PolitiFact Missouri found that Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., accurately claimed in September 2017 that nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. Our ruling Kemp said that in in Georgia, "25 percent of rural residents" are "without access to high-speed internet." Kemp’s claim is backed by data reported by the FCC in 2016. New data shows that the percentage of rural residents without access to fixed terrestrial broadband is 28.1 percent. We rate Kemp’s statement True.

pomt-10985	"NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/16/blog-posting/dont-believe-nasa-will-pay-you-100000-stay-bed/	Have you ever dreamed of getting paid just for being a couch potato all day? A misleading blog post is claiming, "NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!" Is that offer too good to be true? For the most part, it is. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post, which is on the website World Facts FTW, claims that NASA wants volunteers to participate in "bed rest studies," as it wants to "study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel." As a reward for making it through 60 days of staying in bed and enduring bone, muscle and heart tests, volunteers get a large amount of cash, the post claims. We wanted to know if this stellar offer was truly up for grabs. We found out that NASA has paid people to stay in bed for long periods of time before. But there’s a pretty large error with the blog post’s headline. We began by reverse-image searching many of the photos on the website, which were not credited, using RevEye. (RevEye is a image search engine that allows you to search the internet for all the webpages an image appears on.) Some images were lifted from a Vice article titled "How I Felt After 70 Days of Lying in Bed for Science." In that article, a volunteer named Andrew Iwanicki reflects on his experience lying down at a negative 6-degree angle for 10 weeks, and mentions that he was paid $18,000 by NASA. A number of other news sources corroborate Iwanicki’s story, and a page on NASA’s website tells readers about how bed rest studies help scientists "understand the effects of living in space." But those news outlets reported that NASA paid volunteers $18,000 to participate in a bed study — a far cry from the $100,000 mentioned in the blog post. We found no evidence to support the claim that NASA paid, or will pay, its volunteers $100,000. The blog post’s headline is also misleading, since it doesn’t consider how difficult it is to participate in a bed rest study, given the high number of applicants and low number of participants required. In the Vice article, Iwanicki reports that he was one of 55 participants selected out of 25,000 applicants. Given that NASA’s bed studies occur infrequently—the previous one concluded in November 2017 and the next one will start in fall 2018—it seems likely that they would need a small number of volunteers. A Lexis search did not return any results of NASA paying people $100,000 to participate in a bed rest study, and NASA could not be reached for comment. We attempted to contact World Facts FTW, the website the blog post was on, by using this contact form, but received an error message after we clicked "send." We also could not find a Twitter or Facebook page through which to contact World Facts FTW. This isn’t the first time that NASA’s bed rest studies have inspired misinformation. We previously debunked a version of the tale that claimed NASA was paying volunteers to lay in bed and smoke weed. Our ruling A recent blog post claims "NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!" NASA does have a program that pays volunteers to participate in bed rest studies, where one lies down for a long period of time. The point is to allow scientists to understand how the body might be affected by space travel. But the blog post grossly exaggerates the amount of money one would receive for such a task. In the past, rather than being paid $100,000 for 60 days of lying down, volunteers have been paid $18,000 for 70 days of their time. We rate this statement False.

pomt-13323	Says marijuana use among Colorado high school students "has not increased since legalization."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/oct/06/campaign-regulate-marijuana-alcohol/has-colorado-teen-pot-use-not-increased-legalizati/	Colorado has been the measuring stick for both supporters and opponents of an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona this November. A recent ad from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, attempts to show the positive effects of marijuana regulation in Colorado, highlighting millions of dollars going toward public education and the lack of an increase in pot use among teens. "According to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization," the ad, which started airing Sept. 27, claims. We should also note that the anti-pot camp has used Colorado teen pot statistics in their ads. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. The first retail store opened in January 2014. We have seen multiple numbers on teen pot use, so we wondered if this claim held up. Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the pro-marijuana campaign, pointed us to the 2015 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey. The ad cites a June 2016 Denver Post article, which references the survey. This survey, which takes place every two years, is done by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. The 2015 version surveys about 17,000 middle and high school students at random. According to the results, 38 percent of high school students surveyed said they used marijuana at least once their life. In 2013, that number was 36.9 percent. The 2015 survey also noted that 21.2 percent of high-schoolers used marijuana in the last 30 days. That number was 19.7 percent in 2013. However, the stats are not significant, according to multiple experts we spoke with. This means the data has wiggle room. "There was not a statistically significant increase in 30-day or lifetime marijuana use among high school students between 2013 and 2015," said Mark Salley, a spokesman with Colorado’s health department. The state’s top health official, Dr. Larry Wolk, said the same thing in December 2015 when looking at federal data -- from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health -- on the topic. The national survey notes that 11.16 percent of Colorado 12- to 17-year-olds in the 2012-13 cycle used marijuana in the last 30 days . That number was 12.56 percent in the 2013-14 cycle. "This is not a statistically significant increase at the 5 percent level of significance," said Brad Stone, a spokesman with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the clock hasn’t even really started on the full effects of legalizing recreational marijuana. "We’re not going to see the full effects of legalization until something like 25 years after national legalization," Caulkins said. "It takes time for the industry to adapt to new opportunities, go through the usual shake-out period." Our rating The ad claimed, "according to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization." Based on the numbers cited, there does appear to have been a slight increase in marijuana use among Colorado’s high school students. However, multiple experts we spoke with said that increase is not statistically significant. They also said it was too early to draw conclusions about marijuana use, and that more years of study will be needed.

pomt-06849	Tax increases under Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm led to state unemployment going from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/04/raul-labrador/raul-labrador-says-tax-hike-led-spike-michigan-une/	During the July 31, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, faced off with former Michigan Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm over the causes of her state’s economic troubles. We separately analyzed a comment by Granholm in which she took responsibility for cuts in state government and said that they had hurt Michigan’s economic growth. Labrador responded to Granholm’s comment by arguing that tax increases on her watch played a role in the state’s economic distress. Addressing host David Gregory, Labrador -- a tea party-affiliated House freshman -- said, "Let's talk about the truth about what happened in Michigan. Gov. Granholm actually supported the highest tax increases in the history of Michigan, and unemployment went from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent." After some stop-and-start verbal sparring with Granholm, Labrador proceeded to offer a contrast with Michigan, saying that Texas has thrived economically under a policy of tax decreases. After talking to experts, we decided not to check Labrador’s specific claim that the tax increase under Granholm was the biggest in the state’s history. We made this decision for two reasons -- first, there are many conflicting ways to make such a comparison and second, the data to prove or disprove the claim is difficult to obtain. Instead, we’ll look at two questions. Did the state’s unemployment rate go from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent? And did the tax increases under Granholm -- whether or not they were historically large -- contribute to the increase in unemployment? Did the state’s unemployment rate go from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent? This one turned out to be more complicated than we’d expected. We first turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates both the national unemployment rate and the unemployment rate for each of the 50 states. We found that the unemployment rate was indeed 6.8 percent around the time Granholm took office in February 2003. The rate stayed strikingly consistent during the next five years of Granholm’s tenure, staying within a narrow range between 6.7 percent and 7.4 percent through April 2008. Then it began to climb. According to BLS, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.1 percent in August and September of 2009 before falling to 10.4 percent when Granholm left office in February 2011. Though 14.1 percent is high, it’s not as high as the 15.3 percent Labrador said. But Labrador has good reason to think that the rate went that high. In October 2009, the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth issued a press release noting that the state’s unemployment rate had ticked upward to 15.3 percent in September. So what happened? The rate was initially pegged at 15.3 percent, but as often happens, more complete data came to light and the number was revised. That’s how the rate was subsequently lowered to 14.1 percent. So while Labrador overstated the peak unemployment rate under Granholm, we’ll give him some leeway because the higher number did receive media attention before the revision was made. Did the tax increases under Granholm contribute to the increase in Michigan’s unemployment? The short answer is that they probably did -- but they were hardly the driving force that Labrador implies. He’s correct that Granholm enacted a tax increase package in 2007, as the state was facing a dire fiscal outlook. The package included a hike in the state income tax rate from 3.9 percent to 4.35 percent (although this was below the 4.4 percent rate it had been in 1999 under Republican Gov. John Engler). She also enacted a surcharge on the state’s business tax, which replaced an ill-fated, and quickly repealed, effort to expand the sales tax to a smorgasbord of services that had been included in the same bill as the income tax hike. Experts we spoke to said that, on the margins, these taxes could have added to the state’s economic difficulties, possibly sending unemployment higher. However, their effect would have been small compared to the other economic factors in play at the time. Michigan’s unemployment rate began climbing in April 2008, four months after the official start of the last recession, and it increased rapidly -- from 7.4 percent to 13.1 percent. That’s a 75 percent increase in the unemployment rate in the space of just one year. "Was there anything else going on in the world other than the Michigan tax system that might have affected the employment picture?" said Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University and author of Michigan's Economic Future: A New Look. "If Michigan’s tax system was the only thing that affected jobs, why was the rest of the country losing 7 million jobs at the same time? You can’t lay this at the feet of the Michigan tax system." Indeed, if you look at the trends in the unemployment rate for Michigan and for the nation as a whole, they follow a similar arc. Craig Thiel, director of state affairs with the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan, acknowledged that it’s difficult to disentangle the various factors that pushed Michigan’s unemployment so high. Still, he said that "the near-term impact that the recession had on Michigan employment certainly swamped any possible adverse economic effects resulting from the tax increases." It’s also worth noting that between April 2010 and April 2011 -- a period that covered most of Granholm’s final year in office -- the state’s unemployment rate fell by 2.9 percentage points, more or less in tune with national declines. Michigan’s decrease in unemployment was as rapid as any state in the nation, even though the previously adopted higher taxes were still in effect. Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, added that even if Labrador were correct that tax policy hampered Michigan’s economic growth, it still wouldn’t necessarily provide any useful advice on the topic the Meet the Press panelists began with -- the federal fiscal picture. "The lessons we can draw for federal policy based on the experience of states is questionable," Burtless said. "In the long run, high state tax burdens may slow state growth rates, but that does not mean the result applies to the federal government. Middle- or high-income residents of high-tax jurisdictions may move to lower-tax jurisdictions to reduce their tax burdens -- Michiganders to Texas, New Yorkers to Georgia, Californians to Idaho. But there’s very little evidence for this effect in the country as a whole. How many Americans will move to Mexico or Canada to avoid higher federal taxes in the United States?" Our ruling Even though Labrador ignored the revised numbers, we consider his recap of the arc of Michigan unemployment to be fair. However, while higher taxes may have boosted unemployment on the margins, most of the available evidence suggests that Michigan’s rise in unemployment tracked the course of the national recession, simply to a greater degree, given the weakness of the state’s signature manufacturing sector. The experts we spoke to agreed that the impact of tax policy likely played a relatively minor role in the unemployment spike Labrador was referring to in 2008 and 2009.

pomt-01346	"The next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/22/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-next-state-budget-will-begin-535/	Gov. Scott Walker put a happy face on the state’s long-term budget outlook in his second debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke. "The most recent fiscal year just ended with a cash balance of some $517 million," Walker said. "And the next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact. That means we can invest in our priorities." That first figure is undisputed and widely reported: The state ended the year from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in the black by $517 million. But Burke challenged Walker’s second figure. There’s a $1.8 billion shortfall heading into the 2015-’17 budget, she said, not a "surplus of over half a billion dollars." That’s a huge difference. To determine if Walker is right about the projected $535 million surplus, we turned to reports issued by the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. But first, we want to be crystal clear about what is being debated here. It’s not a prediction of how the second year of the 2013-’15 budget will end up. Rather, Walker is talking about projections on where the state’s finances will be as the next governor and Legislature put the 2015-’17 budget together in early 2015. This is what is often referred to as the "structural deficit." The name is unfortunate. The figure does not reflect a "deficit" or -- if Walker is right -- a "surplus" at the end of a budget year. Rather, it is a tally of past decisions -- both in spending and in tax collections -- that officials will have to account for in the next two-year budget. As such, it’s a benchmark for the size of the budget challenge. The Fiscal Bureau does this exercise periodically, mostly during budget season. The bureau’s longstanding method is to assume no loss or gain in revenue and no changes in spending. Applying the same approach allows for a consistent picture over time. The bureau’s latest estimate came out Sept. 8, 2014. The bottom line: a $1.76 billion deficit heading into the 2015-’17 budget. Among the chief reasons for the gap: Tax cuts approved by Walker and the Republican-led Legislature, which contributed to a slowing of revenue. The numbers cited by Walker So what is Walker referring to with his $535 million surplus figure? That figure is contained in a Sept. 18, 2014 Fiscal Bureau memo to a Republican state representative, John Nygren of Marinette. In the wake of the $1.8 billion estimate, Nygren asked the bureau to look at it a different way. He asked for an estimate of the budget challenge assuming that lawmakers would hold most spending at 2014-’15 levels for the two following years, and tax revenue would rise at the five-year average of 2.9 percent. That yielded an estimate of a $535 million surplus. The Fiscal Bureau also got a request from a Democrat, state Sen. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse. It asked the Fiscal Bureau to run an estimate based on increases in school spending, granting state agencies their $1 billion spending requests and other changes. Budget requests came in Sept. 15, 2014. That estimate was a $2.7 billion shortfall. Another scenario run for Shilling was a deficit of $4 billion. You get the idea. Just weeks from the Nov. 4, 2014 election, both parties have come up with ways to manipulate the Fiscal Bureau’s $1.8 billion estimate using some scenarios that range from spending freezes to giving agencies everything on their wish lists. We’re not buying it. Walker’s own budgets report the "structural deficit" number using the method the Fiscal Bureau used to come up with $1.8 billion. And lawmakers of both parties have done the same for years. Indeed, Walker has used the "structural deficit" estimates to his advantage in the past and even has made it the centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Every time you hear the governor say he inherited a $3.6 billion "deficit" from Gov. Jim Doyle, it’s a reflection in part of the $2.5 billion "structural deficit" the Fiscal Bureau estimated in 2011 as Walker prepared his first budget. And Walker, again using the Fiscal Bureau’s traditional methodology, has touted the fact that his tight budgeting actually eliminated -- however temporarily -- the structural deficit heading into his second budget. Walker’s campaign argues that the Fiscal Bureau memo is based on some outdated figures and that it’s zero-growth assumption is unrealistic. But the governor is seeking to have it both ways, trumpeting the bureau’s method when it suits him and rejecting it when it does not. The numbers will change again when the Fiscal Bureau updates its report in early 2015. Our rating Walker told debate viewers: "The next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact." That rosy number flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor’s budget office. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08813	Obama's approval numbers 'are in the low 40s.'	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/16/matthew-dowd/matthew-dowd-says-obamas-approval-ratings-are-low-/	During the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Matthew Dowd, a former political strategist for President George W. Bush, used poll numbers to explain President Barack Obama's relatively weak political position. Obama's "approval numbers in this country are in the low 40s," Dowd said. "He's perceived as not able to handle all the major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of this country right now questions his leadership." We thought we'd look at whether Dowd was right on the polling numbers. We checked with the poll-analysis website pollster.com and found 16 traditional, live-caller telephone polls taken by media organizations or independent polling firms between mid July and mid August 2010. We excluded polls taken by automatic-dialing programs, by the Internet or by partisan firms. The polls we looked at included a sampling of either all adults or registered voters. The two most recently released polls confirm Dowd's statement. A Gallup poll taken between Aug. 12 and Aug. 14, found a 42 percent approval rate, while a Fox News-Opinion Dynamics poll taken Aug. 10 to Aug. 11, 2010, found 43 percent approval. But most polls in the past month have not been quite so low. Among the five polls taken in the last week before the show aired, including the two cited above, Obama's approval rating averaged 45 percent. And that percentage has been remarkably consistent. Among the eight polls taken during the two weeks prior to the show, Obama's approval rating averaged better than 45 percent. Among the 13 polls in the three weeks prior to the show, he averaged slightly under 45 percent. And among the 16 polls from the month prior to the show, the average was, once again, 45 percent. So over the course of the last month, Obama's approval rating in independent, traditional-format polls has consistently averaged approximately 45 percent -- that is, in the mid 40s, rather than the low 40s. However, the two most recent polls -- showing Obama's approval at 42 percent and 43 percent -- are smack in the middle of the low 40s. Whether these poll results are blips or the start of a new downward trend remains to be seen. For now, we'll give Dowd the benefit of the doubt and rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06903	Says unemployment in Trenton is "twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state" and, as a result, "we have seen an increase in crime."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/26/shirley-turner/sen-shirley-turner-claims-unemployment-trenton-dou/	When the unemployment rate goes up, crime will follow. That’s what Sen. Shirley Turner (D-Mercer) has said is happening in Trenton, where municipal officials are preparing to lay off about 110 patrol officers and demote more than half of its police supervisors. The senator made that argument during a July 12 debate on the Senate floor about overriding a veto from Gov. Chris Christie and restoring $50 million in municipal public safety aid. That measure ultimately failed in a 24-13 vote. "You cannot do anything else if you don’t feel safe. And we know that in our urban areas today, particularly right here in the city of Trenton, which is not unlike most cities in the state, we have experienced an exceedingly high unemployment, twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state, and we all know that when you have high unemployment, crime follows," Turner told her colleagues. Turner continued, "We have seen an increase in crime -- gang activity, child abuse, spousal abuse, gun violence. All of this goes hand-in-hand with a very deep recession." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check three points in Turner’s statement: is Trenton’s unemployment rate double every other part of the state; has crime in the capitol city increased; and does higher unemployment lead to more crime? We found that Turner was right about the increase in crime, but she overstated Trenton’s unemployment rate and research shows unemployment has a mixed impact on crime. Even the city’s police director said unemployment is not the sole reason for criminal activity. First, let’s talk about the city’s unemployment rate. In May, Trenton had an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent, which was slightly below the city’s 2010 average unemployment rate of 12.8 percent, according to data from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development and available at the time of Turner’s statement. Compared to 97 other municipalities with populations of at least 25,000, Trenton’s unemployment rate was below that of 14 towns and higher than the rates in 83 towns. But Trenton’s rate was roughly double or more than double the rates in only 13 of those municipalities, not "every other area of the state," as Turner had said. Those 13 municipalities had unemployment rates of 6.7 percent or less. Turner acknowledged the mistake in a phone interview. "I shouldn’t have said ‘every other,’" she said. Now, let’s turn to the city’s crime statistics. Based on data provided by Acting Police Director Joseph Juniak, crime in Trenton increased slightly in the first six months of this year, compared with the first six months of 2010. The "crime index" -- which includes seven major types of offenses -- went up by 63 offenses, or nearly 4 percent, for the first half of 2011. Given the number of guns involved in 2011 incidents and the number of guns recovered this year, violent crime with weapons could rise even further this year, according to Juniak. So, Turner was wrong about how Trenton’s unemployment rate compares with the rest of New Jersey, but she was right about increasing crime in the city. But does higher unemployment lead to more crime? PolitiFact New Jersey looked at four studies and reached out to various experts. We discovered a similar conclusion each time: unemployment rates affect property crime, such as burglaries and motor vehicle thefts, but they have a smaller impact or no effect at all on violent crime, such as murders and robberies. Looking at data from all 50 states between 1971 and 1997, a study published in 2001 estimated that a drop of 1 percentage point in the unemployment rate results in a decline in the property crime rate of between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent, but only a half percent decline in the violent crime rate. That study was done by a professor of public policy in California and an economics professor in Austria. Using data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. from 1978 to 2004, another study published in November 2010 determined that a 1 percentage point increase in a state unemployment rate translates into 3,762 additional property crimes per year. However, violent crime does not respond to changes in state unemployment, according to that study. Naci Moran, an economics professor at Louisiana State University and one of the authors of that study, told us in an email that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases property crime by slightly more than 2 percent. But the impact of unemployment on violent crime is weaker, Moran wrote. "The upshot is that the claim made by that senator is supported by scientific research and that unemployment has an impact on crime," Moran wrote. Jay Hamilton, chair of the Economics Department at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, added in an email: "If there is a general consensus it would probably be that when we find a relationship between the two it is weaker than most people would suspect." Back to Turner’s statement: During a debate on the Senate floor, Turner said the unemployment rate in Trenton is "twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state." Due to the high unemployment, there’s been an increase in crime in the capitol city, she said. Recent crime statistics back up the senator’s claim about increased crime, but on the other two points, Turner’s statement is flawed. The city’s unemployment rate is not as high as she claimed. Also, studies have shown that unemployment can affect property crime, but it has a reduced impact on violent crime. We rate her statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02402	On Syria, "a lot of the allies signed on. At the last minute, Obama backed off."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/09/dick-cheney/cheney-says-lots-allies-backed-syrian-air-strike/	The Republican storyline on the crisis in Crimea ties Russian aggression to foreign policy mistakes by President Barack Obama. Former Vice President Dick Cheney pressed this interpretation of events in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. "We have created an image around the world, not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness," Cheney said. "The Syrian situation is a classic. We got all ready to do something. A lot of the allies signed on. At the last minute, Obama backed off." Cheney obviously thought Syria was a telling example, because he came back and said it again a few moments later. International support for military intervention in Syria was a muddy business, and we thought we should look at where America’s allies stood after chemical weapons were used in Syria. Were "a lot of them ready to go"? We reached out to Cheney, via the Republican National Committee, to learn which allies he had in mind. The RNC made an effort but we did not hear back before we published. A quick recap In August 2012, President Obama told reporters that the United States had no plans to use military force against Syria but "a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus." A year later, an attack on an opposition-held suburbs on the outskirts of Damascus brought matters to a head. The bodies brought into hospitals and the illness that struck the doctors and nurses that treated the victims pointed to the use of chemical weapons. The attack took place on Aug. 21 and within a week, the administration was talking about launching air strikes at weapon depots and military command centers in Syria. Under the best of circumstances for the White House, any such military action would come with some sort of endorsement from the United Nations Security Council and the participation of America’s key European and Middle Eastern allies. Who signed on and who didn’t Both France and Britain were early supporters of a limited air strike. French President Francois Hollande said, "France is ready to punish those who took the heinous decision to gas innocents." British Prime Minister David Cameron said the international response should be legal and proportionate, while a top official was quoted as saying it was "reasonable to assume our armed forces are making contingency plans." But while Cameron was counted among those ready to attack, the British parliament took a different view. At the end of August, dozens of members of Cameron’s own party deserted him, and a motion to back the use of force failed by 13 votes. It was an unprecedented loss for a prime minister, and Cameron said he would cancel a military deployment that had already begun. Support among the other European states was equally hard to find. Italy said it would only go along if the U.N. Security Council approved the use of force. Germany was seen as a pivotal player and was clearly against military action. With opinion polls showing over 60 percent of Germans favoring diplomacy over force, and elections just a few weeks away, the German government stopped well short of endorsing a military response. Germany signed on to a G20 statement that called the use of poisonous gas a war crime and said the Syrian government was the likely culprit. But having said that, the statement added, "The EU underscores at the same time the need to move forward with addressing the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process." The role of the United Nations was critical because the strongest legal justification for an air strike would come through the U.N. Security Council. That was impossible since two permanent members, Russia and China, had made it clear they would veto any such resolution. The strongest support within NATO came from Turkey. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-time political foe. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the Arab League never approved a military strike. As the White House aimed to muster international backing, it looked for ways to maintain a sense of momentum. On Sept. 6, it released a joint statement from Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The statement called for "a strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated. Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable." However, the nature of "a strong international response" was left undefined. At one point, the administration said 25 nations had signed on but that did not mean they all endorsed air strikes. Ultimately, even France said it wanted to wait for a final report from U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. By mid September, the United States and Russia had struck a deal that sidelined the use of force in exchange for Syria giving up its chemical weapons. That process is underway but is behind schedule. Our ruling Cheney said a lot of allies "got ready to go" on Syria and "signed on," but Obama backed out. Actually, very few American allies were "ready to go." We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. And France’s support seemed to wane as time went on. Among the "no" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In fact, the United Kingdom’s parliament offered an embarrassing rebuke to Cameron when it blocked British participation. The Arab League did not endorse the military action, nor did the United Nations. Obama has said he declined to pursue military action because Syria agreed to weapons inspections. There’s no dispute that for whatever reason, military action was not pursued in Syria. But Cheney was re-writing history when he said "a lot of the allies signed on." We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08029	Says the 3C Corridor train would have taken "an hour and 15 minutes longer" to carry passengers across Ohio "than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/07/brent-larkin/columnist-brent-larkins-claim-about-1935-steam-tra/	If former Gov. Ted Strickland had used a theme song in his unsuccessful re-election bid, it might have been "I've Been Working on the Railroad." Jobs were the biggest issue of the fall campaign, and Strickland said that thousands would be created by his plan for a "3C Corridor" passenger rail system linking Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. He described Gov.-elect John Kasich’s intention to kill the plan and return a $400 million federal grant as tragic and a job-killer. Critics of the plan claimed that its employment potential was exaggerated, its ridership forecasts were too optimistic and its cost projections too low. Ultimately, Plain Dealer columnist and former editorial director Brent Larkin wrote: "Voters never warmed to the idea of spending hundreds of millions on a passenger rail project that would have taken riders from Cleveland to Cincinnati over a period an hour and 15 minutes longer than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935." We don’t usually look at remarks from columnists, but that comment stopped PolitiFact Ohio in its tracks. We knew that the 3C Corridor was not a high-speed rail plan. We had not realized it was more like a trip back in time. So PolitiFact Ohio asked Larkin where he got his figures. He referred us first to a year-old feasibility report on the proposed Cleveland-to-Columbus-to- Cincinnati Amtrak service. "This is the schedule Amtrak said it would run, and the schedule Ohio included as part of its application to the feds for the $400 million," Larkin said. "No other schedule was ever formally provided to the feds." The proposed schedule shows a 255-mile Cleveland to Cincinnati trip taking 6-1/2 hours. The first daily train would leave Cleveland at 6:30 a.m. and arrive in Cincinnati at 1 p.m. Larkin then shared a railroad timetable from New York Central Lines, effective Feb 3, 1935. It showed a departure time of 3:10 p.m. from Cincinnati and an arrival in Cleveland of 8:20 p.m., for a travel time of 5 hours 10 minutes -- an hour and 20 minutes faster than the 3C line. Criticism of the 3C as "snail rail" with an average speed of 39 mph started as soon as the project was proposed. The Ohio Department of Transportation responded in September with a new average estimate of 50 mph and "speed up to 79." It shortened the Cleveland-to-Cincinnati trip to 5 hours 12 minutes. But, not so fast. As an October story in the Columbus Dispatch noted, ODOT itself had said a year earlier that the trip couldn't be made in less than 5 hours 20 minutes -- even if the trains didn't stop. ODOT’s revised schedule hadn't even been seen by the three freight lines that own the tracks the 3C passenger trains would use, putting its feasibility in serious doubt. And, no matter how weak or strong its support, the optimistic revision still comes up longer than the best rail time of 1935. "The schedules speak for themselves," Larkin said. We rate his statement as True.	None	Brent Larkin	None	None	None	2011-01-07T06:00:00	2011-01-02	['Ohio', 'New_York_Central_Railroad']
pomt-07309	"The Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election. A very small percentage of that has come from organized labor."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/17/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chair-chris-redfern-says-don/	Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern and his GOP counterpart Kevin DeWine sparred recently during WCPN’s Sound of Ideas radio program in Cleveland. Both are former legislators, young, brash and well-oiled talking-point machines who frequently appear together to defend their respective politics and candidates. Controversial Senate Bill 5, the new law that overhauls the state’s collective bargaining rules for some 360,000 public employees, drove the discussion at several points on the May 4 program hosted by The Plain Dealer’s Tipoff columnist, Mike McIntyre. Democrats and labor groups fiercely oppose the law and want to put it before voters in November. But a caller to the show who identified himself as a Democrat complained that the party is influenced too much by labor groups. Not so, Redfern said. "Over the course of the last six months, for instance, the Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election. A very small percentage of that has come from organized labor." Given PolitiFact Ohio’s weakness for a political boast, especially one that includes a statistic – we decided to take a closer look. Redfern’s reference to the last six months coincides with the current election cycle, which began when the books closed on fundraising for the Nov. 2, 2010, election. PolitiFact Ohio asked for an accounting of the $1.1 million and the union contributions because political donations are not reported publicly in real time and parties typically have several accounts. Party spokesman Seth Bringman said the money was raised this calendar year; that after the November election, fundraising didn’t get underway in earnest until after the December holidays. The party raised $383,191 this year for its federal campaign account, which is used when the party promotes a candidate running for federal office, such as the U.S. Senate, Bringman said. The Federal Elections Commission requires the party to submit monthly reports on contributions to the federal account. PolitiFact checked the party’s claims against FEC records and found the figure accurate. The party raised another $477,901 for its state account, as detailed in its "pre-primary" report filed in April with the Ohio Secretary of State, Bringman said. The report shows the party raised $455,281. The slight difference is a result of refund and other accounting issues required by the state. For the analysis, PolitiFact Ohio is using the figure reported to the state. PolitiFact Ohio verified $858,472 through records. Bringman said the remaining money – about $242,000 --will be detailed in forthcoming reports. We’re taking him at his word, since the figure will be easily verifiable once reports are filed. Next we looked to see what percentage of the money raised came from labor groups. Bringman provided a list of contributions from labor organizations received this year. The contributions, which include $25,000 from the Ohio Education Association, total $66,645. That translates to about 6 percent of the total raised this year. PolitiFact Ohio matched these labor donations to the state report. Bringman insisted that the forthcoming reports detailing the remaining $140,000 will not show any additional labor-group money. We also evaluated whether the money raised from labor over the last six-month reflects what the Democratic Party typically draws from labor. Is the figure an anomaly that works to Redfern’s advantage in responding to the caller? On the radio program, Redfern went on to say that "our support, financially speaking, has been and will always be" from individual donors, many of them who make small donations. That comment drew a rebuke from DeWine, who said the amount of money labor groups contributed to Democrats in 2010 is "staggering." The GOP chairman produced a spread sheet for us that showed $8.2 million in contributions from labor groups to 2010 Democratic candidates – including those running for the Ohio General Assembly and statewide offices — and to state and county Democratic parties. Bringman estimated that together the state party, statewide candidates, General Assembly candidates and county parties raised about $50 million in the 2010. The would mean union donations accounted for about 16 percent. So where does this leave Redfern’s statements on the Truth-o-Meter? Campaign figures support his claim that that his party has raised $1.1 million since November. Unions contributed a bit under 7 percent of the total, which allows Redfern -- generously speaking -- to claim the it’s a "very small percentage" of what it raised so far. One important caveat: The figures presented by both Democrats and the GOP only take into account money given to the Democratic Party and its candidates. But that doesn’t include any money spent directly by labor organizations on behalf of a candidate. That’s a piece of additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern’s claim Mostly True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2011-05-17T06:00:00	2011-05-04	['None']

pomt-07754	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is "manufactured" and a "bogus figure."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/mark-pocan/wisconsin-state-rep-mark-pocan-says-gov-scott-walk/	Democrats trying to stop Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s move to sharply curtail public employee collective bargaining rights attack the plan itself, but also challenge Walker’s depiction of a crisis that he says demands such sweeping changes. In a Feb. 16 blog post headlined, "Walker’s Trojan Horse," Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan of Madison scoffs at Walker’s estimate of a $3.6 billion shortfall facing the governor as he prepares the two-year state budget he’s set to introduce March 1, 2011. "Governor Scott Walker’s manufactured $3.6 billion state budget deficit in the next biennium is rapidly unraveling as a bogus figure," Pocan wrote. "The only way you can slip a bunch of bad public policy into law in Wisconsin is to disguise it as something else. Create a crisis, claim you are the sole path to resolving that crisis needing to enact whatever measures are necessary and he a hero to the people. Right." The $3.6 billion figure -- for the two-year budget starting July 1, 2011 -- has not received much scrutiny in the media. Given its importance in the debate, and reader requests to test it, we decided to dig in. An important note: The number shouldn’t be confused with the $137 million deficit for current budget year ending June 30, 2011. Walker’s "repair bill" for that budget is the focus of the massive protests in Madison over the collective bargaining restrictions in the bill. But that provision would affect the two-year budget, too, because Walker wants local governments to use the limits on union power to offset the cuts in state aid he will propose. First we turned to Pocan, who was co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee when Democrats controlled the action in the last session, under then-Gov. Jim Doyle, also a Democrat. Pocan acknowledges the state has serious fiscal concerns that must be addressed in the next budget. But he thinks a more realistic figure for the shortfall is somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, in part because legislators will likely limit state agencies close to a spending freeze. So, is Walker puffing up the projected shortfall by more than 100 percent? In short, is the number -- as Pocan claims -- "bogus"? Before we dive into the question, a bit of background. A projected budget shortfalls is just that, a projection. It’s an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services. The process has some inherently political overtones. As we have noted in the past, incoming governors often seek to make the problem large so they can come off as budget-cutting heroes when they submit their plan. Governors leaving office have an incentive to downplay shortfalls to burnish their reputations for fiscal responsibility. In terms of size, the shortfall that Walker projects is nothing unusual over the last decade. For instance, Doyle estimated a $3.2 billion deficit heading into 2003-2005, and at least $5.4 billion heading into 2009-2011. The shortfalls are owing in large part to changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections -- which are dependent on the economy among other factors. Walker’s timing is good on the revenue front: Tax revenue is expected to rise $1.5 billion in the biennium compared to this year, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. On the spending side, another factor that explains the biennial budget squeeze is beefed-up state commitments to school aid, prisons and health care for the needy that date to the 1990s. When determining the shortfall, one of the few statutory rules of the game is that the shortfall report comes out before the governor makes his recommendations and ultimately presents a budget. In a November item, we reviewed the Doyle administration’s estimate of a $1.5 billion to $2.2 million deficit. In rating it False we said found Doyle’s report made an "$800 million assumption -- it counts as continued savings cuts that are really decisions for the new governor." Doyle, we reported, assumed in his estimate that Walker would continue several cost-saving measures Doyle had used to balance the current two-year budget. Those measures included furloughs, a roll-back of a 2 percent pay raise and across-the-board spending cuts. Walker, of course, may end up using some of those methods to balance the budget, but Doyle’s assumption dramatically reduced the size of the challenge Walker inherits. We also faulted the November report from Doyle for counting on $528 million in additional federal Medicaid payments, which the report said was iffy. Another $200 million debt hanging over the state’s head was not accounted for at all -- the repayment of a transfer from the state’s patient compensation fund that was invalidated by the courts. And Doyle’s version counted on $300 million from unspecified cuts in the Department of Health Services. When you add those items in, the deficit figure was more like $3.3 billion. Fast forward to 2011. Walker’s new team revised Doyle’s report in February, estimating the shortfall at $3.6 billion for the biennium. How did they arrive at that? Was it just a matter of reversing some of Doyle’s assumptions? Not entirely. Walker’s package of tax cuts for business and people with health savings accounts, added another $140 million to the projected shortfall -- that’s lost revenue to the state treasury. The cuts were approved in January shortly after he took office. And the administration added back $1.2 billion in social service spending based on what they say is need that can’t be ignored in the Medicaid entitlement program. That was included in a memo from Budget Director Brian Hayes to the secretary of the Department of Administration, his boss. The Walker estimate also scrapped the $800 million that Doyle’s aides had included for prospective cuts. While in office, Doyle asked many agencies -- but not nearly all -- to freeze their budget requests at this year’s level. Those were submitted by his appointees. Under the adjustments by Walker’s appointees, those requests add up to a much larger number. State budget officials did not return calls for this item. We turned UW-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky to opine on Walker’s numbers. Reschovsky, who teaches at the La Follette School of Public Affairs, estimates the state deficit at close to Walker’s figure of $3.6 billion. He said the agency spending numbers were realistic, and that Doyle’s figure obscured the scope of the problem. "People who suggest the problem isn’t real, I don’t think they are right," he said. Reschovsky uses his own formula for the calculations, but was familiar with the February memo from Hayes laying out the administration’s numbers. In contrast, Pocan -- whose claim the figure is "bogus" is the one we are evaluating -- said he had not seen the Hayes memo and was not familiar with its assumptions. Pocan argues that agency increases over two years will never stand -- either in Walker’s budget proposal or during the Legislature’s review. But that steers the discussion off point: Those requests, which largely reflect a continuation of current programs, are what creates the gap. It is in cutting them that revenues and spending are balanced. Pocan gets some backing from Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research organization. "The statutory practice of including agency requests in initial budget numbers is very misleading and confusing for the public," Berry said. "They are wishes, not reality." But Berry argues that the state’s use of budget gimmicks dating back into the 1990s has created a rolling "structural deficit" that puts the state in a deep hole even as it starts its budget process. Partly as a result of that, he thinks the two-year deficit is easily over $3 billion, even if some of the agency requests are inflated. Let’s wrap this up. Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan accused Walker of manufacturing a crisis for his own ends. Pocan says the deficit problem is about half what Walker claims. Walker will surely knock down the spending increases requested by state agencies, to bring costs in line with revenue. But Walker is following the rules and traditions of the shortfall-prediction game, and outside experts say his figure is realistic as a measure of the challenge he faces. And Pocan hurts his cause by not having read the latest shortfall estimate report by Walker’s top aides. We rate Pocan’s statement False.

pomt-01095	A private company building a natural gas pipeline into Florida "is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies."	true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/12/marco-rubio/six-federal-agencies-must-review-florida-natural-g/	Sen. Marco Rubio previewed a potential 2016 presidential run in his new book, American Dreams, by outlining several policy positions -- including a push for energy independence and a distaste for industrial regulation. The Republican discussed in one chapter the future of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, praising the process known as hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) for providing abundant oil and natural gas. But "government-created obstacles" such as overregulation of the energy sector make the United States its own worst enemy, Rubio wrote, and states such as Florida suffer for it. "A private company is interested in building a natural gas pipeline into Florida," the book read. "But before it can even begin construction, it is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies." No matter your political stance on government regulation, we’re not civil engineers, so we didn’t know how many federal entities were needed to approve a new pipeline. We decided to pull the permits and find out whether Rubio was correct. Sabal Trail Transmission Neither Rubio’s Senate office nor his book publicist returned our calls, but the biggest pipeline project on the drawing board to come into Florida is the Sabal Trail Transmission expansion. The project stretches about 460 miles from central Alabama through Georgia to Florida just south of Orlando, eventually sending natural gas all the way to a Florida Power & Light plant in South Florida. The state’s gas capacity would increase 20 percent, at a cost of $3 billion. Duke Energy also has plans to build a connection from the pipeline to power its Crystal River plant. Environmentalists have decried the project, calling the pipeline and its compressor stations unnecessary and the source of too much pollution. It would be the third major natural gas pipeline into the state. The plan begat another controversy when it was discovered that Gov. Rick Scott owned a $53,000 stake in the company responsible for the project after signing legislation in 2013 to help approve permits for the pipeline. The Public Service Commission, run by Scott appointees, later that year approved building the pipeline. When Scott in 2014 disclosed the assets of a blind trust held in his name as part of his re-election campaign, the Broward Bulldog noted he owned the stake in Spectra Energy, the Houston company working with FP&L’s parent company NextEra Energy to build the pipeline. Scott’s office argued that because the holdings were bought as part of the blind trust, there’s no way the governor knew about it, and therefore the stake didn’t present a conflict of interest. Scott did use proceeds from the trust to fund in part his 2014 re-election bid. His office told us they had no further comment on the issue. Sabal Trail Transmission LLC, the joint Spectra and NextEra company building the pipeline, made no secret about the regulatory process for the pipeline, which began surveys in September 2013. The company directed us to a resource report that listed all the agencies from which the company must get approval. There are many state agencies listed, including the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and various water management districts. There’s also a list of federal agencies: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees all pipeline building in the United States. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees permits for compliance with health and environmental requirements. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which examines the project for dredge and fill permits and compliance with the Rivers and Harbors Act. Three districts of the Corps are involved. U.S. Department of Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service, which examines the plan over three states for effects on endangered species and migratory birds. U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Marine Fisheries Service, technically two agencies in the same federal department, which consult on the impact on endangered species, marine mammals and fish habitats. So that’s five listed outright in the project’s paperwork. But Sabal Trail Transmission LLC pointed out there’s a sixth, too. U.S. Department of Transportation, which has the authority to conduct a facilities design safety review, and perform construction inspections. And since there’s construction and other work involved, we’ll go ahead and tack on the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s requirements, to give Rubio a smidge of extra credit. Is that too much regulation? That depends on your political point of view. But Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposes the project, says it’s not like those groups are simply there to mire the project in red tape. "Every agency has a distinct role in this pipeline, which is going through very delicate ecosystems, geologic formations and communities in our state," she said. The pipeline expansion is currently in regulatory review, with a projected completion date of May 2017. Our ruling Rubio said a private company building a natural gas pipeline into Florida "is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies." When we checked on the groups involved in the building of the Sabal Trail Transmission expansion, five agencies were listed in paperwork from the builder. Throw in the fact the Department of Transportation has to okay the plans, that makes six. OSHA compliance could bring it to seven, but Rubio doesn’t need it. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01708	The cost of "college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/10/cormick-lynch/ri-congressional-candidate-cormick-lynch-says-educ/	Cormick Lynch, a Republican running to replace Democrat U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, is concerned about the cost of education. During a debate with his GOP challenger, Stan Tran, on the WPRI Newsmakers program that aired Aug. 3, Lynch complained that college tuition and fees have gone through the roof over the past 36 years. "College education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978," he said. "This isn't your parents' college education. Students -- young students -- are issuing outrageous amounts of debt to go to college and get a degree, and the only thing the schools are guaranteeing them after that is a bill." Lynch said the injection of federal money is one of the reasons the costs have gone up so much. "Education costs should not increase more than the rate of inflation." Critics have long argued that escalating government loan problems have pushed college costs higher and higher. A 1,200 percent increase means the cost of education is 13 times higher than in 1978. That sounded high to us, so we thought we'd check his statistic. Lynch said he based the number on an April 23, 2013 article on the business website fastcoexist.com, where it says -- in a story and in a graphic -- that since 1979, public and private college costs have increased 1,120 percent. It's based on a report by Bloomberg and Business Week. Lynch then added 33 percent a year for 2013 and 2014 and rounded it up to 1,200 percent. We confirmed the trend -- and got more up-to-date numbers -- by going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows a 1,172 percent increase from July 1978 to June 2014, which rounds up to the amount cited by Lynch. Lynch's problem: His statement doesn’t account for inflation, which increased the cost of things we buy -- from a dozen eggs to a college education -- by 265 percent from 1979 to 2012. We confirmed the numbers by turning to data from National Center for Education Statistics, which looks at costs a bit differently using dollar amounts from the schools as far back as the 1963-64 school year. The latest statistics cover the 2012-13 school year and look at costs with and without inflation. Without inflation, the typical price tag for tuition and fees for the 1977-78 school year was $984. It was $10,683 for the 2012-13 school year -- a 985 percent increase. But when changes in the cost of living are taken into consideration, the typical $984 college bill for 1977-78 would now be about $3,636. Then the average bill for the 2012-13 school year ($10,683) would be 194 percent higher, not 1,200 percent. The inflation-adjusted increases were 147 percent for private or nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, 234 percent for public four-year institutions and 147 percent for public two-year colleges. Point of interest: At URI, tuition and fees for in-state students totaled $924 for the 1977-78 school year. The total for 2012-13 was $12,450, an increase of 277 percent if you adjust for inflation and 1,247 percent if you don't. Our ruling Cormick Lynch said the cost of "college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978." He should have made it clear that he wasn't adjusting for inflation. His statement is only close to true if the median household income had remained at $15,000 per year (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and a loaf of bread was still 54 cents (as it was in 1978, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). If you adjust those tuition numbers for the rising cost of living, Lynch's percentage is six times too high. The statement is accurate in the sense that college cost have increased many times faster than the cost of other things we buy. But it fails to account for inflation -- an important omission -- that would put the comparison in context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04325	Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson ran Medicare "into the ground" and "nine years closer to bankruptcy."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/26/tammy-baldwin/tommy-thompson-ran-medicare-ground-us-health-and-h/	In the second debate between U.S. Senate candidates Tammy Baldwin and Tommy Thompson, the Democratic congresswoman lit into the Republican former governor on Medicare. Baldwin rebuked Thompson on his performance as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a post he took after leaving the governor’s office. "When Tommy Thompson left Wisconsin in 2001 to join the Bush administration, he ran Medicare. You could say he ran it into the ground," Baldwin charged in the Oct. 18, 2012, debate. "When he came to the administration, Medicare was approaching bankruptcy in the year 2029; when he left, it was 2020 -- nine years closer to bankruptcy. That's the Tommy Thompson record as secretary under George W. Bush." That’s pretty tough stuff, especially the thrust of Baldwin’s accusation, that Thompson was personally responsible for pushing Medicare closer to bankruptcy. Medicare and its solvency Medicare, the government health insurance program that serves some 49 million senior citizens and people under 65 with certain disabilities, cost $549 billion in 2011. It is funded by two separate trust funds. The trust fund for Medicare Part A -- which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices -- is funded mostly from federal payroll taxes. This is the trust fund typically cited when politicians from both parties warn of Medicare’s demise. Each year, the Medicare Board of Trustees projects the number of years before the Part A trust fund will be exhausted. Since 1999, when Baldwin first entered Congress, the annual reports have put the life of the trust fund at between eight and 28 years. The most recent projection, in March 2012, said the fund would be exhausted in 12 years, in 2024. Baldwin’s evidence Asked for evidence to back the claim, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited the Medicare board’s annual reports for 2001 and 2005 -- the years that correspond with Thompson’s tenure as Health and Human Services secretary. In 2001, the trust fund for Part A was projected to be solvent through 2029; but by 2005, it was projected to be exhausted in 2020, nine years sooner. Kraus argued that Thompson did nothing to prevent the nine-year slide. So, Baldwin was right on the numbers. But her claim put the blame squarely at Thompson’s feet, suggesting he could have prevented the slide himself. Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe noted it is Congress’ job to properly fund Medicare, saying Thompson only administered the program "as directed by law." Just what was his role? Other evidence PolitiFact National’s examination of a March 2012 claim by Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee, is helpful in evaluating Baldwin’s claim against Thompson. Romney’s statement was different -- he claimed President Barack Obama was "ending Medicare as we know it," partly by "allowing it to go bankrupt in less than 15 years." On the bankruptcy point, PolitiFact National pointed out that decisions made over nearly 50 years by many presidents and members of Congress put the program on an unsustainable path. Our colleagues also said "it’s not clear that Medicare’s situation fits the two definitions of ‘bankrupt’ we’ve used in the past -- to be ‘declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts’ or ‘reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished.’ Medicare is a government program; the government will have the ability to pay its bills, however financially painful that may become." On that point, PolitiFact National concluded: "We find it a ridiculous exaggeration to say Obama is personally responsible for Medicare’s woes." It would be even more ridiculous to lay full blame for Medicare’s move toward "bankruptcy" on a cabinet secretary. Expert views Two Medicare experts we interviewed agreed that the performance of the HHS secretary is a factor in the solvency of Medicare’s key trust fund, but far from the determining one. "It certainly is reasonable to say the secretary is the ultimate point person for Medicare in the administration," said Jack Hoadley, health policy analyst and research professor at Georgetown University. But he also said many factors, such as congressional actions and longstanding trends in demographics and health care spending, "matter in determining the life" of the fund. Joseph Antos, health care and retirement policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said an HHS secretary only implements Medicare law handed down by Congress. He said it’s "more correct to say Congress and the fee-for-service payment mechanism ran Medicare into the ground. The big spending is on payments for health services, and Congress sets payment rates through legislation. Fee-for-service gives a strong incentive for the use of more services, and more complex services, which increases total program spending." Our rating Baldwin said Thompson ran Medicare "into the ground" during his four years as health and human services secretary, citing the fact that its key trust fund moved nine years closer to insolvency. But Medicare’s financial health is determined more by presidents, members of Congress, health care costs and other factors -- over a period of decades -- than by the limited role of the HHS secretary. We rate Baldwin’s statement False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-10-26T11:37:58	2012-10-18	['Tommy_Thompson', 'United_States', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-09988	It is "the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/16/gus-bilirakis/dhs-report-right-wing-terror-risks-more-cautious-b/	Conservative groups have been sounding an alarm about a leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security they say portrays veterans and gun owners as likely terrorists. The outcry began in the conservative media, with reports from Fox News and commentary from radio host Rush Limbaugh and conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. Republican members of Congress then joined in. Here's a statement from Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. "I am disturbed and personally offended by the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts," he said. "Federal homeland security officials should focus on specific, verifiable and actionable intelligence to stop potential terrorist threats to our country. Instead the department is engaging in political and ideological profiling of people who fought to keep our country safe from terrorism, uphold our nation's immigration laws, and protect our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. It troubles me that the department has specifically avoided talking about foreign terrorism but seems more than willing to insult our nation's heroes returning from battle." The report was not supposed to be publicly available ("No portion . . . should be released to the media, the general public or over nonsecure Internet servers"). But somehow, it got released and is now widely available on the Web. ( Read it for yourself here .) The title is "Right-Wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment." It's part of an ongoing series of intelligence assessments issued by a Homeland Security division that works with the FBI to analyze threats within the United States. The reports go to state and local law enforcement officials and are marked as not for release to the general public. The report, dated April 7, 2009, begins by stating that it has "no specific information that domestic right-wing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence, but right-wing extremists may be gaining new recruits. ... The economic downturn and the election of the first African-American president present unique drivers for right-wing radicalization and recruitment." A few sections down, the report says, "The possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks." The nine-page report then explores at greater length potential factors exacerbating right-wing extremism: the economy, the election of President Barack Obama, illegal immigration, gun control legislation, perceived threats from other countries (the "New World Order") and finally, "disgruntled military veterans." The report says that "right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat. These skills and knowledge have the potential to boost the capabilities of extremists — including lone wolves or small terrorist cells — to carry out violence." The report mentions Timothy McVeigh as an example of a veteran who associated with an extremist group after Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991. (McVeigh's 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people.) On gun control, the report states that "a correlation may exist between the potential passage of gun control legislation and increased hoarding of ammunition, weapons stockpiling, and paramilitary training among right-wing extremists." But it also notes that "law-abiding Americans" may also make bulk purchases of ammunition. Countering claims that the DHS is targeting conservatives is the fact that the department issued a similar report on left-wing groups a few months previously. "Left-Wing Extremists Likely to Increase Use of Cyber Attacks over the Coming Decade," issued Jan. 26, 2009 (six days after Obama took office), said left-wing extremists include "radical elements of the anarchist, animal rights, or environmental movements" who are "willing to violate the law to achieve their objectives." So it's important to note that since Obama took office, the DHS has warned about extremists from both ends of the spectrum. Republicans seem to be the most vocal about the more recent report, but others have raised concerns about how the report described political opinion. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano that he was concerned about civil liberties. "As I am certain you agree, freedom of association and freedom of speech are guaranteed to all Americans — whether a person's beliefs, whatever their political orientation, are extremist or not," he wrote. "I am disappointed and surprised that the department would allow this report to be disseminated to its state, local and tribal partners in its present form." Napolitano said in a statement that the department was not targeting anyone's political views and monitored all types of extremist groups. "We don’t have the luxury of focusing our efforts on one group," she said. "We must protect the country from terrorism whether foreign or homegrown, and regardless of the ideology that motivates its violence." She also told CNN that the department had not intended to offend veterans. "I know that some veterans' groups were offended by the fact that veterans were mentioned in this assessment. So, I apologize for that offense. It was certainly not intended. I'll be meeting with the leaders of some of those groups next week," she told CNN on April 16. In another interview, Napolitano said that Republican leader John Boehner wants to make "political hay" out of the report. "There has been a lot of spinning out there in Washington, D.C.-land, but all we're trying to say across is, look, there is situational awareness that needs to go on," she told NBC's Matt Lauer. "These are routine reports. In fact, this one was begun months ago, before this new administration took office." This brings us back to Bilirakis' claim that DHS thinks that "returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts." This is a distortion of what the report actually said. The report said that right-wing extremists would try to recruit veterans, and that they would try to use gun control legislation as a "radicalization" tool. That's very different. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01391	Says Rick Scott changed his promise from 700,000 jobs created "on top of what normal growth would be" to just 700,000 jobs.	true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/14/charlie-crist/rick-scott-changed-terms-his-promise-create-700000/	What’s 700,000 jobs give or take … 1 million? That’s the question a new ad from the Charlie Crist campaign hopes to answer for Florida voters. "He made a promise," the ad says, showing video of Gov. Rick Scott from the 2010 campaign for governor. "Hold me accountable for delivering on the campaign promises I make," Scott says. The ad then shows Scott promising to create 700,000 jobs "on top of what normal growth would be." Later, in reaction to a reporter’s question on that metric, Scott said, "No." The ad is paid for by the Florida Democratic Party, but the Crist campaign approved it and promoted it to the media. So we’re rating it as coming from the Crist campaign. Since 2010, PolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott’s promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years, so this controversy is very familiar to us. But if you’re just tuning in now, we’ll start the story from the beginning. Because of the state’s housing-driven economy, Florida took a tremendous hit during the financial crash of 2008. By 2010, state economists said that the bottom had hit and Florida would gradually recover. That July, economists predicted that Florida would gradually recover, adding 1 million jobs by 2017 -- no matter who was governor. On July 21, 2010, Scott unveiled his now famous 7-7-7 plan, promising to create 700,000 new jobs in seven years (actually the plan was written to create 661,914 jobs, but the Scott campaign rounded up for effect). The jobs would flow from his pro-business, anti-regulation, anti-tax agenda. During the campaign, Scott said that the jobs would come on top of natural growth. "Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be," Scott said during a 2010 debate hosted by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association on Oct. 20. (This is the video shown in the Crist ad.) Accounting for normal growth would make the target 1.7 million jobs over seven years. A few months after Scott took office in 2011, though, he started backtracking. First his staff and then Scott himself announced that they would be counting new jobs toward a goal of 700,000, period, not 700,000 on top of natural growth. When an Associated Press reporter reminded Scott in August 2011 that his original promise was 700,000 jobs on top of natural growth, Scott said, "No, that’s not true." Members of the Sun Sentinel editorial board asked Scott in September 2011 if that was his promise -- "Your pledge was for 700,000 in addition to normal growth, wasn't it?'' -- and Scott said no. At the time, PolitiFact Florida rated Scott's new position a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. Scott seems to be sticking to his new metric. In May 2013, Scott said the state was "already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years" when approximately 302,500 net jobs had been created since December 2010. We rated the claim that he was halfway to his 2010 goal as Mostly False, noting that he still had a ways to go to make it to 1.7 million jobs created. His jobs promise, which we track on our Scott-O-Meter, is rated In the Works, because Scott promised the jobs would be created over seven years, and he still has three more years to go. The seven-year yardstick is ignored in Crist’s latest ad. Our ruling Crist’s ad says that Scott changed 2010 his 2010 promise of 700,000 jobs created "on top of what normal growth would be" to just 700,000 jobs. That’s a difference of 1 million jobs, as had been projected by economists. The ad provides a concise but accurate summary of Scott’s 2010 pledge and then his public statements that modified the terms. We rate the ad’s statement True.

pomt-14766	Says 25 percent of U.S. Muslims "agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/09/donald-trump/trump-cites-shaky-survey-call-ban-muslims-entering/	Donald Trump turned to polling data to justify his proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States. "According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population," the Republican presidential candidate said in a Dec. 7 statement. "Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad, and 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to shariah." There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we decided to focus on Trump’s claim that 25 percent of Muslims polled by the Center for Security Policy agree that global jihad justifies violence against Americans. While the study Trump cited does exist, it’s not at all clear that it supports his argument that "there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population." There are several important problems with the survey that call into question whether the results are representative of the entire U.S. Muslim population. Trump’s poll The Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank, surveyed 600 Muslims and released findings in June under the headline, "Poll of U.S. Muslims Reveals Ominous Levels Of Support For Islamic Supremacists’ Doctrine of Shariah, Jihad." Among the findings is 25 percent of respondents agreed either slightly or strongly with the statement "Violence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad." About 64 percent disagreed. The first problem with the Center for Security policy poll has to do with methodology. It was an online, opt-in survey, which tend to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. In traditional polling methods, everyone in a population has a chance of being selected for the survey, meaning the results generally reflect the country’s demographics. Numerous respected polling groups, like Survey Monkey, use opt-in surveys, said Christopher C. Hull, a former adjunct professor at Georgetown University who now works with the Center for Security Policy and answered an inquiry from PolitiFact on the group’s behalf. He added that the method is useful for reaching small populations, such as U.S. Muslims, who only make up about 1 percent of the population. Hull did caution, however, that "one cannot extrapolate directly from an online, opt-in survey to the broader U.S. population." One notable finding buried in the full survey data: It found that 23 percent of the U.S. Muslims surveyed said they are "not at all familiar with" the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, and 18 percent said they are not familiar with al-Qaida. Experts said it seems illogical that such a large percentage of American Muslims would not have knowledge of the two groups. "The al-Qaida number seems entirely implausible and likely a canary in a coal mine as to the unrepresentativeness of this survey," said David Dutwin, executive vice president and chief methodologist at SSRS, a research firm. There may be further problems with the poll, including the reality that many American Muslims are immigrants and not fluent in English, and that the survey asked leading questions with limited response choices, according to a critique by the Washington Post’s Philip Bump. It’s also worth noting that the head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has articulated a variety of theories about Muslim extremists that verge on conspiracy, such as the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the United States government and the false narrative that President Barack Obama is Muslim. Robert Oldendick, executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina, reviewed the survey methodology made available by the Center for Security Policy but said he still didn’t have enough information to assess whether it’s a good or bad poll. The group has not disclosed how the surveyors targeted participants and what the response rate was. "I would view these results very cautiously," Oldendick said. "It may be right, but it may not be. But the information to identify the quality of the sample is just not there." Compared with Pew Trump also mentioned research by the Pew Research Center as support for his proposal. On a key point, the results of the Center for Security Policy study diverge from the results of a 2011 Pew Research study, a traditional telephone survey of 1,033 U.S. Muslims. The methodology of the Pew poll, and the organization’s reputation, is considered solid by public-opinion experts. The Pew survey asked whether "suicide bombing/other violence against civilians is justified to defend Islam from its enemies." Just 1 percent said it is "often" justified, while 12 percent said it is "sometimes" or "rarely" justified. Eighty-one percent said it is "never" justified. According to Pew in 2011, about 13 percent of American Muslims said they believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. That’s half the rate of the Center for Security Policy finding of 25 percent. The 2011 Pew study also found that a "significant minority" -- 21 percent -- of American Muslims feel that there is a great deal or a fair amount of support for extremism in the American Muslim community. The Center for Security Policy survey results do not directly back up Trump’s proposal to stop Muslims from entering the United States, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Polling Company, which conducted the survey on the center’s behalf. "We did not -- nor would we -- ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims," she said. The Center for Security Policy poll has touched a nerve because it "asked questions that other polling firms are refusing to ask," Hull said, defending the results. "When people do not like the results of a poll, they attack the poll’s methodology and sponsor," he said. "This situation is no different." Our ruling Trump said that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims "agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad." Trump is referring to a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy. However, polling experts raise numerous questions about the validity of the poll’s results, including its "opt-in" methodology and the dubiously large percentages of respondents who said they were unaware of ISIS or al-Qaida. Moreover, an official with the Center for Security Policy cautioned against generalizing the poll results to the entire Muslim-American community. Another survey, which experts consider credible, found levels about half as high as what the Center for Security Policy poll found. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-07946	Says that 98,184 Texans are now driving with temporary driver’s licenses lacking their photos.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/26/mario-gallegos/mario-gallegos-says-98000-texas-motorists-legally-/	A Democratic state senator warned Tuesday that a Republican-sought mandate requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls could leave nearly 100,000 drivers unable to cast ballots. Sen. Mario Gallegos of Houston specified that 98,184 residents "are driving with this paper right here," waving a sheet of paper we took to be a state form, and without a license featuring their photo. His point: Such Texans would be prevented from voting if the legislation before the Senate passes into law. Gallegos’ statement came up as he pressed Republican senators to speak to how the proposal would affect drivers who relinquish their licenses to law enforcement officers and are then given temporary licenses. "I’ve known some folks that have had their licenses pulled and have not gone through the process, and there’s no photo ID. All they’re given is the sheet of paper that I have right here, that they’re driving with," Gallegos said. "98,184 that are driving with this paper right here, no photo ID." Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, replied that the issue needs clearing up. We reached Gallegos’ legislative director, Debra Gonzales, who shared information she attributed to the Texas Department of Public Safety stating that in 2010, 98,184 people were arrested for violating provisions of the Texas Transportation Code related to operating a motor vehicle or watercraft under the influence of alcohol. Section 524.011 of the code says the officer shall issue a temporary driving permit "unless department records show or the officer otherwise determines that the person does not hold a driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle" in Texas. The 2010 number is down from the recent high of 103,155, set in 2007, according to the information. Gonzales forwarded a copy of the form for the temporary permit, which says: "If your Texas driver license was confiscated, this document will serve as your temporary driving permit... This permit is valid for 40 days from the date of service," meaning the date the original license was taken away. If a driver seeks a hearing, though, the temporary permit remains valid until a judge makes a final decision in their case. Next, we contacted the DPS. Spokesman Tom Vinger said that once a detained driver is moved to a police station or sheriff’s office, he or she is asked to take a chemical test measuring blood alcohol concentration.The officer tells the driver their license will be suspended if they refuse to take the test or fail it. The officer also confiscates the original license and issues a temporary driving permit. In an e-mail, Vinger said that 98,184 people were arrested for driving while intoxicated during 2010. He cautioned, though, that not all of the drivers ended up with temporary licenses. Vinger also noted that a driver who has had their license confiscated due to a DWI arrest remains eligible for a Texas-issued identification card, which includes a photograph. The six-year cards typically cost $16, he said. Gonzales, Gallegos’ aide, later agreed that arrested individuals could obtain state photo IDs, potentially satisfying the proposed voter ID law, though she said doing so might involve hassles. The bigger point, she said by e-mail, is "that out of 100,000 people per year that get arrested for DWIs," the voter ID proposal is "bound to negatively impact one as a voter, disenfranchising them. And if one is affected, then it’s one too many." Our sense: Gallegos’ statement incorrectly assumes everyone arrested for DWI during 2010 not only received a temporary license when arrested but is currently driving with such a license. DPS did not pinpoint the number of current drivers with temporary permits. Also, affected individuals can get other state-issued photo IDs. We rate Gallegos’ statement Half True.

mpws-00018	The hottest news at the Capitol this week hasn’t been about transportation funding, education or any of the other big and complicated policies legislators are grappling with this session. It was Gov. Mark Dayton’s decision to boost pay for members of his cabinet, a move he says is long overdue. Republicans have seized on the issue, saying Dayton made a rash decision when some Minnesotans are still struggling financially (and it’s a message that will almost certainly show up in GOP campaign literature come 2016). Even Democrats in the Minnesota Senate, who are up for re-election in 2016 – and who may be trying to avoid that aforementioned campaign literature – voted 63-2 this week to suspend Dayton’s pay increases. The effort was led by DFL Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk of Cook. Now, Dayton says he no longer trusts Bakk because Bakk stabbed him in the back. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/02/poligraph-commissioner-pay-explained/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Pay raises, facts and flack	February 13, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota', 'Minnesota_Senate']
pomt-11262	"I am the only one onstage who has never voted to raise your taxes. These two, each, a billion dollars worth of votes to raise your taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/30/todd-rokita/did-luke-messer-and-mike-braun-raise-taxes-indiana/	In Indiana’s Republican primary, no candidate for U.S. Senate wants to be accused of hiking taxes. So when U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita called out his fellow challengers, U.S. Rep. Luke Messer and Mike Braun, for raising taxes in the April 23 debate, we budgeted some time for a fact-check. "I am the only one onstage who has never voted to raise your taxes," Rokita said. "These two, each, a billion dollars worth of votes to raise your taxes." Is that the case? The answer depends on what defines a tax increase. Through one lens Rokita may have a point. Through another, his comment can be seen as misleading. Whether these actions are turn-offs for conservative voters May 8 is for them to decide: The Braun and Messer tax hikes were approved by a Republican-controlled Legislature and a Republican governor. Has Todd Rokita ever raised taxes? Rokita, Indiana’s former secretary of state, has only been in a position to raise taxes since he was elected to Congress in 2010. Congress has been under partial or total Republican control since that time, preventing votes on direct tax increases. (More on that in a minute.) Unlike his competitors, he did not serve as a state legislator. Rokita joined the Indiana secretary of state’s office in 1997 as general counsel, later becoming deputy secretary of state. He won two terms as secretary of state before moving to Washington in 2010. As secretary of state, Rokita had no budget-adopting or tax-approving authority. "It is usually easier for someone who has served less time in legislative bodies to make the argument being made by Rokita," said Paul Helmke, a professor at Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Braun and Messer, on the other hand, are associated with a couple of tax hikes from their time in the state Legislature. Messer’s team argued that Rokita’s record of no tax votes is not so clear. Messer’s campaign pointed to the FAST Act, a transportation bill that tied customs user fees to inflation, increasing funding for highway spending by $5.2 billion over 10 years. But the transportation bill also won the vote of Messer, elected to Congress in 2012. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, said this qualifies as a tax, because the government is imposing new charges on private market transactions. The same reasoning would apply to a bipartisan 2012 tariff on imports that Rokita supported. Helmke, on the other hand, didn’t consider the fee a tax hike because it was not assessed on the general population, as most people are not direct customs users. And while tariffs can lead to increased costs, he didn’t consider a vote to give the Commerce Department authority to impose a tariff as a vote for a tax hike. Has Braun ever voted to raise taxes? To understand Rokita’s point against Braun, you have to hit the road. Rokita pointed us to road funding legislation supported by Braun and signed into law by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2017. It came with a 10 cent per gallon gas statewide tax increase. The measure’s Republican sponsors said the tax hike would raise an average of $915 million a year in each of the next seven years. That’s pretty close to the $1 billion figure Rokita lobbed. The nonpartisan Indiana Legislative Services agency estimated the tax increase would bring in roughly $5 billion over a seven-year period. The main sponsor of the measure, GOP Rep. Ed Soliday, insisted it was not a tax hike but an adjustment to restore the state's buying power lost to inflation. Others called it a user fee, which affects only users of a service. But Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, didn’t mince words. "Most people would say the gas tax is a tax and pretty hard for us to avoid," Hicks said. Rokita, however, previously supported the same tax hike when he was secretary of state. "There’s already been 19 or 20 states that have raised their gas tax, because the federal government won’t, and as a result are going to have a better infrastructure," Rokita told Indianapolis radio host Abdul Hakim-Shabazz in 2015. "And by the way, I don’t know of a politician that’s been unelected for that yet. So, I encourage all those in elective office — from the federal, to the state, to the local level — to look at these ideas." The call to action followed a month-long emergency closure of an interstate bridge that sank several inches in Rokita’s district in August 2015. Has Messer ever raised taxes? Experts had a tougher time calling Messer’s legislative actions tax hikes. The first half of Messer’s tax hikes come from a 2005 bill to finance a new Colts Stadium in Indianapolis, signed into law by Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels. The bill didn’t directly raise taxes, but authorized local governments to do so. That included taxes on food, beverages, hotels, motels and auto rentals. Much of the tax fell on tourists, Hicks said. And it was at the behest of the local governments. "It was an increase that the legislators from the affected counties all asked for," Hicks said. "It’s inaccurate to say this was a tax hike the state was responsible for. The local governments didn’t have to do it." In effect, Messer voted to allow certain counties to raise taxes by close to a billion dollars, according to the principal and interest payments on the bonds that financed the stadium. The other half of the attack on Messer comes from a 2005 budget that affected property taxes. The budget included language that reduced a state credit to local governments for property taxes. Without the credit, more taxes fell on property owners. It also altered the way property taxes were assessed, raising taxes for properties that had been previously undervalued by assessors. Statewide property taxes increased by an average of 24 percent, according to Larry DeBoer, agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, though some surprised homeowners received rebates that helped ease the burden. "But back then a taxpayer group threw tea bags into an Indianapolis canal in protest — perhaps we can claim the first modern tea party movement here in Indiana, for better or worse," he said. Hicks said it was irresponsible to consider this hike without considering the large property tax cuts that followed, in 2008. But Messer was out of the state House by then. Our ruling Rokita said, "I am the only one onstage who has never voted to raise your taxes. These two, each, a billion dollars worth of votes to raise your taxes." There is some truth in that Rokita has never voted to raise taxes in Indiana. As secretary of state, he did not have that power. In Congress, neither Rokita nor Messer have voted for direct tax increases. But Rokita voted for bills that raised user fees and import tariffs, which affected some taxpayers. (Messer, too, voted in favor of the user fees.) Braun indeed voted to increase taxes by almost $1 billion annually in a 2017 road funding law. Left unsaid by Rokita: He supported the gas tax from the sidelines, because it would lead to better infrastructure. Rokita also left out important context for Messer’s two 2005 votes that indirectly raised taxes by over $1 billion. One allowed local governments to increase taxes to fund the Indianapolis Colts football stadium. Another cut subsidies and changed the way property taxes were assessed.

pomt-07736	"Unfortunately we have documented instances where people defecated in the (Statehouse) building."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/01/tom-niehaus/state-sen-thomas-niehaus-accuses-protesters-defeca/	The lasting image thus far surrounding the controversy over Senate Bill 5, a proposal to restrict collective bargaining rights for organized labor, occurred on Feb. 22 when more than 5,000 union workers staged a raucous protest rally with colorful signs and bullhorns outside of the Ohio Statehouse. The protesters’ target was Republican Gov. John Kasich and the GOP-controlled Senate that is pushing the bill. Even Republican Senate President Tom Niehaus the next day grudgingly expressed admiration for the groups’ ability to coordinate so well and make themselves part of the lawmaking process. But right after comments praising the protesters, Niehaus veered in a totally different direction, painting a different lasting image of the protesters at the Statehouse — one not quite so becoming. "Unfortunately, we have documented instances where people defecated in the building. We have documented instances where they have written on the walls," Niehaus said. "This is the people’s house. I used to say treat it like it’s yours. Well, I don’t want it to be like it’s theirs if that’s the way they treat their own home." Some union groups responded immediately, denying that a group featuring police officers, firefighters, teachers, nurses and others unionized workers would commit such vile acts in the storied building. So, what gives? It is clear that Kasich and Statehouse Republicans are frustrated by being upstaged by protesters over SB 5 (Thousands more were expected to rally at the Statehouse on Tuesday, March 1). But PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether Niehaus’ accusation would hold up on the Truth-O-Meter. Did protesters really defecate in the Statehouse? We asked Niehaus’ staff about the "documented instances" and were told that several were reported to the senator and that he confirmed them with Statehouse management. That management is handled by the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board. We called the CSRAB, the curators of the Statehouse, for an accounting of any incidents in the building during the protest. "There was defecation in the stairwell to the parking garage," said CSRAB spokesman Gregg Dodd, but not inside the Statehouse. Furthermore, there is no proof it was left by protesters, and Dodd expressed his doubt. He noted that CSRAB has dealt with this issue before when there are no demonstrations taking place at the Statehouse. "Unfortunately it happens from time to time even when there are no events going on, and we think it is either a homeless person or persons, or someone waiting for the bus stop," Dodd said, explaining that this particular stairwell leads up to the street level where there are stops for the Columbus bus system. The top of the stairwell, at the street level, is enclosed by a small, heated shelter house. There are two of these shelters around the Statehouse. They are used by homeless people to congregate and sleep at night. The area is also along a stretch that is a main transfer area for the city’s transit system. Scores of people gather at various times of the day waiting for buses. "So, there is no way to determine if that was in fact someone associated with the rally," Dodd said regarding the human waste left behind in the stairwell. We’ll give Niehaus a small nod for being right about the writing on the walls. Dodd said there was some writing on the walls inside the Statehouse, but he also noted it was with chalk and was easily cleaned up by the Statehouse maintenance crew. There were also some union stickers stuck to Statehouse floors that needed to be scraped up. But Niehaus’ key accusation dealt with defecation.. In the context of his statement, he clearly was suggesting that protesters soiled the floor, and that it happened inside the Statehouse. As Senate president, Niehaus is one of the most influential people in the state government and when he speaks people listen. Yet this claim is beyond inaccurate. It’s a ridiculous assertion that is unsupported by the people who actually take care of the Statehouse. Statements that are both inaccurate and ridiculous get a special rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.

pomt-01008	Texas has "the lowest crime rate in this state since 1968" because of changes in law regarding nonviolent drug offenders.	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-changes-drug-laws-led-lowest-texas/	Changes in law, Rick Perry said, explain why Texas crime is at hippie-era lows. In his last appearance before state lawmakers as governor, the Republican presidential prospect saluted bipartisan efforts to treat alcoholism and drug addiction as diseases. "Over the years, I came to see our approach to nonviolent drug offenders as flawed," Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015 speech. "And because of the leadership of Democrats and Republicans, we started to take a new approach." Lawmakers created local drug courts, Perry said, also creating "diversion programs that treat alcoholism and drug addiction as a disease and not a moral failing." "And because of these changes in policy, we’ve been able to shut down three prisons," Perry said. "Repeat offenses by drug offenders are down and," he said to applause, "the lowest crime rate in this state since 1968." (His prepared text said "the crime rate is the lowest it has been since 1968.") Unlock your doors, Texas. But did Perry, governor from late 2000 into early 2015, get all of this right? Asked the basis of Perry’s statement, gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne emailed us a chart, drawing from FBI-collected data, listing Texas crime rates since 1960. And in 2013, the latest year of available data, Texas had its lowest overall crime index—3,666.5 property and violent crimes per 100,000 residents—since 1968 when the index was 3,478.3, according to the chart. Gauged violent crimes include murder, aggravated assault and rape. Tallied property crimes roll in burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Outside looks Criminologists responding to our inquiries agreed Perry’s claim was supported by the total Texas crime index. Also, according to the figures, the state’s 2013 property crime rate, 3,258.20, was the lowest since the 3,208.1 rate for 1968. The state’s violent crime rate, 408.3, (a sliver less than the 408.6 rates of 2011 and 2012) was the lowest since it was 407.7 in 1977. Still, the overall crime index can be overplayed, Carnegie Mellon University expert Alfred Blumstein said by email. We asked him about the meaning of the index after noticing an FBI web page stating the agency hadn’t calculated total crime indexes since about 2004 after advisers concluded the index and a modified index (folding in arson) weren’t "true indicators of the degrees of criminality because they were always driven upward by the offense with the highest number, typically larceny-theft. The sheer volume of those offenses overshadowed more serious but less frequently committed offenses, creating a bias against a jurisdiction with a high number of larceny-thefts but a low number of other serious crimes such as murder and forcible rape." Blumstein told us he prefers to focus on individual tabulated crimes, particularly murders and robberies if he’s analyzing violent crimes--"which I think people are much more concerned with." Then again, Tony Fabelo, the Austin-based research director for the Justice Center, which focuses on public safety issues for the national Council on State Governments, said he had no qualms about anyone stressing the index. Methodological doubts abide in academia, he said by phone. "However, when a politician talks about the crime rate, they are" understandably "using the crime index," Fabelo said. National decrease a long-term trend Fabelo suggested other reasons for perspective--starting with the fact that crime in Texas (and the nation) has been on the decline most of the past quarter century, according to the FBI statistics. In 19 of the 24 years from 1990 through 2013, the state’s crime index went down; it last increased in 2009, according to the governor’s chart. In the same years, the violent crime rate decreased in all but three years, most recently in 2002, the chart indicates. Nationally, the FBI says, the 2013 violent crime rate was down 21 percent compared to the rate in 2004 while the property crime rate was 22 percent lower. Texas had a slightly bigger difference; its 2013 violent crime rate was 25 percent less than its 2004 rate; the state’s 2013 property crime rate was 28 percent lower. Generally, Texas Christian University criminologist Michael Bachmann said there are "different schools of thought why crimes are decreasing nationally and the answer you'll get will vary dependent on which theoretical paradigm the criminologist subscribes to. The range goes from simple demographic changes (aging of the population)," he emailed, "and effects of abortion legislation to better policing, security and surveillance technology (esp. cell phones), proactive policing, or mandatory minimum sentencing laws for chronic offenders." And crimes not tallied by the FBI’s reporting system may merit more attention, Bachmann suggested. Financial fraud, white-collar crimes and crimes solely committed online, he said, are on the rise. Perry’s explanation for Texas rate The governor’s ‘68 reference aside, did the crime rate reduction occur due to the actions he described? Changes were put into law with his support. According to a January 2002 state report by Fabelo, drug diversion courts started in some Texas counties in the 1990s. After Perry became governor in late 2000, he agreed to legislation passed in 2001 requiring nine populous counties, including six counties that already had courts up and running, to establish the courts, the report said. And with Perry’s approval, the 2007 Legislature expanded the mandate to more counties, provided that federal or state funding was available, and authorized similar courts to consider driving-while-intoxicated cases. By email, David Reaboi of Right on Crime, a project of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, noted the closing of a state prison in Sugar Land in 2011 (due to legislated budget cuts, an August 2011 Texas Tribune news story said) and the shutdown in 2013 of two privately-run correctional facilities, which the Tribune attributed to a tighter budget and fewer inmates. Reaboi also noted a September 2012 report by the Council of State Governments finding that over the past few years, Texas sent fewer ex-convicts back to prison. From 2000 to 2007, the state’s recidivism rate—reflecting felons who returned to prison within three years after they were discharged or paroled—dropped 22 percent, according to the report, which hailed the decrease as proof that additional rehabilitation and treatment programs were working. Then again, a news story on the report in the Austin American-Statesman said some criminologists also noted the average age of offenders was rising; older people tend to commit fewer crimes. Derek Cohen of Right on Crime guided us to a 2013 state report showing that from 2008 to 2013, the number of adults incarcerated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice dipped, rebounded and then dipped more than before, ultimately hovering around 152,000: Reaboi commented: "Perry is on firm ground." Fabelo called drug courts among factors contributing to the index’s decline though, he reminded, those courts only handle a subset of suspected wrongdoers. "You can never tease out the impact of any specific policies," Fabelo said. Blumsteim, speaking generally on Perry’s point, said: "What he’s taking credit for is very much a national phenomenon and a national trend." He said it might be more meaningful to compare Texas to other states year by year. Our ruling Perry said Texas has its lowest crime rate since 1968 because of changes in law regarding nonviolent drug offenders. In 2013, an index combining Texas rates for property and violent crimes reached its lowest level since 1968. Legislated changes affecting drug offenders surely contributed. But in Texas and nationally, crime has been decreasing for a while, for multiple reasons. We rate this statement, an oversimplification, Half True.

pomt-03956	Says she heard more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/17/patience-roggensack/roggensack-says-her-appeals-court-caseload-topped-/	Patience Roggensack’s campaign for re-election to Wisconsin’s highest court emphasizes her years on the bench as she competes against two lawyers with no judicial experience in the Feb. 19, 2013, primary. The Supreme Court justice is airing a TV ad that puts some hard numbers on that selling point, reinforced by images of an NFL referee, a pilot and a surgeon on their nerve-racking early days on the job. Roggensack appears on camera and says her 17 years of wearing a black robe is critical to doing her job. As she speaks, words appear on the screen: "Supreme Court cases heard, over 550" Then: "Appellate cases heard: over 2,400." The first figure didn’t jump out at us -- after all, Roggensack is approaching 10 years on the high court. But her Wisconsin Court of Appeals stint in Madison-based District 4 lasted only seven years (1996-2003). Did Roggensack really hear about 340 cases a year on average in that time? When we asked Roggensack’s campaign for backup, its opening argument was unimpressive. We were told the number in the ad probably was off. Campaign consultant Brandon Scholz said he came up with the 2,400 figure himself without a full understanding of court statistics. After a couple days of consulting with experts, though, he presented us with a number -- 2,500 -- based on an extrapolation from one year of case termination statistics from the whole of District 4. The campaign could not provide a record of how many opinions Roggensack wrote, or orders she issued. Instead, it attributed to her a caseload figure that any of the five judges in District 4 would have had if cases were distributed equally among the judges. Not a promising start, but we don’t render a verdict until all the evidence is in. So we gave it our own review. To evaluate her formula, we went over caseload figures for her entire tenure at District 4 and got up to speed on the appeals process. Cases are randomly assigned and judges are given an equal number of cases to screen each month, we found, so it is reasonable to attribute a share of the district caseload to her in order to arrive at an educated guess. And the cases come in droves, we found. During Roggensack’s tenure, she and the other four judges in District 4 disposed of about 7,400 cases. (Her tenure doesn’t match up to calendar years so the number is not precise.) We concluded that Roggensack’s estimate is based on a reasonable formula that apportions her a share of the overall district caseload. But there’s another way to do this: use the court’s internal record-keeping system to come up with a more precise count of cases she handled, rather than a pure estimate. We asked for help from Judge Richard Brown, the chief judge of the Appeals Court. Brown ran a report on how many case opinions Roggensack wrote or supervised. The final result still involved a bit of extrapolation, but we think it’s a harder count than the estimate provided by Roggensack’s campaign. Brown’s count: 2,186 -- a figure that is in the ballpark with Roggensack’s general "over 2,400" claim. The reality is there’s no indisputable count available. Finally, it’s worth noting that Roggensack describes her workload as cases she "heard." That’s not a legal term, and it’s therefore a subjective matter to decide what it covers. But there are nuances here that require some clarification. Roggensack counts several types of cases to get to "over 2,400." She included cases in which the judges review legal briefs by the parties, decide the case, and then author or contribute to signed opinions. And she counted cases in which judges decide but turn over the writing to staff attorneys, typically when decisions are deemed obvious and noncontroversial. A large majority of the cases she takes credit for hearing are the type in which staff attorneys, not the judges, write the final legal ruling under judicial supervision. There’s another nuance. About half of cases not authored by the judges result in orders known as summary dispositions, not full-blown written opinions. For some perspective, we turned to Charles Dykman, a judge who served with Roggensack in District 4, which covers 24 counties in western and central Wisconsin. Dykman was presiding judge for much of Roggensack’s tenure there, which means he was actively involved in managing caseloads. Dykman, who retired in 2010 after 32 years on the appeals bench, told us the only number he kept track of was majority opinions he authored -- about 1,900 over 32 years. That’s a much narrower way to view it than Roggensack chose. Dykman said it was "foolishness" to equate complex cases heard by three-judge panels with minor summary disposition cases in which the appeal often lacked merit. Still, Dykman said Roggensack could reasonably claim having "heard" those types of cases. Finally, we note that the number Roggensack used did not include a relatively large category of decisions that appeals court judges make in motions that fall short of full-blown appeals. Some of those decisions are fairly complex and time-consuming, said Paul Lundsten, the current presiding judge in District 4. Those, however, are not separate cases. Our rating Roggensack’s TV ad says she "heard" more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge. That’s over a seven-year span. The figure turns out to be an estimate, not an actual count. A harder count put the number at 2,186, though it, too, includes some assumptions. The count includes minor and major cases, and a large number in which the judge’s decision is written up by staff attorneys. But they are all cases reviewed and decided by the judge -- in essence "heard" -- and Roggensack made no claim that her number involved only judge-authored opinions. So with the clarifications noted, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Patience Roggensack	None	None	None	2013-02-17T09:00:00	2013-02-06	['Wisconsin']

pomt-03245	Says Mitch McConnell pushed "the Wall Street bailout through the U.S. Senate" and called it "the Senate at its finest."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/matt-bevin/matt-bevin-mitch-mcconnell-bank-bailout-efforts/	A 46-year-old wealthy investment manager in Kentucky is mounting a Republican primary challenge to the state’s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Matt Bevin comes from the tea party wing of the GOP. Early polls suggest Bevin has a ways to go before he could unseat McConnell, but Kentucky voters sent libertarian favorite Sen. Rand Paul to Washington, and Bevin has the money to get his message to party activists. The two candidates have begun trading attack ads. The latest from Bevin ties McConnell to the financial rescue measures passed by Congress as the economy headed into a tailspin in 2008. Here’s the key text from Bevin’s ad: Announcer: After pushing the Wall Street bailout through the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell bragged (video clip of McConnell) "This has been the Senate at its finest." Announcer: And what are fact-checkers saying about Mudslinging Mitch’s latest attacks on conservative Matt Bevin? Misleading (image from Washington Post) Doesn’t add up (image from local Fox news) Like Obama campaign attacks (image from Washington Post) After 30 years in Washington, voting for one bailout after another, slinging mud is all Sen. McConnell has left. The ad plays to antigovernment sentiment among people who see Washington’s multibillion dollar intervention in 2008 as a gross overreach of public power and a favor to the financial elite. We will examine this specific claim the ad makes to link McConnell to specific actions. Did McConnell push the bailout, formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, through the Senate? To answer that, we have to go back to September and October 2008. As the housing market bubble burst, the web of investments that bound just about every financial player to each other threatened a global freeze on lending. On Sept. 29, 2008, three days before the Senate vote on TARP, two leading voices from the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, described the situation. In "The bailout package: Vital and acceptable", Edwin Meese, President Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, and Stuart Butler wrote: "Some key parts of the credit market are on the verge of gridlock, resulting not just in the collapse of major financial institutions but also in credit disruption that is severely weakening the long-term prospects of non-financial companies. And while this is currently most visible in Wall Street and in the financial sector, it is only a matter of time before the fallout hits Main Street, with potentially devastating economic effects for typical American households." President George W. Bush was pressing for passage of a $700 billion bailout. So were GOP presidential nominee John McCain and the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama. In late September, an effort to get a bill through the House of Representatives had just failed. The action shifted to the Senate where McConnell played a key role in negotiations. In a floor speech right before the Senate voted, McConnell took credit for the package and urged his fellow Republicans to approve the emergency intervention. "After extensive consultation between the majority leader and myself and the leaders in both parties here in the Senate, we believe we have crafted a way to go forward and to get us back on track," McConnell said. "This is the only way to get the right kind of solution for the American people." The Senate passed the TARP on a vote of 74 to 25, with 40 Democrats, one independent and 33 Republicans including McConnell voting in favor. Nine Democrats and 15 Republicans voted against it. On the night the bill passed, McConnell joined Republicans and Democrats in a quick press conference to mark the moment. "This has been the Senate at its finest," McConnell said. "In the years that I’ve been here, I can’t recall a single time, where in this close proximity to an election, both sides have risen above the temptation to engage in partisan game playing if you will, to address an issue of great magnitude." We should note that part of the compromise that produced TARP included a provision to release the money in two installments. When a vote came for the second infusion of cash, in January 2009, McConnell joined 32 Republicans and nine Democrats in a failed effort to oppose it. McConnell said he voted for the first installment on the condition that it be used to prevent a systemic economic collapse but didn't like that part of it was used to help the auto industry. "The current (Bush) administration used these funds for the auto industry, a move that I opposed. Now Congressional Democrats are urging more of the same," McConnell said in a statement. "The American people still don't have assurances that this money will not be wasted or misused to play favorites." According to a recent Treasury report, of the $420.61 billion dollars spent under TARP including the government’s stake in the insurer American International Group, $420.49 billion has been returned to the government. Our ruling Bevin said that McConnell pushed the Wall Street bailout through the Senate. The record shows that McConnell actively supported emergency government intervention in the financial markets and spoke openly of playing a key role in crafting compromise legislation. However, to say that he pushed the bill through the Senate downplays that other political leaders, including the Republican president and the party’s presidential nominee, also pressed to get the measure passed. The ad also ignores that in January 2009, there was a second bailout funding vote and on that one, McConnell voted no. Still, McConnell worked hard to get the initial bailout through the Senate. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Matt Bevin	None	None	None	2013-08-14T13:54:11	2013-08-06	['Mitch_McConnell']

pomt-14385	Under the Iran nuclear deal, "we give them $150 billion, we get nothing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/17/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-we-are-not-giving-iran-150-billion/	Donald Trump, fresh off winning four states in the March 15 primaries, rattled off a series of domestic and foreign policy "disasters" that he’ll fix, from businesses leaving the United States to terrorist threats to poorly negotiated deals. "One of the broadcasters was saying, ‘Is there anger?’ " Trump said. "I’m supposed to say, ‘No there’s not, we love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. We give them $150 billion, we get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful.’ " Okay, $150 billion in exchange for nada does sound like a pretty terrible deal — but is that actually what was agreed upon? According to all the experts we talked with, Trump’s claim is inaccurate. "The best I can say is that he got the name of the country right. Almost nothing else in there is right," said Michael Malloy, an expert on economic sanctions at the University of the Pacific. No hundred-billion giveaways Trump’s statement makes it sound like we’re cutting Iran a $150 billion check. In reality, the money is already Iran’s to begin with, just frozen under the many economic sanctions levied against the country. Restrictions on Iranian assets — such as the $1.9 billion the National Iranian Oil Company was restricted from collecting from Shell for delivering crude supplies — began to thaw this year. Per the Iran deal, nuclear inspectors verified in January that Tehran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program, prompting the United States and other countries to lift the sanctions. Just how much money was being held up? Experts say $150 billion is the high end of estimates or, as Malloy put it, "what it could possibly be in the broadest imagination." Most peg the the total value of Iranian assets at around $100 billion, but Iran probably still won’t be able to access all of it. The deal only releases assets frozen because of Iran’s nuclear program. Assets blocked because of other sanctions (on terrorism, human rights, and missile technology) won’t change as a result of the agreement. Also, Iran won’t suddenly have all the assets at its disposal because some of it is tied up in debts. For example, about $20 billion is obligated to China, which worked around the sanctions to finance infrastructure projects in Iran. The actual amount available to Iran is about $60 billion, estimates Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew pinned it at $56 billion, while Iranian officials say $35 billion, according to Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In return, no bomb While the United States doesn’t get a cash bonus for lifting sanctions, Trump’s claim that we got "nothing" in return misses the point of the deal: blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb. "We got major restrictions and intrusive transparency on Iran's nuclear program. Beyond being not ‘nothing,’ this is the entire reason why we put the sanctions on in the first place," Nephew said. "Reasonable people may disagree whether we got enough for the sanctions relief, but it wasn't nothing." "There’s a long list (of things we got), such that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the deal, Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon," said George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Under the deal, Iran agreed to lose 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium and give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium. It also agreed to curb production of plutonium (the other element that can be used to build a bomb) and dismantle its one plutonium reactor. To make sure Iran holds up its end of the bargain, the deal also permitted international inspectors to "implement continuous monitoring." (What that means and whether it’s enough are up for debate.) In other words, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Jim Walsh, we got Iran to nip its nuclear ambitions in the bud before the cash was released. Experts also pointed out that there’s also a host of diplomatic advantages gained from the deal, such as the goodwill of the five other countries involved in the deal and potentially more cooperation from Iran in the Middle East. For example, the deal has "reduced the chances of a war between Iran and Israel," and Iran "could eventually de-escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia and contribute to a political settlement of the crisis in Syria," said Iradian. "In the big game, that counts for something," said Malloy. Our ruling Trump said under the Iran nuclear deal, "we give them $150 billion, we get nothing." Trump is referring to the amount of previously frozen Iranian assets the deal releases. To be clear, this is money that already belongs to Iran so we’re not "giving" them anything. The $150 billion is a high estimate, and most experts say the real figure is closer to $100 billion, while Iran is probably only able to access a fraction of that. In exchange for lifting the sanctions, the United States and its allies get to block Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in the near future. One can argue whether we got enough, but we didn’t get "nothing." We rate Trump’s claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-17T15:06:45	2016-03-15	['Iran']

pomt-12060	"We're still doing dumb things like telling the parent of an 11-year-old that it's against the law for them to tell their parents what they were tested on ... That will end when I'm governor."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/sep/07/adam-putnam/putnam-wrongly-says-its-against-law-students-talk-/	Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam is railing against big government in his campaign for governor, repeating one story from his young son to demonstrate ridiculous overreach. The story goes like this: Putnam’s son had to write an essay as part of a statewide exam about whether or not to keep the penny after reading an article about it. Putnam doesn’t think anything of it and brings up the story to a principal of another school in a different town. The principal gives him a horrified look, because Putnam’s son is not supposed to share the details of the state test. According to Putnam, the principal said, " 'He could get in big trouble’ and here’s the kicker quote ‘that’s against the law.’ " From a breakfast in Kissimmee to a party meeting in Orlando, Putnam has repeated a version of this story to drum up support with voters fed up with government getting between parents and kids. "We're still doing dumb things like telling the parent of an 11-year-old that it's against the law for them to tell their parents what they were tested on something that will determine whether they're promoted or not," Putnam said during a speech at the Republican Party of Florida quarterly meeting Aug. 12. "That will end when I'm governor. That's crazy talk." This staple of his stump speeches made us wonder. Can students really not disclose the contents of the standardized tests to their parents? Is it really against the law? Putnam’s story speaks to a larger issue of children being afraid to talk to their parents about tests because of ambiguous testing rules. However, doing so is not against the law, and the state has made efforts to clarify those conversations. What can students talk about? In 2014, the Florida Department of Education phased out the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test and replaced it with the Florida Standards Assessment. The testing system measures students’ achievement in math, language arts, science, biology, U.S. history and civics depending in certain grade levels. These tests have a lot of rules and procedures laid out in the FSA testing manual for administrators, which is the basis for Putnam’s claim. The statements in play come from a section labeled "Discussing Test Content after Testing," which is read aloud to students before the exams. The first part tells students they cannot share test specifics, with an emphasis on modern communication methods. "Because the content in all statewide assessments is secure, you may not discuss or reveal details about the test items or passages after the test. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as texting, emailing, or posting online, for example, on websites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram." However, the section goes on to address student-parent conversations — something Putnam’s story omits. It says: "While students may not share information about secure test content after testing, this policy is not intended to prevent students from discussing their testing experiences with their parents/families." A list of frequently asked questions for parents on the FSA website also addresses the security of testing content, using similar language. One answer explains that students are asked to sign an acknowledgement that says they cannot reveal details about the test "to anyone." That, again, is followed by more guidance in bold emphasis that says the policy "is not intended to prevent students from discussing their testing experiences with parents and families." Here’s how it looks on the website: Putnam's campaign (and undoubtedly some test administrators and students) interpret these instructions to mean that students cannot share test content specifics with anyone, including their parents, but can generally discuss how the exam "experience" went. We wanted to know how the state defined "testing experiences." It doesn’t. "The department does not monitor or interfere with personal family interactions, and parents have the discretion to determine the depth and breadth of their family’s discussions," said DOE spokeswoman Meghan Collins. The portion about parent involvement was added fairly recently following concern from parents that students could not talk about their tests after signing the acknowledgement. In fall 2015, the department added this language to testing manuals and to parent/guardian letter templates it provides to districts. For the record, the relevant Florida statutes about punishable testing offenses (1008.24) do not say anything about students talking to their parents about the exams. In practice, school officials are most concerned with students sharing testing details with other students. Local officials we interviewed did not have any examples of students punished for discussing tests with their parents, and they said they do not discourage those conversations. "We have not experienced any issue with students speaking with their parents about the FSA, nor have (we) received complaints about the policy," said Pinellas County School District spokeswoman Lisa Wolf. In Hillsborough County, school spokesman Grayson Kamm said the administrative guidance "is not statute" and clearly addresses student-to-student discussion. "Students are expected not to share the exact items and answers with other students as to guard against sharing content, which could invalidate results," Kamm said. Jane Windsor, an education law attorney at Sarasota-based Windsor Law LLC, said she was not aware of any law or statute prohibiting students from talking to their parents about testing material. "Any parent is going to want to know how a big test went. That’s a normal conversation and even if the child is talking about specific questions, that’s not a danger," Windsor said. "What is a danger is sharing contents of a test with another student. That’s definitely an ethical issue." Some parents remain concerned, even after the state’s attempts to protect parent discussions. Melissa Bywalski is the parent of a fifth-grader at Kathleen Elementary School in Lakeland and a member of the Opt Out Florida Network, a group against state-mandated standardized testing. She said her son Zack refused to talk to her about a state test he took in third grade. "He was worried he was going to get in the trouble for telling me where he took the test, how long it took and even how he felt he did on the test," she said. Bywalski said she worries that the test rules create an atmosphere in the classroom where students feel like they can’t open up about problems at school. "What if he feels he can’t talk to me about a bully, or something?" she asked. Our ruling Putnam said, "We're still doing dumb things like telling the parent of an 11-year-old that it's against the law for them to tell their parents what they were tested on something that will determine whether they're promoted or not." He said he would change this if elected governor. There are rules that prohibit students from disclosing test information with other students, particularly through texts and social media. One FAQ response goes further to say students cannot share the information with "anyone." However, the state has updated its rules to explicitly say that conversations about "testing experiences" between parents and children are not a violation of the rules — and they are not against the law. Putnam does voters a disservice by repeating the notion that these conversations are discouraged and could spell legal jeopardy. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

An actuarial study commissioned by my predecessor, a Democrat, and completed last year found that if Obamacare is implemented in Wisconsin: -- 100,000 people will be dropped by their employer-sponsored health insurance. -- 59 percent of people who buy their own health insurance will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent. --150,000 people will stop buying health insurance in the private sector and will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers. -- Between 2014 and 2019, Obamacare could cost Wisconsin taxpayers $1.12 billion; after all federal aid and tax credits are applied, the state’s portion of the bill will be $433 million. -- Approximately 122,000 parents, caretakers and pregnant women with an income of more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for Medicaid. Walker concludes that he prefers more private-sector competition to try to hold costs down and insure more people. Those are some startling claims, all couched in the certitude of "a study" -- and one ordered by a Democrat. Is Walker right? We’ll look at the four parts of his claim that Walker says come straight from a study authored in part by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, a leading health-care expert. We’ll save the $1.12 billion taxpayer-cost claim for another day, but note Walker attributes it to the study when it’s actually his administration’s own estimate, and that estimate has been challenged. And because Walker so closely links his "devastate Wisconsin" characterization to the results of the study, we’ll look at whether the study found that Obama’s reforms would "lay waste" to or render Wisconsin "desolate" -- our dictionary’s definition of "devastate." Let’s start at the end, and then take each claim in turn. The Gruber study’s succinct conclusion starts with this fact: About 340,000 uninsured people in Wisconsin would become insured because of the law. Walker’s op-ed notes that 91 percent of Wisconsin residents have health insurance, but does not mention that the number would rise when the reforms kick in. The study does conclude that higher premiums would be a reality for some people who buy insurance on their own. Others in that group, it says, will see their premiums go down. But the study is written in bland actuarial terminology, and offers no opinion, pro or con, on the changes that Wisconsin could face under Obama’s reforms. Its primary author, Gruber, strongly objects to the way Walker characterizes the study, contending the governor distorted its findings on the impact of the health care reforms under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Let’s take a look at what Walker pulled out of the 56-page study, authored by Gruber -- who has worked has worked with both Mitt Romney and Democrats on health-care reform -- Gorman Actuarial, and Jennifer Smagula. Part 1 Walker quotes the figure correctly: "100,000 people will be dropped by their employer-sponsored health insurance." But he leaves out that an estimated 90,000 others will gain coverage through employers, for a net drop of 10,000 people with employer coverage. Gruber said Walker failed to note that "many more people in the recession alone have lost their employer coverage" than would happen under the Affordable Care Act. Gruber notes the 100,000 people is just 3 percent of those with employer coverage. Walker was trying to point out the negative impact of people having to switch doctors when they are dropped from their employers’ plan, said Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services. Part 2 Walker takes this claim almost word for word from the study: "59 percent of people who buy their own health insurance will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent." Walker correctly cites the impact on 59 percent of the relatively small group -- 160,000 people -- who lack access to employer insurance but are able to buy policies directly from insurance companies or through brokers. The study notes that the health reform law creates both "winners and losers" among this group. In the op-ed piece, Walker cites only the "losing" side of the equation. The study prominently noted that the other 41 percent in this group would pay smaller premiums -- 56 percent smaller on average. That’s after taking into account the law’s subsidies for people in low-to-middle-income households who don't get health benefits from an employer. And Walker did not note that some people would pay higher premiums by choice, because the subsidies will enable them to buy better coverage. Smiley said she didn’t know why Walker singled out the losing side. She said that some people would be forced to buy richer benefits than they want. Experts say that will happen, but how many is not known. Under the health care law, younger, healthy people will pay more, and older, less healthy people will pay less, Gruber and other experts say. The younger group in effect will subsidize the older group, including those with pre-existing conditions who will be able to get the same coverage as everyone else under Obama’s changes. Typically people who buy insurance on their own are unemployed, self-employed or work for small companies. These plans in the current "individual market" tend to be costlier and less comprehensive than in employer-provided plans, and enrollees pay the whole tab, a Kaiser Health News story said. Part 3 Walker’s asserts that "150,000 people will stop buying health insurance in the private sector, and will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers." But there are multiple problems with Walker’s wording. The Gruber study does not say that 150,000 people will stop buying health insurance "in the private sector." It says the opposite -- they would buy insurance from private companies through the government-run "exchanges," online marketplaces where people and small businesses will be able to shop for insurance from private companies. Walker further asserts that those people "will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers." By "dependent," Walker refers to the taxpayer subsidies, tied to income, that the law provides to people, Smiley said. But an estimated 60,000 of the 150,000 would not be eligible for subsidies, the study says How those people would be dependent on the government -- much less taxpayers -- isn’t clear. Smiley said she didn’t know, either. Part 4 Walker says Gruber’s study found that "approximately 122,000 parents, caretakers and pregnant women with an income of more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for Medicaid." Medicaid is state-federal health insurance for low-income families as well as the disabled and elderly who are impoverished. That number is not in the study at all, even though Walker’s opinion piece indicated it was. Smiley acknowledged it’s a Walker administration estimate. The wording of Walker’s piece suggests that pregnant women and others will lose their health insurance. What Walker didn't mention is they instead will buy subsidized health insurance from private companies through the exchange. Given Walker’s preface that his claims prove "devastation" of Wisconsin, we think some readers probably imagined he was suggesting that 122,000 people would be thrown off Medicaid and left without coverage. "I don’t think it was intended to suggest that," Smiley said. "It was just that they can’t get the plan they currently have." Walker here was referring to a group of people above 133 percent of the poverty line who currently get Medicaid coverage through BadgerCare Plus. Overall, Gruber said Walker’s op-ed was particularly misleading because it focused on a small number of people (about 100,000) who will see premium increases, while ignoring that 340,000 more people would get insurance. Our rating In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, Walker said "Obamacare" will push people off employer-sponsored insurance, drive up premiums, increase dependency and make 122,000 people, including pregnant women, ineligible for Medicaid. The context of his comments is his assertion that this will "devastate Wisconsin." Walker pulls some numbers from an actuarial study of the impact of the law, but cherry-picks data, leaves out critical facts and mischaracterizes some of the numbers, creating a highly misleading impression. Indeed, some of the numbers he attributes to the study are really estimates from his own administration. We rate his claim, taken as a whole, False.

pomt-00596	"Most polls show foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S. now than they did before Obama’s time."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/04/gretchen-carlson/gretchen-carlson-most-polls-show-world-has-lower-r/	Fox News host Gretchen Carlson called out President Barack Obama for trying to spin the accomplishments of his presidency in a recent White House speech. Carlson claimed Obama is overstating the positive influence he’s had on world affairs. Here’s what Obama said: "People don’t remember — when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia. And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth." PolitiFact rated Obama’s claim Half True. Carlson, in her own on-air fact-check, sounded like she thought the rating should have been worse. "The president said he believes he’s helped improve the United States’ standing in the world," she said on The Real Story on June 2, 2015. "But right now it appears that statement isn't totally accurate since most polls show foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S. now than they did before Obama's time." That’s a different claim than Obama’s. Obama said the United States is the most respected country, while Carlson said the nation’s standing has actually dropped since Obama took office. Is Carlson closer to the truth than Obama? Not really. While you wouldn’t say the United States is beloved everywhere on the world’s stage today, it generally is in a better position than when President George W. Bush left office. We’ll walk you through three different polls. Spokespersons for Fox News did not respond to requests for comment. BBC polling In April 2008, the BBC World Service/Globescan released its annual Country Ratings Poll asking respondents about various countries’ "influence on the world." Almost 25,000 people rated 16 countries and the European Union on whether their world influence was "mostly positive" or "mostly negative." In 2008, an average of 35 percent of people said the United States’ world influence was "mainly positive" and 47 percent said it was "mostly negative." This was a slight improvement over previous years of serious souring on the United States. How have things changed since Obama’s tenure? The United States’ influence was seen more favorably in the early years of Obama’s presidency, coinciding with an improved national economy. But the U.S. reputation retracted in more recent years. The BBC attributes the backlash to U.S. government surveillance programs, particularly in Spain, Germany and Brazil. Still, in the most recent BBC survey, which covered December 2013 to April 2014, 42 percent of people said the United States’ influence was "mostly positive" — an improvement of seven points from 2008. And 39 percent said the U.S. influence was "mostly negative" — eight percentage points less than in 2008. Whatever you make of the recent dip, the BBC ratings are still better for the United States than they were in 2008. Pew Research Center Pew Research Center measures the favorability of the United States in its Global Attitudes Survey. A thousand respondents in each country are asked in face-to-face and phone interviews to say whether they have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of the United States. Richard Wike, Pew’s director of global attitudes research, emailed the following chart showing favorable ratings of 19 countries surveyed in 2008 and 2014. New findings from 2015 surveys will be released this summer. In 13 of 19 countries, the view of the United States improved from 2008 to 2014. The improvement was biggest in France, Germany, Indonesia and Spain. In four countries — Russia, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon — the United States’ favorable ratings fell. The largest drop was in Russia, a 23-point difference. In Poland and Pakistan, there was no significant change. So Pew also does not back up Carlson’s point. Gallup The most recent data we could find is from a periodic survey by Gallup about the five major world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Germany and the European Union. The headline does little to help Carlson’s claim: "Russia Receives Lowest Approval in World; U.S. Highest." The most recent poll, released April 21, 2015, is based on face-to-face and phone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries. It shows the median approval rating of the United States is 45 percent, more than any other world power and greater than the 34 percent approval rating of the country’s leadership in 2008. U.S. leadership approval peaked in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, at 49 percent. It dropped to 41 percent in 2012 but picked up the next year. "America’s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America," Pew wrote in 2014. "After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014." Our ruling Carlson said, "Most polls show foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S. now than they did before Obama’s time." We’re not sure how she got to most. The consensus among three polls shows the United States generally in higher regard today than Bush’s last year in office. The outliers would be the views of people in a few countries, including Russia, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. It’s misleading to say "foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S." and it’s inaccurate to say "most polls" show that. We rate it False.

pomt-10179	"If an Iranian woman shows too much hair in public, she risks being beaten or killed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/25/sarah-palin/iran-aint-miami-beach-but-beatings-and-killings-fo/	In arguing for a hard line against Iran, Gov. Sarah Palin invoked not just that country's uranium-enrichment efforts and attitude toward Israel, but also its treatment of women. "It is said that the measure of a country is the treatment of its most vulnerable citizens," Palin wrote in a Sept. 22, 2008, opinion piece in the New York Sun . "By that standard, the Iranian government is both oppressive and barbaric. Under (President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad's rule, Iranian women are some of the most vulnerable citizens. If an Iranian woman shows too much hair in public, she risks being beaten or killed." We've looked elsewhere at how candidates from both parties have strayed from the truth in their tough rhetoric about Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons. Now let's check Palin's grasp of the consequences of improper head-covering. Restrictions in Iran go back centuries, but the strength of enforcement has varied. Modesty has been a component of Islam since the Prophet Mohammed revealed purported advice on the subject from God in the seventh century. It has been interpreted differently among and within Muslim cultures around the world, including Iran. In 1936, Iran's largely secular ruler Reza Shah Pahlavi, intent on modernizing the country, banned the practice of wearing the veil, known in the Muslim world as hejab. That law was rescinded after Pahlavi was forced to relinquish power in 1941, but the policy of discouraging and disparaging hejab remained, said Ziba Mir-Hosseini, an Iranian anthropologist and a visiting professor at the New York University School of Law. In the 1960s, many women did not go to college because they would be forced to remove their hejab, Mir-Hosseini said. "They were caught between tradition and resistance on the one hand and education and modernity on the other," she said. "Many women took up hejab in the early 1970s as a sign of protest." An Islamic revolution overthrew Pahlavi's son in 1979 and instituted a 180-degree turn with respect to hejab, mandating it in 1983. The punishment for breaking that law was imprisonment or 70 lashes of flogging. The penalty was changed in 1988 to a fine and imprisonment of one to two months. "It has been really rare that it has been applied," Mir-Hosseini said. "It goes so much against people's sense of justice and public order in Iran. But at the same time the radicals, the hard-liners, the hejab is so central to them. It is not only religious, it is anti-Western." Hejab remains mandatory today. The custom has evolved under the influence of modern fashion, though. Some Iranian women still wear the chador , a full-length garment, often black, that fully covers their hair and drapes over their entire body. But many might wear colorful, tight-fitting overcoats, long boots, and a light scarf that covers only a token amount of their hair. The government has periodically cracked down on dress it does not consider conservative enough, typically for a month or so as the weather warms in the summer. In recent years, though, the crackdown has persisted, as hard-liners such as Ahmadinejad have gained influence. Generally, women who are stopped are told to cover up, or asked to sign an agreement to cover up more in the future, or perhaps fined or even arrested. There have been regular reports of confrontations between the police and women who resent being hassled for alleged immodesty. And yes, there have been accounts of brutality by police against some women after such stops. In defending Palin's statement, the McCain campaign pointed us to three such accounts, one from the Asia Times , one from the U.S.-funded Radio Farda, and a third from the Economist of Aug. 25, 2007. The latter said: "Much of the police action has been accompanied by complaints of brutality, and in many cases by documentary evidence such as graphic footage of beatings, posted on dissident Web sites." There's an important caveat to make here, though. The beatings are not administered by the government as punishment for an improper hejab — that was outlawed in 1988. Rather they are imposed in the course of an arrest and are generally due to resistance, according to the vast majority of news accounts we read and our interviews with experts on Iran. (Similarly, plenty of protesters in the United States are arrested, but it would be innaccurate to say they're arrested for protesting — in fact they're arrested for other offenses, such as ignoring police requirements about where to protest, or disrupting traffic.) "For some of the younger people, this (defying modesty rules) is a way of protesting. They get away with it as long as they can. But usually the punishment for that is just paying fines," said Faegheh Shirazi, an Iranian women's rights advocate, professor of Middle-Eastern Studies at the University of Texas and author of the forthcoming book, Velvet Jihad: Muslim Women's Quiet Resistance to Islamic Fundamentalism. "When the police come, you have to abide by what they say. I'm sure if the woman resists and starts backfiring, there would be some struggle." To the extent that there are beatings, they are extrajudicial, said Elizabeth Rubin, an expert on Middle Eastern culture at the Council on Foreign Relations. "If you are showing too much hair you may be asked to fix your scarf," she said. "You would not generally be beaten or killed except by a crazy zealot outside the law." To be sure, Iran has been widely criticized by human-rights organizations for harsh restrictions on dissent and personal behavior. Adultery is punishable by death. Abortion is illegal, and punishable by blood money. Gay people have been subject to arbitrary arrests and harassment . And the government regularly tries to quash dissent, holding political activists without charge and denying them access to counsel. But in this instance Palin overstated the case. The McCain campaign did not provide any account — nor could we find any — of an Iranian woman being killed for improper hejab. If there are any such instances they are extremely isolated. So it was misleading for Palin to suggest beatings are punishment for immodesty in Iran. More to the point, the restrictions related to modesty are routinely flouted without consequence. And her claim that killing was a possible consequence of immodesty pushed her statement into the realm of outright falsehood.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-25T00:00:00	2008-09-22	['Iran']

pomt-09369	"Actually, Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/30/charlie-crist/crist-says-reagan-was-democrat-converting-gop/	Battling suggestions that he's waffling on Republican principles, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist reminded listeners in a televised debate Sunday that Ronald Reagan was once a Democrat. The line turned up in a three-way chatter between FOX News Sunday moderator Chris Wallace and the two Republican U.S. Senate candidates, in which Wallace asked the governor whether he would support rival Marco Rubio or run as an independent -- if he lost the GOP primary. For the record, Crist said he’d support the GOP nominee and that he wouldn’t run as an unaffiliated candidate. Here is an excerpt: WALLACE: Well, I'm going to get -- I'm going to -- I'll give you an opportunity for a final statement. I just want to say, though, you are saying you are going to run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. You will not run on the no party affiliation line. CRIST: That's right. That's right. That's what I'm saying. RUBIO: Chris, if I may, the governor likes to call himself a Reagan Republican. I don't ever recall Reagan being questioned about running as an independent. But Ronald Reagan asked a very important question-- CRIST: Actually, Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican. We wanted to find out whether the late Republican icon Ronald Reagan was actually a registered Democrat, or whether he was an ideological one. We turned to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library, in Simi Valley, Calif. The library's Web site notes Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, after stumping for Richard Nixon as a Democrat. It tells the story of Reagan making a speech at a Democrats for Nixon event and being interrupted and asked if he had registered as a Republican. He responded no. That's when "down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared I'm a registrar and placed a registration card in front of him. In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party,'' according to Web site. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at the Reagan library, explained more in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida. "Yes, this is true. He switched to Republican in 1962,'' Giller wrote, noting a quote in which Reagan complained, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.'' Giller said Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as that of Nixon in 1960 "while remaining a Democrat." At the White House Web site, the biography of Reagan makes a brief reference to the ideological evolution in the fourth paragraph: "As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over the issue of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from liberal to conservative." And then Reagan, noted for his quips, said it himself in a Sept. 28, 1982, news conference exchange with ABC White House correspondent Sam Donaldson over whether the White House was to blame for the continuing U.S. recession. Donaldson: "Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes in the past and you have blamed the Congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?" Reagan: "Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat." White House press corps: (Laughter.) Historian Edward Yager, a government professor at Western Kentucky University and author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, said Reagan "was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for FDR in 1932, when he was 21." Yager said he’s never seen copies of the voter registration cards, but noted "virtually all the sources that refer to" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat and that "he has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for FDR four times, then for Truman." Reagan was a Democrat, added Yager, even when he voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower. Reagan had considered switching by 1960, said Yager, but there were some in the Nixon camp who "thought he might be more effective (as a supporter) by maintaining his Democrat registration and affiliation and cutting into Democratic voters." It may be among the great, forgotten flip-flops in political history that evolved into a laugh line for a man venerated for his ideological adherence to the principles of the Grand Ole Party. But Crist was correct when he invoked it. We find his claim to be True.

pomt-07968	The health care law includes tort reform.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/21/anthony-weiner/tort-reform-health-care-law-no/	We've never played a drinking game while watching C-SPAN, but Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., suggested that people try it while listening to the debate Wednesday on a measure to repeal last year's health care law. A defender of the law, Weiner took aim at Republicans that he said would be making false claims. "There are basically three formations of the argument by the Republicans: First, they start by making stuff up. You kind of have to wonder if any of them actually read the bill: 137 new agencies — not true; new IRS agents— not true; death panels — not true; Members aren't covered — not true; no tort reform in it — not true. "You know, I want to just advise people watching at home playing that now popular drinking game of you take a shot whenever the Republicans say something that's not true, please assign a designated driver. This is going to be a long afternoon." Weiner was on fairly solid ground with most of his claims. We've debunked death panels (Pants on Fire); 15,000 new agents for the Internal Revenue Service (Barely True); 53 new government bureaucracies (Barely True); and members of Congress aren't covered by the health care bill (False). But we stopped short at Weiner's claim that the health care law included tort reform. Did it? Before we get into details of the health care law, we should explain the basics of tort reform in plain language. What tort reform usually means is changing the rules that apply when patients sue their doctors for medical errors or malpractice. The thinking goes that if doctors weren't so afraid of being sued, they would order fewer tests -- they wouldn't practice "defensive" medicine -- and that would drive down health care costs. On the other hand, patients who believe they have been harmed by doctors want to keep their right to sue, or at least get some sort of payment. Policy wonks have been trying to come up with new ideas to balance those concerns, such as protections for doctors who can show their actions followed evidence-based medical guidelines. Still, when talking about federal tort reform, the usual ideas are: • Caps on the amount of money juries can award injured patients. • To let jurors consider patients' other sources of income when making awards. • To create "fair share" rules that let jurors assign damages based on how much the doctor or hospital contributed to the injury. There's nothing like that in the health care law, which passed Congress in March. Still, we got in touch with Weiner's office, and they pointed us to pages 686 and 891 of the final bill. These are the parts of the bill that authorize $50 million in funding for state projects that develop, implement and evaluate "alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care organizations." Given the size of the health care system, that's a tiny amount of money. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office evaluated whether the state pilot projects would reduce the government's health spending and declined to assign any cost savings to the program. On the other hand, the CBO found that traditional ideas on tort reform could reduce government health spending by $54 billion over 10 years. Finally, we turned to the advocacy groups that monitor tort reform efforts. Darren McKinney, director of communications for the American Tort Reform Association, said he agreed with Weiner about death panels, but the idea that the law includes tort reform is "demonstrably untrue, and it's not even close." He also pointed out a clause in the law that specifically says the state programs cannot limit people's right to sue, and that the pilot programs must allow patients to opt out of the alternatives "at any time" to pursue litigation. We confirmed those clauses in the final bill, on page 892. Then there's a letter from the American Association for Justice, formerly known as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Soon after the health care bill became law, the group's president wrote this to the group's membership: "I am very pleased to report that the health care bill is clear of any provisions that would limit an injured patient's rights concerning medical negligence claims. While there is a provision for demonstration projects, it provides an absolute opt-out clause for plaintiffs at any time. While some states may embark on demonstration programs we find objectionable, the opt-out provision for plaintiffs minimizes this concern. In short, this is a tremendous victory for all Americans." The letter then went on to outline the more traditional forms of tort reform that the association successfully fought to keep out of the bill. Weiner is on firm ground when he said that there have been several notable falsehoods about the health care law. But in claiming that the law includes tort reform, he is significantly mischaracterizing the law. Although it has a tiny amount of money for state pilot projects that look at alternatives to litigation, they are so small that they were ignored by the leading group that opposes tort reform -- the trial lawyers. The group's president said the projects weren't anything to be concerned about. That puts the projects at such a great distance from any sort of traditional notion of tort reform that they're just not even in the same ballpark. We rate Weiner's statement False.

pomt-09266	"The governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/30/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-charlie-crist-offshore-oil/	Many Republicans believe that Charlie Crist's decision to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent, no-party candidate, helps the Democrats chances in November. But it also means Democrats may have to outmaneuver Crist for some traditional Democratic voters. Leading Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek started to lay that groundwork within hours of Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Meek said Crist's position against offshore oil drilling has vacillated over the years, while Meek's position has never changed. "I've been consistent as relates to being against offshore drilling in Florida," Meek said. "I can't say that (for) every candidate in the race. It was (a) news flash as of two days ago that the governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling." Oil drilling is certainly a timely topic. On March 30, President Barack Obama proposed to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling. Three weeks later, on April 20, an explosion and fire on a drilling rig resulted in a massive oil spill that threatened several Gulf Coast states. The spill has forced many to rethink the benefits of offshore drilling -- including Crist. The key to Meek's claim is how often, and how much, Crist has changed his position. As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. Crist even evoked childhood memories of cleaning birds after an oil spill in Tampa Bay, the St. Petersburg Times' Steve Bousquet reported. Crist expressed opposition to drilling throughout his career, from state senator to education commissioner to U.S. Senate candidate to attorney general. A sampling: June 20, 1998, in a Florida Times-Union interview during his first U.S. Senate campaign: "Having grown up here, it's hard not to feel strongly about the beauty that is Florida. I would and already have fought offshore drilling in Florida, and would continue that fight in Florida." Oct. 10, 2006, interview with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board: "Offshore oil drilling, I'm adamantly opposed to it. I think a lot of that has to do with growing up here. I'm a Gulf Coast guy. ... I remember when I was in elementary school, we had an oil spill in Tampa Bay. You may recall that. I literally remember cleaning birds off when that happened." Oct. 20, 2006, at a press conference, on the qualities Floridians want in a president: "Making sure that we don't drill for oil off our beautiful shore, and, of course, the other traditional things that go along with it." But in 2008, with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon and Crist being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate for a ticket that would popularize the phrase "drill, baby, drill!", Crist backed off his previous unflinching opposition. On June 18, 2008, Crist said: "We have to be sympathetic to the pocketbooks of Floridians and what they're paying at the pump for gas and balance that with any way that our state might be able to contribute in terms of resources to have a greater supply and therefore lower prices," Crist said. "I think an open-minded person understands that we ought to at least study (offshore drilling)." The next week Crist delivered a keynote address at a global climate change summit in Miami. "We must have an open discussion – without compromising Florida’s sensitive ecosystems and natural beauty," Crist said of offshore drilling. "As I stated last week, only when we are able to do so far enough from Florida’s coast, safe enough for our people and clean enough for our beaches, should we consider increasing our oil supply by drilling off Florida’s shores. Let me repeat that – far enough, safe enough and clean enough." Crist said options now needed to be studied, but largely stayed away from offering specific proposals. That so-called study period ended with the April 20, 2010 spill. After flying over the gulf and seeing the spill firsthand, Crist withdrew his support for any form of drilling off Florida's coasts. "It could be devastating to Florida if something like that were to occur," Crist said. "It's the last thing in the world I would want to see happen in our beautiful state. Crist also repeated the criteria laid out in his 2008 climate change address, saying the gulf spill proved drilling isn't yet far enough away, clean enough, or safe enough. "Clearly that one isn't far enough and that's about 50 to 60 miles out, it's clearly not clean enough after we saw what we saw today - that's horrific - and it certainly isn't safe enough. It's the opposite of safe," Crist said. We should note that Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling. Meek was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging Congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006, voted against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. He did, however, release a tepid endorsement/criticism (it's hard to tell) of Obama's March 2010 drilling proposal. Read it here. Now back to Meek's claim against Crist. Meek said Crist's positions has changed "once again" on offshore drilling. That means at least twice. On a very basic level, Crist was opposed to oil drilling until 2008, then open to it, and now opposed again. That's two changes of positions as Meek suggests. But a more nuanced reading of Crist's statements on offshore drilling produces a slightly different interpretation. Crist was first opposed to oil drilling, then open to it if was proven safe. The April 20, 2010 spill convinced him it wasn't, and as a result, Crist again became opposed. We don't think that's necessarily the same as two flip flops. Crist decided to to explore the possibility of offshore drilling in 2008 after years of rejecting it out of hand (flip 1), but ended that examination after seeing the devastation in the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20 spill. That might be one and a half, but that's not a second flip. As a result, we rate Meek's statement Half True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-04-30T17:51:47	2010-04-29	['None']

pomt-08119	"An overwhelming majority of Americans support passage of the DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented youth willing to work for a college degree or serve in our armed forces."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/10/organizing-america/arm-democratic-national-committee-says-americans-o/	Calling for congressional approval of a measure enabling young illegal immigrants to work toward citizenship, a Texas arm of the Democratic National Committee said most Americans back the proposal. "An overwhelming majority of Americans support passage of the DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented youth willing to work for a college degree or serve in our armed forces—individuals who are Americans in every way but their legal status," trumpets a Dec. 6 press release issued by Organizing for America - Texas. DREAM stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The Democratic-majority House approved the act this week, turning it over to the Senate. We hunted for evidence of that overwhelming support, turning first to a summary of the poll linked to OFA's press release. The telephone poll of 1,008 adults , conducted June 10-13, was commissioned by First Focus, an advocacy organization that describes itself as dedicated to making children and families a priority in federal policy and budget decisions. According to its poll summary, 70 percent of respondents favored the act. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent, the summary says. A breakout on the poll shows that when asked if they'd favor or oppose the act, 51 percent said they'd strongly favor it while 18 percent said they'd not-so-strongly favor it. Twenty-five percent said they'd oppose it. And how was the question framed? Before answering the pollster, respondents heard a positive description of the bill, prefaced with these words: "Currently, illegal immigrant children who were brought to the U.S. at a young age and have grown up here and have no way to become legal citizens and fully contribute to society." The poll script states the DREAM Act would address "this problem" by giving illegal immigrants brought here as young children "the opportunity to work legally without fear of deportation and ultimately earn permanent legal resident status if they meet certain requirements." It says students must have come here when they were very young, lived here at least five years, stayed out of trouble, earned a high-school diploma or GED and completed at least two years of college or military service. Finally, respondents were told the proposal "has the potential to provide children and young people who meet these requirements with improved access to a higher education and a legal means by which to contribute to society." We wondered why the emphasis on contributing to society. Wendy Cervantes, a First Focus vice president, told us that aspect is relevant considering the avenues that are closed to illegal immigrant children. "They can't work, they can't drive, they can't really do anything legally," Cervantes said. Still, might the repeated reference to contributing to society sway respondents in favor of the act? Cervantes said that was not the intent. "We slaved over the wording quite a bit, mostly because we didn't want people to think we were trying to lead anybody one way or another," she said. Cervantes also pointed out two other polls suggesting Americans support the act. In a Rasmussen Poll released Sept. 21, 52 percent of likely voters said children brought here illegally who complete two years of college should be afforded a path to legal status, according to a write-up posted online by the Washington Independent, which describes itself as an independent news service. Thirty-six percent said such children should not be given an opportunity to become citizens, the Independent reported. In the poll, 78 percent said children brought to the U.S. illegally who later serve in the military should get a chance to become citizens, the Independent says. Its article didn't offer more details; Rasmussen hasn't posted the full poll on its public site. A poll commissioned by America's Voice, which advocates comprehensive immigration reform including tighter border security and giving illegal immigrants already here a path to citizenship, showed 66 percent of voters supporting the act, according to a Nov. 10 memo from the polling firm, Lake Research Partners. The poll surveyed 1,200 likely voters Oct. 31-Nov. 2. Those respondents heard the act described as providing "illegal immigrant students who were brought here as young children with the opportunity to earn permanent legal resident status" if they'd been "brought to the U.S. when they were very young, lived here for at least five years, stayed out of trouble, earned a high school diploma or GED, and completed at least two years of college or military service." Respondents were polled about the DREAM Act after being asked whether deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants now in the country is unrealistic; 76 percent agreed, 21 percent disagreed. But overall, immigration was not a high-priority concern; only 2 percent ranked it as their most important issue in deciding who to vote for Congress. The economy and jobs, health care, the federal budget deficit, education and moral values came out as most important for more voters. We wondered if any polls show that most Americans oppose the act. An online search led us to a November poll commissioned by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for stronger border security and stricter immigration laws. It found that 54 percent of 1,000 likely voters contacted Nov. 22 preferred to leave consideration of the act to the new (more Republican) Congress being sworn in early next year. The FAIR poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. Worth noting: The FAIR poll put a negative light on the current Congress, which is now considering the DREAM Act. Its first question: "Should the lame-duck Congress limit its work to fiscal issues like the budget and taxes or should the lame-duck Congress use the opportunity to address social policies that were too politically difficult to deal with before the election?" Next, the poll says the act "offers legalization to about 2 million illegal immigrants," a reference to the number of people who would be potentially eligible to earn citizenship if the act passes into law. Each of its questions about the proposal sounds a warning note: 1) "In additional to legalization, the DREAM Act would entitle newly legalized illegal immigrants to benefit from subsidized tuition rates at all state colleges and universities, and qualify for low interest government educational loans. Based on this information, would you be much more likely to support, somewhat more likely to oppose or much more likely to oppose passage of the DREAM Act?" Sixty-one percent replied they'd be more likely to oppose, 34 percent said they'd be more likely to support. 2) Under the act, "any illegal immigrant who files an application for legalization... would be protected from deportation so long as the application is pending. In addition, the government would be barred from using information provided in DREAM Act applications against the applicants, even if they are denied legalization." Fifty-eight percent said the information made them more likely to oppose. 3) Given this additional information, would you support or oppose action on the act by the lame duck Congress? Fifty-four percent said they opposed such action, 38 percent said they supported it. We ran what we learned about these polls past Karlyn Bowman, who analyzes polls for the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute. Bowman agreed the polls commissioned by First Focus and FAIR used language that potentially biased the responses. Also, Bowman said, she's wary of polls that gauge voter attitudes on specific measures that most Americans don't know that much about. "When you (then) begin asking Americans about (such) specifics, that's pushing the polling instrument far beyond where it should go," she said. As we completed this article, Bowman pointed out a poll just released by the Gallup organization. The poll taken Dec. 3-6 of 1,003 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, found 54 percent of respondents saying they'd vote in favor of allowing illegal immigrants brought here as children to gain legal resident status if they joined the military or went to college. Forty percent said they'd vote against, We set aside the First Focus poll (in which 70 percent favored the act) and the FAIR poll (in which 54 percent opposed acting on it now) as unreliable. That leaves the Rasmussen poll, for which we have scant methodological information (52 percent of those voters favored the act), the poll taken for America's Voices (66 percent in favor) and the fresh Gallup poll ( 54 percent in favor of a key aspect of the act). "Overwhelming" public support? That's questionable. But polling consistently shows a majority of Americans favor giving undocumented immigrant children a way to gain legal residency.

pomt-13663	"Youth unemployment is through the roof."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/04/donald-trump/ama-trump-exaggerates-youth-unemployment/	In Donald Trump’s Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the web-forum Reddit, the Republican presidential nominee was asked what he thought was the most important issue facing American young people. "The question most young people ask me is about the rising cost of education, terrible student debt and total lack of jobs. Youth unemployment is through the roof, and millions more are underemployed. It's a total disaster!" Trump wrote. Among the concerns Trump addressed in this answer, his assertion about youth unemployment stood out. If true, it would mean that youth employment was bucking the downward trend of the overall unemployment rate since 2010. To get a sense of whether youth unemployment is unusually high, we looked at a couple of questions. Is youth unemployment in the United States rising? Is it high historically? Is it high compared with other wealthy countries? The answer to each of these questions, we found, is no. A note on measures of unemployment: As we’ve explained before, there are different ways to look at the unemployment figures put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most commonly quoted figure measures people who cannot find work as a percentage of the labor force. This does not include people not looking for work, including retired people, many students, stay-at-home parents and people too discouraged to look for work. We’ll mostly look at this headline number, but other broader measures of the unemployment generally map onto the trends we’ll outline, according to Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics at the George Washington University and chief economist for the job site Indeed. We’ll try to use apples-to-apples comparisons to get a sense of whether the U.S. rate is unusually high. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the government agency that tracks the unemployment rate. It gets its numbers from a Census Bureau survey of 60,000 households. The numbers we’ll be using are then adjusted to take into account seasonal hiring. The unemployment rate for June for people 16 to 24 is a little more than twice as high as the overall unemployment rate. This is not unusual historically, Sinclair said. Young people typically take longer when looking for work than people with more experience, and a person looking for their first job will always be counted as unemployed while people who look for a new job while still working will not, to give two possible explanations. To determine whether today’s youth unemployment rate stands out, we need to compare it with youth unemployment rates in other times and places. The unemployment rate for people 16 to 24 peaked at 19.5 percent in April of 2010. In June of this year, the rate was a little more than half that—10.7 percent. The number fluctuates from month to month, but has trended downwards for years. The unemployment rates for people 16 to 24 have not yet reached its low from the mid 2000s. But it is close—less than one percent higher. The current rate is lower than some pre-crisis months between 2006 and 2008. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has collected youth unemployment data since 1948. The current rate is below the average for that whole period, and below the average rates for each of the last four decades. Data released by the International Labor Organization allows us to compare youth unemployment across countries. In 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate they reported for people 15 to 24 was essentially identical to their international rate. It was higher than the rate in Germany and Canada but lower than the rate in the United Kingdom and the overall rate for other high income countries and the European Union. The worst-off high income countries—Spain and Greece, each dealing with budget crises—have youth unemployment rates almost four times as high as the United States. France’s is twice as high. Youth unemployment affects the population unequally, and the rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are higher than the rate for the population as a whole. We looked at this disparity when Trump inflated the black youth unemployment rate in June. There are other ways of looking at the labor market for young people—other than unemployment—that are less positive. The labor force participation rate, which measures the portion of the population that is working or looking for work, fell during the recession and flat-lined during the recovery. The ratio of employed people to the entire population (including students and those not looking for work) 16 to 24 years old is improving but has not recovered from the recession and remains low by historical standards. Our ruling Trump said, "Youth unemployment is through the roof." Individual young people he speaks to may be worried about unemployment, but Trump is wrong to say that youth unemployment is exceptionally high. It is, at worst, average, in historical and international terms. We reached out to the Trump campaign, but they did not respond. This does not mean the job market works well for every young person, or that every statistical measure of the job market is positive. But his statement, in regards to unemployment, is still False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3fba3a88-41b9-49ce-8e8a-4bf8ab289f3f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-04T14:29:30	2016-07-27	['None']

pomt-03539	Says Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told insurance companies "they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/28/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-hhs-put-gag-order-insurers-ab/	Editor's note: This item was initially published May 24, 2013, as a Mostly False because of the limited supporting information we received Sen. Mitch McConnell's office. The office cited a letter sent to Humana, a government contractor for Medicare Advantage. We found that letter provided relatively little support for the senator's claim and rated it Mostly False. After the item was published, we received a note from Michael Cannon of the libertarian CATO Institute, who pointed out that we should have considered a 2010 letter from Sebelius to an insurance industry group. We found that letter actually provided more support for McConnell, even though his office had apparently been unaware of it. On May 28, we changed our rating to Mostly True and archived our previous fact-check here. Sen. Mitch McConnell says the Obama administration has created a "culture of intimidation" in Washington. One example: Obamacare. "Over at HHS back during the Obamacare debate, Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius sent out a directive to help insurance companies telling them they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them." McConnell, R-Ky., said on Meet the Press on May 19, 2013. A McConnell spokesman pointed us to a 2009 letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, often known as CMS, to Humana. The agency wrote the letter to respond to mailings that Humana sent to its nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. In bold type, Humana told its enrollees that "millions of seniors and disabled individuals could lose many of the important benefits and services that make Medicare Advantage health plans so valuable." In the letter, CMS told two Humana executives that CMS was concerned that "this information is misleading and confusing to beneficiaries, represents information to beneficiaries as official communications about the Medicare Advantage program, and is potentially contrary to federal regulations and guidance." The letter was relatively narrow in scope: It dealt with Humana, as a government contractor, and the information it was giving Medicare beneficiaries. It provides little support for McConnell’s claim because it said nothing about private insurance companies communicating with policyholders. It’s worth noting, too, that the Obama administration later clarified its rules saying Medicare Advantage contractors could communicate with Medicare beneficiaries about pending legislation as long as they did not use federal money to do so and they got permission from beneficiaries before sending them information about legislation or asking them to join advocacy efforts. Then another letter came to our attention. The AHIP letter Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, wrote to America’s Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, on Sept. 9, 2010, a few months after Obamacare became law. In the letter, Sebelius accused insurance companies of spreading misinformation by saying Obamacare was to blame for expected premium increases. "Given the importance of the new protections and the facts about their impact on costs, I ask for your help in stopping misinformation and scare tactics about the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, I want AHIP’s members to be put on notice: the Administration, in partnership with states, will not tolerate unjustified rate hikes in the name of consumer protections," Sebelius wrote. She said insurers would be required to justify any rate increases, that there would be state and federal reviews of increases that don’t appear justified, and insurers that have a record of unjustified increases would be excluded from the insurance exchanges set up by the law. Sebelius also disputed the insurance companies’ predictions that Obamacare would necessitate higher premiums and said any cost increases would be offset by savings built into the law. When the letter came out in 2010, Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Sebelius' letter was an attempt to "intimidate those who say unflattering things about ObamaCare." "What business does she have threatening insurers because they disagree with her in public? ObamaCare gave the HHS secretary considerable new powers. Is one of those the power to regulate what insurers say about ObamaCare? Excluding insurers from ObamaCare’s exchanges is not a minor threat," Cannon wrote. An HHS spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter was in response to insurance companies using Obamacare as an excuse to raise premiums, and that the law gave the agency the authority to scrutinize excessive premium increases and require justifications from insurance companies. But we find Cannon's interpretation more accurate. The letter chastised the insurers for anti-Obamacare messages and threatened them with regulatory action. Our ruling McConnell said that Sebelius told insurance companies "they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them." Her letter to AHIP didn’t go quite that far, but Sebelius was definitely seeking to muzzle the insurers because she felt they were giving false, self-serving information. The letter sought to discourage them with a not-so-subtle threat of regulatory action. Although McConnell was exaggerating that the companies were prohibited from these communications, the talk of regulatory action was significant and could fairly be taken as an attempt to intimidate. We rate McConnell's claim Mostly True.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-05-28T10:53:19	2013-05-19	['Kathleen_Sebelius', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

pomt-07054	"If you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-tax-rates-are-lowest-1950s-ceos-/	During a press conference on June 29, 2011, President Barack Obama was asked whether tax increases should be a part of a deal to approve a new debt ceiling -- the subject of long-running negotiations as the current statutory cap on federal debt approaches in August. Obama said that he believes some types of revenue increases should be included. As part of his answer, he sought to provide some context about current levels of taxation, at least for the most highly compensated Americans. "You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix," Obama said. "The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s." We realize that Obama offered two different standards -- the lowest rates ever, and the lowest since the 1950s. We’ve decided to use the latter standard -- "since the 1950s" -- because the data is more consistent and easily accessible. (With one exception to fund the Civil War, there was no federal taxation prior to 1913.) The most basic way to look at this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what’s commonly called the "top tax bracket." This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately. Assuming you’re talking about the "ordinary" income a CEO or a hedge fund manager earns -- a key assumption, which we’ll discuss in more detail later -- Obama is pretty close to right, but not 100 percent. Between 1960 (when the "1950s" faded into history) and the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960, and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980. By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993. So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today’s top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today’s.) That’s not exactly what Obama said, but it's close. Now for the complications. First, hedge fund managers, who were specifically cited by Obama, typically don’t pay taxes on their income the same way other Americans do. The bulk of hedge-fund managers’ income is typically considered "carried interest" -- that is, their share of profits from the funds they manage. When a fund has capital gains and those gains flow to the manager, they are taxed as a capital gain, not as ordinary income. From a taxation perspective, the difference is significant -- taxation can be as low as 15 percent, rather than the 35 percent paid by everyone else (including other types of Wall Street managers). The 15 percent rate for capital gains has been in place since 2003, so tax rates for hedge-fund managers’ carried interest isn’t new. But 15 percent is the lowest it has been since 1950, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. So for hedge-fund managers, Obama’s statement looks correct. There’s another complication. One more way to analyze Obama’s statement is by effective tax rates. An "effective" tax rate is what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like. It’s always lower than the statutory tax rate, sometimes significantly lower. There’s data on this, but it’s a bit more scattershot and doesn’t go all the way up to 2011. But we’ll do a quick review of the data. A 2007 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez calculated effective tax rates for various income groups. For people whose income ranked between the top 1 percent and top 0.5 percent, the effective tax rate for individual, corporate, payroll and estate was 34.0 percent in 1960, 36.1 percent in 1970, 37.6 percent in 1980, 31.5 percent in 1990, 35.7 percent in 2000 and 31.3 percent in 2004. For those earning between the top 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent of the income curve, the numbers were 41.4 percent in 1960, 44.6 percent in 1970, 43.0 percent in 1980, 33.0 percent in 1990, 38.4 percent in 2000 and 33.0 percent in 2004. For those earning between 0.01 percent and 0.1 percent, the rates were 55.3 percent in 1960, 59.1 percent in 1970, 51.0 percent in 1980, 34.3 percent in 1990, 40.2 percent in 2000 and 34.1 percent in 2004. Finally, for those in the top 0.01 percent of the income distribution, the effective tax rate was 71.4 percent in 1960, 74.6 percent in 1970, 59.3 percent in 1980, 35.4 percent in 1990, 40.8 percent in 2000 and 34.7 percent in 2004. So for each of these elite income groups, the effective tax rates were at or near historical lows in 2004, though for certain groups, the effective rate was equal or slightly lower in 1990. Of course, this data is seven years old. Meanwhile, the 2010 Economic Report of the President included a table that showed "that the effective tax rates that applied to high-income taxpayers reached their lowest levels in at least half a century in 2008." The table (labeled table 5-8) had data running back to 1960 and for both taxpayers earning at least $250,000 and taxpayers earning over $2 million. The table mirrors the Piketty-Saez data in that the 2008 levels are at or near lows for the period, with only the early 1990s coming close. So where does this leave us? There’s some degree of uncertainty in making this kind of statement, since a very high-earning American’s tax rate can vary greatly, depending on the kinds of income earned (and what tax rate it’s subjected to) and the kinds of exemptions and deductions claimed on their return. Even so, when Obama said that "if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s," he's close: Their tax rates are at or near the lows for the years elapsed since then. The top marginal income tax rates were lower between 1988 and 1992 than they are today, but otherwise, Obama is right. They were higher for the other years. Meanwhile, the rates that are used to tax carried interest for hedge-fund managers have been at historical lows since 2003. And effective tax rates for high-income earners were either at their lowest since 1960 or very close to their lowest (at least according to the most recent data available). On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-06-29T18:11:18	2011-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-01322	Georgia has elected more African-American leaders than any other state in the country.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/27/nathan-deal/deal-overstates-georgia-tops-black-elected-officia/	Both incumbent Republican Nathan Deal and Democrat Jason Carter have tried to woo black voters in their tense race to be Georgia’s next governor. Those voters now make up almost one-third of the state’s active voters – and their turnout could decide the close race in next week’s election. Democrats are trying to boost turnout in the voting block that traditionally supports them in part with a mailer that urges African-Americans to vote "if you want to prevent another Ferguson." Deal called the flier "despicable" and a failed attempt to compare Georgia to the Missouri town roiled by protests following the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. "Georgia has elected more African-American leaders -- mayors, county commissioners, et cetera -- than any other state in the country," Deal said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story. "We have a long history of good race relations, and I cannot understand why the Democrat Party of Georgia would try to destroy it." Does the Peach State lead the nation in the number of black elected officials? That’s a claim that cried out for testing on the Truth-O-Meter. We began, as we always do, by asking the Deal campaign for its source. Spokeswoman Jen Talaber wrote in an email that "Georgia has historically been a leader in African American officeholders," citing a 1987 publication that ranked it among the top five states for that distinction. She also pointed to a 2013 story in which the head of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials counted 1,000-plus members, "outnumbering the top three states listed in the aforementioned survey." But GABEO’s website says that the group is open to members of all races, as well as candidates and previous officeholders. Membership does not reflect a current tally of black elected officials. And PolitiFact, in trying to back up the governor’s statement, found similar metrics that put Georgia high but not at the top. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal Washington think tank that focuses on issues of race, prepared annual reports on the number of black officials in every possible office between 1970 and 2002. Those reports consistently showed more blacks served in elected offices in Southern states than anywhere else in the nation. But in specific states, the numbers varied. In 2000, when Democrats still dominated state and local politics, Georgia had 582 black elected officeholders on every level, said Dianne Pinderhughes, a professor of Africana studies and political science at the University of Notre Dame. By 2002, the last year available, that number had grown to 611. But both years Georgia lagged behind neighboring Alabama, with 731 black officials in 2000 and 756 in 2002. And consistently, nearby Mississippi led the nation, with 897 in 2000 and 892 black elected officials in 2002. "Georgia certainly isn’t No. 1 and never has been," said David A. Bositis, the senior political analyst at the center who wrote the yearly reports. The same is true when examining more recent figures that tally only state and local data, not all elected positions. Georgia had 452 black leaders in all state and local offices, according to the Gender and Multi-Cultural Leadership Project, which examines demographics in politics. The figures are based on data from 2006 for all offices except governor and lieutenant governor, which are from 2007. Based on those figures, Louisiana had 467 black elected officials at the time, and Alabama had 498. Mississippi was again the national leader, with 530 black state and local elected officials. Bositis, who now works as an independent researcher on the issues of race in politics, said more recent data are not available largely because research funding dried up. But he cautioned that the figures alone are not necessarily something states should boast about. The reports show that Mississippi largely leads because it has the highest black population in the country and therefore has several small jurisdictions with all-black elected leadership, he said. By comparison, Colorado is just 4 percent black but has had two black lieutenant governors and a black speaker of the House in its history. "I don’t think there are any states in the South that can boast about race relations," Bositis said. Yet that is exactly what both parties are doing in the tight battle for governor. Membership in a black political group does not translate into data to support Deal’s claim about the number of black elected officials in Georgia. Both Deal and PolitiFact Georgia found research, though, that consistently contradicts his claim. Georgia consistently ranks among states with the most such elected leaders, but it has not been at the top. The only thing that keeps this from being outright wrong is the lack of more recent data. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2014-10-27T00:00:00	2014-10-22	['None']
pomt-13569	"Who would sign up to speak for a (Haitian) dictator? Rob Portman."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/23/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democrats-ad-ties-sen-rob-portman-haitian-dic/	As part of their campaign to help Democratic candidate Ted Strickland to the U.S. Senate, the Ohio Democratic Party announced an August onslaught of web videos, ads and editorials called "The Portman Files." The campaign will highlight Ohio’s Sen. Rob Portman’s "career as a D.C. lobbyist and lawyer for a series of nefarious clients and interest groups," according to the Ohio Democrats. First in this launch is a web ad titled, "Baby Doc." Text scrolling across the screen reads, "In the 1980s, Haiti is ruled by the brutal dictator Jean-Claude ‘Baby Doc’ Duvalier." A quick 60 Minutes clip describes Duvalier as having ruled Haiti with "unchecked brutality." The scrolling text continues over spooky music: "In 1985, Rob Portman joined a D.C. lobbying firm and became a ‘registered foreign agent’ for the government of Haiti." An unidentified voice says, "Thousands of Haitians were killed, disappeared, tortured. Those who spoke out against Duvalier were just taken away." Finally, the scrolling words conclude, "In 1985 Portman’s lobbying firm revealed traveling to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc. Who would sign up to speak for a dictator? Rob Portman, decades of fighting for the rich and the powerful." Linking Portman’s first job, post-college, with the regime of a corrupt dictator seemed extraordinarily far-fetched, even for this election season. We looked for the source. Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan’s law school in 1984, according to a 2012 Cleveland.com article. Responding to our inquiry, the Ohio Democratic Party provided us with a copy of a short-form registration statement signed by Portman on May 5, 1985. We asked Brett Kappel, a partner at Akerman LLP and an authority on lobbying, campaign finance and government ethics laws, to take a look at the registration form. Kappel confirmed, via email, that it "does show that Senator Portman did register as a foreign agent for Haiti, as well as four other Patton Boggs clients." Kappel also said that lobbying regulations would not have required Portman to register for all of Patton Boggs’ clients. The other clients for which Portman registered were the Government of the Sultanate of Oman; the Guatemala Sugar Association; Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd.; and a group of cigar and tobacco makers. On Portman’s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as "standard procedure" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. Portman’s staff supplied PolitiFact Ohio with an affidavit from a former managing partner of Patton Boggs & Blow, Stuart Pape, dated April 12, 2005. In his affidavit, Pape explained how Portman filed the May 5, 1985, registration statement because he was working on the Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd. account, a foreign principal based in Hong Kong. Pape further said that he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for the Republic of Haiti or any foreign government while with the firm. This affidavit became necessary in 2005, the year President George W. Bush tapped Portman as his United States Trade Representative. Rules dictate that the U.S. trade representative position cannot be held by anyone who has ever lobbied for foreign governments. Haiti did not come up as an issue during the Senate confirmation process. Sen. Evan Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, briefly sought to hold up Portman's confirmation until he got a commitment from Portman to get tough on trade with China. Portman was confirmed as trade representative by a unanimous vote. The ad is careful in its wording. Its claim is that "Portman’s firm revealed traveling to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc." That, records show, really happened. But the shade that the ad attempts to throw on Portman’s record is undeserved. Portman did not lobby on behalf of Haiti or its dictator while with Patton Boggs & Blow. Our ruling The anti-Portman ad ominously asks, "Who would sign up to speak for a (Haitian) dictator? Rob Portman." Portman worked for a lobbying firm that required its attorneys to register as foreign agents in case they were assigned to work for overseas clients. One of the firm’s clients was the Republic of Haiti, which was under the power of dictator "Baby Doc" until 1986. Portman was with the firm from October 1984 to October 1986. He did register as a foreign agent for the Republic of Haiti in 1985, and four other foreign-based clients. But the only work Portman performed directly for a foreign account was on behalf of Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., according to a sworn statement by a managing partner of Patton Boggs LLP in April 2005.

pomt-01614	At "least a quarter of those apprehended" at the border "have criminal records."	false	/texas/statements/2014/aug/29/david-dewhurst/unsupported-claim-1-4-apprehended-border-crossers-/	Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, backing Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to direct National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border, expressed concern about stopping criminals from entering the country. As quoted in a July 21, 2014, news story on Breitbart.com, Dewhurst said there is a huge "criminal element" at the border that includes significant gang activity. "We've seen estimates that at least a quarter of those apprehended have criminal records," Dewhurst said. A reader asked us about that 25 percent statement. We rode an explanatory roller coaster before finding there is no research bearing out this claim. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Andrew Barlow pointed out a former Border Patrol official, Ronald Coburn, saying in a Fox News interview July 19, 2014: "One in ten of every adult male crossers in this day and age more than likely already has a violent criminal record here in the United States, has been removed and is returning. Another one in ten, making it one in five, is bringing with him or her their violent criminal tendencies and records from their own countries of which we don't know yet," according to video posted by Breitbart.com. At least in the video snippet placed online, Coburn didn’t declare a source for his figures. In his email, Barlow further noted reports covering the federal fiscal year through September 2013. That year, the U.S. Border Patrol said, its officers apprehended 420,789 individuals. The same year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE "removed 106,695 criminals apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the U.S." Contrast those numbers, Barlow said, and it looks like 25 percent of apprehended individuals had criminal convictions. Following Barlow’s lead, we devised a slightly different calculation by focusing on the 414,397 individuals reportedly apprehended by the Border Patrol in the U.S.-Mexico border region. That contrast suggests 26 percent of the apprehended individuals already had a criminal conviction. Also, we noticed the ICE report directly presented an analysis of individuals with prior convictions. "In FY 2013, ICE removed 235,093 recent border crossers," the report said. "Many of those apprehended along the border had a prior criminal or civil immigration violation in the United States. Of those recent border crossers removed, 106,695 had a criminal conviction." This seemed to signal 45 percent of recent border crossers removed by ICE that year already had a criminal conviction. So, Dewhurst’s statement seemed to hold up. Federal cautionary note That was before we heard back from ICE and the Border Patrol. Dallas-based ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok responded to our email seeking comment on these percentages by saying it’s "inappropriate to compare Border Patrol apprehension statistics and ICE deportation statistics to come up with an accurate statistic on criminal aliens apprehended." We asked why and didn’t hear back. But separately, Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas sociologist expert on immigration, said a weakness in using the percentages of individuals with criminal convictions deported by ICE to analyze the backgrounds of people caught near the border is that ICE may be deporting immigrants apprehended in previous years. Rodriguez said, too, that ICE in recent years has concentrated on removing individuals convicted of crimes, so it’s understandable many deportees would have U.S. convictions. Doug Mosier, an El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman, struck a similar cautionary note about drawing conclusions about the criminal histories of people detained at the border from the backgrounds of people deported by ICE. By email, Mosier said: "It is almost impossible to quantify ICE vs USBP numbers being that there are so many processes that can take place when a subject is apprehended at the border. Secondly, it is rare for ICE to apprehend people at the border; that mainly occurs in the interior." Mosier added: "What ICE removes will not fully represent illegal immigrants that USBP might process and repatriate on its own (in the case of Mexico, for example). Even though ICE deports them, it doesn’t mean that Border Patrol necessarily caught them; and just because they were deported/removed that year, does not mean that they entered that year. (Many of those persons that ICE removes are subjects that have either completed sentences in prisons or have exhausted their immigration benefits/hearings/processes, which can take some time)." Less than 1 in 5 individuals apprehended near border have U.S. criminal/immigration violations Asked if the government has a sense of the U.S. criminal records of people the Border Patrol catches near the border, Mosier provided figures indicating that in both fiscal 2013 and the first nine months of fiscal 2014, less than 5 percent of immigrants captured by its agents near the southern border had a prior U.S. immigration or criminal conviction. Individuals Apprehended With Prior U.S. Criminal Convictions U.S. Border Patrol, Southwest Sector Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014 (October 2013 through June 2014) Time Period Total Individuals Apprehended Apprehended Individuals With Prior U.S. Criminal/Immigration Conviction Percentage of Apprehended Individuals With Prior Conviction Fiscal 2013 414,397 15,466 3.7 % October 2013 through June 2014 422,146 18,422 4.4 % Source: Email and telephone interview, Doug Mosier, spokesman, U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Aug. 13, 2014 We shared this information with Dewhurst's office. Barlow replied by email we’d misinterpreted what Dewhurst originally said in that the Texan was referring both to "re-crossers" convicted in U.S. courts and to individuals "whose past criminal activity occurred in their country of origin or in the U.S. prior to their deportation-for-cause instead of a trial." Dewhurst ultimately offered no data on the share of people apprehended at the border who had criminal convictions abroad--and that information might not be available. By email, Mosier of the Border Patrol told us that while every apprehended undocumented immigrant is screened for his or her immigration and U.S. criminal histories, home-country convictions and a person’s "international criminal history" isn’t usually available from federal data systems. Our ruling Dewhurst said at "least a quarter of those apprehended" at the border "have criminal records." Dewhurst’s described basis for this statement was a methodologically unsound mash-up fueled by the U.S. criminal histories of deported immigrants. In reality, less than 5 percent of people apprehended by the Border Patrol near the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2012 through June 2014 had a U.S. criminal conviction or immigration violation. Public data on home-country criminal records don't appear to be available. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-06317	"More than half of the people on food stamps today are children."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/14/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-more-half-food-stamp-recipie/	There’s not much variety in a food stamp diet. Just ask Rep. Marcia Fudge. She began Nov. 7, 2011, dining on less than $5 a day, a self-imposed restriction to raise awareness about poverty in America. The congresswoman took what’s known as the Food Stamp Challenge. Her budget for one week’s worth of food came to $31.50, the average weekly benefit for an adult food stamp recipient in the United States. Her menu included such delicacies as cabbage and kale (flavored with pork neck bones), rotisserie chicken for protein, bananas and potatoes. Just prior to taking the challenge, Fudge championed the food stamp program,, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, with Al Sharpton on MSNBC. Fudge and Sharpton both were critical of a House-passed bill drafted by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin which calls for cuts in the food stamp program. Fudge said she thought it would be tragic to reduce food aid to needy Americans in the name of balancing the budget. "More than half of the people on food stamps today are children," Fudge told Sharpton. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Fudge’s claim. But first, some background on Ryan’s budget. It calls for reducing the federal outlay for food stamps by an average of $12.7 billion over 10 years. The bill would shift funding for the program to block grants provided to the states, which would then administer the payouts. Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said his boss believes in the food stamp program but wants to make it more sustainable over time by changing the way it’s administered and by reducing budget increases going forward. Enrollment in food stamps has grown from 17.3 million in 2001 to 44.3 million today, while funding has grown from less than $18 billion in 2001 to more than $80 billion today. PolitiFact Ohio isn’t commenting on whether Ryan or Fudge have the best recipe for the food stamp program going forward. We check the data about food stamp recipients. The United States Department of Agriculture administers the food stamp program, and according to its records, 47 percent of the recipients in 2010 were under the age of 18. That’s down from 49 percent in 2008. Fudge pegged the figure at more than half while talking to Sharpton, so we asked her office to explain. Fudge press secretary Laura Allen cited the 49 percent figure as well as another USDA statistic that claimed 52 percent of SNAP households include children. "The congresswoman could have been more specific, but since 52 percent of households that receive SNAP include children, there is a strong argument that more than half of people ‘on SNAP’ or using the benefits are children," Allen wrote in an e-mail. Not necessarily. Just because half the households have children, doesn’t mean half the total recipients are children. It turned out the 52 percent figure was taken from a USDA document that shows that in Fudge’s district in Ohio between 2007 and 2009, 51.5 percent of households receiving food stamps had children below the age of 18. A separate document for 2010 puts the figure at 48.7 percent. Allen went on to say the Congresswoman’s slight overstatement was "an honest mistake." Fair enough. And as mistakes go, this one is pretty small. Roughly half the people on food stamps are children. Fudge described it as more than half based on data that was specific to her district. The actual figure for the national average is 47 percent, a point of clarification. A statement that is accurate but requires additional information or clarification lands one place on the Truth-O-Meter: Mostly True.

pomt-07786	At protests in Wisconsin against proposed collective bargaining changes, "phony sick notes (were) passed out to excuse striking union members."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/21/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-republican-party-says-doctors-were-handi/	Among the thousands of government workers who demonstrated against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker over collective bargaining rights were men and women wearing white lab coats and carrying clipboards. Some had stethoscopes around their necks. According to the Wisconsin Republican Party, they were doctors who wrote excuses for the protesters to explain their absence from work. "Phony sick notes passed out to excuse striking union members," the GOP charged in a news release issued Feb. 19, 2011. As a result of teachers calling in sick, several school districts have had to close their doors during the ongoing protests, including Madison for four days and Milwaukee for one. The GOP argues that amounted to a strike, because the closings occurred after the state’s largest teachers union called on all Wisconsin residents to attend the Madison rallies. However, no state, local government or public school employees -- all of whom would be affected by Walker’s plan to curtail collective bargaining rights -- have formally declared a strike. But what about the rest of the GOP’s claim? Did doctors roam the crowds outside the state Capitol handing out phony sick notes to government workers who missed work to protest? The GOP news release cited a YouTube video posted Feb. 19 by the MacIver Institute, which describes itself as a Madison-based "think tank that promotes free markets, individual freedom, personal responsibility and limited government." One of the women dressed in medical garb -- her name is not given -- tells the interviewer, "We are writing sick notes for anybody who needs them." "Who’s sick?," the interviewer asks. "Everybody is sick of Scott Walker," the woman says. Another woman identifies herself as being one of a "group of doctors representing ourselves, not necessarily our workplaces, providing work excuses for teachers and other union members who need them." The interviewer also confronts a man, apparently a doctor, who was filling out forms and asks if what he was doing was fraud. "We’re not handing out anything. We’re assessing people and dealing with them appropriately in the privacy of their own medical consultations," the man replies. We found other evidence that doctors were handing out notes to public workers to give to their employers: The Associated Press quoted doctor Lou Sanner as saying he gave out hundreds of such notes. Many protesters seemed to be suffering from stress, said Sanner, a family-practice physician and faculty member at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. WKOW-TV in Madison aired a report from the demonstrations that included an interview with doctor Kathy Oriel, who is also a family-practice physician and faculty member at the medical school. Asked on camera if she thought she could get in trouble for issuing the notes, Oriel replied: "Certainly. We think it’s worth the risk to support the people and we feel very strongly that these are professionals who really would like to be in school, they would like to be in school with our classes, but they’re put in a position where they really have no choice." We tried calling Sanner and Oriel but were referred to a medical school spokeswoman. We also called two other doctors at the medical school who have been linked to the sick notes. Their offices referred us to a phone number -- (608) 890-9220 -- that offers a recorded message saying the medical school "will thoroughly investigate these allegations and take appropriate actions as indicated." That phone line allows callers to record a comment and says people wishing to comment also can send an e-mail to publicaffairs@uwhealth.org. Meanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools officials have also promised an investigation, saying teachers who were "absent without leave or who called in sick since the protests started in Madison" could face disciplinary action. After days of protests, the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Feb. 20, 2011, that if teachers are not otherwise off, they should report back to the classroom. (Some districts were off Feb. 21, 2011 for Presidents Day.) That’s enough for our checkup. The Wisconsin Republican Party claimed that doctors passed out "phony sick notes" to "excuse striking union members." It’s clear that doctors outside the Capitol were distributing notes that public employees attending demonstrations could use in an attempt to explain their absence from work. None of the public employees, however, have gone on strike. We rate the GOP’s statement Mostly True.	None	Republican Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2011-02-21T15:09:14	2011-02-19	['Wisconsin']

pomt-12995	"Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud"	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/bipartisan-report/florida-calls-recount-over-voter-fraud-website-say/	A website misleadingly claimed that the Sunshine State has pushed for a recount of presidential election results, citing widespread voter fraud. "Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud," read the headline of a Dec. 6, 2016, post on BipartisanReport.com. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com While the post itself recounts a real news story about a lawsuit claiming voter fraud in Florida, the headline is inaccurate enough to give people the wrong impression that a potential recount is underway. The Tallahassee Democrat reported on Dec. 5 that three Florida residents had filed a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet and Florida’s 29 Republican electors. The website also cites the same story in the Detroit Free Press. The filing alleges that the state’s election results were invalid, contending that voting machines malfunctioned or were hacked, many votes went uncounted and mail-in ballots weren’t included, among other problems. The suit aims to force a recount of votes by insisting Hillary Clinton would have won the election had there been no alleged impropriety. Trump won Florida by almost 113,000 votes, and there has been no proof of "massive voter fraud." The election results were certified on Nov. 22, with only "minor problems" reported by election officials. Despite what the headline implies, state officials have not pushed for a recount. Under Florida law, a recount is triggered if a candidate wins by 0.5 percent or less. Trump’s margin of victory over Clinton was about 1.4 percent. A voter may file a lawsuit to contest the results within 10 days of the results being certified. The results can be contested if there’s a suspicion of fraud or corruption, a candidate being ineligible, a dispute over vote totals or bribery. With the assistance of a left-leaning Washington-based group called Protect Our Elections, the trio of plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on Dec. 2, the final eligible day to contest the results. The Facebook post of the report did mention the lawsuit, also noting "Trump is NOT happy." But there’s a good chance he won’t say anything about the lawsuit at all. Even Orlando attorney Clint Curtis, representing the plaintiffs in the recount lawsuit, acknowledged the action may produce zero results before the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19. "They can ignore it entirely," Curtis told the Tallahassee Democrat. Our ruling Bipartisan Report’s headline read, "Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud." A trio of Florida voters contested the results, not state officials. Their lawsuit cited potential problems like uncounted or improperly tallied votes and voting machines that didn’t work or were hacked. The lawsuit likely won’t bring a recount — or any action at all — before the Electoral College votes. The headline confounds readers by misrepresenting what the story actually says. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df5eff17-355a-47fc-b2a7-901d97cf27ce	None	Bipartisan Report	None	None	None	2016-12-15T16:20:25	2016-12-06	['None']
pomt-07856	"Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/10/barack-obama/obama-says-companies-have-nearly-2-trillion-sittin/	In an address to the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 7, 2011, President Barack Obama implored business owners to start investing and hiring. And, he said, they've got plenty of cash on hand to do it. "So if I’ve got one message, my message is now is the time to invest in America," Obama said. "...Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets. And I know that many of you have told me that you’re waiting for demand to rise before you get off the sidelines and expand, and that with millions of Americans out of work, demand has risen more slowly than any of us would like. "We’re in this together, but many of your own economists and salespeople are now forecasting a healthy increase in demand," Obama said. "So I just want to encourage you to get in the game." We're checking Obama's claim that "American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets." We asked the White House press office where Obama got the statistic, and they pointed us to a Dec. 10, 2010, story in the Wall Street Journal, which ran under the headline, "Companies Cling to Cash." "Corporate America's cash pile has hit its highest level in half a century," wrote Justin Lahart. "Rather than pouring their money into building plants or hiring workers, nonfinancial companies in the U.S. were sitting on $1.93 trillion in cash and other liquid assets at the end of September, up from $1.8 trillion at the end of June, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Cash accounted for 7.4 percent of the companies' total assets — the largest share since 1959. "The cash buildup shows the deep caution many companies feel about investing in expansion while the economic recovery remains painfully slow, and high unemployment and battered household finances continue to limit consumers' ability to spend." The Wall Street Journal got its numbers from a Federal Reserve "flow of funds" report issued on Dec. 9, 2010. The figures come from a section on "Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business" (Table L. 102); specifically, Line 41, "total liquid assets." In the third quarter of 2010, the liquid assets came to $1.93 trillion, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2005 and 2006. You can check out the footnotes for a detailed explanation of what all is considered a liquid asset, but it includes cash and money market and mutual fund shares. As always, there are lots of ways to slice the data. As a result, Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's conservative Mercatus Center, cautioned not to place too much stock in the absolute precision of Obama's number. "If you break out financial assets by category, into say liquid and less liquid assets, you can pretty much create any number you want, because '$2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets' is imprecise," Thallam said. "For instance, if you use checkable deposits, time and savings deposits and money market funds for both categories of business, you get $2.3 trillion." We spoke to two other economists who preferred to cite a different category of businesses, "Nonfinancial Business" (Table L. 101) instead of "Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business" used by the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter of 2010, the liquid assets for nonfinancial businesses was $2.4 trillion; up from just over $1.9 trillion in 2005. Although experts may differ on which category to highlight, it was perfectly reasonable for the Wall Street Journal to cite the category it did. More important, though, is that Obama's statement implies companies are sitting on a full $2 trillion that could be immediately invested in business expansion. And that's not right. "Much of this money is already committed -- it must be used to pay wages, suppliers, rent, utilities, etc.," said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "But, there is little doubt that companies have a great deal of cash sitting around that they could use to invest, if they wanted, even if $2 trillion is more than a bit of an exaggeration." It's crucial, said Brian Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, to "normalize" the figure. In other words, how much in liquid assets did businesses have on hand back when things were going relatively well? In the category Obama cited, liquid assets came to about $1.5 trillion in 2005 and 2006. That's a good indicator of normal levels, Bethune said. Obama's statement suggests companies have about $2 trillion in cash they aren't using, he said, "and that's not really the way to look at it." "Companies have to have a certain amount of working cash to meet payroll and other business expenses," Bethune said. "By some measure, that's excess cash. But that's a major distortion. It's not like all of a sudden there is free cash sitting around." Still, no matter how you slice the data, the Federal Reserve statistics show that companies are holding on to much more cash and liquid assets than they have in years past, so Obama's broader point is valid. It was also presented in general enough terms -- "$2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets" -- that it is defensible as an accurate figure. But to the extent Obama's statement implies companies could readily invest that entire amount of money, it is misleading. Less the amount needed to meet regular business expenses, the amount on the balance sheet that could be used to invest in business expansion (including hiring new workers) is actually much smaller. And so we knock Obama's statement down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-10T16:43:09	2011-02-07	['United_States']

pomt-07560	"There has never been a death caused by a [commercial nuclear] reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/01/johnny-isakson/isakson-claims-no-deaths-us-nuke-plant-operations/	(Editor’s Note: Sen. Isakson’s statement was made in the context of a discussion about two commercial nuclear power plants -- Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi and the Votgle facility, a plant near Augusta that’s slated for expansion. Isakson was specifically addressing safety issues at commercial nuclear power generators.) The fallout from Japan’s nuclear disaster has arrived in Georgia as a small cloud of worry. The construction of the nation’s first new nuclear reactors in decades is slated for just south of Augusta at the Vogtle power plant. When a deadly earthquake and tsunami triggered what is likely a partial meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a few residents near the Georgia site began to ask questions. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson was quick to offer reassurances that Vogtle would be safe. "There has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s," Isakson said in a YouTube.com video posted by his office. Three Mile Island? That 1979 nuclear accident sank the U.S. into a three-decade freeze on the building of nuclear power plants. No one died? Nuclear power companies have a lot at stake at Vogtle. They hope its new reactors will herald an industry renaissance. Now that Fukushima Daiichi is in crisis, the future for nuclear power is uncertain. Members of Congress, such as independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, have urged regulators to be cautious as they proceed with the construction of more nuclear plants in the U.S. We called up Isakson’s office and asked for more evidence. A spokeswoman pointed us to 2010 testimony by Greg Jaczko, the chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a Senate committee hearing. When a senator asked Jaczko whether a fatality had ever occurred "as a result of an accident at a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States," Jaczko replied with this: "There has not as a result of plant operation, not at a commercial power plant. There have been other nuclear facilities where there have been fatalities, but not in a nuclear power plant." We interviewed experts on Three Mile Island, epidemiology and the history of nuclear power. They agreed that no one died during the immediate crisis surrounding the Three Mile Island accident or in other commercial U.S. plants as a result of plant operation. In addition, they agreed that the scientific consensus is that in the decades following Three Mile Island, no deaths have been tied to illnesses resulting from radiation exposure. "The statement of the politician [Isakson] is correct -- as far as we know," said Sam Walker, who retired last year as historian for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is the author of a book on Three Mile Island. The prevailing view is that despite early, anecdotal reports of deaths and disease, Three Mile Island’s impact on overall cancer deaths is minimal. Worker radiation exposure was higher than normal but not extreme, and experts think people living near the plant were exposed to low doses. This does not mean, however, that the disaster has not caused deaths or won’t in the future. It can take more than a decade for radiation exposure to manifest itself as cancer, and it’s difficult to pinpoint whether radiation exposure, a smoking habit or other factors caused a particular person’s illness. The latest research suggests Three Mile Island may have some deadly long-term effects. University of Pittsburgh professor Evelyn Talbott has been leading a major, decades-long effort to track the effects of Three Mile Island radiation in more than 32,000 people who lived in the area surrounding the plant. Talbott’s team noted no increase in overall cancer deaths 20 years afterward, but research they recently submitted for publication shows that adult men who they think received the highest doses of radiation from the accident are at greater risk for leukemia than others who were exposed, the scientist said. Women with similar amounts of radiation exposure showed a higher risk of breast cancer. "So presumably there may have been excess deaths. We just don't know who specifically, as the cases were within a group of people exposed to more radiation but also had other factors which may have predisposed them," Talbott told PolitiFact Georgia. Members of an impassioned minority think the impact may have been more severe. A study by scientists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found a link between Three Mile Island and increased incidents of cancer overall. Critics think there are too few peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals on the disaster’s health effects. Joseph Mangano, the head of the Radiation and Public Health Project, thinks the dangers of radiation exposure in general are underplayed. He noted that only a handful of studies have been published on patterns of several types of cancer. "I think the health research field has completely dropped the ball," Mangano told PolitiFact Georgia. In conclusion: Isakson’s statement that "there has never been a death caused by a reactor in the United States, even when Three Mile Island failed in the 1970s," reflects a prevailing view. According to the latest research, that does not mean there has never been a death because of Three Mile Island’s long-term effects. It’s also worth noting that some scientists back a minority view that the accident increased overall cancer deaths. That said, Isakson specified in his claim that there has never been a death "caused by a reactor" in the U.S. This language is not clear, but it does indicate his claim is limited to plant operations, not the long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident. His backup information suggests this as well. We rate Isakson’s statement True.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2011-04-01T06:00:00	2011-03-15	['United_States']

pomt-10798	"Hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would, and kept standing till 6-million kids had coverage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/08/hillary-clinton/standing-up-but-not-alone-/	In a TV ad airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sen. Hillary Clinton portrays herself as a leader on health care. "Hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would," the announcer says, "and kept standing till 6-million kids had coverage." Indeed, the New York senator has a record as an advocate for health care reform. When she was first lady, President Bill Clinton appointed her to head the President's Task Force on National Health Reform. But the group formulated a plan that ended up going down in defeat. It was one of the most significant defeats of President Clinton's first term. Critics of the Clinton health plan, mostly Republicans, focused on her role and mocked the proposal as Hillary Care. The name has stuck and made a resurgence in the past few weeks since now-candidate Clinton has proposed her own plan. But did she stand up for universal health care "when almost no one else did"? That's a stretch. The president obviously also favored it in 1992, but so did every other major Democratic candidate — Jerry Brown, Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas. It also had support in Congress, though not enough to pass. So we find the "almost no one else" claim to be an exaggeration. For the second part of the assertion, the Clinton campaign said the "6-million kids" refers to those who would benefit from the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which passed in 1997 and was funded with cigarette taxes. SCHIP provides federal funding to states, which then put up their own money and set rules to provide health care for uninsured children. Much of the credit for SCHIP usually goes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. But the Clinton campaign says she used her influence behind the scenes to push for SCHIP, and there is evidence to support that. Shortly after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, "Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support." We don't dispute that Clinton worked behind the scenes for SCHIP, but the TV ad gives her disproportionate credit for the entire program. We find that the ad overstates her role on this count and also on the broader issue of universal health care. And so we find the claim to be Half True.

pomt-01025	The Super Bowl has "one of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/29/john-cornyn/does-sex-trafficking-increase-around-super-bowl/	For the past few years, campaigns against human sex trafficking have swelled in the days before the Super Bowl, largely because of the persistence of a claim that it’s the largest sex trafficking event in the country. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has been pushing anti-human trafficking legislation through Congress, repeated this at a Jan. 27 news conference. "While most Americans are going to be getting prepared for the Seahawks and the Patriots to tee off in the Super Bowl," Cornyn said, "the dirty little secret is that the Super Bowl actually (has) one of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country." Cornyn’s staff clarified that he was not saying human trafficking surges nationally on Super Bowl Sunday. He meant that it surges in the region where the Super Bowl takes place and in the days surrounding the event. (This year, it’s Feb. 1 in Phoenix.) But as it turns out, there is very little empirical evidence that speaks to this oft-repeated claim -- even though there is some recent academic research on the topic. While there are news reports and anecdotal examples of sting operations in Super Bowl host cities, comparisons to the rest of the year are rare, making it hard to know whether there’s a Super Bowl spike. The latest evidence We spoke with Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a social work professor at Arizona State University who is leading the latest academic research on sex trafficking around the Super Bowl. Her research intends to discover whether or not there is an increase in sex-trafficking events surrounding the Super Bowl and to further understand sex trafficking trends. (Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 -- a circumstance "in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.") Roe-Sepowitz’s 2014 research used online escort ads to compare supply and demand for trafficking victims in New York City -- where the 2014 Super Bowl took place -- and used Phoenix as a control. During this weekend’s Super Bowl, they are looking at the same two cities and will publish a report in the coming weeks. Last year, they reviewed online commercial sex ads in the New York and Phoenix metropolitan areas in the days leading up to and following the game. Out of nearly 1,000 ads in New York, 84 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Among more than 1,300 ads in Phoenix, 80 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Roe-Sepowitz said that so far, the research does not show correlation between the Super Bowl and higher levels of sex trafficking activity. They found some evidence of "victim movement and marketing trends that tend to correspond with the build up towards the Super Bowl" -- traffickers responding to the influx of thousands of men with money to spend. But they did not find that the level of activity was necessarily higher than other weeks out of the year. On the other hand, increased public attention on trafficking around the Super Bowl might mean that the frequency is lower than it would be otherwise. In all, this research does not conclusively prove one way or another that the Super Bowl is the largest event for sex-trafficking in the country. Other debunkings Some advocacy groups have tried to debunk the rumor, too. Around the time of the 2014 Super Bowl, leaders from the Polaris Project -- an advocacy organization -- wrote a column in the Huffington Post, in which they acknowledged that the evidence for a spike in trafficking around the Super Bowl is slim. And the idea detracts from the fact that trafficking occurs year-round. The Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women, an advocacy group, published an extensive report on sex trafficking and the major sports events, including the Super Bowl, in 2011. "The hype around large sporting events and increases in trafficking for prostitution is often based on misinformation, poor data and a tendency to sensationalize," the report says. "On various occasions, politicians have uncritically repeated this claim, despite the fact that numerous researchers, anti-trafficking experts, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have stated that there is no evidence of a link between large sporting events and trafficking for prostitution." Cornyn’s staff sent us links to several news articles that they said indicated a spike in human trafficking around the Super Bowl. For example, the New York Attorney General’s office had evidence that a prostitution ring offered special discounted "party packs" around the Super Bowl -- but those arrested were not charged with human trafficking (as opposed to prostitution). Another article that Cornyn’s staff sent quotes Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who has worked with Cornyn on sex-trafficking legislation, saying: "During the Dallas Super Bowl in 2011 there was a 300 percent increase in the Internet ads regarding sex trafficking." Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker checked this claim and gave it their worst rating in terms of accuracy -- four Pinocchios. Klobuchar was (incorrectly) citing an informal study out of the Texas-based Traffick911. That study found a 172 percent spike in Internet ads for female escorts in the three weeks leading up to the Dallas Super Bowl. But that study does not specify that these posts indicated sex trafficking, rather than prostitution, and there’s no comparison to prior Super Bowls or trends in escort service posts at other times of the year in Dallas. Cornyn’s staff also sent articles that included estimates of trafficking victims in areas around the Super Bowl host city in past years -- such as for those trafficked in the Miami area for the Super Bowl there in 2010. But there’s no way of knowing with certainty whether this is a spike, because we don’t have figures from the rest of the year to compare. Our ruling Cornyn said that the Super Bowl has "one of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country." There’s very little evidence to support this persistent claim. It’s certainly possible that a Super Bowl host city might attract more sex trafficking during the event than it would at other points in the year given the rapid arrival of many thousands of visitors with money to spend. But there’s no empirical evidence to prove it. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2015-01-29T17:33:41	2015-01-27	['None']

pomt-08649	"You can’t raise taxes in Ohio. We are one of the highest taxed states in the country."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/15/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-ohio-one-most-taxed-states/	Jobs and taxes are top issues in this year’s state and national elections, with politicians banging daily on related themes in speeches, news releases and campaign ads. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich amplified his tax message recently with the claim that Ohioans pay more taxes than people in most other states. While he frequently makes the statement on the campaign trail, the claim is the stinger in his latest campaign television ad that began airing statewide Aug. 22. "You can’t raise taxes in Ohio. We are one of the highest taxed states in the country ... If you raise prices in the state you drive taxpayers away." Kasich made similar claims Sept. 14 during the first gubernatorial debate with Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, which makes the issue worth examining now. The statement, Kasich says, refers to an individual’s tax burden – the sum of state and local taxes, such as property taxes and local sales taxes, that an individual pays. And he specifically uses a ranking by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, which regularly crunches state and local tax data. The Tax Foundation ranks Ohio’s total tax burden seventh highest, according to its 2008 study, the most recent available. Among 50 states, seventh qualifies in our book as "one of the highest." But the ranking deserves more discussion because of an ongoing debate among tax experts about how to best evaluate or measure the total tax burden. The Tax Foundation first combines state and local tax collections, and makes projections, or estimates, for the year the study is completed. The Tax Foundation also considers taxes Ohioans may pay in other states, and vice versa. It then divides the state’s total tax collections by total personal income. Translated: the average Ohioan pays about 10.4 percent of their income to state and local taxes compared to the national average of 9.7 percent. Ohio takes a hit in the Tax Foundation study because of its relatively high income tax rate. Other tax experts, including those at the Federation of Tax Administrators, agree that combining state and local taxes and dividing that by total personal income offers a reasonable way to look at the burden. But these experts stick with the raw U.S. Census data without making any adjustments or projections. Ohio has the 16th highest total tax burden -- all state and local taxes -- as a percentage of personal income, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators’ crunching of U.S. Census numbers. That ranking moves Ohio from the top quarter of highest taxed states to the top third, giving the state a bit more cover. And even in its purest form, the Federation of Tax Administrators say, U.S. Census data can be misleading because not all taxes are "tied to personal income and the scope neglects certain types of state economic activity." You can read its analysis of measurement methods here. The Ohio Tax Department likes to brag about another view of tax-burden numbers offered this year, also by the Federation of Tax Administrators, but one that only looks at state taxes. By that measure, Ohio has the 33th highest state tax burden as a percentage personal income. That means only 17 other states collected a lower percentage of taxes than Ohio. But beware: this ranking looks only at the taxes imposed by the state -- not those imposed by local authorities. So an equal comparison can’t be made to studies that examine both state and local taxes. Nonetheless, the ranking is instructive because it shows Ohio’s tax rating has improved since it began reducing personal income and business taxes in 2005. That year, Ohio ranked 28th in the study of the state-tax burden. And there are other ways to slice and dice the figures. We ran a simple Google search, "total tax burden by state per capita," and immediately found another ranking. This one, from Statemaster, uses U.S. census data and excludes federal and local taxes from its rankings, focusing only on state tax collections. It ranks Ohio as having the 27th heaviest tax burden. So that brings us back to the nagging question: How should the tax burden be measured? Ohio’s Education Tax Policy Institute, a think-tank that defends the state and is led by school districts to analyze tax data and influence policies, argues that the Tax Foundation’s attempts to look beyond the U.S. Census data dooms its study. The institute makes its case in a paper entitled, "More Tax Foundation Nonsense!" which is available on its Web site. The Tax Foundation has battled back, offering lengthy rebuttals. Its argument, "Wishful Thinking About Tax Burdens in Ohio," is available on the Tax Foundation Web site. The problem for voters is that tax experts will be debating the issue long beyond the election, so PolitiFact Ohio wants to keep Kasich’s claim in the context of the governor’s race. By citing the Tax Foundation study, Kasich is invoking several taxes the governor can’t easily influence – such as school levies passed by voters, or sales tax boosted by county commissioners – to paint Ohio’s tax picture as bleak. The claim also obscures the tangible improvements Ohio has made at the state level in reducing both business and personal income taxes since 2005, including a nearly 17 percent cut in personal income tax since then. These improvements were addressed in more detail in the June 17 PolitiFact Ohio article, "Ted Strickland boasts Ohio’s small business climate is tops in the Midwest." We think both are important points that help provide clarification about taxes in Ohio. One thing about Kasich’s claim is clear: by one measure, it’s accurate. But how to best define tax burden is cloudier, and a look at other research shows that answers and rankings can vary wildly depending on which taxes are included, which data sets are employed and which projectons are applied. For these reasons, we rate Kasich’s claim Half True. Comment on this item.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-09-15T12:00:00	2010-08-22	['Ohio']
pomt-03583	"Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/16/one-new-jersey/democratic-ad-targets-chris-christie-hikes-tolls-p/	Few things anger New Jerseyans more than higher costs – and that just may be the point of a recent radio ad critical of Gov. Chris Christie’s time in office. One New Jersey, a Democratic grass-roots group, released the ad May 3. It uses the sound effects of a deck of cards being shuffled and cut to emphasize a theme that Christie’s gubernatorial tenure thus far has stacked the deck against taxpayers. Christie is up for re-election in November. His lone challenger is state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex). The ad goes after Christie in a number of areas but we’re looking at issues that are near and dear to many New Jerseyans: toll costs, public transportation, education and the wealthy paying their fair share in taxes. "Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires," a portion of the 60-second ad states. Most of the claims are accurate but some details are lacking. Let’s start by reviewing toll hikes. One New Jersey is correct that tolls are higher under Christie, but doesn’t mention that the state has had two major toll increases in recent years – the larger of which was courtesy of Democrat Jon Corzine, not Christie. In August 2011, Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed to raise trans-Hudson tolls by $1.50 starting in September 2011, followed by additional hikes of 75 cents annually through 2015 to fund a $33 billion capital plan for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Those increases affected the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Goethals, Bayonne and George Washington bridges. The Corzine-approved hike that took effect Jan. 1, 2012 increased tolls 53 percent on the New Jersey Turnpike and 50 percent on the Garden State Parkway. Those hikes were the second part of a two-phase toll increase adopted by the Turnpike Authority in October 2008, when Corzine was governor. And costs also have increased for train and bus rides since Christie became governor in January 2010. Three months after Christie took office, NJ Transit approved its largest fare hike in history to help close a $300 million budget gap for the fiscal year beginning that July 1. The hikes, the first since 2007, amounted to 25 percent for train and some bus riders and 10 percent for local bus riders and light rail commuters. In February 2010 Christie called NJ Transit a "political patronage pit" that needed to cut costs and said fare hikes would be unavoidable since drivers of the state’s roads had just experienced another toll hike. Next, let’s look at college tuition. Christie cut funding for county colleges by 10 percent in 2010, a year that also saw record enrollment increases at the state’s two-year schools. Tuition increased an average of 4.4 percent. Also, 24 of New Jersey’s four-year colleges and universities raised tuition and fees in 2010 faster than the inflation rate, according to a Star-Ledger survey that year. Still, tuition generally increases annually at most schools. Finally, did Christie protect a tax cut for millionaires? Democrats approved a bill in May 2010 renewing a one-year tax rate increase of 10.75 percent for those with taxable income above $1 million. The rate had expired before Christie became governor. Christie, who campaigned that he wouldn’t raise taxes, vetoed the surcharge -- protecting the rich, some claim -- and Democrats couldn’t override it. "Plain and simple, Christie picks and chooses when and how to use his power – and on whose behalf," One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said in an e-mail. "He used his power to roll back a tax hike on millionaires, but chose not to use his power to roll back toll, tuition and fare increases that disproportionately hurt New Jersey’s middle-class and working families." Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts declined comment. Our ruling Part of an ad about Christie claims, "Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires." The ad is correct that tolls, train and bus fares, and college tuition increased on Christie’s watch but disregards that some of those increases resulted because the governor slashed funding in an effort to close budget gaps. As for protecting a tax cut for millionaires, we’ve heard this one before and we’ll point out again that Christie technically didn’t cut the millionaire’s tax since it expired before he took office. Still, opinions vary wildly on that claim. We rate this portion of the ad Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05202	"Minnesota has passed and Indiana has passed" right to work laws making union membership and dues optional	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/11/jeff-fitzgerald/rep-jeff-fitzgerald-says-minnesota-and-indiana-hav/	The prospect of a ban on workers having to join unions or pay dues has injected the debate over so-called "right to work" legislation into political campaigns across Wisconsin and the United States. It drew attention in Wisconsin after Gov. Scott Walker’s successful drive to sharply curtail collective bargaining for public employees raised the question of whether state Republicans might extend that to private-sector unions. Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, is a "right-to-work" supporter and helped Walker pass the public-union measure. If he wins a U.S. Senate seat in November 2012, he might have a chance to vote on national legislation banning compulsory dues payment. In May, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and Salon.com posted a video clip of Fitzgerald telling a Journal Sentinel reporter that Walker’s Act 10 union legislation was not surprising, given the GOP desire to balance the budget without tax increases. He added some Republicans wanted to go further than Walker. "I had people in my caucus who were wondering if we were going to do ‘right to work’ in this state," he said during the interview. "To tell you the truth the collective bargaining (measure), to me, I thought was more of a middle ground, if you can believe that." He added: "I had a number of people who thought (we should do) much like the states around us now -- Minnesota has passed and Indiana has passed ‘right to work’ states (laws)." Critics say such laws are anti-worker, while supporters said they attract businesses. "Right-to-work" laws are most common in southern and western states. But has "right-to-work" become a trend in nearby states? Let’s look at Fitzgerald’s statement on Minnesota and Indiana. The second one is easy: News reports trumpeted Indiana’s move to become the 23rd "right to work" state in January 2012. That move drew attention in Wisconsin because it was signed by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a national Republican figure whom Walker has cited as a role model. But did heavily unionized Minnesota follow suit and become just the second state since Oklahoma in 2001 to enact the law? "Right to work" legislation was debated in Minnesota in early 2012, at a time when Republicans there controlled both legislative houses. Instead of sending legislation to Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democratic Farmer Labor party member and right-to-work opponent, a group of conservative Republicans pushed a constitutional amendment to let voters decide. On March 12, 2012, just before Fitzgerald made his statement, a "right to work" bill promoting a constitutional amendment won approval in a Minnesota Senate committee, by a 7-6 vote amid labor protests. But that is far from final passage. Indeed, in a very short time, the Minnesota bill was on life support, and by May 2012 it was considered all but dead, according to various news accounts. The measure never emerged from a second committee, much less moved on to a full floor vote. A failed attempt in early May to attach right to work to the Vikings stadium legislation briefly brought the issue back into the public eye. The legislative session is over and the bill is history now, said state Sen. Dave Thompson, chief author of the bill. Thompson said he could introduce it in 2013 if Republicans keep control of the Minnesota Legislature in the fall 2012 elections. Bottom line: It’s clear from the history that Fitzgerald’s comment incorrectly lumped Minnesota in with Indiana. There is one notable nuance in the timing the comment. The Journal Sentinel interview was conducted March 21, 2012 but didn’t go public until May. It was for a Journal Sentinel documentary on the 2012 recall election, "The Choice", but the comment didn’t make it into the final version. Apparently, a Democratic Party tracker also filmed the interview as it was conducted after an appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club. So at the time, the Minnesota committee vote was fresh, and it was on Fitzgerald’s mind when he spoke, said Steve Stanek. But even that was not a final vote. And media reports on March 19, 2012 -- two days before Fitzgerald’s comments -- had GOP Senate Majority Leader Dave Senjem saying the votes aren’t there for the "right-to-work" amendment. Our rating Fitzgerald told a reporter that Minnesota and Indiana have "passed" "right-to-work" laws. He was on target regarding Indiana, but spoke prematurely about Wisconsin’s westerly neighbor. On balance, we rate Fitzgerald’s statement Half True.	None	Jeff Fitzgerald	None	None	None	2012-06-11T09:00:00	2012-03-21	['Indiana', 'Minnesota']
pomt-06986	"I sponsored and was the co-sponsor of the only legislation that ever passed that had E-Verify provisions in it back in 2010 when I served in the Legislature."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/12/adam-hasner/hasner-claimed-he-co-sponsored-only-e-verify-bill-/	In the first debate among Republicans running for the U.S. Senate in Florida, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner used a question about illegal immigration to highlight his legislative record while taking a not-so-subtle swipe at the record of current state Senate President Mike Haridopolos. The topic: E-Verify, a federal employment background check system. The Legislature failed to pass immigration reform during the 2011 session despite solid Republican majorities. And the Senate -- under Haridopolos' leadership -- voted down an amendment to an immigration bill that would have fined employers who hire illegal workers. (The amendment and the attached fines were crafted so that employers would choose to use the system rather than face a penalty.) That gave Hasner an opening during a June 30, 2011, debate hosted by the Florida Society of News Editors. "E-Verify is a very commonsense reform that we can implement here in the state of Florida," Hasner said. "I think I share a lot of Floridians' frustration that it didn't pass and a lot of the politics that were taking place behind the scenes. ... What's most important is to look back. ... some do, and some talk. I sponsored and was the co-sponsor of the only legislation that ever passed that had E-Verify provisions in it back in 2010 when I served in the Legislature. So I know that there's a will to pass these types of commonsense measures." For this fact-check, we're checking if Hasner is right to say he co-sponsored "the only legislation that ever passed that had E-Verify provisions." First, some background about the program. E-Verify is a federal database system that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to federal Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility. E-Verify grew out of a pilot program by the federal government and got its name in 2007 -- the same year that federal agencies were required to start using E-Verify. As of 2011, more than 270,000 employers use E-Verify. E-Verify in the Legislature During the 2010 legislative session, state Rep. Sandy Adams, an Oviedo Republican now in Congress, filed House Bill 219. The bill would have required state government contractors to participate in a program operated by the Department of Homeland Security that provides electronic verification of work authorization issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The staff analysis of the bill discusses Employment Eligibility Verification (EEV) -- that program was renamed E-Verify in 2007. The text of the bill itself use the term "E-Verify," but we sent the description of the federal work authorization program cited in the bill to Bill Wright, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and he said that the bill described E-Verify. Hasner was one of about 20 co-sponsors and voted in favor. It passed the House unanimously but never received a vote in the Senate and died. Floridians for Immigration Enforcement gave kudos to Hasner for his efforts to pass HB 219. The issue of E-Verify remained in the spotlight. During the 2010 campaign for governor, Rick Scott promised to require all Florida employers to use E-Verify. Scott issued an executive order his first day in office requiring state workers to be checked through the system, though most agencies already used the system. (The order also extended to state contractors.) That spins us ahead to the 2011 legislative session. On the opening day, Haridopolos stood before a crowd which was chanting "E-Verify! E-Verify!" on the Capitol steps in Tallahassee, and said, "I hear this word E-Verify," as listeners erupted in cheers. "I'm here to verify it will be a part of our Senate bill.'' The immigration bill, Senate Bill 2040 -- passed by the Senate 23-16 on May 4, 2011, three days before adjournment. It included a requirement that one-stop career center staff verify the employment eligibility of workers through E-Verify. Haridopolos voted in favor. It did not include, however, stronger E-Verify provisions that had been originally proposed and supported by Scott. The immigration bill then died in the House without coming to a vote. So not the bill many wanted. But a bill. With an E-Verify component. We asked Hasner adviser Rick Wilson why Hasner claimed to be the sponsor or co-sponsor of the "only" legislation with E-Verify in it when Senate Bill 2040 also included E-Verify. "It's not that he was the only -- that he was the first to pass something and pass it with a governor that was hostile to it and a Senate that was hostile to it," Wilson said. "In speeches it's always 'first' and not 'only.' He may have misspoken. ... We are not asserting that we are the only." Wilson also argued that Senate Bill 2040 was passed so late in the session that "it was too late for the House to take it up." We asked spokespersons for the House and Senate (Katie Betta, spokeswoman for GOP House Speaker Dean Cannon; Michelle DeMarco, press secretary for the Senate Democrats and Mark Hollis, press secretary for the House Democrats; and Brandi Young, legislative analyst for the Senate majority office) if they could find any other bill with E-Verify provisions that passed at least one chamber in 2010 or 2011. None could find any other bill. E-Verify amendment There's one other noteworthy thing we found. In a December 2009 special session, Democratic Rep. Janet Long filed an amendment to a passenger rail bill that required contractors bidding on rail projects to use E-Verify. Her amendment was withdrawn. Hasner filed two amendments of his own -- one striking the E-Verify language. The amendments were later withdrawn. But why would Hasner -- a champion of E-Verify -- file an amendment to get rid of an E-Verify requirement? Wilson told us that Hasner's amendment was a procedural move in response to Democrats -- that he had no intention to kill the implementation of E-Verify. Long's amendment adding E-Verify, "was a phony amendment intended to undermine anti-labor union amendments filed by Adam," Wilson said. "The fact is while Mike Haridopolos broke his promise on E-Verify, Adam co-sponsored E-Verify legislation and has been a consistent supporter of it." Interesting part of the record, all the same. Our ruling Hasner said Floridians shared his frustration that E-Verify didn't pass and that he "sponsored and was the co-sponsor of the only legislation that ever passed that had an E-Verify provision in it." Hasner was one of 20 co-sponsors of a bill that would have required state contractors to use E-Verify -- which passed the House but not the Senate. But in 2011, the Senate also voted for a limited provision that had E-Verify in it. Hasner's campaign says he could have misspoken and usually says that the bill he co-sponsored was the "first" and not the "only." We aren't ruling here on whether Hasner is a cheerleader for E-Verify; a group in favor of cracking down on illegal immigrants has praised Hasner's efforts to try to get E-Verify passed in 2010. What we are judging is Hasner's claim that his bill was the "only" one that "ever" passed that had E-Verify in it. We rate this claim False.

He said, "34 percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance." We interpret his statement as a reference to health insurance coverage -- not a claim that Hispanics are denied all health care -- and find it to be accurate. The January 2007 report Key Facts: Race, Ethnicity & Medical Care, published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, notes that 34 percent of Hispanics are without health insurance coverage. The report cites 2005 estimates by the Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The report also notes that of all racial/ethnic minority groups, Hispanics have "the highest percentage of uninsured, and the lowest percentage of people with employer coverage." The 2005 National Healthcare Disparities Report from the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality said that Hispanics have less access to health care than non-Hispanic whites and are more likely to receive poorer-quality care.

pomt-14662	"Today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/19/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-if-you-were-raised-poor-youre-just-/	The newly installed House speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., recently took to Medium to set the stage for a forum in Columbia, S.C., on Republican efforts to fight poverty. The forum, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, drew six 2016 Republican presidential candidates – former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired physician Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. In his Medium column, Ryan wrote that a new direction was needed on government anti-poverty efforts. "We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now," he wrote. "And I don’t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. I’m not saying we haven’t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty – that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves." Here, we’ll check Ryan’s statement that "today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago." When we asked Ryan’s staff for their evidence, they pointed us to an academic paper by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez and Nicholas Turner, "Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility" from January 2014. Chetty and Hendren are at Harvard, Kline and Saez are at the University of California-Berkeley, and Turner was with the U.S. Treasury Department. The paper, based on extensive analysis of income and educational-attainment data, found that "intergenerational mobility" has "remained extremely stable" since the generation of Americans born in 1971. "We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s," the authors wrote. When we asked one of the co-authors, Saez, whether Ryan’s summary left out anything important, he said no. "Yes, this is broadly correct," Saez told PolitiFact. Saez said the paper shows the odds of staying in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution when your parents were in the bottom one-fifth have stayed stable for the past four to five decades. The paper and Saez in the interview both noted one caveat – that the consequences of the pattern Ryan is citing have worse effects today because inequality has grown over the same period. "Because inequality has risen," the paper notes, "the consequences of the ‘birth lottery’ – the parents to whom a child is born – are larger today than in the past." However, this caveat doesn’t undermine Ryan’s point. If anything, it accentuates it. (We're also not penalizing Ryan for rounding up the study's length to 50 years.) Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, said the paper Ryan chose is a credible one within the profession. "These are the authors I would turn to" when looking at intergenerational mobility. Our ruling Ryan wrote that "today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago." His support for this claim – a respected academic paper published in 2014 – found exactly what Ryan described. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09024	"Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/07/bud-chiles/chiles-needs-schooling-education-rankings/	Bud Chiles has long been critical of Florida's public education system. He has bashed the Florida Legislature for directing insufficient dollars toward Florida schools and, most recently, launched the "Worst to First" initiative, a statewide effort publicizing Florida's low ranking in a variety of categories concerning children. It came as no surprise, then, when he made education a cornerstone of his independent gubernatorial campaign. "Too many of our children are failing in schools because Florida is failing our children... Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education," reads his campaign website. Florida's education reputation has never been stellar, but Chiles' dead-last claim seemed worth verifying. His campaign offered this clarification, "Florida is currently ranked 50th out of 50 states in per capita funding for K-12 public education and 39th in per-pupil funding." They directed us toward the U.S. Census Bureau's public education finance report and Education Week's "Quality Counts 2009," two respected rankings of the nation's public schools. What we found raised more questions than cafeteria mystery meat. The Education Week source earned Chiles a big "F", for false. It placed Florida 31st in its national ranking of school finance in its January 2010 report, not 50th. The rankings consider equitable distribution of school dollars and regional cost differences. Its results were based on 2007 spending levels. The report showed Florida was improving from previous years, when the state ranked 39th in 2009 and 38th in 2008. Education Week also ranked the states on simple per-student spending. In its 2010 report, Florida ranked 38th on that list. It was 41st in 2009, and 39th in 2008. "I’ve looked at the past three years reports, but Florida wasn’t ranked last in any of the school finance indicators during the period," said Hajime Mitani, a research analyst for the EPE Research Center, which conducts research for Education Week's annual rankings. But the Chiles campaign had done its homework when it came to the Census report. In per-pupil spending, Florida was below the national average in 39th place, according to the Census' most recent findings from June 2010, which looked at 2007-2008 spending. But when the Census looked at what states spent per every $1,000 of personal income, Florida dropped to 50th. In fact, Florida came in 50th in that same category in every report from 2010 through 2007. The state wasn't dead-last, however. The Census report includes Washington, D.C., in its ranking, so every time Florida finished 50th, it placed before the nation's capital. Still, Florida never ranked below 40th place in overall per-pupil spending during those years. We went back to the Chiles campaign, which then sent us toward the National Education Association, a teachers union. The union's December 2009 report ranked Florida 50th in per-capita state education expenses during the 2006-2007 school year. It also ranked Florida 50th in total state government education spending for every $1,000 of personal income during the 2006-2007 school year. But, as with the Census report, the report's findings weren't conclusive. Although the Chiles campaign highlighted the findings having to do exclusively with state spending, the union's report also determined: Florida ranked 41st in per-student spending based on K-12 fall enrollment during the 2008-2009 school year. Florida ranked 47th in per-capita state and local government education spending during the 2006-2007 school year. Florida ranked 6th in per-capita state and local government K-12 school capital spending during the 2006-2007 school year. Finally, the union's report offered this caveat: "Of course, no set of tables tells the entire story of a state’s education offerings. Consideration of factors such as a state’s tax system, provisions for other public services, and population characteristics also are needed. Therefore, it is unwise to draw conclusions based solely on individual statistics in this report." That Chiles directed us toward three education reports that didn't fully support his claim is also telling: Depending on how the numbers are massaged, Florida's spending record can vary widely. "If you are comparing states, everything is relative," said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. "Like with anything, your outcome depends on how you define the process. So you can use different factors and come out with different results." Other education experts cautioned against putting too much faith in the various rankings, which often compare distinct state education budgets. For example, one state might include construction costs toward its total education dollars, but Florida does not. Critics also warn that demographic and geographic differences render the rankings moot. "Unless everybody is doing the same thing, it is not really fair," said Cheryl Etters, a Florida Department of Education spokesman. Consider that the National Center for Education Statistics, another highly regarded education group, determined Florida spent $9,084 per pupil during the 2007-2008 school year in its most recent May 2010 report. New Jersey spent the most, at $17,620. Utah spent the least, at $5,978. Using these numbers, Florida would place 35th in spending. But the center did not rank the states according to these findings. Instead, states were listed in alphabetical order. "We never rank. We list it alpha. In many ways, it’s not really fair to compare Florida to Nebraska," said Tracy Dell'Angela, communications director for the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the National Center for Education Statistics. Chiles himself questioned the authenticity of such rankings when Education Week placed Florida 10th in overall quality of education in 2009. "It's bunk, it's just wrong to say that we're 10th in education or to say we're progressing nationally," Chiles told the Miami Herald in August 2009. "It's just clearly not true." Now, let's revisit what Chiles said on his campaign website: "Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education." We think that statement deserves red marks on several grounds. His campaign cited two outdated reports. The Census data's most recent report was based on 2007-2008 school year spending. The union's ranking was from the previous school year. That doesn't count as "today" in our book. What's more, these reports and various others put Florida's spending record all over the map. It is true that the Florida Legislature has not made any gains in public school spending in recent years because of the stalled economy. This year, overall per-student funding increased from $6,842.29 to $6,843.51, or $1.22 per student, but the state got there by asking local governments to contribute more. There's no way to know whether that's enough to change any of these rankings, no matter which measurement is used. So no gold star here. We give this a Half True.

pomt-05964	Rob Cornilles supports privatizing Medicare.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/rob-cornilles-supports-privatizing-medicare/	Turning Medicare over to profit-minded insurance companies hasn’t been too popular an idea with seniors, or soon-to-be seniors, who want to make sure the government health care program is around for them when they need it most. So it’s no wonder that Democrats here and nationally are claiming that Republican Rob Cornilles, in the 1st Congressional District special election, wants to privatize Medicare. He faces Democrat Suzanne Bonamici in the Jan. 31 election. Democrats’ statements have ranged from the specific to the general. Here’s an example: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tweeted Jan. 10, "Did you know Cornilles said he'd support turning parts of Medicare over to private insurance companies?" The committee’s first ad against Cornilles showed these words on screen -- "Turning over Medicare to private insurance companies" -- while the announcer says that Cornilles supports "Turning over some of Medicare to private insurance companies." And finally, a Jan. 18 press statement from the Bonamici campaign includes a quote from the Oregon State Council for Retired Citizens PAC: "To set the record straight: Suzanne Bonamici is the only candidate in this election that Oregon seniors can count on to stand up for them in Congress and to protect – not privatize – Medicare and Social Security." See? For the record, Cornilles denies he wants to privatize Medicare. Also, he does not support a system where the government would give seniors "voucher" money to get health insurance on their own a la the 2011 plan from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,which was essentially a privatization plan. What Cornilles has said is that he supports the new Medicare reform plan that Ryan has with Oregon’s Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, which calls for more private competition. Earlier, Cornilles also said that he supports a "hybrid" approach of both traditional Medicare and a private option. But is that fair to call it outright privatization? And is offering a private option the same thing as turning over part of Medicare to private insurance companies? Let’s not forget that Medicare currently contains a private option: It’s called Medicare Advantage. Seniors can buy plans from private insurers that wrap prescription, hospital and doctor coverage into one tidy package. Traditional Medicare, on the other hand, is a fee-for-services plan. There are many reasons seniors may opt for one or the other, says Joe Baker, president of the nonpartisan advocacy Medicare Rights Center. In Oregon, about 40 percent of seniors have Medicare Advantage. So if current Medicare already has a private option -- or is partially privatized -- what’s the big deal with what Cornilles has said? Well, he likes the proposal put forth by Ryan and Wyden. Bonamici and other Democrats do not. And there seems to be some genuine debate over whether the proposal moves toward privatization. "Basically, the Wyden-Ryan proposal would significantly privatize the Medicare program; it would retain the original government-run Medicare program as a plan you would choose, but that doesn’t mean that’s not privatizing Medicare," said Baker of the Medicare Rights Center. "It would turn Medicare into a voucher-like program and move it away from a defined benefit (system) to defined contribution (system)." Max Richtman is president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, whose political action committee has endorsed Bonamici. He agrees with Baker that the Wyden-Ryan plan does not preserve traditional Medicare, because it offers vouchers for seniors to buy health care insurance, including traditional Medicare. The value of the vouchers would be capped, leaving seniors to shoulder the costs of any health care costs that outpace inflation, he said. But Jennifer Hoelzer, Wyden’s press secretary, strenuously disputes the privatization assertion. The proposal calls for a new system, sometime in the future, where private insurers would submit health plans with monthly premiums for review to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The amount of money seniors would receive in "premium support" to pay for Medicare plans would be based on the second-cheapest plan or traditional Medicare, whichever is less expensive. Should seniors pick a cheaper plan, they’d get to keep the difference, Hoelzer said. Should they pick a pricier plan, they would pay out of pocket as they do now. Any legislation would retain strict controls over what private insurers can offer and traditional Medicare would be guaranteed one of the choices, she said. We’ve digressed a bit but understanding the plan is important since so many people see it as a sign of Cornilles’ support of privatization. Steve Weiss, president of the Oregon State Council for Retired Citizens PAC, acknowledges that Medicare Advantage is "partial privatization, but I think that Cornilles has upped the ante in that with his support of the Wyden-Ryan plan." In the debate over the Wyden-Ryan plan, we see increased private options for Medicare, a program that already includes private options. We do not see the proposal as removing the government from providing Medicare. Democrats assert that Cornilles wants to privatize Medicare -- all or part of it -- and turn it over to insurance companies while Bonamici wants to protect it. Nowhere has Cornilles said that he wants to privatize Medicare, and he has rejected a plan that calls for vouchers. The statement contains a nugget of truth: Cornilles certainly wants more private competition in Medicare and it’s probably fair to say that he’s more enthusiastic than Bonamici about introducing even more private elements into Medicare. But that doesn’t mean he wants to privatize Medicare. And his encouraging private competition doesn’t change the fact that Medicare currently has a private option. Those two factors are what we call critical facts that would give a different impression. We rule the statement Mostly False. Go back to OregonLive to comment.

pomt-00379	Says Texas has "had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/sep/07/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-draws-debunked-figures-says-illegals-co/	Republican Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general seeking a second term against Democrat Justin Nelson, invoked previously debunked numbers when he was asked about Democrats seeking to decriminalize border crossings. Paxton, in an Aug. 26, 2018, appearance on "Fox & Friends," called decriminalizing crossings "a little scary," telling the host: "Obviously, you know we’re a border state. We are struggling with protecting our border, protecting our people. To have a policy like this that takes away criminalizing crossing the border, you’re basically opening up your borders. "And the reality is we already struggle with this," Paxton went on. "We’ve had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides. We've had human trafficking. We've had all kinds of drug crimes. And if we make it more lenient, we’re going to get more of it. So, it’s going to cost lives if we go down this path," Paxton said. An Aug. 23, 2018, Huffington Post news story quoted Texas’ Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Lupe Valdez, and a Democratic U.S. House nominee, Veronica Escobar of El Paso, speaking favorably about no longer charging border crossers with criminal violations. The story quoted Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, specifying that people seeking asylum at the border shouldn’t be charged with criminal violations. We can’t check a prediction about what happens if fewer people crossing the border get charged with crimes. But the big crime counts aired by Paxton reminded us we’ve long found flaws in citations of counts of crimes and homicides attributed to information publicized by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead state agency tasked with helping keep watch over the Texas-Mexico border. Let’s plumb our relevant past fact-checks before reviewing the meat of Paxton’s statement. Rick Perry's flammable 2014 claim In July 2014, Gov. Rick Perry warned about the security of the Texas-Mexico border by declaring that more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by "illegal aliens" in six years. Pants on Fire, we ruled, in that Perry had misrepresented figures on a DPS web page that could be read, at worst, to indicate that in their lifetimes, an unspecified subset of 203,685 "criminal alien defendants" booked into Texas jails over the nearly six years through June 2014 had been charged with--not convicted of committing--3,070 homicides. We identified other complications that, it turned out, also weakened a pair of subsequent claims we checked that were based on DPS-posted numbers. To begin with, the term "criminal aliens" is generally used by law enforcement to identify noncitizens residing in the U.S. who are convicted of a crime--and such individuals include people living here legally or without legal authorization. Also, Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said the DPS information didn’t even demonstrate the homicides occurred any time recently or in any particular state. Meantime, Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, Jr. built his own analysis of Texas crime numbers and told us that if Perry’s claim held up, it would mean that more than half the state’s homicides in the six years were committed by unauthorized residents--an absurdity. "It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed," Martinez commented. Two 2018 immigrant-crime claims Early this year, we replowed DPS-posted numbers before rating Pants on Fire Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s statement that "566,000 crimes" had been "made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last six years." At the time, the DPS said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions had been accumulated by more than 240,000 "criminal aliens" booked into Texas jails in the latest six-plus years--as before, we confirmed, the charges had been amassed through their "criminal careers." We’ve posted the charts offered as factual back-up by Perry and Patrick, respectively, here. In March 2018, most recently, we rated False a claim by Sean Hannity of Fox News that 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period. We found that Hannity’s claim, triggered by DPS-posted figures, reflected on mostly petty charges leveled through the lifetimes of 245,000 "criminal aliens" booked into local Texas jails from June 2011 through February 2018--and 34 percent of them weren’t identified as living in the U.S. without legal authorization at their latest arrest, the DPS said. Generally, nonviolent offenses predominated, accounting for 66 percent of the tallied charges and 55 percent of career convictions. Martinez looked over these DPS-posted numbers, later saying that to his eyes, they reflected what’s known about most domestic crime--a "sea of minor drug and property crimes." Paxton points to DPS figures In May 2018, we emailed a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, seeking to learn more about data fueling the DPS’s evolving posts about immigrants and crime. Two months later, Vinger responded by pointing out a substantially revised version of the web page. Vinger later told us by email that the revised web page "only refers to charges and convictions for criminal aliens who were in the country illegally. Past versions," Vinger wrote, presented higher counts by showing "charges and convictions for all criminal aliens – legal and illegal." Another change: Vinger said the previous web page tallied crimes for each jailed individual’s criminal "career" while the new version, he wrote, shows charges and convictions occurring since June 2011. When we requested Paxton’s backup information, a spokeswoman for his state office, Kayleigh Lovvorn, said by email that Paxton’s numbers came from the same DPS web page, "Texas Criminal Illegal Alien Data." However, we didn’t spot information on the revised web page supporting Paxton’s reference to "illegals" committing over 600,000 crimes and more than 1,200 homicides since 2011. The newly available figures linked far fewer offenses, including homicides, to unauthorized residents. According to U.S. Department of Homeland Security "status indicators," the DPS reported, "over 261,000 criminal aliens were booked into Texas jails between June 1, 2011, and July 31, 2018, of which over 175,000 were classified as illegal aliens." In the same period, DPS says, "these 175,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 273,000 criminal offenses and which included arrests for 505 homicide" charges. All those criminal charges, the DPS says, "have thus far resulted in over 114,000 convictions including 229 homicide convictions; 12,801 assault convictions; 3,016 burglary convictions; 17,002 drug convictions; 159 kidnapping convictions; 6,820 theft convictions; 10,846 obstructing police convictions; 962 robbery convictions; 1,596 sexual assault convictions; 1,087 sexual offense convictions; and 1,215 weapon convictions." According to the web page, Homeland Security separately identified another 10,182 "illegal aliens," all imprisoned in Texas, who together had been charged with more than 6,000 criminal offenses included 83 homicide charges. We combined the two sets of counts--a move supporting the conclusion that, per the DPS, more than 185,000 individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission were jailed in Texas over the seven-plus years who all told accounted for more than 279,000 criminal charges and over 114,000 convictions including 589 homicide charges and 229 homicide convictions--on all fronts, considerably shy of what Paxton said. Cato perspective We also ran Paxton’s statement past Cato Institute analyst Alex Nowrasteh, who authored a February 2018 study of crimes committed by immigrants in Texas. Nowrasteh said by email that in 2016, according to DPS data he said he obtained through a public information request, 16,277 illegal immigrants were convicted of a crime in Texas, accounting for 4 percent of Texas residents convicted of a crime at a time that illegal immigrants accounted for 6 percent of the state’s residents, according to U.S. Census Bureau research. Put another way, Nowrasteh said by email, the "most crime-prone group in Texas were American natives." Our ruling Paxton said Texas has "had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides." Both of these numbers--which we’ve twice debunked in detail since 2010--exceed what the state estimates by more than 400 percent. DPS-posted figures lately suggest that since mid-2011, Texas-jailed individuals believed to be living in the U.S. without legal permission account for 229 homicide convictions among more than 114,000 convictions across a range of mostly minor offenses.

pomt-00566	"In Florida, for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/11/jeb-bush/Jeb-Bush-says-he-cut-Florida-taxes-by-19-billion/	Jeb Bush keeps promoting his record during the runup to announcing his presidential campaign, telling a crowd at a Republican event he cut taxes as Florida’s governor. "In Florida, for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion, creating a much better business climate," Bush told the crowd at Gov. Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Orlando on June 2, 2015. Florida’s budget went from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion during Bush’s tenure, thanks in part to an influx of some 3.5 million people. The state also pocketed $10 billion in cash reserves and won a top bond rating. But was he able to help cut taxes by $19 billion at the same time? We cracked open the state’s books to take a look for ourselves. Projecting a point of view Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee told us they came up with the figure (actually $19.3 billion) using data from Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. This figure has been cited often by both politicians and the media, but the details are where things get tricky. Without putting you to sleep with nitpicking of revenue projections, this is what Right To Rise did: Using an annual state report called the Fiscal Analysis in Brief, the PAC tallied the total of all revenue changes from legislative changes in each year between the 1999-2000 and 2007-08 fiscal years. Here’s where we come to our first round of caveats. Economic experts told us those revenue changes aren’t all necessarily tax cuts. Each year includes dozens, if not hundreds of different legislative actions, ranging from fee and license changes to sales tax holidays and lottery proceeds. Those aren’t all what we’d consider tax cuts, they’re just changes in how much the state collected. It’s also a good thing Bush used the term "we," because the revenue changes resulted from action by the Legislature. Bush’s influence and his line-item veto power did come into play, but he can’t take credit for all of these measures. He has said, "I cut taxes to the tune of $19 billion" before, though. Right to Rise added up those cumulative revenue changes for each year and developed a formula to estimate how much state revenues have been affected since. Our experts told us that’s acceptable, but it makes things more complicated. It means, for example, that if taxes were cut in 1999, Right to Rise counted those revenue changes for each subsequent year through 2007. By the end of Bush’s term, we’re looking at eight years of cumulative tax savings. If you really want to read the fine print, you can see the PAC’s estimates here. The nominal dollars saved using those projections totaled more than $17.6 billion, but the PAC adjusted the estimate into 2007 dollars. That leaves us with the $19.3 billion estimate. Economists told us while it was fine to adjust the projections for inflation, there are limitations to that estimate. That’s mostly because analysts don’t really know what would happen to any given revenue source in the real world. "I think it’s kind of tough to make this kind of analysis, because the economic impact is listed, but would change as the economy changed," Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, told us. "They’re basically looking at a point in time, going back and revisiting it." Two big specifics If you’re still with us at this depth of wonkishness, there’s more to consider. A big chunk of the $19.3 billion in projected tax savings came from the 2001 law to phase out the federal estate tax, which was backed in Washington by Bush’s brother, then-President George W. Bush. The state essentially received a share of this federal tax, but lost that money when the phase-out was complete. According to the PAC’s projections, by the 2007-08 fiscal year that loss of estate tax money cost Florida about $848 million per year. Sources told PolitiFact that it’s not really right for Jeb Bush to take credit for the federal repeal, because the state didn’t do anything. "It’s not like anyone in Florida got rid of it," Francis said. "The federal government got rid of it." Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said Bush supported the repeal of the tax as governor, and didn’t push to replace it with a state tax. Several states did enact their own tax to make up for the lost revenue. One review by economist Martin Sullivan, writing for tax news publisher Tax Analysts, omitted the estate tax in his report because it didn’t require legislative action to go into effect. His analysis, which wasn’t adjusted for inflation, tallied the total of Bush-era tax cuts over those eight years at about $13 billion. Of note is where the biggest chunk of Bush’s claimed tax savings came from: A change in the amount the state taxed intangible assets, like stocks, bonds and accounts receivable. Florida made about $600 million per year from the tax, a fair sum for a state with no income tax. Bush pushed hard to trim the tax in 1999 and 2000. He finally succeeded repealing the tax entirely in 2006. Francis said that point gets lost when people use a big number like $19 billion. "When you’re looking at the intangibles tax, what were the benefits of that?" Francis said. "Was any of it good for the average person?" Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, which supported ending the tax, pointed out that removing it benefitted people with lower incomes and assets for years, because the exemption was gradually increased before the tax was repealed entirely. "People considered it a benefit for the rich because the income limits were so high at the end," Wenner said. "Really, just about anyone who had any amount saved up saw a benefit." Sullivan’s analysis provided one answer most people can probably wrap their heads around. He concluded the real Bush-era tax savings by 2006 ended up being about $140 per person, per year. Our ruling Bush said "for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion." He was citing a projection from his Right To Rise PAC that measured cumulative revenue changes from 1999 to 2007. The total of $19.3 billion is adjusted into 2007 dollars. The analysis includes the federal repeal of the estate tax, for which economists told us Bush couldn’t really take credit. It also includes a big cut to the state’s intangibles tax, which may not benefit your average person much. Experts said there are limits to how economists can estimate the impact of legislative actions, but the PAC’s projections could be considered fair. What’s trickier is whether Bush can take credit for all the revenue changes or even call them all tax cuts. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04752	"President Obama is attacking Paul Ryan on Medicare even though it is his administration with the help of Jim Langevin who cut $716 billion from Medicare."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/29/michael-riley/ri-congressional-candidate-michael-riley-says-pres/	It’s a big number: $716 billion. And it has become one of the most ubiquitous -- and contested -- figures tossed around in this presidential campaign as debate swirls over the future of Medicare, the federal health care program for seniors. Democrats say the $716 billion represents anticipated savings in Medicare spending over the next decade, thanks to President Obama’s new health care law which, among other things, reduces Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and other providers. Republicans from Mitt Romney on down say the $716 billion is what President Obama cut from the Medicare trust fund to pay for other reforms in the President’s Affordable Care Act. That’s where Rhode Island Republican Michael Riley, hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin in Rhode Island’s 2nd District, comes in. (Langevin voted for the health care overhaul.) Riley, who runs an investment advisory business, grabbed hold of some national GOP talking points when he posted this on his Facebook page this month: "President Obama is attacking Paul Ryan on Medicare even though it is his administration with the help of Jim Langevin who cut 716 Billion from Medicare." PolitiFact National has on two previous occasions analyzed similar statements made by Romney and ruled them Half True or Mostly False depending on the wording of the claim. Other fact-checking organizations have come to similar conclusions. Here’s why. Whether the verb used is "cut" or "robbed" -- Republicans have used both -- the statement would suggest to most people that Medicare benefits are in play. While Obama indeed directed $716 billion away from future Medicare spending, the money will be used primarily to provide coverage for the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats insist the move does not translate into reductions in benefits for millions of the elderly. What’s being cut, they argue, is the rate of Medicare growth by, among other steps, reducing the reimbursements paid to health care providers and insurers. (Those providers and insurers went along with the lower reimbursement idea when the health care overhaul was being discussed in exchange for the likelihood of more customers under the law’s mandatory insurance provision.) Democrats also point out that Romney’s vice presidential nominee, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, assumes the same savings in his budget proposals. But Republicans say Democrats are missing a critical point: if providers and insurers face lower reimbursements for Medicare patients, they might start refusing to participate in Medicare. And that would limit the elderly’s access to Medicare. A recent report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, raised that same point: "The question is whether reductions in payments to health care providers will impair either access to health care services or the quality of those services. While there are some indications that providers are beginning to pull back from the program and that waiting periods for care may be increasing in some jurisdictions, it is too early to know for sure." The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that estimates the impact of proposed laws, has said that if Congress overturns the Affordable Care Act now, spending for Medicare would increase about $716 billion between next year and 2022. In an interview, Riley wouldn’t say whether he was talking about benefits being curtailed when he said President Obama "cut" Medicare by $716 billion. "My meaning is it’s money that would [otherwise] go into Medicare," which he described as a pool of money. "The truth is it’s too early to know." Our ruling Congressional candidate Michael Riley says that with the help of U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, President Obama "cut $716 billion from Medicare." Mr. Obama did direct $716 billion away from future Medicare spending as part of his health care reform law. But calling it a cut leaves the impression that the $716 billion is being taken from money already allocated. That’s not the case. The debate, however, continues over whether benefits are in jeopardy. In the meantime, the Congressional Budget Office says the move eases the burden of Medicare’s current deficit. Because the statement is "partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rate it Half True.

pomt-01801	When the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were "skyrocketing."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jul/23/club-growth/club-growth-says-nh-gas-tax-enacted-when-prices-we/	New Hampshire voters are famously unenthusiastic about tax hikes, so it’s no surprise that the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group, is making hay of the state’s recent gasoline tax hike in an ad that’s intended to bolster a Republican congressional candidate. The ad -- part of what the group is calling a "six-figure" television buy -- aims to "thank" GOP state Rep. Marilinda Garcia for opposing higher taxes and spending in the Legislature. Garcia is running in the Sept. 9 Republican primary for a U.S. House race. The 2nd district seat, representing the western half of the state, is currently held by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster. Here’s the ad’s narration: "Across New Hampshire, taxes are going up, and families are hurting. With gas prices skyrocketing, the Legislature raised our gas tax. State budgets are growing by hundreds of millions. What’s next, an income tax? One representative has taken the lead to say no -- Marilinda Garcia. She knows government has gotten too big. Conservative Marilinda Garcia is fighting for more freedom and less government. Thank Marilinda for opposing higher taxes and spending." When we looked into it, we found that the Club for Growth’s claim that prices were "skyrocketing" isn’t supported by the data. A little background: Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan signed the tax increase into law on May 20, 2014, after the Democratic-controlled state House and the Republican-controlled state Senate passed the measure. It added 4.2 cents in tax to each gallon of gasoline sold, effective July 1, 2014. The proceeds -- an estimated $32 million annually -- are to be spent on road and infrastructure projects, including the widening of Interstate 93. The tax hike marks the first time the state has raised the gas tax since 1991. The bill that became the gas tax hike was introduced in the state Senate on Jan. 8, 2014. (It was introduced in the House later.) So we looked at how the state’s gasoline prices moved between Jan. 8 and May 20, when Hassan signed the measure. According to gasbuddy.com, a website that tracks gasoline prices in a wide range of states and cities, New Hampshire gasoline prices were $3.42 around Jan. 8 and rose to $3.61 around May 20. That’s an increase of 6 percent -- rising, but not exactly "skyrocketing." And gas prices haven't skyrocketed since Hassan signed the bill, either. Between the bill signing and the effective date of the increase, gas prices in New Hampshire rose from $3.61 to $3.68. Then, since July 1 they've fallen, from $3.68 to $3.55. If you take an even longer view, the term "skyrocketing" becomes even less apt. For a significant portion of the previous three years, gas prices were higher than they were when the bill was signed on May 20, 2014, peaking at $3.91 in September 2012. Smaller spikes, each higher than $3.69 a gallon, occurred in July 2011, April 2012, February 2013 and July 2013. The same general pattern holds region-wide. Data from the federal Energy Information Administration shows that gas prices in New England as a whole rose from $3.63 when the bill was introduced to $3.80 when it was signed -- an increase of 5 percent, or well short of "skyrocketing." According to the American Automobile Association, seeing a rise in gas prices on this scale is typical for the period from January to May. Gas prices usually are cheapest in the winter because people drive less, reducing gasoline demand. Prices generally rise through the spring, when refineries conduct maintenance between peak demand for heating oil in the winter and gasoline in the summer, among other reasons. "It can be a shock to see prices rise significantly in the springtime, and no one wants to pay more for the same product," said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA’s national office. "With that in mind, it is understandable why consumers might feel that gas prices are skyrocketing at times." But Green said it’s important to keep some context in mind. "Every year, someone could say that gas prices are ‘skyrocketing’ by comparing Jan. 1 to May 20," he said. "But that comparison would only tell a small part of the story." The rest of the story is that gasoline prices have actually been coming down modestly in recent years, Green said. In New Hampshire, the average price of gas on May 20, 2014, was lower than it was on that date in 2011 ($3.90) and 2012 ($3.70) and was only a little higher than it was on that date in 2013 ($3.46), Green said. "The most important trend we see is that gas prices are a little less expensive than in recent years due to the recent boom in North American crude oil production," he said. "Consumers are not saving huge amounts of money, but prices absolutely are not ‘skyrocketing’ higher when compared to previous years." For what it’s worth, a July 2014 survey by the University of New Hampshire found that, as a whole, New Hampshire voters support the gas tax increase. In all, 52 percent said they favor it, compared to 40 percent who said they opposed it. Unlike Democrats and independents, Republicans -- the direct target of the ad, since Garcia must win the GOP primary -- narrowly opposed the hike (43 percent in favor, 47 percent against). Self-described conservatives were the most negative about it (36 percent in favor, 60 percent opposed). The Club for Growth did not return an inquiry for this article. Our ruling The Club for Growth ad said the New Hampshire legislature raised the gasoline tax at a time when gas prices in the state were "skyrocketing." Gas prices in New Hampshire rose modestly -- about 5 percent -- between the bill’s introduction and its signing, mostly, experts say, because of cyclical increases related to refinery maintenance and other reasons. Not only is that short of "skyrocketing," but the price of gasoline at the time the bill was signed was actually lower than it had been at multiple points over the previous three years. We rate the claim False.	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2014-07-23T17:50:07	2014-07-21	['None']
pomt-03865	"There have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/11/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-hundreds-tax-preferences-and-/	The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and Rob Portman’s interest is in the latter. The first-term Ohio U.S. senator is, after all, a former budget director in President George W. Bush’s cabinet, and tax reform is one of his foremost goals. Just which tax rates and preferences need reforming is a political judgment. But the scope of the challenge caught our attention when Portman told the Fox Business Networkon Feb. 20: "There have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this." That’s a lot of new references and loopholes, and we were curious about the number. So we asked Portman’s press secretary, Caitlin Dunn, who sent us two sources to support the senator’s claim. First was an August 2010 report to the White House by President Barack Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which laid out a menu of optionsfor simplification and better compliance within the tax system. The board included leaders in economics, business and labor and was chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Like Portman, this committee cited 1986 as a baseline, because that was the last time Congress overhauled the nation’s tax code. Among the committee’s observations: "The tax code has become more complex and more unstable over the last two decades, in part because legislators have increasingly used targeted tax provisions to achieve social policy objectives normally achieved by spending programs. There have been more than 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, and a current JCT (Joint Committee on Taxation) pamphlet lists 42 pages of expiring provisions." That 15,000 figure was also in the second source that Dunn sent us: a statement from a 2010 Senate hearing, by Sen.Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, "We have made 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, but many of these changes have stretched the code in different directions." If you read these statements closely, you’ll notice that they don’t say exactly the same thing as Portman said. These statements talk about thousands of changes -- but a change can mean many things, including revocation of tax breaks, new rates, a reinterpretation of a rule or even a technical correction, according to a number of budget experts with whom we spoke. Affirming this was Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and the staff director of the President’s Economic Advisory Board in 2010 -- that is, the Volcker committee whose report was cited as a source by Portman’s office for the 15,000 "changes" in the tax code. "Definitely those are not all loopholes," Goolsbee told us in an email. "That would include every change to the code." So how many of them were new loopholes or preferences? We called Tax Analysts, a Northern Virginia publisher of in-depth analyses of tax law, and asked Martin Sullivan, the chief economist. Sullivan used to work for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. He was somewhat skeptical of broad claims on numbers in these matters. For example, if an existing law is changed and it results in a single section being split into a dozen or more parts -- but with provisions that already existed -- do you count that as a dozen new provisions? He recalled counting the changes in a single tax law in 1997 -- 400 of them, he says. He says many of them resulted in tax cuts. But that does not mean they were all loopholes or special provisions. Four-hundred new loopholes in a single year would, in fact, be eye-popping. Continuing our quest for a number, we turned to congressional testimony from hearings on the need for tax reform, and found the prepared text for a March, 2011 Senate hearing by Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who co-heads the tax group at the Washington law firm Skadden Arps. Goldberg is a former IRS commissioner, former IRS chief counsel, and former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy. In his written statement, he referred to the "endless stream" of bills that followed the 1986 tax reform, and the "mind-numbing complexity" of the tax code that only grew worse. In other words, tax preferences grew. But this still did not give us a number. So we talked with Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute and its Tax Policy Center. A former deputy assistant director for tax policy at the Congressional Budget Office, Williams said there has definitely been an expansion of the tax code, in many cases promoting policy makers’ social and economic goals such as education (with tax credits), work (the earned income tax credit), retirement security (individuual retirement account changes) and so on. Stir in corporate tax provisions and the number adds up. Does it add up to hundreds? "I certainly haven’t counted," Williams said. As we continued down this road, the question took on the characteristics of a puzzle, if not a chase down a rabbit hole. Portman’s claim rang true, but no one had a precise way of measuring the number. Several experts, however, introduced us to the closest thing: The annual lists of "tax expenditures" published by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and, separately, the White House in its annual budget documents. A tax expenditure is a tax break, credit, deduction, exclusion or exemption granted for a specific purpose -- to spur energy production or education or employment, for example, or to exempt interest on certain construction bonds from taxes, or to provide special depreciation allowances for ethanol production plants. Some people call these loopholes, although every one of them is allowed for in the tax code, and they certainly qualify under Portman’s characterization of "tax preferences." This gave us a benchmark. And in 2006, the Congressional Research Service, or CRS, said in a report that there were 133 of these tax expenditures as of 1987, the year following tax reform. The CRS prepares research reports to help lawmakers understand the history and background of particular issues. Have tax expenditures, or special provisions, grown by the hundreds since then? Not if you use the number on a CRS report last March 22, which said that there were now "over 200" separate tax expenditures. And that figure of "over 200" differed with one the White House used, compiled by the Treasury Department for inclusion in President Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2013 budget request. That document listed, item by item, 188 -- everything from expensing of certain small business investments to income averaging for farmers. Providing us with a slightly different number was Leonard Burman, a professor and economist at Syracuse University and former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax analysis. Burman sent us a chart based on information from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It showed there were 202 tax expenditures in 2007. Since there were 133 right after tax reform, that would not suggest growth by the hundreds. Burman concluded that Portman was "exaggerating a bit," but he added that Portman’s "basic point was right -- there has been a proliferation of tax preferences." It was beginning to look as if Portman might be wrong. But in all these discussions was a caveat: The lists of tax expenditures are incomplete and imperfect. We’ve noted already that the White House lists and joint tax committee lists don’t align, for various technical and interpretive reasons. But more importantly, the lists are nothing more than reports of tax breaks in effect at a given point in time. If a provision is changed but its structure remains the same or similar, it may not get counted as a new tax expenditure, even though the change could benefit someone new or restrict someone else. Such problems were pointed out to us by Alex Brill, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Brill served as an adviser on Obama’s fiscal commission in 2010, and was an economist for President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2001 and 2002. More pertinent for today’s purposes, he was policy director and chief economist on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee -- the committee that writes the tax laws -- -- from 2002 to 2007. Brill told us, "There is no single, absolute, universal means with which to count." Brill sent us the prepared testimony from September 22, 2011, of Thomas A. Barthold, chief of staff the Joint Committee on Taxation, before the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. In his prepared remarks, Barthold included a graph of tax expenditures. It showed that in 1986, there were about 130 of them. The number had hit 250 by 2009, dropping slightly in 2010. These were only tax expenditures that had a cumulative value of $50 million or more. But Barthold provided the committee with something better: a list of tax expenditures that have been added to the tax code since the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We counted them and got 157 -- still not in the hundreds when measuring expansion or changes. Brill, however, found a number of things missing from that list. For example, the new medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its exclusion of certain items was not listed, nor was a drug tax from the same bill, even though it excludes certain drugs -- a provision that could be considered a preference. Brill said he found at least four examples from health reform, "and there are more from just that bill if you dig deeper." Also missing from the list, he noticed, was the frequently criticized NASCAR tax break, a provision from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that allowed for accelerated depreciation of race tracks. That bill alone had "tons of provisions" that amounted to narrow tax breaks, Brill said. We counted the breaks in that bill, using a Joint Committee on Taxation document listing the effects of each new provision on tax revenue in the 2004 act. We came up with 179. So Portman, after all of this, appears to be correct: There have been "literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this." Exactly how many, no one knows. We even asked Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor, president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and President Ronald Reagan’s chief economic adviser from 1982 through 1984. Feldstein’s name came up during conversations with others, partly because he, too, was on the Volcker committee whose 15,000 figure was cited by Portman’s office. When we asked by email about those 15,000 changes and whether they included more than loopholes and preferences, Feldstein replied, "I’m sorry but I don’t know. I believe that many were added in the Clinton administration as a way of achieving increased government spending through the tax code." That may seem a bit political, but economists see tax expenditures just as Feldstein described: a way of achieving a goal without direct spending. They cost the government, regardless. We are still without a precise count of the number of loopholes and preferences added after the 1986 tax reform. Brill, however, took a stab at it, telling us, "Certainly it less than 15,000," but well more than the other numbers mentioned here. Initially, he guessed it might be 300, but after looking at just a couple of tax-related bills he concluded that "I think its far, far more than that." So we were able to find enough documentation to prove it, even though Portman used an educated guess, not a hard figure. We rate his statement True.

pomt-14710	"Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/03/dan-patrick/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-claims-states-where-peopl/	President Barack Obama may be considering executive action on gun sales in his final year in the White House, but Texas’ lieutenant governor says his state shows why the country needs less gun control, not more. Texas became the 45th state to allow concealed-carry permit holders to openly tote their firearms on Jan. 1. Concealed carry has been allowed in the state since the 1990s with basically "zero problems," Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said on NBC’s Meet the Press. "Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less," Patrick said Jan. 3. "There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent. Murders are down. Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing." Is it true that states with concealed carry have seen a 25 percent decline in crime? The evidence for such a sweeping statement, we found, is lacking. Correlation, not causation Patrick’s statement reminded us of a very similar claim by Florida state Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who said, "In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower." Gaetz crunched the numbers himself, comparing the rate of violent crimes (murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the 42 states that allowed open carry in 2012 with the eight states that didn’t. While his math technically checks out, experts told PolitiFact Florida that Gaetz’s statistic is meaningless, as you can’t really draw conclusions about the impact of a single law with data from a single year. But Patrick cited a "study," not Gaetz’s napkin calculations. He did not get back to us by deadline, but he could be referencing one by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, and flubbing some of the details. Lott’s research — which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal but on the Crime Prevention Research Center’s website — looked at the increase in concealed-carry permits but did not discuss open carry, as Patrick mentioned on air. And the 25 percent refers to a decrease in murder rates across the nation as well as a decline in violent crime. According to the study, the number of concealed-handgun permits across the country has increased by 178 percent from 4.6 million to 12.8 million from 2007 to 2015. Meanwhile, national murder rates have fallen from 2007 to 2014 by 25 percent, from 5.6 to 4.2 homicides per 100,000. "Overall, violent crime also fell by 25 percent over that time period," Lott writes, though he doesn’t give the numbers behind this rate in the study. In an interview with PolitiFact, Lott noted that the third edition of his book More Guns, Less Crime, shows that murder rates decreased 1.5 percent every year after concealed-carry legislation was passed, while robberies and rapes declined by 2 percent. Over 10 years, that comes out to about 15 to 20 percent, he said. Experts said that the study notes an "association" but doesn’t actually show causation between increased gun ownership and fewer murders or less crime. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, called Patrick’s claim "ridiculous" and pointed out another coinciding trend. "Mass shootings have more than doubled over that time," said Webster. "But I don’t make the claim that more gun carriers have led to more mass shootings." A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Criminology directly refuted Lott’s findings (and Lott in turn criticized that research). Researchers at Texas A&M University looked at county-level crime data in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas from 1998 to 2010 — the only four states with at least a decade’s worth of data after concealed-carry legislation was passed. While all the states saw an increase in the amount of concealed-carry permits, the crime trends varied. Rape and burglary decreased across all four states from 1998 to 2010, and murder decreased in Michigan and Texas. However, robbery, aggravated assault and larceny increased in Michigan and Pennsylvania while murder increased in Florida and Pennsylvania. "We found no effect of increases in (concealed-carry permits) issued in a county on changes in crime rates," Charles Phillips, a public health professor at Texas A&M and lead author of the study, told PolitiFact. An inconclusive theory at best The "more guns, less crime" theory largely stems from Lott’s highly influential and equally controversial book of the same name, which analyzed 30 years’ worth of crime data. More than a decade after its first publication, the theory continues to be the subject of heated academic and policy debate as well as numerous fact-checks. Lott contends the "vast majority" of research supports his work, but some researchers say he’s been discredited. Major critiques in the Stanford Law Review and by the National Research Council note that the evidence does not show a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates. "The only real dispute is whether the benefits and the costs of these (right-to-carry) laws are a wash or whether they lead to increases in violent crime," said Stanford Law professor John Donohue, a vocal critic of Lott’s work. Donohue’s own influential 2014 working paper shows an increase in violent crime in 22 states. According to Donohue, much of the national decline in crime came from New York, a state that has no right-to-carry law. Webster of Johns Hopkins pointed out that permit holders are low-risk when it comes to involvement in violent crime, so it’s counter-intuitive to suggest that they’re the cause of a decline in murders. That holds true in Patrick’s home state of Texas, where concealed-carry licensees commit very few crimes, said Phillips of Texas A&M, based on his own research. "But when convicted, they are more likely to be crimes involving violence, guns and death." Finally, experts have pointed to a lot of theories beyond right-to-carry laws that may account for falling crime rates,including improved police technology, mass incarceration, online financial practices that keeps paper money out of homes, and extended unemployment benefits. So it's not as if the crime is falling because of loose gun restrictions alone. Our ruling Patrick said, "There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent." It’s possible that Patrick is referencing a disputed study by gun rights advocate John Lott and getting some details wrong. Lott’s study shows a 25 percent decrease in murder and violent crime across the country from 2007 to 2014, as well as a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits. Those two trends may be correlated, but experts say there’s no evidence showing causation. Further, gun laws may have little to nothing to do with rates of falling crime. We rate Patrick’s claim Mostly False.	None	Dan Patrick	None	None	None	2016-01-03T18:42:23	2016-01-03	['None']

pomt-08500	Says "Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/08/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-sen-russ-feingold-cut-medicare-52/	In his campaign against U.S. Sen Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, Republican Ron Johnson has made health reform the centerpiece of his campaign -- slamming Feingold’s support for "ObamaCare" in speeches, news releases and TV and radio ads. Johnson says he wants the whole law repealed. In a direct mail piece to voters, Johnson criticizes Feingold as being the decisive vote for cuts to Medicare, an especially hot-button topic for senior citizens. Republicans have been using the approach across the country against Democratic incumbents -- just as Democrats have tried to tag Republican candidates as out to gut Social Security. The eye-catching cover of Johnson’s mailer pictures three whispering women, all seniors, with the tagline: "Do you know Russ Feingold’s dirty little secret..." On the flip side, one headline reads "Ron Johnson will fight to preserve your benefits." The other, in a tarnished brown: "Russ Feingold cut Medicare by $523 billion." It goes on to say: "Feingold cast the deciding vote on ObamaCare, which made cuts to Medicare that will impact 100,000 Wisconsin seniors utilizing the Medicare Advantage program." It cites the Christmas Eve 2009 vote in which Feingold joined the 60-vote majority, all Democrats, to move along the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The final vote, in March of 2010, was 56-43. Feingold voted also yes on the final bill. So does the law "cut" more than $500 billion from Medicare? The national PolitiFact site, and various state sites, have ruled repeatedly on the Medicare question. They have found the health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but rather is an attempt over 10 years to slow the program’s future growth by curtailing spending by that amount. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. There are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits. In fact, there is an expansion of some benefits, such as the gradual closure of the "doughnut hole" in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The law also tries to improve the program for beneficiaries by paying more for preventive care. How do other groups view this question? The leading senior advocacy group, AARP, took the position that the health care measure was on balance a good thing. "The health care law strengthens Medicare by protecting and improving your guaranteed benefits and cracking down on waste, fraud and inefficiency," a statement on the organization’s website says. "It also identifies savings that will keep Medicare financially stable for 12 years longer than if the law hadn't been passed." But America’s Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry trade group, has raised concerns about the impact of the changes on benefits, which will vary by insurer. Under the measure, the second-biggest savings category is Medicare Advantage ($136 billion), making up about one-quarter of the $523 million in "cuts" referred to in the mailer. About 25 percent of people covered by Medicare have chosen Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage, often called Medicare's HMO, is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. As PolitiFact National has noted, the Advantage program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. President Barack Obama and groups such as AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare. Advantage beneficiaries would see fewer benefits -- not in the basic package of guaranteed benefits, but in extras that Medicare Advantage offers its patients, such as gym memberships. Some plans pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. Aside from the Advantage reductions, other savings as part of the $500 billion will come from higher insurance premiums for seniors making $85,000 or $170,000 per couple, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and smaller-than-expected increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Johnson cites two media accounts to back his claim on the $500 billion. One, a March 2010 Washington Post story, noted a "total reduction in projected spending on the (Medicare) program to more than $500 billion over the next decade." That story is highlighted prominently in a related Johnson TV ad. Johnson campaign spokeswoman Sara Sendek also pointed to a CBS News web report, also in March 2010, that references "$500 billion in Medicare cuts over the next decade." Both clearly note the amount is spread over 10 years, with the Post story labeling it "a reduction in projected spending" -- elements Johnson did not include in his flier or the TV ad, where the same cut is mentioned. A final issue is whether Feingold "cast the deciding vote" on the new law. In December 2009, the bill needed 60 votes to prevent Republicans from thwarting passage. But any of the 59 others who voted yes could also be labeled the decisive vote. In any case, Feingold was not a last-minute convert to the bill. His support was not in question. So, let’s review the Johnson claim. In a campaign mailer and other venues, Ron Johnson says Feingold supported a measure that cut more than $500 billion from Medicare. That makes it sound like money out of the Medicare budget today, when Medicare spending will actually increase over the next 10 years. What Johnson labels a cut is an attempt to slow the projected increase in spending by $500 billion. Under the plan, guaranteed benefits are not cut. In fact, some benefits are increased. Johnson can say Feingold was the deciding vote -- but so could 59 other people running against incumbents now or in the future. We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02897	Says Chris Christie fired 6,000 teachers.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/07/ed-schultz/schultz-says-gov-christie-pushed-fire-6000-teacher/	New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie might have won re-election with plenty of votes from Democrats (a stunning third of voters from the other party marked their ballots for him, according to exit polls), but he got no love from a major Democratic constituency: teachers and people who identify with their cause. MSNBC host Ed Schultz puts himself in the teachers’ camp. On his election day show, Schultz said Christie is far more conservative than the moderate image that swirls around him. Case in point? The governor’s education policy. "All of a sudden, he is the self-anointed expert on education in America, and he has all the answers," Schultz said. "Cut a billion dollars out of the system, fire 6,000 teachers, and just tell everybody I'm an expert." Did Christie’s policy lead to the firing of 6,000 teachers? We decided to dig a little. We reached out the Ed Schultz Show and didn’t hear back, but the state count of teachers undercuts the claim. Christie took office in 2010. Over the next two years, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500. Year Number of teachers Change from year before 2007 110,964 2008 111,786 822 2009 114,450 2,664 2010 114,704 254 2011 110,301 -4,403 2012 110,229 -72 Source: New Jersey Education Dept. Now, while 4,500 is less than 6,000, it’s still a lot of teachers, and Schultz could claim that he was in the ballpark. Except we know that not all those teachers were fired. " 'Firing' is an incorrect term," said Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association. Wollmer said Christie backed a budget cut of $1.3 billion for schools. It produced a mix of layoffs and retirements. Wollmer said layoffs were more common than retirements, but he said he has no hard data on how many people fell into each group. Plus, the cuts led to reductions in the ranks of both teachers and support staff. Wollmer lumps both groups together. "I’m more than comfortable saying Christie was responsible for over 6,000 layoffs, due to his cuts," Wolmer said. But that raises another wrinkle in the story. We need to assess whether responsibility for the loss of teachers rest solely on Christie’s shoulders. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker and now head of a left-leaning think tank, New Jersey Policy Perspective, said two things happened after Christie took office. "Christie and the Democratic Legislature cut $1 billion in state funds from school aid and the stimulus aid expired," MacInnes said. A multi-billion dollar state budget deficit made 2010 a very contentious year for school funding. Christie proposed deep reductions in aid, and local school boards tried to fill the gap with property tax hikes. Then local voters shot down those plans in record numbers. Those local decisions complicate the picture, "Yes, funding cuts do appear in many cases to have led to staffing reductions," said Bruce Baker, professor of education at Rutgers. "But I'm not sure of a good data source you could use to identify what share of those reductions were from ‘reduction in force’ policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress." On the other hand, as a deadline loomed for passage of a state budget, Christie refused concessions to the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state’s smallest budget in five years passed with a minimum of Democratic support. The initial cuts were so deep, a judge reversed a portion of them. The loss of stimulus dollars also played a major role. According to the federal government website, Recovery.gov, New Jersey received over $1.6 billion in one-time education grants through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. In April 2010, Christie’s administration said schools needed to manage a slightly smaller loss of about $1 billion in stimulus funds but in either case, schools were losing a significant amount of money due to the end of the federal program. Overall, Christie gets a fair degree of responsibility for the school funding cuts, although the way those cuts translated into reductions in staff might be indirect. Our ruling Schultz said Christie firied 6,000 teachers. There are two problems with Schultz’s claim. First, the number is closer to 4,500, and even the teachers’ union would not say that all the people that held those jobs were fired. Some of them retired and were not replaced. The number of teachers declined but not necessarily through being fired or laid-off. Second, while Christie pushed hard for steep cuts to school funding, he also got help from local voters. Because of those caveats, we rate Schultz's claim Half True.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2013-11-07T12:39:44	2013-11-05	['None']

pomt-02488	The annual gross domestic product of metro Atlanta is "bigger than 28 states in the union."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/18/kasim-reed/reed-metro-atlanta-financial-behemoth/	The Atlanta region has drawn millions of newcomers here in recent years with its warm weather (snowstorms notwithstanding), reasonably priced housing, and job opportunities in real estate, banking and the airline industry. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed talked about the economic might of the region during a recent speech before the Atlanta Press Club. One statistic he used to cite the size of metro Atlanta’s economy surprised us, so we decided to do some fact-checking. The annual gross domestic product of metro Atlanta, the mayor said, is "bigger than 28 states in the union." Is it really that large? Mayoral spokesman Carlos Campos said Reed was using U.S. Commerce Department data as the basis for his claim. We looked at the data, and the most recent statistics we found show the mayor’s statement might be conservative. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the total market value of all of the goods and services produced within the boundaries of a specific area. Federal officials define the Atlanta metropolitan area as 28 counties that stretch as far north as Dawson, south to Meriwether, as far west as Haralson and as far east as Walton and Jasper counties. It includes Georgia’s four highest-populated counties: Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The Atlanta metropolitan area had nearly 5.3 million residents in 2010, the ninth-highest total in the nation. In addition to having a large labor force, metro Atlanta has two major transportation hubs that have helped its economy race ahead of other regions. One is Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which ranks among the world’s busiest airports. The other is the ports of Savannah and Brunswick, which are considered to be among the fastest-growing ports in terms of the volume of items shipped there. Although the ports are not located in metro Atlanta, Reed and others note they are important to the region’s economy. About 180,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the 28-county Atlanta region can be attributed to the ports, according to a 2012 University of Georgia study. The region has 11 Fortune 500 companies with Atlanta addresses, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber. Only New York City and Houston have more Fortune 500 businesses, according to the chamber. So how large is this region’s economy? In 2012, the Atlanta region had a GDP of nearly $295 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Reed used that same number in his remarks. Among metropolitan areas, Atlanta’s GDP is the 10th-highest nationally, which is about where it should be considering it has the ninth-largest population. In order, the metropolitan areas with the largest gross domestic products are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Boston. In terms of how Atlanta fares in comparison with other states, only 16 states had a higher GDP. In order, those states were California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota. Metro Atlanta would also beat out the rest of the state. The region makes up about two-thirds of the state’s GDP, the Commerce Department data show. The Atlanta region does have a larger population than the rest of the state. PolitiFact Georgia looked at other categories of gross domestic product, and the Atlanta region fared as well, if not better, in those areas. For example, in 2012, only 12 states had a higher per capita GDP than metro Atlanta. The per capita gross domestic product for metro Atlanta was $46,970. University of Georgia economist Jeff Humphreys said he’s not surprised metro Atlanta has a higher GDP than most states. "Atlanta is a huge metro area," said Humphreys, the director of the university’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. "The population would outrank a lot of states." Indeed, metro Atlanta has a larger population than 30 other states, U.S. census figures show. Humphreys said the Atlanta region has a "highly developed economy" through economic resources such as the airport that are "serving people in other states, the country and the world at this point." To sum up, Reed claimed the Atlanta region had a higher GDP than 28 other states. Our research showed Atlanta slightly better than that in most categories. We rate the mayor’s statement True.

pomt-00252	"I voted to fund President Trump’s wall."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/05/joe-manchin/did-joe-manchin-vote-fund-border-wall/	Immigration policy has been one of the most contentious issues in Congress in recent years. And a big part of that debate has revolved around President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. Generally, Democrats have been skeptical that a wall is needed or would work as an immigration-control measure. But Democratic senators who are up for election this year in Republican-leaning states have had to walk a political tightrope, balancing their party loyalty with their constituents’ support for the president. In an ad in his reelection campaign, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said, "I wanted Mexico to pay for the wall, but they’re not. So we need to do it ourselves." Despite attacks by Republicans accusing him of being soft on illegal immigration, Manchin said in the ad, "I voted to fund President Trump’s wall. Check the vote." So we did. The clearest example — and the one Manchin visually highlighted in his ad — was a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Among other things, it would have funded a border wall. Specifically, the legislation said that "the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such actions as may be necessary (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) to construct, install, deploy, operate, and permanently maintain physical barriers, tactical infrastructure and technology in the vicinity of the United States border to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the border and deter, impede, and detect illegal activity in high traffic areas.'' The measure also would have struck the language in an existing bill that said "fencing and road Improvements'' and instead inserted "physical barriers" -- a stronger phrase, closer to the vision of a "wall." "Not later than September 30, 2022, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in carrying out this section, shall deploy along the United States border the most practical and effective physical barriers and tactical infrastructure available for achieving situational awareness and operational control of the border," the legislation said. The legislation included other elements of Trump’s immigration agenda, including tighter curbs on legal immigration, that made it unpalatable to most Democrats. Trump backed this measure, and three Democrats ended up voting for it when it came up on Feb. 15, 2018, along with 36 Republicans. That was well short of a majority and much less the 60 votes required to advance the measure to a final vote. But Manchin was one of those three Democrats to vote for it. In two other instances, Manchin voted for measures that would have increased border security infrastructure such as fencing, but not precisely the wall as envisioned by Trump. One was a bipartisan measure, informally called the Common Sense Plan, that would have implemented a path to citizenship for "dreamers" who were brought illegally to the United States as minors, along with funding for border security. Despite the border-security language, Trump opposed it. The measure would have provided $25 billion for "the construction of physical barriers, border security technologies, and tactical infrastructure." It said that within six months after passage, the executive branch would have to submit to Congress "a risk-based plan for improving security along the borders of the United States, including the use of personnel, fencing, other forms of tactical infrastructure, and technology." It won the backing of eight Republicans and 46 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independents. Manchin voted to advance the measure to a final vote. However, it fell short of the 60 votes required for final passage. A third measure — and the only one to pass — was a $1.3 trillion annual federal government spending bill, of which funding for replacement border fencing was a small part. Trump has sometimes touted this bill as making progress on building his border wall, but we have found these claims inaccurate, because the law was actually explicit about providing funding for items outside the scope of the Trump wall. The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign. The final vote for this bill was 65-32 in favor. All told, 39 Democrats voted for it, including Manchin. It can be tricky to pin down what pieces of legislation supported Trump’s specific vision for the wall, and which supported more generic elements of border security. However, the bill Manchin highlighted in his ad -- the Grassley legislation -- received Trump’s support, so Manchin’s vote for it was effectively a vote for Trump’s border-security vision, however it might play out on the ground. This supports Manchin’s notion that he "voted to fund President Trump’s wall." Manchin’s overall message is a shift from Trump’s first year in office. Morrisey’s office forwarded us a link to an article that listed a number of instances in which Manchin spoke out against, or expressed skepticism about, the idea of a border wall. For instance, the article noted that in an interview on "The Young Turks" on July 11, 2017, Manchin said, "I’m not for building a wall. I’m not for building a wall at all." He also told Politico that month that he had "not been supportive of funding for a wall." Our ruling Manchin said, "I voted to fund President Trump’s wall." Manchin has offered various opinions about the merits of a border wall over time. However, when it came to votes, we found a clear instance in which Manchin supported a Trump-backed, hard-line immigration bill with border wall provisions that was too conservative even for a sizable portion of the Republican caucus. We rate the statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Manchin	None	None	None	2018-10-05T11:52:46	2018-06-14	['None']
pomt-00296	Says Ohio U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson backs a "massive tax giveaway" for corporations "by slashing Medicare and Social Security."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/26/danny-oconnor/danny-oconnors-ad-ohio-really-slashes/	Lower corporate taxes beat high ones, many Republicans say, firm in the assertion that if companies can keep more of their earnings, they’ll spend it on jobs and expansion. Or else it’s all a sham to help their fat-cat contributors -- and ordinary Americans will have to pay later when their retirement benefits get shorted. The latter belief is the basis of a new ad from Danny O’Connor, the Democrat running in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District. He’s challenging Troy Balderson, a Republican who won the mid-Ohio seat temporarily after a special election in August 2018. Balderson was not in Congress when lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but he supported it. An announcer in O’Connor’s ad says, "If you want to know who Troy Balderson works for, follow the money. An avalanche of corporate cash. Big banks. Drug companies. The insurance giants. Balderson backs a massive tax giveaway for them by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us." These dots supposedly go from corporate donations to tax cuts for companies to slashed retirement programs. Let’s see where they actually lead. Basic facts The basic facts on campaign contributions are simple and taken from public filings. Balderson is raising campaign money. Based on publicly filed campaign finance records through Sept. 10, he has raised nearly $1.8 million, with about $240,000 of it coming from political action committees of businesses. Whether that’s an "avalanche of cash" is relative, but for the sake of comparison, O’Connor, the candidate making the claim, has raised much more money: $5.5 million -- but he shuns money from corporate PACs. The ad’s announcer singles out three kinds of corporations. One is "the insurance giants." Yet nearly a quarter, or $11,900, of the industry’s total came from a single hometown insurer, Nationwide, based in Columbus, mostly from the company PAC. Balderson has received more than $30,000 from commercial banks so far. Yet the overwhelming share of it -- $15,500 -- was from another hometown company, Columbus-based Huntington Bancshares. O'Connor got $2,500 from Huntington's PAC in April but gave it back in June. Balderson got $14,900 from pharmaceutical and health products companies, records show. But 40 percent of that drug industry money, or $6,000, came from Cardinal Health, a Columbus-based pharmaceutical distributor. The 'giveaway' The ad then says Balderson "backs a massive tax giveaway" for his corporate donors This refers to the corporate tax rate reductions in the late 2017 income tax overhaul. How do the tax cuts for corporations lead to "slashing" Medicare and Social Security? There are two ways, if you follow this line of thinking. First, the tax cuts required the government to boost its borrowing, which means larger deficits. Second, Republicans in Congress including Balderson say they want a balanced budget. This would require changes in spending, and because the tax cuts pushed up deficits, even bigger spending cuts could be required, Democrats warn. House Republicans released a balanced-budget blueprint on June 19 laying out their ideas -- and explained how and why Social Security and Medicare would be affected if this plan came to pass: "The Federal Government is spending far more than it takes in," the document said. "This increasing disparity is largely due to mandatory – or autopilot – spending, which includes safety-net programs like Medicare and Social Security, as well as the interest on the national debt." That drives the "rapid rate at which the national debt is accumulating." To fix this, House Republicans would create a dual system that let seniors stay in tradional Medicare or enroll in private plans that would provide "the same level of health coverage" but "compete for seniors’ business, just as Medicare Advantage does today," the House document said. This would create savings for seniors as well as taxpayers, the proposal said, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis of similar proposals in 2017. The CBO said savings or higher costs for seniors would depend on the program's design. But Medicare could save $537 billion over the next decade with these changes, Budget Committee Republicans estimated. As for Social Security, savings would come from eliminating the ability to collect unemployment benefits and Social Security disability insurance at the same time. This was projected to save up to $4 billion. Separately, President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sept. 17 that with budget deficits projected at about 4 percent to 5 percent of the country’s economic output for the next one to two years, there would likely be an effort in 2019 to cut spending on entitlement programs. He did not specify where the cuts would be made, Reuters reported. Trump, however, ran on promises not to cut Medicare or Social Security. Our ruling O’Connor’s ad says Balderson "backs a massive tax giveaway" for his corporate donors, suggesting he "works" for them, "by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us." Balderson certainly takes campaign contributions from corporations. And Balderson supports corporate tax cuts, too. The entire tax package added to deficits -- which so far have been financed with higher federal borrowing, not cuts to retirement programs. Nevertheless, changes to those programs could come. But the idea of "slashing" Medicare or Social Security is not what’s been proposed. Rather, Republicans have suggested holding down their growth rate and allowing private accounts, with a lot of details still to come. PolitiFact has rated claims that say the tax cuts will lead to Social Security and Medicare cuts as Half True, reasoning that policies like the tax cuts and balanced budget bills could make cuts more likely, though not certain. But O’Connor went further. His ad said Balderson "backs a massive tax giveaway" for corporations "by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us." It’s speculative, scary and oversteps what is known to be on the table. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14323	Says JoAnne Kloppenburg "has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/30/rebecca-bradley/did-joanne-kloppenburg-say-her-job-judge-promote-m/	In the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg has cast Justice Rebecca Bradley as a conservative who is too cozy with the Republican Party and GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Bradley to three judgeships in three years. But Kloppenburg, a state Court of Appeals judge in Madison, has made contributions over the years to Democratic candidates and is benefitting from the work of liberal groups such as One Wisconsin Now. Bradley, in turn, has sought to cast Kloppenburg as a judge who would rule on cases based on her personal biases. In a March 21, 2016 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio’s "Joy Cardin Show," Bradley said: "Given her judicial philosophy, JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society. She will most definitely introduce her social and political beliefs into her decision making." We don’t know, of course, just what Kloppenburg would do as a Supreme Court justice. But what has Kloppenburg said about what her job is as a judge, and about promoting a more equal society? On her campaign website, Kloppenburg states this as being her judicial philosophy: "I apply the law fairly, and thoughtfully, and in a principled and disciplined manner to answer the legal questions presented by the parties in a case. I approach each case with an open mind, and my decisions are based on the law and the facts, not on ideology or partisan politics. I am faithful to the court’s role as an independent check and balance on the other political branches of government. My duty is to uphold the Constitution, a sacred document that represents the will of the people and which contains the fundamental principles that define our democracy, protect individual rights and promote a more equal society." She made a similar statement in a candidate questionnaire. As Bradley’s campaign noted to us, Kloppenburg has also said -- more than once -- that among U.S. Supreme Court justices, she aligns most with Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in part because they believe in "protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society." So, Kloppenburg’s statement is more broad than Bradley suggests, in that she states her job as a judge is to uphold the U.S. Constitution. But Kloppenburg also states that in her judicial philosophy, the key principles of the Constitution are protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society. That echoes the claim made by Bradley. Our rating Bradley says "JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society." Kloppenburg does say that, but she also says more. Kloppenburg declares that her judicial philosophy is to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and that in her view, the fundamental principles of the Constitution are to "protect individual rights and promote a more equal society." Bradley’s statement is accurate but needs additional information -- our definition of Mostly True.	None	Rebecca Bradley	None	None	None	2016-03-30T05:00:00	2016-03-21	['None']

pomt-04566	Texas is "the state that has now gone the longest without electing a Democrat statewide."	true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/26/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-texas-has-gone-longest-all-sta/	During a Texas Tribune Festival discussion, state Rep. Joaquin Castro suggested Texas ranks No. 1 in a dubious category for Democrats. The San Antonio Democrat, nominated this year for a U.S. House seat, said: "We are the state that has now gone the longest without electing a Democrat statewide. It has been since 1994 that a Democrat has been elected in Texas." The claim was noted for us by University of Texas journalism student Joshua Fechter. The last Democrats were elected statewide in 1994. Those victors included Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, Attorney General Dan Morales and State Comptroller John Sharp. In the year's marquee race, Republican George W. Bush denied Gov. Ann Richards a second term. And have Texas Democrats been shut out of statewide office longer than Democrats elsewhere? We left Castro a message seeking backup information, then recalled that the Associated Press said in a July 30, 2012, news article: "Texas Democrats have the longest losing streak in the nation in statewide elections." The story suggested the party’s July 31 runoff for its U.S. Senate nomination would indicate if Democrats had hopes of changing that record this year. To gauge whether Texas has the nation’s longest current stretch of statewide Democratic also-rans, we looked first at which states have Democratic governors.Twenty states have Democratic governors, according to the National Governors Association, while Rhode Island has an Independent chief executive and the others are led by Republicans. Of the 28 states outside Texas with Republican governors, 15 have at least one Democratic senator, the Senate roster shows, as does Rhode Island. Each of these senators would have last won election in 2006 or later. This got us down to 13 red-hued states: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming. But 10 of them saw Democrats elected governor later than 1995, according to information kept by the governors association. This result left us with three states potentially more long-lastingly difficult for Democrats running statewide than Texas: Idaho, South Carolina and Utah. Scratch South Carolina; Democratic Sen. Ernest "Fritz" Holliings won his last term in 1998, four years after the latest Texas Democrats won statewide. Hollings did not seek re-election in 2004. Similarly, interviews confirmed, voters in Idaho and Utah elected Democrats statewide after 1994. Like Texas, Idaho last had a Democratic governor, Cecil Andrus, through 1994. But Democrat Marilyn Howard was elected superintendent of public instruction in 1998 and re-elected in 2002, serving through 2006, according to Dean Ferguson, communications director for the Idaho Democratic Party. In Utah, lawyer and Democrat Jan Graham won her second term as attorney general in 1996, serving to 2001, according to a biographical entry on her law firm’s website. "Graham is the only woman in Utah’s history to be elected to a statewide office," the entry says. As we completed this look, Castro spokesman Cary Clack said he didn’t know how Castro learned of, or determined, this factoid. Our ruling Texas voters have not elected a Democrat to statewide office for longer than voters in any other state. Castro’s statement rates as True.

pomt-11674	On rescinding Obama-era marijuana enforcement guidelines.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/05/jeff-sessions/did-attorney-general-sessions-reverse-course-enfor/	A scoop by the Associated Press on federal enforcement of marijuana laws drew an angry morning tweet from Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. The AP story said that the days of a lighter federal touch on marijuana violations were ending. Gardner expressed a sense of betrayal. "This reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation," he wrote Jan. 4. "With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A few hours later, the Justice Department announced the policy shift. In the words of the department’s press release, there would be "a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents." Federal prosecutors were free to enforce federal law according to rules that had been in place for decades. Gardner clearly thought Sessions had reversed himself, but we wanted to see if that was accurate. Based on what we heard from Gardner and his staff, whatever promises Sessions might have made to let states such as Colorado set their own rules for pot were spoken in private, not written or said in public. That’s nothing we fact-checkers can verify or refute. And looking at Sessions’ public statements, every legal scholar we reached told us the same thing: Sessions never promised to keep the Obama-era guidelines in place. A little history Under federal law, marijuana is illegal. Congress could change that, but it hasn’t. As more and more states took matters into their own hands for both medical and recreational use, they put the Justice Department in a legal bind. It could enforce federal law, or effectively bow to state law. The Obama administration began issuing prosecution guidelines in 2009 and in 2013 settled on ones crafted by Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Cole’s memo basically left it to state and local agencies to enforce their own laws, while the feds would focus on marijuana when it was tied to gangs or drug cartels, violence (especially involving firearms), or was part of schemes to sell pot in states where it remained illegal. Cole's memo urged federal prosecutors to use their own discretion. What Sessions has said Sessions has never hid his opposition to marijuana. At an April 4, 2016, Senate hearing he said that "good people don’t smoke marijuana," and that the government needed to send the message "that this drug is dangerous, you cannot play with it, it is not funny, it's not something to laugh about." He called the Obama administration's approach one of Obama’s "great failures." In light of those comments, the issue came up at Sessions’ confirmation hearings. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked him if he would use federal law to prosecute sick people who are using marijuana legally in their state. "I won't commit to never enforcing federal law, Sen. Leahy, but absolutely it's a problem of resources for the federal government," Sessions said. Leahy pressed him on whether he agreed with the Cole memo guidelines. Sessions avoided a direct answer. He said some of them were valuable but added, "Using good judgment about how to handle these cases will be a responsibility of mine. I know it won't be an easy decision, but I will try to do my duty in a fair and just way." At a Nov. 14, 2017, House Judiciary hearing, Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked Sessions what the Justice Department’s marijuana policy was. "Our policy is the same, really, fundamentally, as the Holder-Lynch policy, which is that the federal law remains in effect, and a state can legalize marijuana for its law enforcement purposes, but it still remains illegal with regard to federal purposes," Sessions said. Gardner’s floor speech Gardner followed up his tweet with a speech on the Senate floor. He said his conversations with Sessions had left him with a clear sense that the federal government would not interfere with Colorado’s legal use of recreational pot. "Prior to his confirmation, then-Sen. Sessions told me there weren’t any plans to reverse the Cole memorandum," Gardner said Jan. 4. "Then-Sen. Sessions said marijuana wasn’t going to be on President Trump’s agenda. That it was something they weren’t going to deal with." However, Gardner offered nothing in writing from Sessions to back up his recollection of those conversations. Legal scholars see no change We reached a handful law professors who follow federal drug policy. Not one found the new policy inconsistent with what Sessions has said before. "I don’t think one can accuse Sessions of changing his mind," said Franklin Snyder at Texas A&M University School of Law. "What he said about Holder-Lynch was accurate. I suspect that some people read his words as suggesting support for the Cole memorandum, but that’s not exactly what he said." Robert Mikos at Vanderbilt Law School agreed. "It seems perfectly consistent with what he has said with regard to marijuana law in the past," Mikos told us. Alex Kreit at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego said Sessions’ answers had given him "wiggle room, and he always said that policies would be evaluated." The more surprising shift for Kreit was how this runs against what President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail. At an October 2015 event in Nevada, Trump said "in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue." He said much the same in Colorado. A key question now is what the government does under the new policy. "Federal prosecutors have a lot of discretion, so neither the Cole memo nor this new announcement guarantee any change in actual prosecutions," said Robert J. MacCoun at Stanford Law School. If there’s a crackdown in the next few weeks, the answer will be evident. Otherwise, it might take a while before the impact, if any, bubbles up. Our ruling While some might have reason to think that Sessions changed his stance on marijuana prosecutions, there’s no hard proof that he did. In public, he always affirmed that marijuana is illegal under federal law, and he never promised to abide by an Obama-era memo that down-pedaled prosecutions. No Flip here.

pomt-03707	Ché Guevara "wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/did-che-guevara-write-extensively-about-superiorit/	When rapper Jay-Z and his pop star wife Beyonce went to Cuba to celebrate their wedding anniversary in April, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., criticized the rapper’s choice of heroes. "Well, I won't rap it, but I'll say, first of all, I think Jay-Z needs to get informed," Rubio said during the April 14 interview on ABC News’ This Week. "One of his heroes is Ché Guevara. Ché Guevara was a racist. Ché Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent. So he should inform himself on the guy that he's propping up." It was a whirlwind day for Rubio as he taped seven interviews on Sunday news shows in anticipation of releasing immigration legislation with other senators. "You know, Jay-Z's a guy that wears the Ché Guevara t-shirt and he doesn't realize Ché Guevara was a racist," Rubio said on Meet the Press. "Ché Guevara was a murderer and a killer. So look, (Jay-Z is) an entertainer, obviously. He's not in the middle of any public discourse here. But I think it's important to point out when people take stances like this that are absurd." Clearly, Ché Guevara is a controversial figure, but we hadn’t heard before that he was a racist. We set out to fact-check whether he "wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent." Ché Guevara’s quotes about blacks Ernesto "Ché" Guevara was a Latin American guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary, and a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in the late 1950s. Although hailed in some circles as a legendary icon of rebellion, the Argentine-born doctor is also reviled by many Cubans for ruthlessly ordering the execution of more than 150 prisoners in Cuba without a fair trial. But was he a racist? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant sent us links to a few articles and book passages. The most compelling evidence was from The Motorcycle Diaries, a book based on diaries he kept while traveling through Latin America in the early 1950s. (The book was also made into a 2004 movie.) "The blacks, those magnificent examples of the African race who have maintained their racial purity thanks to their lack of an affinity with bathing, have seen their territory invaded by a new kind of slave: the Portuguese. And the two ancient races have now begun a hard life together, fraught with bickering and squabbles. Discrimination and poverty unite them in the daily fight for survival but their different ways of approaching life separate them completely: The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations." Another comment came from Guevara’s writing about his time fighting with revolutionaries in the Congo and included this line: "Given the prevailing lack of discipline, it would have been impossible to use Congolese machine-gunners to defend the base from air attack: they did not know how to handle their weapons and did not want to learn." Finally, there’s this line after the revolution in 1959: "We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution. By which I mean: nothing." Experts on Guevara’s words We interviewed two authors who wrote books about Guevara: Jon Lee Anderson, a staff writer for the New Yorker, who wrote Ché Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, and New York University professor Jorge Castañeda, author of Compañero: The Life and Death of Ché Guevara. We also interviewed multiple professors who are experts in Cuban or Latin American studies. There wasn’t a debate among the experts about Guevara’s quote calling blacks "indolent." But many said it had to be evaluated within the context of his life at the time. Several said that it was an exaggeration to suggest that Guevara wrote "extensively" about the superiority of whites. They pointed to other statements by Guevara that have either been misinterpreted or were clearly not racist. First, let’s start with the Motorcycle Diaries quote. Guevara wrote the passage in The Motorcycle Diaries about blacks being "indolent" after visiting workers’ slums in Caracas. His observations were "stereotypical of white, especially Argentine, arrogance and condescension," Anderson wrote in his book. (Anderson called Rubio’s claim "pure twaddle.") Castañeda said the diary entry reflected Argentinians "who maybe have a tendency to see themselves very differently from the rest of Latin America. .. I think it is a stretch to call him a racist. ... There are so many other things to criticize Ché Guevara. That’s not one of them." Mark Sawyer, a UCLA political science professor who called Rubio’s claim a "gross exaggeration", wrote that Guevara’s quote was from when he was 24 years old and "reflects a Ché whose views evolved on the issue of race and who eventually saw black liberation as synonymous with ending oppression." Sawyer dismissed Guevara’s remarks about fighters in the Congo lacking discipline as not racially motivated. Rather, the line is "the same kinds of concerns he expressed about peasants wherever he went to help foment revolution," Sawyer wrote in a blog post. As for this quote -- "We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution. By which I mean: nothing" -- some sources on the Internet claim it is from a 1959 speech or press conference, but we were unable to find an original source or context for the quote. Sawyer wrote in his blog that "Ché is referring to the concept that he saw blacks as participating in the revolution not as blacks but as patriots. That is, the Revolution would be universal and color blind." (Sawyer told PolitiFact that he was uncertain of the source of that Guevara quote.) Without an original source for context, we can’t independently verify this interpretation. Guevara’s comments on racial equality At least a couple of our experts pointed to a famous speech Guevara made at the University of Santa Clara in 1959 in which he called for greater representation in all parts of Cuban society. At workers rallies around that time, Guevara and Raul Castro talked about the need to "advance the revolution’s anti-discrimination program," wrote Alejandro de la Fuente, a University of Pittsburgh history professor in his book A Nation for All: Race, Inequality and Politics in 20th Century Cuba. In the speech at Santa Clara, Guevara called for the university to "paint itself with black, paint itself with mulatto" students and teachers, Fuente wrote. In 1964, Guevara spoke before the United Nations and criticized "racist" intervention by the west in the Congo, Anderson wrote in his book. People who have studied Guevara said he was racially inclusive in his actions. "Blacks did do plenty for the revolution," said University of Texas Latin American history professor Jonathan Brown who has read declassified CIA reports on Guevara’s speeches in the early 1960s. Brown said Guevara had Afro Cuban troops who followed him into battle and stayed in his army after the victory. Guevara also had Afro Cuban bodyguards and other advisers, he said. Brown noted this even though he is not a fan of Guevara. "His books and influences led a lot of young men to an early grave throughout Latin America," Brown told PolitiFact. Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska who teaches Latino politics, said that Guevara underwent a transformation from his early days in Argentina. "While there is evidence to support the claim that Ché made such statements, or harbored them in his mind as a young man, his role in the revolution was one where he openly espoused anti-racist, egalitarian ideals," Benjamin-Alvarado told PolitiFact in an email. Andy Gomez, a senior fellow University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies, said that being racist isn’t one of the top 10 descriptors he would use of Guevara. "There are other things he was better known for," he said. "A strategist, a thinker, also very cold-blooded murder, which history has proven." Jaime Suchlicki, the head of the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American studies, said that it is "absolutely true" that Guevara was racist against blacks. Suchlicki noted several shortcomings of the Cuban revolution for blacks as outlined in a recent New York Times article. Our ruling Guevara has become an icon of rebellion, and he's also been reviled for ordering executions without trial. But did he write "extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent," as Rubio said? Guevara’s words in The Motorcycle Diaries were highly critical of the blacks he came across in that Caracas neighborhood, and he placed them beneath Europeans. The experts we consulted said the remarks are real and would not have been unusual coming from a 24-year-old from Argentina at the time. Guevara’s quote about the Congo fighters lacking discipline could be interpreted as a criticism of their military readiness -- not a commentary on their race. We can’t fully evaluate the quote about blacks and the revolution without seeing it in full context. Experts said it was an exaggeration to suggest Guevara wrote "extensively" about racial superiority. Rubio’s comments gave the impression that Guevara wrote much more about the superiority of white Europeans over blacks than he did. And later in his life, Guevara made comments supporting racial equality. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10499	"According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ ... will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent ... is it OBAMA??"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/02/chain-email/complete-distortion-of-the-bible/	The chain e-mail attacks on Sen. Barack Obama during this presidential race have been rampant and ruthless. He refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance ( False.) He was sworn into the Senate on a Koran, not the Bible ( Pants on Fire wrong.) His middle name is Mohammed and he's a "covert" Muslim ( Pants on Fire wrong.) But those allegations are dwarfed by a new chain e-mail that distorts the words of the Bible to suggest Obama is the Antichrist. The e-mail reads: "According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal....the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, will destroy everything is it OBAMA??" Like many other e-mails spreading falsehoods about the presidential candidates to thousands or even millions of people, this e-mail encourages its readers to pass it on: "I STRONGLY URGE each one of you to repost this as many times as you can! Each opportunity that you have to send it to a friend or media outlet...do it! If you think I am crazy..Im sorry but I refuse to take a chance on the "unknown" candidate." We feel silly even writing about this because many people consider it ridiculous on its face. But the e-mail was sent to us by many PolitiFact readers who wanted us to sort it out. And judging by 635,000 hits on a Google search for "Obama + Antichrist," the suggestion certainly has spread. Among the thousands of postings is one blog — "Barack Obama the Antichrist?" — devoted to exploring signs that Obama may be the Antichrist. And it's because of chain e-mails like this one that misunderstandings begin. To be clear: Nothing about this detailed allegation is true. Let's begin with the Book of Revelation (note the singular, which is accurate), the final book in the Bible's New Testament, which is 22 chapters long. Its sweeping apocalyptic language is laced with metaphors and symbols that challenge modern readers, but nowhere does it offer the kind of cookbook definition of the Antichrist proposed in this e-mail. To reach our findings, we read the Book of Revelation and interviewed two religious scholars. Here's what we found: • The word "anti-christ" does not appear in the Book of Revelation. "The word Antichrist is not used in the Book of Revelation so this is important to point out," said Dr. James D. Tabor, professor and chair of the religious studies department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "Everybody thinks the word is used." That's a pretty big hole in this e-mail from the get-go. We didn't find the word in reading the text and our second scholar confirms this critical point. "First and foremost, the word Antichrist and a figure called the Antichrist never occurs in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament," said Dr. L. Michael White, professor of classics and religious studies at the University of Texas and director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins. Now, some people interpret characters in the Book of Revelation to be the Antichrist even though the text doesn't use this word. Specifically, in Chapter 13 there is a beast "having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy" that some consider to be an allusion to the Antichrist. "It's only in Chapter 13 and you could almost miss it," Tabor said. But among biblical scholars and historians, there is strong consensus that none of the strange, evil-sounding characters in the Book of Revelation actually represents the Antichrist. "It wasn't there in the Bible," White said. "It emerges in the Middle Ages. It's something historians deal with." Now the word Antichrist does appear a few times in other books of the Bible, specifically in First John and Second John. The description in First John, Chapter 4, verse 3 says: "And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world." • There's no mention of a man of a certain age. The Book of Revelation talks of God, Jesus Christ, John, spirits, Jezebel, a beast like a calf, a beast like a flying eagle, elders, a great red dragon and many more animals and people. But nowhere does it describe "a man, in his 40s," as the e-mail alleges. "As you notice, there's nothing about being age 40," Tabor said. "This is completely wrong. The Book of Revelation doesn't say that. It says it's a male, so I guess they got that right. It says 'he,' 'he,' 'he.' " • There's no mention of the word "Muslim." Considering the Bible was completed by the early second century, and the Islam religion wasn't founded until the early 600s, it's not surprising that the world Muslim (the name for Islam followers) does not appear in the Book of Revelation. So it's this part of the e-mail, where it says the Antichrist will be a man "of Muslim descent," that our religious scholars find particularly ridiculous. By definition, the Antichrist is "the polar opposite and ultimate enemy of Christ," according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. And because Muslims believe "there is no god but God," they would have great difficulty with the idea of elevating a person to a divine status, White said. "A Muslim would be a monotheist and the last thing a Muslim would do is have anyone worship anyone other than God," Tabor said. Not to mention the fact that Obama is not a Muslim. White points to the specific descriptions of the Antichrist as evidence that the e-mail is drawing from a number of sources to create the image it wants to portray. "There is no part of that anywhere in the Bible, not in those forms," said White, who was a co-writer and historical consultant for the 1999 PBS documentary, Apocalypse! Time, History, and Revolution. "That's all a jigsaw puzzle of bits and pieces all filtered through the kind of end-of-world scenarios we get in the theology that is the underpinning of the Left Behind novels." White says this patchwork interpretation of the Bible is common in some groups trying to justify certain beliefs. "Of course, they never bothered to read the Scriptures carefully ... so it's kind of a system of interpretation. That if you start with that presupposition. ... it's all there you can just find it," White said. "That description (in the chain e-mail) never occurs anywhere in one place nor are the component parts really about the same situation. It's a cherry-picking through Scripture to get it all to fit together." But fit together it doesn't. The claim in this e-mail is egregiously inaccurate, so we rule it Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-01200	"Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/01/mario-loyola/mario-loyola-says-even-cuts-wisconsin-spending-and/	Some conservatives are pushing Gov. Scott Walker to use his second term to enact much deeper changes in Wisconsin government. "When Walker got to office, Wisconsin was one of the worst states in the country in which to do business, with one of the highest regulatory and tax burdens," Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote in the conservative National Review on Nov. 5, 2014. "Some estimates now rate it as number 14 for doing business, but don’t be deceived," Loyola wrote under the headline, "Walker’s Win: Why it was the most important GOP win in the country." He added: "Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden." As Walker ramps up exploration of a 2016 presidential campaign, let’s check the claim about spending and taxation in the Badger state. We’ll take the easy part first. Taxes Walker and Republican legislators have approved a variety of tax freezes and cuts. In March 2014, we rated True a Walker claim that he’s delivered $2 billion in tax cuts, mainly by reducing income tax rates and limiting local property tax hikes. But an Oct. 14, 2014 report by the Tax Foundation ranked Wisconsin among the highest 10 states for business taxes on a scale that included corporate, individual income, sales, unemployment insurance and property taxes. Census figures on tax collections lag by two years, so they don’t account for all of Walker’s cuts. But the latest figures showed that property-tax and income-tax collections in Wisconsin run more than 25 percent above the national average, we reported. There’s ample evidence that Wisconsin is among the middle group of states when all sources of revenue are considered. But on taxes alone, the state remains closer to the top. Spending To back up his claim, Loyola, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, pointed us to the state expenditure study done in 2013 by the National Association of State Budget Officers. That report doesn’t compute per-capita spending, but based on a survey of budget officials it shows a total spending figure from state revenues, federal aid and other sources. We did the math and it backs up the claim: In 2013, Wisconsin "state budget" spending was about $7,500 per capita compared to about $3,600 in Texas. The study comes from a respected trade group and other organizations refer to its findings. The study cautions, however: "State governments have specific functional responsibilities that vary among states depending on the role of local governments in providing services. For example, in many states, the funding of elementary and secondary education is considered primarily a local function." We could not replicate the study’s findings using U.S. Census surveys of state and local government finances. That Census data is preferred by researchers, though one drawback is that reporting of the data lags about two years. One researcher, Dale Knapp with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the census figures are better because the Budget Officers’ study "includes some things that we generally don’t consider part of the state budget -- the biggest of which is state retirement payments. They also include unemployment payments, lottery prizes, and capital expenditures, which can vary from year to year." When looking just at state spending (and excluding transfers to local governments), Wisconsin state government spends 27.1% more per capita than Texas in 2011, Knapp found. We also asked the Wisconsin Budget Project to run comparisons. Tamarine Cornelius and Jon Peacock of the group told us that Wisconsin per capita "direct general expenditures" were $1,114 above that of Texas, or 15 percent. That was for state and local expenditures. Wisconsin ranked #21 among the states; Texas was #38. So neither group backs up the claim that Wisconsin state government spends 100% more -- twice as much -- as Wisconsin on a per-capita basis. Still, we found that the numbers in the study cited by Loyola were drawn from the annual financial reports published by Texas and Wisconsin. On a topic where various definitions of "state budget" are fair game, that gives his claim a reasonable basis. Our rating "Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden." Loyola’s on target on taxes, and cites a credible study on spending that is open to challenge but generally defensible. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-09222	Says state's expected "increase in federal political clout is almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/may/17/lone-star-project/democratic-group-credits-hispanic-and-african-amer/	Highlighting the 2011 Legislature’s job of redrawing congressional districts, Washington activist Matt Angle says Texas stands to gain three to four congressional seats thanks to the state's population growth from 2000 to 2010. That’s widely expected. Angle spices his April 29 e-mail blast for the Lone Star Project, the pro-Democratic effort he directs, by saying: “This increase in federal political clout is almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state.” A boom in black and brown residents is driving the pending expansion of congressional power? We sought to learn more. Some background: Relative population changes, as measured by each decennial census, determine whether states gain or lose seats in the 435-member House. Texas is poised to add to its 32 House seats because its population has grown at about twice the national pace. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates there were 24.3 million Texans in 2008, up 17 percent from 20.8 million residents in 2000. In contrast, the nation’s overall estimated growth from 2000 to 2008 was 8 percent. Here's how population affects congressional representation. First, every state gets one House seat. Then the remaining 385 seats are divvied up according to a formula that ultimately gives states with the most residents—California and Texas—the most seats. Angle, referencing the bureau’s estimates, said the state’s African American and Hispanic population increased by 29 percent since 2000 while the “rest of Texas” grew at around 8 percent. “Without the high growth rate of the Hispanic and African American populations,” Angle said, “Texas would have grown at the same rate as the United States and earned no additional congressional seats.” Next, Angle pointed to an April report by the Texas Legislative Council, which advises state legislators. The report includes maps showing that from 2000 to 2008, growth in the Hispanic and black populations outpaced the state’s overall growth in nearly every region. A map suggests the Anglo population exceeded the state's growth rate in 11 of 254 counties. “Over the past decade,” the report says, “the most significant change in the ethnic composition of the state population is the increasing proportion of Hispanics and the decreasing proportion of Anglos.” Hispanics increased from 32 percent of the population in 2000 to 36 percent in 2008, while Anglos fell from 53 percent to 47 percent. “The changes in the Black and Other proportions of the population are small by comparison,” the report says, with black residents amounting to 11 percent of the population both in 2000 and 2008. For outside perspective, we contacted Kimball Brace of Virginia-based Election Data Services, a consulting firm that specializes in reapportionment, redistricting and the census. In December, the firm issued a reapportionment analysis concluding Texas will gain three House seats, possibly four. Brace, looking over the census population estimates for Texas, told us he’d attribute the projected gain largely to Hispanic population growth and not to growth in African Americans. Election Data Services calculates that each House district in Texas will likely be home to 698,552 residents. Presuming that the state’s Hispanic and black population increases by one projected amount, 2.6 million, it’s correct to say the growth equates to nearly four new districts. We wondered if one could just as easily credit Hispanic plus white population growth for the new seats, by limiting the focus to raw population numbers. Our speculation? The census could show a raw increase in the white population that exceeds the numerical increase in African Americans. It goes to reason, then, that the white gains might justify an increase in congressional clout more than the black gains, at least by raw numbers. "You are correct," Brace told us. "In rank order, clearly Hispanic growth is giving (Texas) three out of the four (potential) seats." Both Anglos and African Americans are less significant in that respect. Still, Brace said, other factors besides raw population will come into play when legislators draw districts. Those factors, he said, include relative growth rates of different racial segments, regional distribution of residents and to what degree different segments comprise more or less of the state's population than in 2000. His comments were a reminder that redistricting is a fascinating, complex process with future elections hanging in the balance. "You have this attempt by all groups to push their particular story," Brace said. "Republicans are going to say, 'Hey, we should get at least one (new seat).' Hispanics will say, 'We should get at least three.' African Americans will say, 'Hey we’re significant still'" too. Ed Martin, a Democratic consultant versed in redistricting, said Angle's statement is correct for reasons including the reality that for now, population projections vary widely, while it's undisputed that the relative growth of the state's major population groups place Hispanics first, blacks second and Anglos a distant third. Martin said in an e-mail the "reason Texas can overcome the relatively slow Anglo growth rate to get new seats is the much higher growth rate of Hispanics and African Americans, which far exceeds the national average." Martin's comment prompted us to look at the proportional impact of the growth in black and Hispanic populations in excess of the expected national growth rate of 10 percent. We employed one of several 2010 population projections by the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center to estimate that population growth among black Texans could account for about 90,000, or 6 percent, of the residents fueling the state's congressional seat gains. Meantime, growth in Hispanic Texans in excess of the nation's growth rate could account for more than 1.5 million, or 94 percent, of the additional residents driving the gains. Martin cautioned against using any projection to reach conclusions. He said in an e-mail: "Unless you gather a lot of projections and somehow average them out and make an informed decision about why a lot of smart people come up with different numbers, using any single projected raw number is not reliable." In the end? We're persuaded that Hispanic growth alone stands to merit most credit for Texas gaining three to four additional House seats, but no one can say for certain until the census is complete. We rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Lone Star Project	None	None	None	2010-05-17T06:19:56	2010-04-29	['Texas', 'African_American']

pomt-02164	Jules Bailey "was instrumental in creating the Business Energy Tax Credit that let companies like Wal-Mart profit by $11 million while costing the Oregon general fund $33 million."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2014/may/01/brian-wilson/was-jules-bailey-instrumental-creating-oregons-bus/	One tool government has for steering policy is making tax credits and other incentives available to private companies. You want new development in a tired part of the city? Limit property taxes for qualified investors. Want to cap the burning of fossil fuels? Offer tax credits for new solar and wind projects. Such tax breaks remain politically contentious, however, with critics questioning the use of tax dollars to benefit for-profit corporations. The claim: In Portland, Brian Wilson faces Jules Bailey, currently a legislator, in the May 20 primary election for the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Deborah Kafoury, who is running for board chair. Wilson, in an April 28, 2014, email to supporters, dinged Bailey for his involvement with the controversial Business Energy Tax Credit, a program that drew withering criticism in recent years for its ballooning costs. The email describes Bailey’s supporters as including "corporate lobbyists and out-of-state special interest groups." It adds, "He was instrumental in creating the Business Energy Tax Credit that let companies like Wal-Mart profit by $11 million while costing the Oregon general fund $33 million." Really? We decided to check. The analysis: First, we checked the numbers. Those are accurate, as reported in a story by Harry Esteve, a politics reporter for The Oregonian, in 2009. On the central issue -- Bailey’s role -- we contacted Bailey, who sent an email saying Wilson is in error. "I think he must have me confused with some other legislator," Bailey wrote. "Since the day I was elected, I have spent every term reining in the abuses of the BETC." He suggested we call several other sources, including the state Legislature’s Revenue Office, to verify his assertion. Chris Allanach, a senior economist in the Revenue Office, said, yes, the BETC program had been clouded with controversy and that Bailey had played a pivotal role -- not in championing the program, as Wilson claimed, but in reining it in. Bailey sponsored a bill in the 2009 legislative session that affixed sunset dates to all of the program’s tax credits, Allanach said. Bailey also carried the bill, which ultimately passed, on the House floor. Then, during the 2011 session, Bailey co-chaired the Joint Committee on Tax Credits, which carried on the work of the earlier bill, Allanach said. One result of that work means the state now can sell only $3 million in renewable-energy tax credits in any two-year period. Before the new limits, upward of $300 million in credits were being sold per two-year budget cycle. Wanting more information on the history of the program, we called the Oregon Department of Energy. Diana Enright, a department spokeswoman, emailed a chronology showing that the 1979 Legislature created the tax credit incentives that later became the Business Energy Tax Credit program. A sizable expansion of the program occurred in 2007, when the BETC increased from 35 percent to 50 percent for renewable energy projects. From checking Bailey’s legislative website, we know he was first elected in 2008. His first session was 2009. That meant he showed up in Salem 30 years after the program was born and two years after the expansion that triggered most of the controversy. Both of those dates contradict Wilson’s claim that Bailey was "instrumental in creating" the program. We called Wilson for his reaction. "Our using the word ‘created’ probably was an inaccurate choice of words," he said. "But he was very much involved with it once he got to the Legislature. He’s been vociferous in his defense of it." When asked what constituted Bailey’s "vociferous" defense of the BETC, Wilson hedged. "I was really referring to his umbrella statement that he’s spent his time in Salem closing all sorts of corporate loopholes," Wilson said. "It was more about that than the BETC in particular." In a follow-up call, PolitiFact Oregon told Wilson of Allanach’s view of Bailey’s work. "That’s better information than we had," Wilson said. Various sources that have been helping his campaign, he added, told him that Bailey was "vulnerable" on the BETC issue. "I never want to put out something that isn’t true," he said. "We will definitely make sure that we correct our information." The ruling: Brian Wilson, in taking on Jules Bailey in the May 20 Democratic primary, claimed Bailey was "instrumental" in creating controversial business tax credits. The program was created long before Bailey was elected, and its expansion to include credits for renewable energy projects occurred two years before Bailey was sworn in. A senior state economist who worked extensively on the program characterized Bailey’s work as "clamping down" on the amount of breaks given away. Further, a bill Bailey helped sponsor in his first session, along with a committee he co-chaired in 2011, effectively led to the program’s demise. Wilson, when told that a senior legislative economist backed the notion that Bailey worked to rein in the BETC, said he would amend his claim. Even a modicum of research, however, would have turned up evidence that Bailey had nothing to do with creating the program and that he did, in fact, work over several years to limit it.

pomt-11109	"New law (in California) makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/07/blog-posting/it-illegal-shower-and-do-laundry-same-day-californ/	A new fury is circulating on social media over two water conservation laws signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown. The legislation imposes new restrictions on water use as California recovers from a historic five-year drought that ended in April 2017. But several reports inaccurately stated that the laws would punish state residents who use too much water in their everyday routine. "New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day," said a June 5, 2018, headline from the Federalist Papers Project, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Federalist Papers Project story references a similar post from conservative website Breitbart, but seems to have gathered most of its information from an article on The Organic Prepper, a blog devoted to "preparedness, health, frugality and food," according to its about page. Several other websites reposted The Organic Prepper’s report or wrote similar articles. Even U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., seemed to push the false narrative online. In a blog post, Nunes wrote, "Californians don’t want to have to choose between doing their laundry and taking a shower, but that’s the kind of choice being forced on us." The false reports center on two bills — Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 — that Brown signed into law May 31, 2018. Broadly speaking, the bills instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the Federalist Papers Project story said the bills would limit California residents to 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day, beginning in 2022. Violators who use more water than allowed, the story went, would be fined $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day during drought emergencies. The story said this limit "will turn the most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers" by making it illegal to take a shower and run a load of laundry in a single day. Here, the Federalist Papers Project borrowed calculations from The Organic Prepper’s story, which said the average shower and laundry load use 17 and 40 gallons of water, respectively, for a total of 57 daily gallons — two more gallons than would be allowed were California residents actually limited to 55 gallons of indoor water use per day. But that is where the Federalist Papers Project got it wrong: Under the new legislation, Californians will not actually be penalized on an individual basis for excessive water use. In reality, the bills stipulate that cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts must come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022. They will then need to meet their targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies. George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by three standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use — a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030. The other standards, both yet to be determined, will place similar caps on outdoor residential water use and water loss due to system leaks. "Unfortunately some media outlets have grossly misinterpreted the law," Kostyrko said. "These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal." Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668, explained that the legislation "sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level, but it does not regulate what individual Californians or businesses can and can’t do." "There is nothing in this bill to target households or companies," Metropulos wrote in an email. "Water use objectives are on territory-level of a water agency. There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry." This means that the Federalist Papers Project story was wrong to suggest that water use would be assessed on a daily individual basis. "The new requirements are for water districts, not individuals," said Katie Hanzlik, press secretary for state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, who authored Senate Bill 606. "And the number is based on average water use." Fines based on consumption will actually be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their targets, rather than individuals who use too much water on a given day. And while a water district could theoretically let those costs shift to individual water bills, any increase in costs assumed by ratepayers would be closer to a few bucks than $1,000. For the record, it is also worth noting that washing machines are more efficient than they used to be, which calls into question some of the water-use estimates mentioned in the false reports. Daisy Luther, author of The Organic Prepper, told us she got the figures for her story’s 57-gallon estimate from Home Water Works, a project from the nonprofit Alliance for Water Efficiency in collaboration with Chicago’s Field Museum. (The Federalist Papers Project did not respond to a request for comment.) The Organic Prepper story reported that an average shower uses 17 gallons of water and an average load of laundry uses 40, and Luther said the 40-gallon figure was listed as the average for older washing machines. But most people now own high-efficiency laundry machines that use between 15 and 30 gallons per wash, according to Home Water Works. And since it is the average water use per capita that matters, one person’s reliance on an older machine would likely be offset by other residents who are not using so much water. Our ruling A headline stated, "New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day." The new California legislation does not actually make this combination illegal, nor does it create a financial penalty for residents whose water use exceeds a 55-gallon daily limit. Some Californians will need to use less water, but the police will not come knocking or demanding hefty fines should someone shower and do laundry on the same day. We rate this statement False. Update: The Federalist Papers Project responded to our request for comment shortly after publication, saying its report was "accurate based on the source we used" and linking to an article in Fox News’ opinion section. Our ruling remains the same. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-06-07T15:12:49	2018-06-05	['California']

pomt-03074	The highest paid employee of the State of Rhode Island is a basketball coach.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/29/deadspin/deadspin-says-uri-basketball-coach-highest-paid-ri/	For years, the lofty pay of college football and basketball coaches has been the subject of controversy. And that has drawn the attention of the popular sports website Deadspin. Deadspin claims, based on news media reports and state salary databases, that the large majority of the highest-paid state employees in each state are football and basketball coaches, some of whom have multimillion-dollar compensation packages. And the website says that this calls into question our priorities as a society. The highest-paid employee in Rhode Island, according to Deadspin, is the men’s basketball coach at the University of Rhode Island. We know that has been true in the past, but we decided to dig into the numbers to see whether it remains true. A quick trip to the state’s "Transparency Portal" website confirmed what we suspected -- URI basketball coach Daniel Hurley is the highest-paid, at $597,500 per year. Hurley actually can bank a lot more money than that -- but we’ll address that later. The second highest-paid -- but well behind Hurley -- is URI President David M. Dooley, at $320,000. After Hurley and Dooley, according to the Transparency Portal, the top five include Stella Adeniyi, a registered nurse in the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, at $276,335 (she exceeds her base pay in overtime alone); Ray M. DiPasquale, president of the Community College of Rhode Island, $265,000; and Donald DeHayes, URI provost and vice president for academic affairs, $245,923. By comparison, Governor Chafee earns a salary of $129,210. We asked URI spokeswoman Linda Acciardo to provide a detailed account of Hurley’s compensation. She provided his contract. The sources and total of Hurley’s compensation, under his six-year employment contract, which expires April 7, 2018, may come as a revelation to some Rhode Islanders. He begins with a base salary of $300,000 and adds another $297,500 in bonuses and incentives -- all payable with university money -- but that’s not all. In our examination, we won’t cover non-cash benefits because those are excluded from Deadspin’s report. But as an aside, we note that Hurley’s benefits include the receipt of 20 VIP tickets for each men’s basketball home game and two parking passes for all URI athletic events. If his Rams team qualifies for the Atlantic 10 conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association or National Invitation Tournament playoffs, he would receive 12 tickets for each game in which the Rams appear. If his team makes it to the NCAA "Final 4," he would receive four tickets. Also not counted in his annual cash compensation of $597,500, but potentially lucrative, is his contractual entitlement to operate a summer youth basketball camp and to keep the proceeds, minus the cost of using URI facilities. But let’s return to those cash bonuses and incentives above and beyond his $300,000 base salary. They include a guaranteed $175,000 of the gate receipts for home games, escalating by $15,000 on Oct. 1 of each year of the contract. So, this Oct. 1 he is scheduled to begin receiving $190,000, paid in quarterly installments. He is also guaranteed $65,000 for one away game. That money comes from a guarantee fee paid by the hosting school. Major programs routinely offer guarantee fees to attract non-conference opponents to their arenas, without having to later visit those schools as in a traditional home-and-home arrangement. In recent years, URI has been paid varying fees to visit Auburn, Syracuse and Duke; this year, it will make a visit to Louisiana State. Other guaranteed payments are $50,000 to participate in the men’s basketball radio and TV programs; $10,000 to participate in athletic events and other university functions; and a $12,000 "motor vehicle stipend" paid with donations raised by the Fast Break Basketball Booster Club. In addition, if the booster club generates gross revenue of at least $150,000, Hurley would be paid $5,000 by the club; if the gross ticket revenue for home games exceeds $1 million, he would be paid $25,000; and if his team members achieve a 2.5 grade point average or a 2.75 grade point average, he would be paid $7,500 or $10,000, respectively. Hurley also receives a maximum $8,000 annually, from booster club donations, to pay dues and other costs arising from his membership in a beach or country club. Then there are a series of potential, but much less likely, payments by URI -- none of which he has achieved in the one full season since he was hired -- depending on how the team finishes and whether he wins a coaching honor. If the team finishes first or tied for first in its conference, or if it wins the conference tournament championship, he gets another $20,000. If URI plays in a first, second and third-round NCAA post-season tournament game, Hurley gets $20,000 per game. And if the team reaches the "Sweet 16," "Elite 8," "Final 4," and national championship post-season rounds, he gets an additional $25,000 for each game played in those rounds. It is worthwhile to remember that the Rams have not qualified for the NCAA Tournament since 1999, have gone to the Sweet 16 only twice in history, to the Elite 8, once, and to the Final 4 or national championship game, never. If URI goes to the lesser post-season tournament, the NIT, he gets $5,000. If he wins Coach of the Year from the Atlantic 10 or a successor conference, he scores a $5,000 bonus, and NCAA National Coach of the Year, $10,000. The total of the guaranteed cash sums to be paid directly with university money is $600,000, which is $2,500 more than the $597,500 listed for Hurley in the Transparency Portal. Acciardo said the slight discrepancy probably is attributable to payments due but actually disbursed outside the 2012-2013 fiscal year. Our ruling The sports website Deadspin says the University of Rhode Island men’s basketball coach is the highest paid state employee. It’s a slam dunk. The judges rate the claim True.

pomt-14374	"For more than 80 years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year. This is simply not the time to break with decades of bipartisan practice."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/mar/18/jennifer-horn/nhgop-chairwoman-says-lame-duck-presidents-dont-no/	The ongoing partisan feud over President Obama’s Supreme Court nomination Merrick Garland made its way to New Hampshire, where U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte says the next president should select a justice instead. State Republican chairwoman Jennifer Horn echoed Ayotte’s sentiment and issued a statement criticizing Obama’s move. "Republicans have repeatedly stated that the American people deserve a voice in the process of selecting the next Supreme Court Justice, and I wholeheartedly agree," Horn wrote. "For more than eighty years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year. This is simply not the time to break with decades of bipartisan practice." We were struck by Horn’s assertion that more than eight decades had passed since a president and U.S. Senate found themselves in this situation. We decided to take a look. It turns out that an almost identical statement was made by presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on the Feb. 14, 2016, edition of Meet the Press. There, he told host Chuck Todd that ""It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year." As PolitiFact reported at the time, that’s largely true -- but not because of "tradition" (Cruz’s words) or "bipartisan practice" (Horn’s words). Instead, it’s because it’s simply rare for this combination of circumstances to occur. "This is entirely a matter of circumstance," Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist, told us in February. "Certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year or by senators refusing to consider such nominations." When asked for background on Horn’s comment, state GOP spokesman Ross Berry pointed to Benjamin Cardoza, who was nominated to the court by President Herbert Hoover on Feb 15, 1932, and confirmed by the Senate on Feb 24. But there’s a more recent case. That came during the election year of 1940, when President Franklin Roosevelt picked Frank Murphy for the court. The nomination was Jan. 4, 1940, and the Senate approved him through a voice vote on Jan. 16. That’s 76 years ago, not "more than 80 years," as Horn said. In 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower put William Brennan on the court through a recess appointment. Brennan was confirmed by the full Senate the next year. President Lyndon Johnson attempted to select a justice during the presidential election year of 1968, but both of his picks were turned aside. And most recently, the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy on Feb. 3, 1988 -- but President Reagan nominated him on Nov. 30, 1987. This thumbnail sketch of the last eight decades clarifies both Cruz’s and Horn’s statements. First, it hasn’t been "more than 80 years" since a nomination and confirmation came in an election year. Roosevelt’s nomination of Murphy was 76 years ago. Also, there simply haven’t been many cases of seats on the court coming open during election years. Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution, a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, said that was likely a matter of choice by the justices themselves. "Justices rarely leave active service in an election year, because they know, at least in the modern era of contentious confirmation battles, that their colleagues will be short staffed because of the unlikelihood of an election-year confirmation of a successor," Wheeler told us in February. "Justices in the modern era rarely die in office." What’s more, it’s important to note that in each case in which a Supreme Court seat came open during an election year, the president at the time nominated a candidate for the seat. To say Obama would be breaking from practice by nominating a justice isn’t accurate. Our ruling New Hampshire Republican chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that "For more than eighty years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year." The time elapsed is actually 76 years, but Horn’s statement is otherwise accurate. Her following sentence, that this means there are "decades of bipartisan practice" of not filling seats, is more dubious. Few such positions have come open during that time and when they have, presidents have pushed forward with nominees.

pomt-05245	The federal government "reviewed and verified" his administration’s numbers showing Wisconsin added 23,608 jobs in 2011.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/01/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-federal-officials-verified-h/	In the final gubernatorial recall debate, Gov. Scott Walker sought to close the door on opponent Tom Barrett’s claim that Wisconsin lost jobs in 2011, as monthly surveys of businesses have shown. His administration had drawn criticism in mid May from Democrats for rushing out much more favorable jobs numbers -- part of a more detailed census of businesses -- before federal labor officials could sign off on them. In the May 31, 2012 debate, Walker stressed that those federal officials had now completed their review of the more comprehensive data -- and confirmed that Wisconsin not only hadn’t lost jobs in Walker’s first year, but gained even more than state officials thought. "Yesterday the US Bureau of Labor Statistics … sent an email to the state’s Workforce Development department saying they’ve reviewed and verified the numbers," Walker said, adding the agency had put the job gain at 23,608, a bit larger than Walker’s preliminary number from mid-May. Barrett pounced, saying that a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics official was quoted in the Journal Sentinel as saying the numbers were not in fact final. So who’s right? BLS officials could clear this up, but they have chosen to stick with their policy of not commenting on any individual state’s data before they post the numbers for all 50 states on the federal agency’s website in late June 2012 -- weeks after the recall election. They repeated to us what they have said to other reporters: They have completed their review but can’t say anything about the quality of the numbers. "BLS approved the submission of Wisconsin data as part of the normal processing of data, but does not comment on data until released by BLS," the agency’s chief spokesman, Gary Steinberg, said in an email. The Walker administration has released a cryptic email chain with federal and state officials that it says confirms that federal officials are OK with the numbers crunched by Walker’s administration. Walker cited this in the debate. The emails are not easy to interpret. The emails’ reference to the quarterly census of jobs is the number "202," a federal designation for the census. BLS officials in the email chain are with the BLS’s "Current Data Analysis" section, or CDA. One of the emails tells state officials: "As discussed, CDA has declared the data for the BLS publication to be preliminarily clean." In another, a BLS-to-BLS exchange, the message is: "CDA has declared final signoff." Notably, the emails do not spell out what numbers they are signing off on. Steinberg, of BLS, made clear that "any state may release its data when ready and does not need to wait for BLS to release data." For instance, Minnesota also has released its quarterly census data and -- similar to Wisconsin -- the data shows a much larger job gain than the monthly estimates. Minnesota released its data only after BLS reviewed and verified it. Wisconsin, by contrast, put its numbers out -- and Walker immediately put them in campaign TV ads -- before BLS had verified them. Our rating Walker said the federal government had signed off on the positive jobs numbers and provided some information that supports Walker’s claim. But his statement leaves out the fact federal officials publicly will not verify the numbers, and the fact that the emails released do not contain any numbers, let alone the ones cited. Those missing, important details land his claim at Half True. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's website).

pomt-01470	On the economic stimulus.	half flip	/florida/statements/2014/sep/30/charlie-crist/crist-favored-then-opposed-then-favored-economic-s/	As the campaign for governor heats up, an old charge against Charlie Crist has been revived. A new ad from the Republican Party of Florida calls it "flippin’ unbelievable" -- then recounts how Crist has flip-flopped on, well, many things. One of those things is the stimulus. The ad uses clips of Crist’s own contradictory comments before concluding, "That’s flippin’ nuts." We decided to put Crist’s position on our Flip-O-Meter to see how its changed over the years. In this case, Crist supported the stimulus, suggested he didn't support it and then supported it again. Throughout, he praised the stimulus for preventing teacher layoffs in Florida. Back in 2009, when he was still Florida governor, Crist supported the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The law pumped $787 billion into a sputtering economy after the financial crisis of 2008. Crist was one of 19 governors who wrote President Barack Obama on Feb. 3, 2009, in support of the stimulus. "As stewards of the economies of our respective states and regions, we urge the Congress to reach prompt resolution of all outstanding differences and you to sign the bill when it reaches your desk," the letter said. Crist made many other positive comments about the stimulus, including when he appeared at rally in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009, with Obama. "We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package,'' Crist said. Crist then backed away from that support when he was competing to win the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. His made his most notable comments during this period in a Nov. 4, 2009, interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN. First, Crist criticized Obama for excessive spending. "You know, unfortunately, the president thinks that everything we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money, and that's just wrong," he said. "Frankly, enough is enough. And I know that the people understand that. And I understand it. And I understand it because I'm the grandson of a Greek immigrant who came to this country with nothing, really taught me the value of a dollar, because his first job in America, in Altoona, Pa., was shining shoes for a living for $5 a month." Crist also tried to disavow his earlier support for the stimulus, saying "I didn’t endorse it." Back then, PolitiFact Florida rated his statement Pants on Fire. But Crist also said he appreciated that the stimulus preserved teaching jobs. Frankly, Crist was being simultaneously critical of the stimulus' spending while praising the spending that helped save teachers' jobs. "Well, I didn't endorse it. I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing. But I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians. Let me give you just one example of the difference that made. We would have had to let go of over 20,000 schoolteachers in Florida if we hadn't had that support. And, frankly, I kind of look at it like Florida taxpayers' dollars coming back to the state to benefit them. You know, I used to work for a great U.S. senator named Connie Mack, a true fiscal conservative, as am I. And he always, you know, would stress to us on the staff, let's make sure we get Florida's fear share." More recently, Crist has talked again of saving the jobs of 20,000 school teachers thanks to his acceptance of the stimulus. In a March 2014 interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley, Crist had this to say: "You know, I'm always comfortable telling the truth, but that turnaround started at the end of my term, and one of the reasons is I accepted the stimulus money, saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers, firefighters. It was the right thing to do when President Obama said, I want to help you, and I said yes as a Republican to a Democratic president not because it was political, but because it was right." Our ruling Crist initially supported the stimulus when it was passed in 2009 before softening his support of it in 2010 in an attempt to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Now he supports it again. Throughout all of that, he spoke positively about the stimulus preventing teacher layoffs. His public statements show a partial change of position. We rate it a Half Flip.

pomt-01175	"When (Barack Obama) took office, 2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/09/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-number-unemployed-has-risen/	Late last week, the federal government announced what was widely perceived as a strong jobs report, with an increase of 321,000 jobs over the previous month. This capped a year of the most robust employment growth in years. But that hasn’t stopped criticism about weak job gains from circulating on social media. Around the time the new job numbers were being released, a reader asked us to check a meme circulating on social media. The meme features an image of a glum-looking President Barack Obama, along with the caption, "When he took office, 2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work. In what world is this recovery?" It was posted by a Facebook page and Twitter account called Barack Obama's Dead Fly. (The user’s odd name presumably stems from a 2009 incident in which Obama, during a televised interview, slapped dead a fly that had been bothering him.) The meme’s claim was so out of step with recent jobs data that we decided to delve into the official numbers produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, we looked at the most basic measure: How many people were officially categorized as unemployed in January 2009, compared to the number today? We found that there were almost 12.1 million Americans classified as unemployed in 2009, and a bit over 9.1 million in November 2014. Not only are both of the specific job figures in the meme way off-base, but the trend line is even less accurate -- the number of unemployed Americans has declined by 3 million, or by one-fourth, since Obama took office. Tweaking the time frame doesn’t help, either. If you look at the weakest point of Obama’s tenure -- October 2009 -- there were a little less than 15.4 million unemployed Americans, making the decline to today even steeper -- 6.3 million people, or a 41 percent decline. Similarly, pushing the end time to earlier in 2014 (when the meme may have been made) doesn’t change the overall picture. Could the meme creator have been using a different, broader measurement to define the term "out of work"? Just in case, we took another crack with expanded measures. First, we added together three struggling groups -- the number of people who are unemployed, the number of people who are officially employed but are working part-time because of economic headwinds, and the number of "discouraged" workers who want to work but have stopped looking and thus aren’t counted as being in the labor force. Did the combination of these three categories support the meme’s message? No. In January 2009, this broader measurement of employment distress included 20.8 million people, a number that fell to 16.7 million people by November 2014 -- a decline of 4.1 million, or about one-fifth. This statistic doesn’t support the meme’s claims, either. Finally, we looked at the number of Americans age 16 and up who were not employed -- for whatever reason -- on both of those dates. In January 2009, there were 92.4 million Americans who were not employed. By November 2014, there were 101.5 million, an increase of 9.1 million. This comparison shows a growth in non-working Americans, as the meme did, but the numbers are vastly higher than the meme says, so this couldn’t be the source of the statistic. In addition, the rise in non-working Americans is shaped at least in part by factors out of Obama’s control, including the retirement of the baby boom generation and longer lifespans. Put simply, it’s not a great indicator of the labor market. We asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, whether he could think of any statistic we overlooked. He said we could have considered a particular state, such as California, which is both large and has struggled economically. But when he looked at the numbers, he found that California’s unemployment level was 1.87 million in January 2009 and dropped to 1.31 million by October 2014, the latest month available. So this doesn’t support the meme either. The person who created meme "appears to be very far removed from the national-level unemployment statistics," Burtless said. Our ruling The meme claims that when Obama took office, "2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work." No national figure produces the specific numbers cited in the meme -- and, more importantly, the direction of the changes are flatly opposite to what the meme claims. By almost every metric you can use to calculate the number of Americans who are "out of work," the number has been going down, not up. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06074	Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-didnt-expand-us-trad/	During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s trade policies. "We have to open up markets for our goods," Romney said. "We haven't done that under this president. European nations and China over the last three years have opened up 44 different trade relationships with various nations in the world. This president has opened up none." We won’t check the claim about European and Chinese trade deals here, but we will look at whether Romney is correct about Obama’s record on trade agreements. After lengthy negotiations, Obama signed trade agreements with three separate nations on Oct. 21, 2011 -- South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. These were not trivial deals. The one with South Korea, in particular, was "the largest trade deal since 1994," when the U.S. approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing administration data. The South Korea deal was poised to increase U.S. export access "for everything from cars to farm goods," Bloomberg wrote. All three deals were initially forged under President George W. Bush, but Bush was unable to get the deals past a Democratic-controlled Congress. After the GOP took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans pointed to the proposed deals as rare areas of possible cooperation between the two parties. But implementation negotiations initially stalled amid administration insistence on securing protections for workers. During the 2008 campaign, Obama had promised to "use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world." Even though negotiations with lawmakers dragged on, the administration was ultimately able to secure a legislative formulation that could garner enough votes to pass. Doing so required some political risk for the president with his own base, since a sizable faction within his own party is skeptical of expanding free trade agreements. (Public Citizen, a group that opposed all three agreements, produced a detailed comparison of what Obama promised and what the trade agreement with South Korea contains.) We asked the Romney camp for their view, and a spokesman said that Romney was referring to new deals initiated and completed by this administration, rather than deals initiated during the previous administration and closed by Obama. But we think that's a misleading standard. If that's what Romney means, he's effectively stripping Obama of any credit for enactment of the three trade agreements, when in fact bringing them to fruition required significant negotiating efforts with lawmakers of the opposite party (and led to an achievement that eluded his predecessor, Bush). Our ruling It did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements’ relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers. To say of "trade relationships" that Obama "has opened up none" deserves a rating of False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-08T16:53:44	2012-01-07	['None']

pomt-10273	On whether he wants to be vice president.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/24/joe-biden/he-seems-interested/	"I will not be vice president under any circumstances." - Sen. Joseph Biden, April 29, 2007, NBC's Meet the Press "I am not interested in the vice presidency." - Biden, June 22, 2008, NBC's Meet the Press Well, on Aug. 23, there was Biden in Illinois standing next to Sen. Barack Obama – his brand new running mate. "President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place, then stand firm," Biden said. "Today in Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I'm proud to stand firm with the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama!" Look, we realize there's a sort of ritual dance that goes on when politicians are put in the awkward spot of being asked if they want to be picked as a vice presidential running mate. Rare is the politician who says, "Heck yeah, I've even lobbied for it." That smells of desperation and seems a recipe for future embarrassment. More often, potential vice presidential short-listers demur, or say the question is too hypothetical or that it's just plain moot because they aren't going to be asked anyway. Some avoid the query altogether, saying it's a question for the presidential candidate. And then there's Biden's route, the I'm-not-interested route. Never mind that few actually believed him – we all know the drill. And to be fair, let's put the earlier quotes in some context. The first, "I will not be vice president under any circumstances," came when Biden was still a presidential candidate himself. You don't concede interest in the No. 2 job when you're still in the hunt for the No. 1 job. But Biden was long out of the presidential race when NBC's Brian Williams asked him on Meet the Press on June 22, 2008, "Are you interested in the vice presidency?" "I am not interested in the vice presidency," Biden said. Williams asked again, "You are not interested in the vice presidency?" "I'm not interested," Biden repeated. But Williams, who knows the game, then asked if Biden would say yes if asked. "Unlike most other people, I'm being straight with you," Biden said. "If asked, I will do it. I've made it clear I...do...not...want...to...be...asked." He pounded his hand on the desk with each word for emphasis. Williams summarized, "Do not want to be asked but, if asked, the answer, of course, would be yes." "Of course," Biden said, "it would, because the – if the presidential nominee thought I could help him win, I'm going to say to the first African-American candidate about to make history in the world that, 'No, I will not help you out like you want me to?' Of course, I'll say yes." So the question here, were Biden's earlier pronouncements a flip-flop? Yes, given Biden's adamant tone. We realize his remarks were part of this well-known dance, but when you pound the table to emphasize your position, you tip the scale to a Full Flop.

pomt-14578	"Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War on Iraq. I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/07/bernie-sanders/foreign-policy-spat-bernie-sanders-suggests-madele/	Bernie Sanders is feuding with a female former secretary of state over foreign policy, but her name isn’t Hillary Clinton. On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd played Sanders a clip of Madeleine Albright, who supports Clinton and served as President Bill Clinton’s top diplomat, expressing concern over Sanders’ lack of foreign policy knowledge and interest. Sanders dismissed Albright’s suggestion and, in turn, questioned her judgment. "Now, I don’t really know this. Maybe the answer is different. Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War in Iraq," Sanders asked. "I don’t know," Todd admitted. "I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported that war," Sanders said. "The issue here is not just experience. The issue here is judgment." Surprise! The answer is different, and complicated. Sanders may have couched his comments, but his suggestion that Albright was a war hawk is clear, and inaccurate. Albright’s position was more nuanced. Neither a hawk nor a dove An Albright spokeswoman referred us to an op-ed column Albright penned in the New York Times on Sept. 13, 2002 — about six months before the start of the war on March 20, 2003 — urging President George W. Bush to focus on destroying al-Qaida rather than invading Iraq. "It makes little sense now to focus the world's attention and our own military, intelligence, diplomatic and financial resources on a plan to invade Iraq instead of on al-Qaeda's ongoing plans to murder innocent people. We cannot fight a second monumental struggle without detracting from the first one," Albright wrote. The Sanders camp, meanwhile, forwarded us an interview Albright did with the Globalist in September 2003 — months after the invasion — that seems to suggest her support for the war. When asked if she agrees with the premise of the war, Albright said, "I personally felt the war was justified on the basis of Saddam’s decade-long refusal to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on WMD (weapons of mass destruction)." Wait a second, did Albright change her position and jump on the war wagon? Searching transcript and news interviews in between those two comments, we found that Albright has said she would support the troops if it came to that, but she continuously questioned the Bush administration's’ eagerness to invade Iraq. Here’s a sampling of comments she made: • Aug. 22, 2002, PBS Newshour: "(Iraq) is not a direct threat to the United States, which is why, I think, we need to have a discussion about whether we will be or would be better off with an attack or a pre-emptive attack on Iraq from where we are now, where, in fact, I believe that Iraq and Saddam Hussein are contained pretty well within this sanctions box." • Sept. 13, 2002, NBC’s Today: "I think that there would be a great diversion from our need to fight terrorism if we now all of a sudden redeploy a lot of our intelligence capabilities and capacities and forces to deal with a war in Iraq. … I think if we are going to go into a full-scale war, it should be possible to provide more, in terms of ways that they can see things." • Sept. 26, 2002, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing: "I also hope it will not be necessary to use the authority in question. America must respond firmly to Saddam Hussein and it may be necessary to wage war to remove him. But I do not share the irrational exuberance for this conflict that is present among some pundits and perhaps even a few administration officials." • Dec. 5, 2002, ABC’s Good Morning America: Regarding whether it is the right moment to move toward war, she said, "The timing of this is something that troubles me. And I think we need to know more about what all this is about. You know, a lot of people who have been asking questions or accused of being unpatriotic. My sense is is that it's our patriotic duty as citizens to ask the questions." • Jan. 29, 2003, NBC’s Today: "I think (President Bush) yes, yet again really presented a case against Saddam. I mean, we've heard all that. But I don't (think) that it was convincing enough for me as to why (war) has to happen instantly." • Feb. 9, 2003, NBC’s Meet the Press: "I think we're going to war, and so I will support the president and I will support our troops in Iraq. ... So I am not flat-out saying that I think this is a mistake. What I'm saying, though, is that we cannot avoid thinking about al-Qaida and the fight on terrorism and North Korea. And in the last few days, there are some additional problems between India and Pakistan, and we have a lot of issues on the table." • March 17, 2003, PBS Newshour: "My sense now is we are doing it in the worst way. Not in fact that there is any reason to defend Saddam Hussein — I agree completely and have for a long time with the why of what President Bush has said. But the timing of it, kind of an elective war, pre-emptive action, a serious attack on the United Nations, generally questions about where the institutional structure of the post World War II world is coming to, are all questions that I think need to be considered — and that are issues that show the inevitable, the avoidable consequences, inevitable consequences that will come from this. ... And let me say that as soon as we go to war, I think all of us that have had arguments against this will make very clear that we support our troops." After the war began, Albright remained a critic. • March 20, 2003, CNN American Morning: "My reactions are that it is actually a very sad day that we have had to go in this direction. Obviously, we are all very supportive of our troops who, in watching what has been going on, are quite brilliant. ... And I just think that this is a difficult war. The president has already warned us that it's going to be longer than people think. I hope very much that that part of it can get over as quickly as possible and that we are able to move into the reconstruction phase." • Sept. 21, 2003, NBC’s Meet the Press: "I understood the why of the war ... But I always said that I didn’t know why now. ... And then, I think the part that is very hard to deal with, is the administration keeps changing the rationale for why the war, which is very confusing and does lead people to wonder why we did it at the time that we did." • Oct. 21, 2003, The Herald Sun op-ed column: "The Iraq war was a war of choice. When I was Secretary of State I said many of the same things about Saddam Hussein that President Bush has said. But I never thought he constituted a level of threat that required immediate action." To be fair, it’s not entirely unreasonable for Sanders to have assumed Albright supported the war, given her record as a staunch critic of Saddam Hussein, said Tom Lippman, a journalist and author of Madeleine Albright And The New American Diplomacy. Unfortunately, the record doesn’t back his assumption. What’s more, Albright’s comments on the invasion — recognizing Saddam Hussein as a threat and a tyrant but not necessarily a reason for war — sound similar to what Sanders himself was saying. "The question, Mr. Speaker, is not whether we like Saddam Hussein or not. The question is whether he represents an imminent threat to the American people and whether a unilateral invasion of Iraq will do more harm than good," Sanders said on the House floor Oct. 9, 2002. Our ruling Sanders said, "Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War in Iraq. ... I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported that war." While Albright has voiced support for the troops and said she understands the rationale behind the war, her comments suggest she would have rather avoided the invasion.

pomt-01397	Says PolitiFact has ruled that Ed Gillespie’s ads are false and misleading.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/13/mark-warner/warner-embelishes-politifact-finding-gillespie-ad/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner is airing a TV ad accusing Ed Gillespie, his Republican opponent, of running deceptive campaign commercials. Warner cited two of our Truth-O-Meters as proof. "Ed Gillespie … is attacking Mark Warner with false ads experts call misleading, completely made up," the narrator of ad says. While those words are being spoken, the written words "SIMPLY FALSE" and "MISLEADING" pop up on the screen with citations from PolitiFact this year -- the first from Sept. 28 and the second from April 25. Let’s take a look at what we actually said about the Gillespie claims that Warner denounces. The first case concerns a False rating we gave to a recent Gillespie ad that indicated our colleagues at PolitiFact National gave Warner its "Lie of the Year" award in 2013 for promising four years earlier that he wouldn’t vote for health care reform that took away insurance plans people like. We did use words "simply false" in the ruling summary. PolitiFact’s story announcing to lie of the year never mentioned Warner. It focused on President Barack Obama’s repeated promises that under the Affordable Care Act, "If you like you insurance, you can keep it." Obama made the promise at least 37 times over the years and stood by it long after he enacted regulations that guaranteed some people would lose that plans because of minimum coverage requirements in the ACA. The second citation by Warner concerns a fact check we did on a statement by the Republican Party of Virginia that Warner has voted with the president "97 percent of the time." But far from debunking the claim -- which has become a staple of Gillespie’s speeches and ads -- we rated it True. We pointed out a few issues with the statistic, which is compiled by CQ Weekly, a nonpartisan Washington news service once known as Congressional Quarterly. For one thing, Obama has taken a position only 28 percent of the bills Warner has voted on, and more than half of those were for confirmation of presidential appointees. Also, Senate Democrats on the whole have backed the president 95.4 percent of the time during Warner’s term. Warner most notably backed the president when he voted for Obamacare in 2010. He’s bucked the president by voting against regulating assault weapons and against delaying the start of automatic budget cuts in 2013. Warner says the presidential support rating ignores his efforts to work across the aisle with Republicans, particularly trying to fashion a bipartisan plan to reduce debt. He correctly notes that several congressional watchdogs have rated him among the most conservative Senate Democrats. Did we call the statistic misleading? Nope. But a political scientist we quoted did. Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said, "To imagine that Warner votes like a politburo member for the president would be misleading." Our ruling A Warner TV commercial says PolitiFact Virginia has frowned upon two negative claims that have aired in Gillespie ads. Warner’s right that we labeled as "simply false," the indication in one Gillespie ad’s that the Warner was awarded the "Lie of the Year" by our colleagues at PolitiFact National. But the senator is wrong in suggesting we labeled as "misleading" another attack by his opponent -- that Warner has voted with the president 97 percent of the time. In fact, we rated the statistic True. In the article, we quoted a political scientist who said it would be "misleading" to conclude from the statistic that Warner is a yes-man to the president. Warner tries to walk a fine line on the ad by having the moderator say "experts call" the ads misleading. But the bold letters on the screen saying "POLITIFACT VIRGINIA" put the words in our mouth. In one case, that’s so; in one case, it’s not. All together, Warner’s ad statement is Half True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-10-13T12:27:30	2014-09-30	['None']
pomt-07822	"Across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/16/national-rifle-association/wayne-lapierre-said-violent-crime-jurisdictions-re/	Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association delivered a stirring defense of gun ownership at the Conservative Political Action Conference in the wake of the mass shooting in Arizona. "It's time to acknowledge what we know in our hearts to be true -- that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," he said. "Just knowing there's a good guy with a gun around -- a cop, a guard, a soldier … and, yes, a law-abiding citizen with a gun -- makes us feel safer … because we are safer." LaPierre said it was time for a national "right to carry" law, a measure that many states already have adopted. Generally speaking, it means that law-abiding citizens have the "right to carry" guns as they go about their daily business. (There are typically a few exceptions, such as in government buildings and schools.) "Right now, in the United States, 7 million law-abiding Americans legally carry a concealed firearm, 7 million in almost every state in the country," he said. "And across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it. The whole flock is safer when the wolves can't tell the difference between the lions and the lambs." It's a matter of opinion whether a national "right to carry" law is a good idea, but we were interested in his statement that "violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it." So we decided to check it out. We contacted the NRA and asked them about the statement, but we didn't hear back. We decided to begin with information from the NRA website, which claims that 40 states have "right to carry" laws, while 10 restrict it. We should note that opinions may differ on whether a state has a "right to carry" law or not. The NRA says a state has a "right to carry" law if permits to carry are issued to applicants who meet uniform standards established by the state legislature. If state officials have the discretion to refuse individual applicants, then in the NRA's view, they're not "right to carry" states. The NRA identifies 10 states as lacking "right to carry" laws: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. We next turned to the FBI's crime statistics, looking particularly at the violent crime rate. This is a statistic that counts violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. We should note that the FBI warns people not to create ratings from these statistics, saying that rankings "provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, or region." We went ahead and created a state ranking anyway, knowing that it wouldn't necessarily establish a causal link between "right to carry" laws and a lower crime rate. At this point, we simply wanted to see if the statistics were consistent with what LaPierre said. We found the the states without "right to carry" were spread out across the list, not bunched together at the top. The District of Columbia, which has strict gun control laws, ranked highest for violent crime. The other states ranked as follows: Delaware, No. 5; Maryland, No. 10; Illinois, No. 13; California, No. 17; Massachusetts, No. 18; New York, No. 24; New Jersey, No. 30; Hawaii, No. 36; Wisconsin, No. 39, and Rhode Island, No. 42. We also couldn't help noticing that some states with laws that favor gun ownership placed at different points along the list. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence rates state gun laws, so we looked at the 14 states that had the weakest gun laws. Here, we also saw a wide variation in where the states ranked in terms of violent crime: Alaska, No. 6; Louisiana, No. 7; New Mexico, No. 8; Arkansas, No. 11; Oklahoma, No. 12; Missouri, No. 15; Arizona, No. 21; West Virginia, No. 32; Kentucky, No. 38; Montana, No. 41; Idaho, No. 44; Utah, No. 47; North Dakota, No. 48, and South Dakota, No. 49. So using the 2009 data, we don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other, at least not "across the board" as LaPierre suggested in his speech. Still, there's a more in-depth way to study violent crime rates, using many sets of data over multiple years and controlling for external factors. The book More Guns, Less Crime, by John R. Lott, first published in 1998, makes a case that by using extensive data sets, one can see clear reductions in crime over many years in states and counties that have "right to carry" laws, and he has continued to make that case in new editions of the book. But Lott's work has also been critiqued as flawed by other academics, who say that relatively small adjustments to the data sets yield different results or that Lott doesn't account for other factors that could be affecting crime rates. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that current data do not allow for firm conclusions about how "right to carry" laws affect crime. We think it's worth quoting the conclusion from Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review: "The literature on right-to-carry laws summarized in this chapter has obtained conflicting estimates of their effects on crime ... No link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample; it is only once numerous covariates are included that the negative results in the early data emerge. While the trend models show a reduction in the crime growth rate following the adoption of right-to-carry laws, these trend reductions occur long after law adoption, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the trend models estimated in the literature reflect effects of the law change. Finally, some of the point estimates are imprecise. Thus, the committee concludes that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates." Getting back to our rating. LaPierre said, "Across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it." LaPierre could have used a qualifier here about studies that control for various effects, but he didn't: He said flat out that violent crime is lower in areas with "right to carry." We do not find that current crime statistics support this point. Some academics have said trends over time show that "right to carry" laws lower crime rates, but that argument is contested. There's certainly not straight-line correlation between states with "right to carry" laws and crime rates. LaPierre made it sound like the data clearly supported his view. They don't. We rate his statement False.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2011-02-16T09:11:43	2011-02-10	['None']
pomt-11084	"The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/	On the campaign trail and as president, Donald Trump has expressed his skepticism about global warming. So it was a bit of a surprise when a reader asked us to check a statement issued by his Environmental Protection Agency that touted the administration’s record in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which scientists say are the main driver of global warming. "The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down, Superfund sites are being cleaned up at a higher rate than under President Obama, and the federal government is investing more money to improve water infrastructure than ever before," the EPA said in a statement when contacted for a June 13 article by Bloomberg titled, "Researchers Argue Proposed EPA Changes Could Cause 80,000 More Deaths a Decade." Here, we’ll focus on the first assertion in the EPA’s statement — that "the science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down." We found that to be a stretch. Did greenhouse gas emissions fall on Trump’s watch? When we asked the EPA for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a report titled, "Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks." This includes data collected and released regularly by the EPA, most recently in April 2018. The report found that the amount of greenhouse emissions by the United States fell in the most recent year. But there’s a problem: Due to the lag in data collection, that decline occurred during President Barack Obama’s final year in office, 2016, not under Trump. Here’s a chart of the EPA data on greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2016, most of which consisted of carbon dioxide: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We found other data sets that more directly address the Trump era. The first is a comprehensive study issued every year by the energy company BP, called the Statistical Review of World Energy. It uses a different methodology but produced similar findings as the EPA data — a 0.5 percent decline in emissions for the United States in 2017 (Trump’s first year) over 2016 (Obama’s last). The study found that it was the third consecutive year that emissions in the United States had declined, "though the fall was the smallest over the last three years." In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era. (The BP study was released on the same day as Bloomberg published the EPA statement, so it’s not clear that the agency could have known about it when it made its statement.) A second set of data from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, showed a similar pattern. The EIA data covers 2017 and the first two months of 2018. However, it totals only the emissions from the energy sector, which is a significant source of emissions, but not the only one. Like the BP report, EIA found that that carbon emissions from energy declined between 2016 and 2017. But the annual decline slowed on Trump’s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama’s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level. In addition, the EIA estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years. In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase. The following chart shows annual declines in emissions almost every year from 2007 to 2017, followed by EIA’s projected increases for 2018 and 2019. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Meanwhile, if you look at the EIA data on a monthly basis, emissions have moved in a fairly narrow band in 2016, 2017 and 2018, with emissions actually higher in January 2018 than they were in January 2016 under Obama. Here’s the chart showing monthly data. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Bottom line: Emissions did fall in Trump’s first year, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the Obama era. Trump policies likely not tied to decline Whatever impact Trump’s policies may ultimately have, their environmental impact won’t show up much in the data over such a short period. "Most variations in emissions are due to the combination of long-term trends in energy use and efficiency and short-term variations in weather, with exceptional winter cold or summer heat leading to increased energy use and resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions," said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. One example of a long-term shift would be the transition from coal to natural gas in electricity generation, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The shift to natural gas has been driven by competitive pricing, greater access to natural gas supplies, and changing long-term environmental strategies by utilities. Other factors that could have had an impact include falling prices for renewable energy, consumer preferences for lower-emission power, and Congress’ extension of tax credits for renewable energy resources, according to the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group. The second reason for skepticism is that, whatever the merits of Trump’s policies in other ways, his signature policies are eventually expected to increase carbon emissions, not lower them. "His stated goals are to increase coal use," Reilly said. "His proposed plan to keep coal and nuclear plants from shutting down would have the opposite effect on emissions" from what the EPA touted in its statement. Trump’s effort to roll back fuel vehicle standards would also tend to boost emission levels, though this initiative is so new that it hasn’t had an impact on the data yet. Experts credited Obama for policies and investments over eight years that nudged some utilities toward lower-emission fuels. "This is the result of actions of the previous administration, and perhaps even more importantly, of economic and technological progress that are making renewables cheaper than fossil fuels," said Robert J. Brecha, a professor in the department of physics and the renewable and clean energy program at the University of Dayton. Some utilities have stated that they will be continuing the emissions-reducing efforts they began under Obama, including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy, Southern Co., and Xcel Energy. Our ruling The EPA said, "The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down." Emissions did fall slightly between 2016 and 2017. But the rate of decline slowed under Trump and the month-to-month changes have been modest. Whatever decline has occurred on Trump’s watch is unlikely to stem from his own policies. Changes to emissions levels tend to come either from changing economic incentives, government policy over the long term, and factors beyond human control, such as the weather.

pomt-07187	"Rep. Robert Hurt voted again today to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/09/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-hurt-voted-again-end-medicare/	On June 6, 2011, PolitiFact Virginia rated as False a statement by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that Rep. Robert Hurt, R-5th, voted "to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors." We based that ruling, in part, on a faulty determination that the legislation would not raise health care costs for anyone now 55 or older. Further review shows about 8 percent of Medicare recipients could see higher costs if the plan Hurt supported is adopted. But given the blanket nature of the DCCC’s statement, which suggests all Virginia seniors would see higher costs, we are maintaining our False rating and providing this new analysis: When it comes to alarming voters, nothing rings louder than an accusation that a politician wants to harm seniors. In 2009, Republicans claimed health care reform would set up "death panels" that told old people when to die. Now Democrats are returning fire. They’re accusing Republicans, including Rep. Robert Hurt from Virginia’s 5th District, of voting to end Medicare. "Rep. Robert Hurt voted again today to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors," the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a June 1 news release. The statement added that seniors will "get a $6,400 medical bill" if the GOP plan is adopted. The DCCC, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, earned a Pants on Fire in April for claiming Republicans wanted to end Medicare and stick seniors with a $12,500 bill. We wanted to see if this latest attack was true. What is Congress voting on? In a partisan vote on April 15, Hurt other House Republicans passed a budget resolution embracing proposals that would overhaul Medicare for young and middle-aged Americans. The plan was put forward by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan proposed replacing today’s Medicare program with a "premium support payment." In 2022, new beneficiaries would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it’s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners. The Congressional Budget Office says Ryan’s plan could save the federal government money, but it would also raise costs for users. The CBO, the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress, estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums during 2022 if the current program isn’t changed. Under Ryan’s plan, the CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute $12,500, more than double what they’d pay under the existing plan. So the proposal would raise costs for future seniors, but not for anyone now 55 or older. Folks older than that, including those seniors who currently use Medicare, would still use the existing program. Let us say that again, for emphasis: Ryan’s plan would not affect the Medicare coverage for anyone currently 55 or older. But the DCCC is right in saying people using the new system could pay about $6,400 more per year in the future. The DCCC says the plan would raise costs for current seniors, something we rejected in our initial analysis. Would those who stay on the regular Medicare program see their health care costs go up under the Ryan plan, as the Democratic group says? Some would, but not enormously. Here’s why: The Ryan plan would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama in March 2010. Among its myriad provisions, the law would phase out the "doughnut hole" a quirk in the current Medicare law that requires people with high-priced prescriptions to shoulder more of the costs. The Department of Health and Human Services said about 3.9 million people, or roughly 8 percent of people who use Medicare, fell into the doughnut hole in 2009. During 2011, a discount on brand-name drugs under Obama’s reforms is saving those people an average of $553, according to HHS. If the health care act is repealed, those people would lose that benefit. The DCCC issued its press release after House Republicans, including Hurt, passed a procedural resolution on June 1 that also embraced the Ryan plan. We should note that the Ryan plan, while a bargaining chip in current debt negotiations and likely to be a big issue in the 2012 elections, has no immediate chance of becoming law. The proposal has been rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate is strongly opposed by President Barack Obama. And here’s a technical point: Both resolutions supported by Hurt are, as PolitiFact national has noted, non-binding documents that state policy preferences but cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. To actually alter Medicare, Congress would have to pass a detailed law changing the U.S. Code. Would the plan really end Medicare? The Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and future seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. But to say it would end Medicare, as the DCCC email does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors -- current and future -- would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year. Republicans say future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable and the program requires changes. Their proposal "protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire," Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee, told PolitiFact in April. Democrats contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office in April released a detailed analysis of the proposal that concluded future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance. Many Democrats, including the president, said Ryan’s plan would end "Medicare as we know it." And that’s a crucial qualifier, since Ryan’s vision for the program is indeed very different from what currently exists. But the DCCC left that qualifier out of its attack on Hurt. Our ruling The DCCC says Hurt voted "to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors." Hurt has indeed cast votes for the Ryan plan, which would substantially alter Medicare for many Americans. But beyond that, the DCCC statement falls apart. The Ryan plan would not end Medicare for anyone. The government would continue to help all older Americans pay for their medical bills. And the plan would not mean any change in costs of services for 92 percent of the people who now receive Medicare. So the blanket statement that it would raise the cost for seniors is misleading. The fact that 8 percent might see higher costs does not support the DCCC’s blanket statement that health care costs will rise for seniors. For younger Americans, there would still be a universal program that helps them pay for health care when they reach retirement age through payments to help buy private insurance. They would face higher out-of-pocket costs than those insured under the current plan. The DCCC knows this but seems intent on scaring seniors. We rate its claim False.

For those defenders, a spoof story on the website USA Mirror News may have confirmed their suspicions about the accusers. But the story — sweetened with a dash of retribution — is not true. "Roy Moore’s accuser arrested and charged with falsification," the Dec. 8 headline read. "After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor," the USA Mirror News story said. "Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10,000 in fines." It isn’t obvious from the headline, but the article was published by a website that warns readers it is a satirical publication. Here’s how fake it is: There is no Mary Lynne Davies who has accused Moore. Nine women have come forward and there’s not a Davies among them. On top of that, the Alabama Attorney General is Steve Marshall, not John Simmons. The only thing the item got right is that falsification is a misdemeanor under the Alabama State Legal Code. The website has a disclaimer on its navigation bar, should any reader care to click on it: "USAMirrorNews.com is a satirical publication that may appear sometimes to be telling the truth.

pomt-10751	"The Alternative Minimum Tax was never intended to hit people in middle income, upper middle income. It was meant for people who are rich and evading taxes."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/01/hillary-clinton/tax-for-the-rich-only-but-not-anymore/	The alternative minimum tax indeed was started to tax the rich — specifically rich people avoiding income taxes. On Jan. 17, 1969, Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr told Congress that 155 taxpayers making $200,000 or more found a legal way to not pay any taxes on their 1966 income. That shook lawmakers into creating the alternative minimum tax in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. (For comparison's sake, $200,000 in 1966 is nearly $1.3-million in 2007, according to government-run inflation calculators.) Because of the law, people who are able to use deductions and legal shelters to lower their tax bill too much must pay a minimum income tax, the AMT. Under the law, taxpayers who meet the AMT threshold must pay the higher tax bill, whether it's their actual bill or the AMT. But because of the way the law calculates who meets the threshold, more and more people have been swept into the program. By 2006, 3.5-million taxpayers fell under the AMT, which equates to about 4 percent of American taxpayers, according to the Congressional Research Service. That brought in $24-billion in taxes. But that was with a "patch" by Congress that limited how many taxpayers are affected. Without a change for 2007, 23.4-million taxpayers are going to be paying the AMT, sending $70-billion to the federal government, according to an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. Policymakers have been talking for years about changing the formula that triggers the AMT so that it only catches the very wealthiest taxpayers, but so far the rewrite hasn't happened.

pomt-04107	Since the federal Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, "cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/13/gwen-moore/94-law-domestic-violence-down-two-thirds-us-democr/	Domestic violence is so common that one in four women and one in seven men "have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner," according to a national survey done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So, could it also be true that incidents of domestic violence have fallen dramatically? On Dec. 11, 2012, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., and 119 other members of Congress signed a letter calling on House leaders to hold a vote on re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Moore was among the lead writers of the letter, which declared that since the federal law was adopted in 1994, "cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent." Nearly two decades have passed, but a two-thirds drop is sizable. Is Moore correct on the number? And, if so, to what extent is the law responsible for the decline? The law and the numbers The Violence Against Women Act gives money to state and local law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. After the law’s adoption in 1994, Congress re-authorized it in 2000 and 2005, but failed to do so before its session ended in December 2012. Supporters of reauthorization hope to take up the matter again in 2013, possibly as early as January, said Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams. Moore, of Milwaukee, is a longtime advocate for domestic violence victims. In December 2010, we rated as True her statement that in Wisconsin, "deaths from domestic violence" were "at the highest in 10 years." In the latest attempt to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, versions of the 67 percent decrease claim were also made by others: the White House, in a fact sheet; the left-leaning MoveOn.org political advocacy group, in a TV ad; and a U.S. Justice Department official, in testimony to Congress. When we asked Moore’s spokeswoman for evidence to back the figure, Williams cited a Justice Department report from September 2011. But we found a more recent report from the department, issued in November 2012, two weeks before Moore’s letter. Williams said "we are now transitioning to using" the figures in that report. The new report was based on "nonfatal victimizations reported and not reported to the police" against persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. The first finding in the report: from 1994 to 2010, the rate of nonfatal intimate-partner violence in the U.S. declined by 64 percent. The rate dropped from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000. Intimate partner violence was defined to include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. The 64 percent figure is nearly as high as the 67 percent decrease Moore claimed. But Moore mentioned the Violence Against Women Act and the decrease in the same breath, not saying one caused the other, but suggesting there was a strong connection. So let’s see what role the law played in reducing domestic violence. Why are numbers declining? The Violence Against Women Act contains provisions that could lead to a reduction in domestic violence -- through raising awareness of the offense as a crime, locking up violators and deterring potential offenders. According to a May 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, the law provides grants to, among other things: Help fund state and local prosecutions of violent crimes against women. Encourage state and local arrest policies for domestic violence cases. Educate and train judges and court personnel on domestic violence laws. Help state and local governments enter data on domestic violence into national databases. Establish a national domestic violence hotline fund and fund battered women’s shelters. The National Network to End Domestic Violence, which is pushing for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, credits the law for declines in domestic violence. And a 2002 University of North Carolina study estimated that the law had saved billions of dollars in social costs by reducing incidents of domestic violence. But it’s also clear that other factors bear on the decline. Carnegie Mellon University researchers in 2003 concluded that three other factors were key in declines in domestic violence incidents between 1993 and 1998 -- an increase in legal services for victims; improvement in women’s economic status; and the aging of the population. Barbara Paradiso, director of the Center on Domestic Violence at the University of Colorado Denver, told us that the Violence Against Women Act is one reason for the decline in domestic violence. But experts debate over what factors are most responsible, she said. Our rating U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said that since the Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, "cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent." Her statement is generally on the money, though a bit dated. It also needs some clarification -- namely that there are factors in addition to the law that are linked to the decrease. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13108	Says Nevadans will have a "double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year" and "10 of Nevada’s 16 counties will only have one Obamacare...exchange insurer"	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/nov/04/donald-trump/trump-says-nevadans-will-see-massive-hike-health-c/	At a recent campaign rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump tried to connect the recent news of health care premium cost hikes next year to his target audience — Nevada voters. "It’s just been announced that the citizens of Nevada are going to experience a massive, massive -- in fact, I don’t even want to tell you what the number is, I won’t because you’ll walk out of here depressed -- double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year," he said. "Ten of Nevada’s 16 counties will have only Obamacare, and think of it, you can have one, exchange insurer that you can choose from. They are in a very good position to negotiate with you, aren’t they?" Trump, who wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, threw out some pretty specific figures in terms of Nevada health care costs, making us curious as to how accurate he was. While he largely gets the numbers correct, Trump’s rhetoric overstates the impact of rate hikes that Nevadans enrolled in the state’s insurance market will face next year. A big league premium hike? Republicans across the country have seized on recent news that health care premium costs under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law would increase by an average of 25 percent across the 39 states using the federal online marketplace, coupled with about 28 percent of insurers leaving the marketplace. The premium hikes for some plans in some states are striking: a Kaiser Family Foundation study cites a hypothetical 27-year-old in Arizona who could see the monthly cost of a "second-lowest cost silver plan" jump from $196 to $422, or 116 percent. The average cost for a plan through Nevada Health Link, a state-managed website that uses the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, is also going up. The state is on track for an average increase of about 12 percent for unsubsidized premium costs, which is the eleventh-lowest hike in the country. While a double-digit rise in premium costs is nothing to scoff at, Nevada Health Link spokeswoman Janel Davis said about 87 percent of Nevadans enrolled in an exchange plan receive a tax credit to help pay down insurance costs and that the subsidy should increase in lockstep with any rise in premium. Davis said it’s difficult to calculate an average dollar increase in premium costs because the subsidy is dependent on a variety of factors including income, family size and age. Trump is also correct that most Nevada counties will only have one insurer, but he didn’t get the number of counties in the state quite correct. Nevada has 16 standard counties and the independent Carson City, which is counted as the equivalent of a county by the exchange and census. An emailed version of Trump’s prepared remarks cites 17 counties in the state, though the version on the campaign’s website has 16. Regardless, a large percentage of Nevada counties (59 percent) only have one insurer to choose from. However, the majority of Nevadans enrolled through the exchange live in counties with more than one insurer. According to Kaiser more than 90 percent (79,000) of Nevadans enrolled in the exchange have at least three insurers to choose from, while only 3 percent (3,000) are enrolled in mostly rural counties with only one insurer. And unlike other states, none of the three insurers in Nevada are planning to leave the exchange marketplace in 2017. Nevada Republican Reps. Joe Heck, Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei have introduced a bill exempting counties with only one insurer from the individual mandate penalty, though the legislation hasn’t moved forward since being introduced in September. Our ruling Trump said Nevadans will see a "double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year" and "10 of Nevada’s 16 counties will only have one Obamacare...exchange insurer" Trump is mostly correct, but his rhetoric is a little overstated. Nevadans who get health insurance through the exchange will see their unsubsidized premium costs rise by about 12 percent (although most people in the exchange receive subsidies). Most counties in the state will only have one insurer on the exchange next year, but about 97 percent of enrollees live in a county with at least two insurers. Still, the basic facts are correct. We rate Trump’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-04T12:36:02	2016-10-30	['Nevada', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-08060	"All but one of the 50 states already have some form of a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/25/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-49-states-have-balanced-budge/	Advocating for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would require Congress to balance the budget, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, calls the proposal a "good idea, but certainly not a new one." "All but one of the 50 states already have some form of a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions," he said in an op-ed published in The Dallas Morning News on Dec. 1. "We can draw from the experience of the states in drafting an amendment appropriate for the federal government." Forty-nine out of 50? Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin pointed us to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), a bipartisan organization that advocates for the interests of state governments before Congress and federal agencies. Sandlin also pointed out a flaw in the senator's statement: "Upon further review, it would seem you might have us on a technicality on this one. While it is true that 49 states are required to have balanced budgets, four of them are required by statute, not a Constitutional amendment." She said that they "stand by the spirit of the statement" but that "an important clarifying clause" was cut during editing. The line should have been: "All but one of the 50 states have some form of a balanced budget amendment in their state constitutions or state statutes," she said in an e-mail. According to an October NCSL report on states' balanced-budget provisions, the group "has traditionally reported that 49 states must balance their budgets, with Vermont being the exception." An appendix in the report lists 45 states, including Texas, with a constitutional citation concerning a balanced budget requirement, and four states that have a statutory requirement. Vermont is the only state with neither. The information comes from the legislative fiscal staff in each state, said Ron Snell, director of state services at NCSL. But it's not that simple, Snell said, who noted that Cornyn incorrectly called all the state constitutional citations "amendments." According to the appendix, only two states have constitutional amendments dealing with balanced budgets, which means the provisions were added to their original constitutions. For the remaining 43, the provisions have always been part of their constitutions. More substantively, the report notes that there's no consensus on which states have or do not have balanced-budget laws. That is, not every state has an explicit requirement that state expenditures not exceed projected revenue. The report names Wyoming, North Dakota and Alaska as states whose balanced-budget requirements are debated. "In some states that lack explicit language requiring a balanced budget, a generally observed practice of doing so is based on a limitation of state debt, interpretation of other statues or traditional practice," the report says. The report adds that "two points can be made with certainty. Most states have formal balanced-budget requirements with some degree of stringency, and state political cultures reinforce the requirements." The report also shows a tabulation of states' balanced-budget provisions kept by the National Association of State Budget Officers that takes a narrower view of which states require a balanced budget. According to the NCSL report, the association surveyed balanced-budget requirements in 2008, tallying which states require the governor to submit a balanced budget (43 total) and which require the legislature to pass a balanced budget (40). Thirty-eight states prohibit carrying deficits from one year to the next. We found 41 states have constitutional provisions requiring the governor to submit a balanced budget or the legislature to pass one, and five states that have a statutory requirement. So that's 46 states, by the National Association of State Budget Officers' count, that have balanced budget requirements as a matter of law. However, as Snell said, "it's almost impossible to say" for how many states the balanced budget mandate is "an absolutely binding requirement." Where does that leave us? Only two states — not 49, as Cornyn says — have amended their constitutions to require balanced budgets. Counting amendments plus provisions tucked into original constitutions, however, 45 states have balanced-budget stipulations, according to NCSL's count. NASBO considers 46 states to have constitutional or statutory balanced-budget requirements. Also, despite the letters of those statutory and constitutional strictures, they aren't universally viewed as mandatory. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09305	"The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act is the largest-ever investment in higher education."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/21/democratic-national-committee/texas-organizer-democratic-group-says-student-lend/	A Texas-based Democratic activist hailed recent congressional action on student loans by laying claim to history. Luke Hayes, Texas state director of Organizing for America, which is part of the Democratic National Committee, said in an April 7 press release: "The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act is the largest-ever investment in higher education..." Ever? We endeavored to learn more. Ricardo Ramirez, a DNC spokesman, said Hayes' statement was based on a Web page kept by the House Committee on Education & Labor, chaired by U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-California. A sentence on the page when we visited said the adopted Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act makes the "single largest investment in higher education ever." Miller spokeswoman Rachel Racusen told us that the law frees up close to $40 billion over the next 10 years by ending government subsidies to student lenders. The money is to be spent on bolstering the Pell grant program, which serves needy college students, and funding other college grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the fiscal impact of legislation, has said the student-lending changes will save the government nearly $61 billion in the 10-year period. The office estimates that of those savings, $36 billion will go to Pell grants, $2.2 billion to assist colleges historically serving blacks or other minorities and $750 million to other college-access grants. Racusen said another $7 billion will go to higher education thanks to health-care related changes in law, putting the historic total investment headed to higher education at more than $45 billion over the 10 years. That's not chicken feed, but we wondered how the roughly $4.5 billion per year compares to past investments in higher education such as the GI bill, which started funding college for veterans after World War II, or the flurry of scholarship grants and loans launched in the 1960’s. Over two days, we were unable to come up with total expenditures for those developments, but experts on higher education agreed that spending on those efforts has been substantial. Donald Heller, director of the Center for the Study of Higher Education at Penn State University, advised us of at least two flaws in the "largest-ever" claim posted by the House committee: the projected spending will be spread over 10 years, and the annual total will run short of what the federal government already delivers to higher education. One example: Pell grants for this year alone will account for more than $30 billion in spending, according to Jason DeLisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation, a non-partisan public policy institute. Heller suggested we check research by the authoritative Chronicle of Higher Education. In 2008, the Chronicle said federal spending on research at U.S. colleges and universities exceeded $25 billion during fiscal 2006. Multiply that by 10, representing a decade, and the ballpark federal spending on research at colleges and universities is $250 billion. Racusen, Rep. Miller’s spokeswoman, conceded there may have been larger expenditures in higher education over the years—such as that $250 billion in federal research aid. However, she said, it’s not appropriate to compare research dollars to direct spending on students. Racusen said in an e-mail: "There is a significant difference between research funding, which may be sent to a university but is not considered supporting higher education because it is not used to help students pay for college, or other purposes that involve a students' quality of education at a particular university (such as improve dorms, fund campus services, etc.), and investments in higher education, which are intended to help support the student side of higher education." Also, Racusen said, discretionary spending—which requires annual action by Congress—doesn't have the oomph, or stability, of the student-loan law, which remains in place unless a future Congress changes course. Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the Washington-based American Council on Education, offered his take: "This is the single-biggest concrete investment in Pell grants that we’ve ever had … Is it absolutely positively the highest investment in higher education we’ve ever had? I’m not sure that’s the case. But this is a certifiably big deal." Hartle later shared figures reflecting several such large funding streams. For instance, some $650 billion in college loans are currently in "repayment" by students and their families, evidence of a mammoth commitment to higher education. Hartle said a revision of veterans' benefits after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 promised more spending on higher education -- $60 billion in benefits over 10 years -- than the latest action on student lending, though individual veterans still would have to request the approved assistance. And, Hartle said, a 2007 college-cost reduction act was estimated to have a $32 billion value over 10 years. All in all, he said, "an enormous amount of money has been made available to help low and middle class families over just (the last) four years." Hartle said it'd be correct to say the lending-law change is "damn close" to the largest-ever investment in college student aid. DeLisle suggested the new law's significance lies less in the amount of money generated for higher education than in the fact that powerful lending interests were overcome to make it happen. "Congress was able to shut out one of the biggest and most effective lobbying machines that has ever been around Washington," he said. Adding everything up: Hayes' claim would have been close to spot-on if he'd limited the "largest-ever investment" descriptive to "one-time decisions by Congress boosting grants to needy college students," admittedly a not-so-pithy mouthful. We're not the only ones to divine this difference. As we finalized this article, the House committee rewrote its online statement to state that the law is the "single largest investment in federal student aid ever." Racusen told us: "Given your feedback, we wanted to make sure we were as clear as possible." We rate Hayes' statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03743	"Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-ignores-caveats-citing-harvard-study/	Does having more gun laws in a state result in fewer gun deaths? You would think so if you've seen the recent Facebook posting, created by a group called Anti-Republican Crusaders and shared more than 1,700 times on that and another Facebook page. The posting has the Joe Friday character from TV's "Dragnet" saying, "Just the facts, ma'am," followed by this headline: "Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths." There's also a color-coded U.S. map showing the states with the most laws and fewest deaths. We wondered if the Harvard study did, in fact, prove that point. The Facebook posts send readers to a study published online by JAMA Internal Medicine (not the Journal of the American Medical Association, a separate medical journal, as the post reports). The team led by Eric Fleegler of Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital created a "legislative strength score" to gauge which states had more gun laws. Then they compared that to the state-by-state firearms death rate. The more gun laws a state had, the lower the rate. That may sound conclusive, but there's a huge caveat. As the researchers concluded: "Our study could not determine cause-and-effect relationships." There could be many other factors, such as the rate of gun ownership or a state’s culture of gun ownership.. Curious Facebook readers might have uncovered this if they followed a link to an interview with Fleegler conducted by Robin Young on the March 13, 2013, edition of "Here & Now," the news program produced by WBUR in Boston. Young zeroed in on the same problem, asking if the relevant factor could be a state's gun culture. Fleegler acknowledged the point. "[It] may be true that there are states [where people] don't own a lot of guns, they're OK with passing legislation [and] they have lower rates of firearm deaths," he said. Dr. Garen Wintemute of the University of California-Davis School of Medicine, was even blunter in a commentary that JAMA Internal Medicine released at the same time. When the Fleegler team took into account the amount of gun ownership, "the association between firearm laws and firearm fatalities essentially disappeared," he wrote. Another key shortcoming of the study: The scorecard used to assess how many laws a state has "does not account for variations between states in the specifics of their laws and includes no measure of whether or how effectively the states enforce them." Wintemute noted that while gun laws were almost certainly enacted to reduce criminal violence, their real impact was a reduction in suicide, which "accounted for 94 percent of the observed decrease in firearm-related mortality." Fleegler, in his "Here & Now" interview, noted that suicide was a key factor because when people think of killing themselves, the presence of a gun means they will succeed 85 percent of the time compared to close to 2 percent when they don't have a firearm available. In the end, when the Facebook posting says "Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths," it is correctly summarizing one finding of the study. But it leaves out important details and context that argue against the idea that reducing gun deaths is simply a matter of blindly passing more gun laws in each state. For that reason, we rate it Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-10258	"There's only four senators senior to me ... there's still 44 older than me."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/joe-biden/five-are-more-senior-40-are-older/	In an Aug. 23, 2008, speech in Springfield, Ill., after Barack Obama announced him as his VP pick, Joe Biden jokingly made reference to his long tenure in the Senate, while also broadcasting that he's not as old as many of his colleagues in the Capitol. "In all my time in the United States Senate, and I want you to know there's only four senators senior to me, but Barack, there's still 44 older than me," Biden said. "I want you to know that part. But all kidding aside, of all my years in the Senate, I have never in my life seen Washington so broken." It's true that with 35 years, Biden is one of the most senior lawmakers in the Senate, where seniority is based primarily on the length of consecutive Senate service. But Biden's not ranked fifth as he suggests. Rather, he's sixth, just below New Mexico Republican Pete Domenici. The top-ranking senior senators are Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., with 49 years; Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., with 46 years; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, with 45 years; and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, with 40 years. Biden can perhaps be forgiven the slip, since he and Domenici were sworn in on the same day in 1973 (Biden was 30 years old). Domenici's 35 years are ranked higher, though, because Senate rules break ties by taking other factors into account, such as which state is more populous (a contest New Mexico wins handily over Delaware). Also, Domenici has announced that he won't be seeking re-election when his term expires in January 2009, so Biden soon will assume that No. 5 spot. It's also true that Biden, 65, is younger than many of his senatorial peers — 40 to be exact, four less than he stated. Ranking above him are: Byrd (90), Stevens (84), Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. (84), Inouye (83), Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii (83), John Warner, R-Va. (81), Arlen Specter, R-Pa. (78), Jim Bunning, R-Ky. (76), Kennedy (76), Dick Lugar, R-Ind. (76), Domenici (76), Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. (75), Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa (74), Robert Bennett, R-Utah (74), Orrin Hatch, R-Utah (74), Richard Shelby, R-Ala. (74), Carl Levin, D-Mich. (74), James Inhofe, R-Okla. (73), Herb Kohl, D-Wis. (73), Pat Roberts, R-Kan. (72), George Voinovich, R-Ohio (72), Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. (72), Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C. (72), John McCain, R-Ariz. (71 until Aug. 29, 2008), Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. (71), Thad Cochran, R-Miss. (70), Christopher "Kit" Bond, R-Mo. (69), Tom Harkin, D-Iowa (68), Harry Reid, D-Nev. (68), Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. (68), Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. (68), Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. (67), Ben Nelson, D-Neb. (67), Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (66), Max Baucus, D-Mont. (66), Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (66), Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. (66), Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. (66), Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. (66) and Bill Nelson, D-Fla. (66 as of Sept. 29, 2008). But this is all relative, since according to the Congressional Research Service, 2008's cadre of senators is among the oldest in history with an average age of 61.7 (just younger than Biden's 65). Since Biden was off by one rank of seniority and four elder peers, we rate this as Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-08-27T00:00:00	2008-08-23	['None']
pomt-13963	Says if you try to hide marijuana in a hemp field, "it becomes worthless. The THC goes away."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jun/14/larry-yarborough/fears-marijuana-inspire-more-hemp-regulations-stat/	It may look like marijuana, but hemp cannot get you high. They’re forms of the same species, although hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the high-inducing chemical found in marijuana. Due to the plant's industrial and and agricultural uses, the General Assembly legalized hemp farming last year. Yet many lawmakers fear the hemp industry will provide cover for marijuana growing operations, since the two plants look similar. That argument came up again before the N.C. House overwhelmingly passed further regulations on the hemp industry on June 13. Rep. Larry Yarborough, a Republican from Roxboro, voted for those regulations. But he had previously said the using-hemp-to-hide-marijuana argument is flawed. If a marijuana plant "gets the pollen (from hemp) and goes to seed, it becomes worthless," Yarborough said in a House Agriculture Committee Meeting a few days before the vote. "The THC goes away." That’s a pretty sweeping claim that would seem to debunk many concerns. We contacted Yarborough, a chemical engineer and business owner, to ask where he heard that. He backed off the quote a little bit. "The plant with seed would be worthless in the market," he said. "I don’t know for sure that all the THC would be gone but there would be very little, according to what I have read." Unlike his original statement, that aligns with mainstream research. We spoke with two professors who have studied hemp in other states, and we read a 2015 report on hemp and marijuana compiled by the federal government. All came to the same conclusion: Anyone who tries to hide marijuana inside a hemp field isn’t a very smart criminal. Regulating hemp The new regulations passed the N.C. House by a vote of 108-3. Next up is a vote in the Senate. If they become law, they will limit the amount of land hemp can be grown on, require the location of all hemp fields to be disclosed to state and local law enforcement agencies, allow officials to inspect hemp fields at any time and make it a felony to use hemp to hide marijuana. Yarborough, who represents Granville and Person counties, said he just wanted legislators to know all the facts. "I represent an agricultural community and I have constituents that want to grow industrial hemp and medical marijuana," he said. "I am certainly not an advocate of legalizing marijuana, but I have constituents that are and farmers that want to grow it." Why it won’t work As any experienced marijuana grower will tell you, according to the federal government’s Congressional Research Service, it’s imperative that pollen-producing male plants be kept away from female plants. (If you thought you could avoid discussion of gender segregation in a fact-check about hemp farming, and not North Carolina’s new bathroom law, we’re sorry to disappoint.) Pollination creates seeds. The problem is hemp needs seeds to be worthwhile – they can be sold as food or turned into oil – but the opposite is true for marijuana. "Marijuana growers would not want to plant near a hemp field, since this would result in a harvest that is seedy and lower in THC, and degrade the value of their marijuana crop," the Congressional Research Service paper said. So people would need to smoke much more of the altered weed in order to get high – if they could still get high off it at all – and the smoking experience would also become much less pleasant. That’s because of all the extra seeds, which pop when ignited, said Janna Beckerman, a professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue University. Legally, hemp can’t contain more than 0.3 percent THC. According to the Purdue Hemp Project that Beckerman is a researcher for, that’s about 60 times weaker than the legal marijuana being sold in Colorado. And while hemp-pollinated marijuana likely wouldn’t see its THC content drop all the way to hemp’s virtually nonexistant levels, like Yarborough said, Beckerman said it would be drastically reduced. Oregon State University crop and soil science professor emeritus Russell Karow said growing marijuana in a hemp field would lower the value of the hemp, too, providing further incentives against using the legal crop to hide marijuana. The Congressional Research Service came to the same conclusion. "The two crops are the same species and will indeed cross-pollinate," Karow said. "This results in seed that will not be useful for either purpose – hemp or marijuana." Our ruling Yarborough said that if you try to hide a marijuana growing operation in a hemp field, "it becomes worthless. The THC goes away." Cross-pollination of hemp and marijuana will cause marijuana's buds to lose much of their high-inducing THC, but the THC won’t go away entirely. Researchers agree that while the drug won’t become completely impotent, it will lose much or all of its worth and would also likely damage the value of the hemp crop. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05899	Says "we brought crime rate down by 30 percent" when he was mayor of Dallas.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/03/tom-leppert/tom-leppert-says-he-and-others-brought-down-dallas/	In his bid to take the seat of Texas’ retiring U.S. senator, businessman Tom Leppert draws on his private-sector background plus nearly four years as mayor of Dallas that ended in February 2011. "When I came in, the biggest challenge was in public safety -- the crime rate," Leppert said in a Jan. 12, 2012, debate held in Austin for the Republican candidates vying to replace Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. "In the space of the three years, ’08, ’09 and ’10, we brought the crime rate down by 30 percent -- numbers any city would love to have. And the way we did it is we increased the police department by 20 percent." We wondered if the rate fell that much -- and if Leppert is justified in taking credit. Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us by email that Dallas’ crime rate dropped from 78.45 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2007 to 55.67 crimes per 1,000 in 2010, a decrease of 29 percent. Keylin sent us a 2010 Dallas police report with those numbers and others, including a chart that shows the crime rate per 1,000 residents from 1970 through 2010. The crimes counted are the FBI’s "index crimes": murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft. But the rate started dropping several years before Leppert became mayor in June 2007. After hovering for several years at around 93 crimes per 1,000 residents, the rate declined in 2004 and each subsequent year through 2010 -- with the rates falling more steeply each year after 2007, according to the department. The 2010 rate of 55.67 crimes per 1,000 was a 30-year low. (Click here to view the chart.) A caveat: Comparing the rates before 2007 to those after 2007 is complicated because Dallas police changed how some crimes were reported. The post-2007 declines track with crime tallies that the Dallas Police Department reports to the FBI. Next, we asked Leppert what steps he took or contributed to toward the rate reductions. Keylin told us that increasing the number of Dallas police officers was a main goal in Leppert’s 2007 mayoral campaign. Soon after his election, Leppert held a City Council retreat during which he advocated expanding the force, Keylin said, and during Leppert’s tenure, the council allocated money in each of four budgets to hire a total 679 additional officers. Keylin also cited the addition of 176 squad cars. Dallas Morning News stories from January and March 2011 indicate the force had around 2,860 officers in 2000, 2,900 police in 2006, and 3,684 officers at the end of 2010. The Dallas police sent us figures for net job gains and losses that reflect a considerable increase in hiring during Leppert’s tenure. In 2003-2004, the force saw small losses; then, small gains in net jobs came in 2005-2006. Large gains came in 2007-2010: 168, 203, 208 and 93 net jobs, respectively (after retirement and other departures are subtracted from the number of hires). In 2011 – after Leppert’s exit – the Dallas police lost 179 positions. We consulted other sources before circling back to Leppert. According to a July 25, 2007, Morning News article, public safety was a big part of Leppert’s 2007 mayoral bid and of the post-election council retreat he called. However, the article says lowering the crime rate and adding police were already established city priorities. Shortly before Leppert took office, the News reported that city manager Mary Suhm had drawn up a preliminary budget proposal to hire 200 police officers in each of the next four years. In that June 18, 2007, news story, Mayor-elect Leppert calls the plan "a good start." In a telephone interview, Dallas’ mayor pro tem for 2007-09, Elba Garcia, told us that from at least 2004 on, there was "unanimous consensus" among council members that reducing crime was a priority. Garcia, initially elected to the council in 2001, chaired the council’s public safety committee. A Democrat, she is now a Dallas County commissioner. Garcia said of the crime rate reductions: "It took the leadership of many people, and the mayor (Leppert) wasn’t there when we started that crime decrease." The News reported July 30, 2003 that the city was headed towards its sixth year with the highest crime rate for cities of over 1 million residents as gauged by a national report. Amid public dismay, Mayor Laura Miller met with federal and county officials, and began meeting weekly with police Chief Terrell Bolton, according to the paper, as one council member called for an outside review of the department. Bolton was fired less than a month later -- partly because of the crime ranking, the paper reported. Under the new chief, David Kunkle, who took the post in 2004, crime rates went down and public trust in the police went up, the News wrote in a Jan. 26, 2011, story. In 2005, two local leaders cited concern over the city’s crime ranking when they founded Safer Dallas, Better Dallas, a nonprofit group that sought private donations to support Dallas police. That year, they garnered a $15 million gift from the W.W. Caruth, Jr. Foundation Fund, used to start a police leadership academy and purchase police equipment, according to the Dallas Morning News. Garcia told us that at the July 2007 council retreat, the council vowed to get Dallas out of the No. 1 spot on the big-city-crime list -- a goal achieved in 2009 (and Dallas dropped from No. 2 to No. 3 the next year). The Morning News said in a blog post Oct. 19, 2010: "To get out of the top spots, the city has substantially increased the size of its police force." In a Jan. 8, 2011, Morning News story about the Dallas crime rate’s "steady march downward that started seven years ago," the paper said police "credit factors from public surveillance cameras to specialized crime reduction operations to the addition of 750 officers since 2004." We wondered how to isolate Leppert’s contributions to the rate decrease on his watch. In a telephone interview, Leppert acknowledged that Dallas leaders had been talking for years about adding police. But, he said, "It wasn’t until I came in that we said, ‘We are going to do it. This is going to be absolutely a commitment to it.’ " "There was never a commitment to a long-term effort to do it, and they never looked at the way that you finance it, and we did all of those things," he said. For those police hires, Leppert said, the city made "a fundamental shifting of resources" to public safety, a claim we couldn’t immediately confirm. "There were a lot of people involved in this. I clearly led the effort," he said. "We worked together, and we made it happen. And I understood where we had to go." Still, it’s not clear how much Leppert directly influenced the police force increase that occurred on his watch. One criminologist told us it takes sustained effort to turn around a city’s crime rate. Speaking to the Dallas turnaround, Melinda Schlager at Texas A&M University-Commerce said in a telephone interview: "Many of the seeds for change were planted under Kunkle," the chief who served from June 2004 through May 2010, "and if you look at when the decreases in crime began, they began under Kunkle’s watch." Dallas’ three-year, 29-percent rate drop seems high, but plausible, criminologists told us, noting that national and state crime rates also dropped. From 2007 to 2010, basically Leppert’s time as mayor, Texas saw an 8 percent drop in statewide FBI index crimes, and nationwide the decline was 10.7 percent; Houston saw a 11.4 percent drop over the same years, Austin a 9.4 percent drop. San Antonio’s rate rose and fell, but the city ended with a net gain of 0.1 percent for the period. Garcia said of Leppert’s 30-percent debate statement: "I’m glad he used the word ‘we.’... All that took a lot of people supporting these recommendations, supporting the chief ... It took a lot of people and a lot of leadership." We asked Leppert if it’s possible the crime rate would have fallen at a similar pace anyway, considering it was going down before he became mayor and continued to drop after his tenure. "If they did the same things we did," he said. "I needed the city council, I needed to work with the police department; not only the leaders in the police department but the people who were out on the street doing a great job every single day." Our ruling Leppert’s estimate of a 30-percent, three-year drop is on target, though crime was dropping years before his tenure and factors beyond his influence surely contributed to the drop he touts -- among them private donations before he was mayor and the earlier hiring of a new police chief. Yet the police force grew substantially on his watch. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tom Leppert	None	None	None	2012-02-03T17:21:09	2012-01-12	['Dallas']
pomt-00136	Says "over 40 Republican leaders denounced" Steve Watkins’ campaign	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/25/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-fail-mention-things-have-changed-kansas/	That was then. This is now. If ever there was a time for that cliche, it is in the context of a new ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, attacking Republican candidate Steve Watkins in Kansas. Watkins is running in the Kansas 2nd Congressional District, which either he or Democratic opponent Paul Davis will serve, pending the Nov. 6 election outcome, because incumbent U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins is retiring after five terms. It is a heated, insult-slinging, competitive race, requiring campaigning up and down the state’s eastern border, but things were testy just among Republicans in the early August primary, too. Seven Republicans vied for their party’s nomination, and Watkins beat his nearest competitor, Caryn Tyson, by only 2,255 votes. Watkins’ opponents and the news media had a number of questions about the man who would go on to win, and since politics can be a blood sport, some of those questions have been revived in advance of November. Thus, a claim in a new DCCC ad, which says that "over 40 Republican leaders denounced Watkins’ campaign." Yes, 40 Republican leaders collectively announced concerns about Watkins in late July, as did some others individually. As we said, that was then. What the ad fails to mention is that all or most of those 40 support him now. A number of them are working to elect him. Here’s why they criticized him, and why they came around later. The primary Watkins came to the race as a West Point graduate and former Army ranger, an engineer, an adventurer and an outsider. His father put more than $587,000 into a super PAC that supported his campaign with TV ads, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. (The sum has since grown to nearly $766,000, Federal Election Commission reports show.) His first time voting in Kansas was in a 2017 Topeka city council race, and it was unclear if he had ever voted anywhere before then, McClatchy and the Kansas City Star said. As Watkins decided on running for office, he discussed possibilities with Democrats, too, the Kansas City Star reported in yet another story. It was all a bit too much for some Kansans. And so on July 31, a group of 40 "grassroots leaders" in the district issued a news release expressing "concerns" about Watkins. They said: "Based on reports published in the Kansas City Star, a search of voter records, and the candidate’s own words, Watkins has never voted in a partisan election in Kansas – or any other state. He was not registered in Kansas until recently, when he registered in preparation for filing his candidacy for the open congressional seat." They noted "additional questions about the significant funding the candidate is receiving from out-of-state sources. His residency is also unclear since he returned to Kansas shortly before running for office. His wife does not live in Kansas." Finally, they said, Watkins "used the likeness and the words of President Trump without permission suggesting he had been endorsed by the man he didn’t vote for. Reliable sources have confirmed that there have been no candidate endorsements for this race and that no permission was given for Watkins to suggest otherwise." In short, they viewed him as someone who hadn’t done the work or paid his dues, a newcomer taking shortcuts and liberties. Then he won the primary. And now Watkins still faces questions from reporters and from Democrats concerning his role in starting or building a company, a result of another Kansas City Star story. PolitiFact addressed that earlier this month after the DCCC brought it up in a different ad. The DCCC continues those questions in its newest ad, too. But the new ad’s claim about being denounced by 40-plus Republican leaders stood out to us as odd, considering that President Trump was in Topeka on Oct. 6, praising Watkins. And Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for Watkins just last week. "I’m here for one reason and one reason only," Pence told nearly 200 people at the Oct. 19 rally, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. "Kansas and America needs Steve Watkins in the Congress of the United States of America. So what about those Republican denouncements cited in the DCCC ad? Every one of the 40 expressing concerns has changed his or her mind, said Cheryl Reynolds, a member of the Kansas Republican executive committee and chair of the party’s 2nd Congressional District organization. Reynolds, it should be noted, was at the top of the list of those expressing concerns about Watkins in July. She was the person who sent out the list in the first place. She told us she has spoken with nearly every on the list, and was told by intermediaries that those she had not reached share her support now for Watkins. Asked what changed, Reynolds told us that after the primary, she set up two meetings between the nominee and district Republican leaders, including county chairmen and women, to hear one another out. "We care about the positions" that elected leaders will go to Washington to work on, she said. "And we are confident that we have a candidate who supports the positions of the 2nd District." Those include a strong border, opposition to abortion and support for the Second Amendment. In an earlier statement, Reynolds and three others on that list — the entirety of the Kansas Republicans’ 2nd District officers — said, "We are confident Steve Watkins will represent the conservative values of Kansans — and continue to contribute to Making America Great Again and helping to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda." Ed O'Brien, the district's Republican vice chair and one of the 40 who signed the earlier letter of concern, affirmed the sentiment in an email to PolitiFact. "Steve Watkins more than satisfied our curiosity," O'Brien said. "His positions on the issues closely mirrored our own and those of the majority of 2nd District voters. Once we got to know Steve better we were more than happy to throw our support behind Steve Watkins, the people's choice." Some holdouts Is it all peace, harmony and kumbaya? PolitiFact attempted to reach three of Watkins’ primary opponents who were outspoken during their race, but did not get calls back. One of them had called Watkins "a charlatan, a fraud and an opportunist." Another Republican, Kris Marple, chairman of the Wilson County Republican Party, told us in an email that he backed a different candidate in the primary but did not sign the letter. "However, I'm supporting Steve in the general, and I feel that most of those that did sign the letter are supporting him as well, but I don't know who nor how many," Marple said. This is not unconditional support. Marple told reporters from McClatchy in early October that while he’s willing to give Watkins his nod, "if we come to find out that stuff’s true and he’s really not what he says he is, we’ll replace him in two years, I guess." Another sign of ambivalence came through during the Kansas Farm Bureau PAC’s statewide endorsement process. The PAC announced its endorsements Oct. 10 but declined to back a candidate in the 2nd Congressional District. Asked why, Cory Saunders, the bureau’s public policy manager, told us that when members were polled, "there just weren’t a lot of recommendations for either Watkins or Davis," the Democratic opponent. Our ruling The DCCC said that "over 40 Republican leaders denounced" the Watkins campaign. The big group of 40 that stated concerns did so in late July. Reynolds, the district official who made those concerns public, says the Republicans are now behind the candidate. It may be conditional love, and there may be holdouts among others in the district. When something was true months ago but the actors have changed their minds, and when the context needs to be explained this fully, we rate it Half True.

pomt-11669	"Every taxpayer, their taxes are going down, except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/05/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-everyone-tax-cuts-but-manhattan-francisco/	The nation’s new tax laws put in place by ruling Republicans won’t leave everyone paying less to Uncle Sam forever, projections show, mainly because nearly all legislated individual income-tax reductions expire after 2025. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stirred our curiosity when he asserted that certain rich Americans would face increased taxes off the bat. "By the way," Cruz said in Senate debate Dec. 19, 2017, "there is one subset of people whose taxes will go up under this, the rich people in high-tax Democratic states. The irony of all the high dudgeon from our Democratic friends pounding the table about ‘this is a tax cut for the rich,’ the only people whose taxes are going up are the really rich," Cruz said. Cruz, seeking re-election in 2018, was even more specific, saying: "The middle class, their taxes are all going down. The working class, their taxes are going down. Every taxpayer, their taxes are going down," Cruz said, "except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up." We unsuccessfully queried Cruz about how he reached his conclusion about higher taxes solely hitting plump cats in the Big Apple and The City (which--honest--is what San Francisco residents call their town). To be sure, studies of the plan signed into law by President Donald Trump suggest that many wealthy Americans will see tax cuts--while some will pay more. We didn’t confirm, though, that those likely paying more live only in San Francisco and Manhattan. But experts told us wealthier workers in high-tax states and cities are at risk of higher tabs in the main because the law limits to $10,000 how much anyone may deduct in state and local income taxes. Two studies signal plan’s 'winners, losers' Toward the end of 2017, PolitiFact in Washington looked at impact studies of the adopted tax plan by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. According to the committee, taxpayers stand to enjoy reductions in 2019 (the first year of its analysis) with the average tax rate decreasing in each of 11 income groupings. Yet not everyone is projected to see lower taxes every year. In 2027, the committee’s analysis says, taxpayers earning up to $75,000 a year would face average tax rates higher than what they faced under existing law with people in higher brackets still paying less than they would if the law hadn’t changed. Why the big changes before 2027? The primary reason is that the law phases out some of the individual tax cuts after 2025. Also, some inflation adjustments imposed by the law are less generous than previous ones. Separately, the center’s analysis indicates that from the get-go, some taxpayers within each income bracket will likely pay more in taxes--though 95 percent will see reductions or not lose ground. By phone to our inquiry, the center’s Mark Mazur pointed out that the analysis shows a subset of taxpayers in each quintile stand to pay more in taxes in the plan’s first year, 2018. At the low end, Table 4 states, 1.2 percent of taxpayers in the lowest income quintile will pay more; at the high end, the table indicates, 6.2 percent of taxpayers in the highest income quintile stand to pay more in taxes than if the law hadn’t changed. Also, the center’s breakdown suggests, nearly one in five of the nation’s tip-top wealthiest will see higher taxes. To be precise, the analysis says 16.2 percent of taxpayers in the top tenth of 1 percent in income will pay an average of $387,610 more in federal taxes in 2018 than if the law had gone unchanged: Income range Percentage with a tax cut in 2018 Average tax cut for those with a cut Percentage with a tax increase in 2018 Average tax increase for those with an increase Lowest 20 percent 53.9 percent - $130 1.2 percent $810 20th to 40th percentile 86.8 percent - $480 4.6 percent $740 40th to 60th percentile 91.3 percent - $1,090 7.3 percent $910 60th to 80th percentile 92.5 percent - $2,070 7.3 percent $1,360 80th to 90th percentile 92.3 percent - $3,370 7.6 percent $1,800 90th to 95th percentile 94.4 percent - $4,910 5.5 percent $1,890 95th to 99th percentile 97.3 percent - $13,890 2.7 percent $8,260 Top 1 percent 90.7 percent - $61,940 9.3 percent $93,910 Top 0.1 percent 83.7 percent - $285,490 16.2 percent $387,610 SOURCE: Report, Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, "Distributional Analysis of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," Dec. 18, 2017 Factors behind higher taxes ‘idiosyncratic’ We asked Mazur to explain why some Americans will pay more in taxes. Broadly, Mazur said, those paying more in 2018 will end up doing so for idiosyncratic reasons. For instance, Mazur said by email that larger "families with lots of dependents who are not eligible for the child tax credit (for example because the children are too old or because the dependents are not children) could see a tax increase because the loss of personal exemptions could be greater than the increase in the standard deduction. "In addition, some taxpayers with large amounts of deductions (e.g., moving expenses, casualty losses, alimony paid) could be made worse off under the new law," Mazur wrote. Also, Mazur and other experts said the $10,000 limit on deductible state and local tax payments could leave some taxpayers confronting higher federal taxes--though Mazur said that would apply across the country, not just to residents of San Francisco or Manhattan. "This can occur anywhere in the country, though states and localities with higher taxes generally would be the most likely to bump up against the $10,000 annual limit," he wrote. All this said, Mazur added, most people will still be better off tax-wise in 2018. We also heard back about Cruz’s claim from John Buhl of the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank that has posted sample forecasts of the law’s effect on different earners. By email, Buhl said the "people most likely to see some increase in taxes are higher income earners in high-tax states and localities who" have heavily relied on state and local tax deductions. "Generally speaking, those most likely to be impacted are in the 90th to 99th income percentiles," Buhl said. Buhl noted a wrinkle when it comes to the nation’s super-wealthy in that, he said, the top 1 percent of taxpayers hail from households that typically don't benefit from the state and local deduction; they instead face the federal alternative minimum tax levied on higher-income households that take a lot of deductions to ensure that they pay at least a minimum amount of tax. "Given that, only some wealthier taxpayers will end up paying more," Buhl said. Experts in New York, California Tax experts in the states singled out by Cruz each told us that most taxpayers will pay less in the plan’s first years, but there will be people paying more. In New York, Edmund J. McMahon of the Albany-based Empire Center for Public Policy, a nonpartisan think tank that advocates policy reforms based on free-market principles, took note in a Dec. 13, 2017, blog post that despite the new law reducing tax rates for the nation’s highest earners, the combined federal, state and local income tax rate on the wage, salary, bonus and self-employment incomes of the highest-earning New York City residents would be going up by about a percentage point. By phone and email, McMahon called Cruz’s claim generally correct—though McMahon said that what the Texan said applies to wealthy residents in all of New York’s boroughs, not just Manhattan where "income millionaires are most concentrated," McMahon said. The effects also will extend beyond the wealthiest residents of San Francisco, McMahon said, in that high earners across California will be affected by the cap on deductible state and local taxes. McMahon otherwise speculated that Cruz with his locale-specific claim "was playing to the stereotypes people have" about where the very wealthiest Americans abide. Annette Nellen, a San Jose State University expert on tax law, provided us with a document she drafted spelling out the likely tax effects on different taxpayers. Generally, Nellen’s presentation states, most individuals will see tax reductions though individual results will depend, in part, on types of income and amounts; the ages of dependent children; and whether lost deductions drive up taxes more than savings attributable to reduced rates. Our ruling Cruz said that under the tax changes, every "taxpayer, their taxes are going down, except rich people in Manhattan and San Francisco. Some of them, their taxes may go up." Cruz clearly engages in hyperbole here, though the gist of his statement holds water in that most taxpayers are projected to enjoy lower federal taxes through 2025. Also, those most likely to see their taxes go up include wealthy wage earners in high-tax states and cities. Still, projections show that across income groups, not every taxpayer will see lower taxes, contrary to what Cruz said, and many of those who do see tax savings are likely to lose them after 2025. It’s also so that residents of high-tax states and cities at risk of higher taxes aren’t limited to Manhattan and San Francisco.

pomt-04155	"The average kid comes out of Virginia colleges with about $25,000-plus in debt."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/24/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-graduates-facing-a/	As the father of five young adults, Gov. Bob McDonnell says he feels the pain of rising college tuition. "The average kid comes out of Virginia colleges with about $25,000 plus in debt, and that’s just not acceptable long-term," he said during a Dec. 6 news conference. No doubt, a college education is expensive. But we wondered if the governor’s debt figure is correct. Paul Logan, a McDonnell spokesman, said his boss’s statement is based on data in an October 2012 report by the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit group that annually examines the debt loads of graduates. The study tallied the average student debt in each state for the 2010-2011 academic year. Among Virginia graduates who had taken out loans, the average debt was $24,717, ranking 23rd highest in the nation. That’s pretty close to McDonnell’s number, but there’s a major caveat: that figure only averages the debt of students who took out loans. It does not take into account those who were fortunate enough to graduate without debt. The institute’s figures show that 59 percent of Virginia students graduated with debt and 41 percent did not. The group’s website said the average debt among Virginia graduates who got bachelor degrees during the 2010-11 school year was $14,628. The debt data comes from answers colleges provide to a survey by Peterson’s, a college guide publishing company. Peterson’s survey, which looks at students graduating from four-year public universities and private nonprofit colleges, was answered by 55 percent of colleges and universities that awarded bachelor’s degrees in the 2010-2011 school year. The institute says there are limitations to the figures it uses in its report. Very few for-profit colleges report figures on student debt, and those schools typically generate high borrowing, the report says. And because the data is provided voluntarily, colleges "may actually have a disincentive for honest and full reporting," the study says. The group also says that colleges may not be aware of the full private loan debt held borne by their graduates. Despite those concerns, the institute says the Peterson survey is the only data that allows analysis of student debt among bachelors’ degrees recipients. One final note: Student loans by no means encompass all the money borrowed for college. In 2011, the federal government disbursed $10.6 billion in Parent Plus loans to just under 1 million families, according to a report by ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education. Our ruling McDonnell said the average student graduating from Virginia colleges is about $25,000 in debt. The study he cites says that’s the level of debt among students who have taken out loans. But McDonnell omits a key point. The average he cited doesn’t count a large number of students who graduated debt free. When they are included, the average is $14,628. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-06787	Says he worked with the Democratic legislature to balance spending with revenues so that "at the end of my four-year term, the rainy day fund was established at more than $2 billion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-governor-he-built-rainy-day-fund/	Mitt Romney usually stresses his business background rather than his time as Massachusetts governor. But with President Barack Obama still reeling from the Standard & Poor’s credit downgrade, Romney has lately reminded voters of his bipartisan budget-cutting with the legislature when he was governor. Here’s what Romney said about his work with the Democratic legislature in a speech to a Manchester Rotary club on Aug. 8, 2011. "We worked together to find a way not to just reduce the rate of growth in spending but to actually cut back on spending in the state budget. And so I was able to do that, and then we worked together in ensuing years to hold down our spending level relative to our revenue level. And that was why at the end of my four-year term, the rainy day fund was established at more than $2 billion." We wanted to explore whether Romney is right that his bipartisan efforts were so successful. To back up the claim, the Romney campaign pointed us a to series of state financial statements. They show that shortly after he took office in 2003, Romney and the legislature did cut spending for the 2004 budget year by slightly more than 1 percent. However, spending increased in subsequent years. And they also show that when Romney left office in 2007, Massachusetts’ Rainy Day Fund did indeed hold more than $2 billion. Massachusetts budget watchers we spoke with don’t quarrel with those particulars. They also say it's true that Romney didn’t act alone. "Obviously he did that with the Democratic legislature." said Geoff Beckwith, director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that represents local governments in the state. Michael Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a non-partisan fiscal policy group, presented a less-rosy picture of bipartisan cooperation but acknowledged the results. "Romney presented budgets and the legislature rewrote his budgets, and then he’d veto a few things, and then they’d override his vetoes." The analysts agree that Romney’s account of his fiscal record is largely accurate but doesn’t tell the whole story. Widmer notes that aside from 2003, when Romney and lawmakers took emergency action to cut state aid to cities and towns, spending under Romney rose every year, often far faster than the rate of inflation. The state also received more revenue after the legislature and Romney made adjustments to state fees and taxes. Romney’s campaign has characterized them as "closing loopholes" or increases for a specific purpose, such as transportation. Others, however, describe them as tax hikes. "There were no broad-based tax increases," said Widmer, "but part of the revenue growth was corporate tax increases and fee increases." The growth of the nation's economy also played a significant role. Romney came into office during a downturn, but for much of his term his term, the stock market boomed. Collections from Massachusetts’ capital gains tax on Romney’s watch outstripped estimates by $1.3 billion. "That’s where most of the growth in the rainy day fund came from. It wasn’t part of some sort of concerted effort to hold down spending beyond what the estimates were," said Beckwith. Added Widmer, "All of these numbers are in the context of national forces that he as governor had very little to do with or any other governor." Our Ruling: Mitt Romney said he worked with Democrats to leave behind a rainy day fund that topped $2 billion. The state's financial records back that up.

Afterward, we received additional information from the Social Security Administration, which told us that Congress amended the original Social Security Act to begin dispensing monthly checks in 1940. As such, we are republishing this item with a rating of Mostly False. NBC’s Tonight Show is usually a pundit-free zone. But on Nov. 8, 2013, host Jay Leno entered the pundit world during a newsmaker interview with Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. As Cruz made his case against the Affordable Care Act, Leno pushed back a bit. Leno said it was too early to declare the entire program a failure. "Social Security took seven years before anybody got the first check," Leno said. "It was seven years before anyone got anything." That claim sent us to the history books to see if it was true, and even more important, to learn what explained the delay. Social Security broke new legal ground Just as with today’s Affordable Care Act, a big constitutional cloud hung over the Social Security Act. It became law on Aug. 14, 1935, but its future was murky until the U.S. Supreme Court declared it valid. "When the federal government seeks to expand its influence in new areas, it must find some basis in the Constitution to justify its action," wrote historian Larry DeWitt with the Social Security Administration. The rationale for doing what the government had never done before was rooted in the constitutional authority to collect taxes to "promote the general welfare." Congress bought that argument but whether the court would agree was very much in doubt. The court did not rule for nearly two years. In the interim, the newly appointed Social Security managers were tackling an operational challenge that DeWitt calls unprecedented. "The record keeping involved was on a scale never before attempted," DeWitt wrote. "By the time of the court's ruling in May 1937, more than 26 million Social Security numbers had been issued; around $150 million in taxes had been collected; a dozen or so benefit claims had already been paid, and there were about 150 local field offices in operation around the country." We’ll say more about those early benefit claims in just a bit. Savvy planning Unlike the Affordable Care Act, Social Security was set up as a standalone insurance program. (Today’s debate over whether it truly lives up to that is a separate question.) As an insurance program, it needed to build up reserves before it could start paying out benefits. Plus, because it tied benefits to earnings, there had to be time for workers to log enough pay to qualify for those monthly checks. The original Social Security Act, in Section 202, said people would have to wait until Jan. 1, 1942, before they could start receiving monthly checks. That would be seven years after passage. But Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to move up the issuance of monthly checks, the Social Security Administration told PunditFact. The first monthly check was issued in 1940, the Social Security Administration told us. That’s roughly five years, not seven. The law had another wrinkle. The administration and Congress added a feature to do a little something for people who retired before then. For the years 1937 to 1939, one-time lump sum checks went out to retirees, or if they died, to their estates. DeWitt says the very first beneficiary was an Ohio streetcar motorman named Ernest Ackerman. "Ackerman worked one day under Social Security — Jan. 1, 1937. His wage for that day was $5. He dutifully paid his payroll tax of one nickel and he received a one-time check from Social Security for 17 cents." In the few years of this temporary program, about 441,000 people got checks and the total payments were more than $25 million. Our ruling Leno said after Social Security passed, it was seven years before "anybody got the first check." That’s what was intended, but Congress amended the law in 1939 to move up the issuance of monthly checks, the Social Security Administration told us. Moreover, people received lump sum checks in from 1937 to 1939. That interim effort involved a lot of people and a fair chunk of change. There’s an element of truth to Leno’s claim, but not much more. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Jay Leno	None	None	None	2013-11-12T16:26:47	2013-11-08	['None']
pomt-05085	Tim Kaine "made Virginia the best state for business four years in a row."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/02/majority-pac/majority-pac-says-tim-kaine-made-virginia-best-sta/	The Majority PAC, an advocacy group for Democrats, has jumped into Virginia’s ad wars to boost U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine. One of its TV spots starts by slamming Republican nominee George Allen’s record during his term in the Senate from 2001 to 2007. Then the ad exalts Kaine’s record as governor from 2006 to 2010. "But Tim Kaine? He made Virginia the best state for business four years in a row," the narrator says. In citations in the ad and on its website, Majority PAC bases its claim on a story in The Virginian-Pilot on September 24, 2009 about then-Gov. Kaine’s announcement that Forbes magazine had named Virginia the best state for business for the fourth consecutive year. We’ll stipulate that Forbes proclaimed Virginia the best state for business each year of Kaine’s governorship, a fact we have previously noted. On April 7, 2011, we gave a True rating to Kaine’s statement that during his governorship, various publications had named Virginia "best managed state, best state for business and best state to raise a child." But Majority Pac’s commercial adds a wrinkle. It says Kaine "made’’ Virginia the best state for business. So in this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine whether Kaine’s efforts as governor were the reason Virginia topped Forbes’ lists. Kurt Badenhausen, a senior editor at Forbes who works on the state rankings, was reluctant to say whether Kaine was responsible for Virginia’s No. 1 status. "I’ll just say that we base the rankings on 30-something economic metrics," he told us. Badenhausen said the metrics fall into six categories: business costs, labor supplies, regulatory environment, current economic climate, the state’s growth prospects and quality of life. As our collegues at FactCheck.org recently noted, Forbes started its annual "best state" rankings in August 2006 -- just seven months into Kaine’s term as governor. That was hardly enough time for Kaine to have major impact on the Virginia’s business climate. Kaine didn’t take credit for the honor, and was quoted in the 2006 Forbes article saying the state had a "bipartisan tradition of wanting to have a strong business climate." The 2006 article lauded Virginia for a number of attributes that had been decades and longer in the making. Forbes noted Virginia’s low corporate income tax of 6 percent, a level that had existed for more than 30 years. The magazine also said Virginia’s top-notch AAA bond rating kept the state from "nickel and diming its corporate constituents." The state has had a AAA credit rating since 1938. The article said, "Virginia gets a "tremendous benefit from its location and infrastructure. The state is located within 750 miles of two-thirds of the U.S. population. It is home to one of the country's busiest international airports, Washington Dulles International, and the country's fifth busiest port, Hampton Roads." Forbes listed as among "Virginia’s strongest attributes" the University of Virginia (founded in 1819) and The College of William & Mary (founded in 1693). We should note that Virginia was highly regarded by Forbes in 2005 -- the year before Kaine entered office. That year, Forbes ranked the nation’s 150 largest metropolitan areas by their friendliness to starting a business or a career. Virginia had three regions on the Top 20 list: Washington DC-Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and metropolitan Richmond. Only Texas had more, with four areas in the Top 20. Forbes wrote, "Where are the best places to jumpstart a business or a career? Texas and Virginia, with highly educated labor forces and relatively low business costs, score well on our annual rankings of the 150 biggest metros. No other state places more than one locale in the upper echelon." Virginia ranked second behind Utah on the Forbes best state list in 2010 and 2011 under Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell. Our ruling Majority Pac says Tim Kaine "made Virginia the best state for business four years in a row." The state earned the honor from Forbes Magazine for four straight years when Kaine was governor, but it’s wrong to say Kaine created the conditions that led to Virginia’s selection. The major attributes Forbes cited for Virginia’s rating were in place long before Kaine took office: a low corporate tax rate, AAA bond rating, infrastructure, location, an educated workforce and top universities. Kaine certainly deserves kudos for preserving Virginia’s assets. But as governor, he attributed the top honors to Virginia’s "bipartisan tradition" of building a strong business climate. So we rate Majority PAC’s claim Mostly False.	None	Majority PAC	None	None	None	2012-07-02T11:45:37	2012-06-17	['Virginia']
pomt-00180	"Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/21/dan-mccready/does-gop-candidate-actually-want-abolish-departmen/	In the closing statement of a debate Wednesday night, Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready slammed Republican Mark Harris for his stance on education, repeating a favorite line of attack. "Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education," said McCready, a former Marine who is running for the seat held by Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from south Charlotte east to include Lumberton and up the Interstate 95 corridor to Fayetteville. McCready made similar versions of the same claim earlier in the night and also during an Oct. 10 debate, when he said Harris, a former pastor, was "on the record saying he would abolish the Department of Education." We wondered if Harris, who defeated Pittenger in the Republican primary, actually said he would eliminate the cabinet-level Education Department, which has been around since 1979. Since McCready has repeated this claim many times, we decided to check it out for ourselves. Our finding? The statement is true, and Harris isn’t denying it. We did Google and Nexis searches and discovered two reports from The Charlotte Observer that said Harris had suggested he would like to eliminate the Department of Education. The reports cited a Republican primary debate from April 22, 2014, when Harris was running for a U.S. Senate seat held at the time by Democrat Kay Hagan. At the end of the debate, the moderator opened the floor for questions from voters in the audience. The first question asked the candidates which federal department they would "actively campaign to eliminate" and why they believed that department deserved to be eliminated. Sen. Thom Tillis, then a state representative who ultimately won the GOP nomination and later the general election, answered first. "I think, going back to Common Core, I’d start looking at the Department of Education," he said. "We existed for more than a century without one." Tillis explained that he believed bureaucrats in the department were overpaid and were restricting teachers with unnecessary rules and regulations. Harris, who answered next, said he agreed with Tillis and added that he would also consider cutting the energy and commerce departments. He said: "Yeah, I would really say and agree with Thom that the fact that the Department of Education, as I mentioned earlier, has certainly demonstrated such an overreach and really is something that needs — education belongs in our state and our local communities, and so I think that that’s an area. But I’ll also add to that that I think when you look at the Department of Energy, when you look at the Department of Commerce, again I think that we’ve seen so many regulations that keep stopping and holding back the job creators here in our nation, that those would be departments I would be interested in seeing." Clearly, Harris was on board with Tillis’s suggestion that the Education Department should be eliminated, even if he also included the Energy and Commerce Departments in his response. Aaron Simpson, communications manager for the McCready campaign, pointed to the Charlotte Observer’s coverage of that debate as evidence in support of McCready’s claim. Simpson also noted that Harris did not refute the claim during the Oct. 10 debate. Instead, Harris countered that the department had overstepped its authority and that its responsibilities would be better left to the states. "I have clearly stated that the Department of Education has lost its purpose and its way from when it was founded," Harris said. "It has become a larger agency. It has become an animal that is eating money." Later during that debate, after McCready repeated the same claim, Harris lamented that his opponent "continues to go back and reiterate about the Department of Education." "Again, I will make clear, the Department of Education has gotten to a place where they are holding our money back if you do not go along with Common Core and other pieces on education that do not fit with what the citizens of North Carolina have wanted," Harris said. "Local control, state control of education has always been the best answer," he added. Andy Yates, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said Harris still stands by his belief. "Mark is passionate that education is a state and local issue and that we need to keep the federal government out of our classrooms and out of our education," Yates said. Our ruling McCready said, "Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education." In 2014, during a GOP primary debate for the U.S. Senate, Harris said he thought there were enough problems with the Education Department to get rid of it. His statements since then have supported that position. We rate McCready’s statement True.

pomt-07544	Says a photo ID voting law in Georgia didn't dissuade black voters from participating in voting. "It hasn't, it doesn't, and apparently, if you do cause and effect in that state, it's been helpful."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/04/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-georg/	Editor's note: The statement for this item was paraphrased after publishing for clarity. Republicans in the Ohio House said they were acting to ensure ballot integrity last month when they raced to approve legislation requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification at the polls. Backers of the legislation, House Bill 159, produced no evidence of voter impersonation at the polls -- the problem that the measure claims to solve. But they pointed specifically to Georgia in responding to criticism that the law would disproportionately affect ethnic and racial minorities, students, senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. All are groups with lower rates of having government-issued IDs, several national studies have found. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Bob Mecklenborg of Cincinnati, pointed to totals in Georgia that showed an increase in voting among all racial groups following adoption of a voter ID law. "The African-American vote in Georgia has increased dramatically -- five times the amount of the white vote," he said. "Had there been a contrary result, we might have taken a different position on the bill," House Speaker William G. Batchelder said March 23 at a news conference. "Had this dissuaded black voters from participating, we might have taken a totally different look at it. It hasn't, it doesn't, and apparently, if you do cause and effect in that state, it's been helpful." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a closer look at the speaker's claim. The voting numbers from Georgia -- where photo ID for in-person voting was first required in September 2007 -- came from Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who testified in Columbus for the Ohio bill. Kemp said the Latino vote in Georgia increased from 18,000 in 2004 to 43,000 in 2008, an increase of 140 percent; the African-American vote increased from 834,000 in 2004 to 1.2 million in 2008, an increase of 42 percent; and the white vote increased from 2.3 million in 2004 to 2.5 million in 2008, an increase of 8 percent. Comparing the non-presidential years of 2006 and 2010, the Latino vote increased 66 percent, African-American participation increased 44 percent, and white voting rose almost 12 percent. Was the photo ID requirement the cause of the increase, as Batchelder suggested? Batchelder's office didn't get back to us. We put the question to William Minozzi, an assistant professor of political science at Ohio State University, who examined the effects of voter ID in a study published last fall. "Correlation does not imply causation," he said. Georgia's increased voter participation is "the result of a lot of different things. I think you could call this cherry-picking." "It's an obviously specious argument," said law professor Daniel Tokaji, associate director of Ohio State University's Election Law @ Moritz project, who testified against the photo-ID bill. "A lot of things affect turnout. The last two election cycles are ones in which the Democratic base has been extraordinarily motivated." Both Minozzi and Tokaji cited the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose voter-registration drive in 2008 was called the largest in the history of presidential campaigns. The drive's biggest announced goal was in Georgia, where it aimed to register and turn out 500,000 unregistered African-American voters. The actual increase from 2004 was 466,000, according to the secretary of state's office, which cited its own outreach program to get free ID cards to voters as a factor increasing turnout. A review of research by the University of Wisconsin, responding to voter-ID legislation proposed in that state this year, noted that some researchers thought that such laws might increase turnout, possibly by increasing voter awareness -- "but we found no research showing that effect." A study published in the Harvard Law & Policy Review concluded only that outreach programs may counter a decline in turnout it associated with voter ID laws. Over all, UW found that "studies of the effect of voter ID laws on voter turnout find no discernible relationship or a small negative impact," and that "data limitations make these relationships notoriously difficult to estimate." "You can’t clearly identify the cause and effect," Minozzi said. "There is not wide evidence for one side or the other." A recently completed study by University of Georgia political science professor Trey Hood found "credible evidence" that Georgia's voter ID law did lower turnout among people who lacked government photo IDs before the law took effect, by about one third of a percentage point in 2008 compared to 2004 levels. However, the Hood study found no evidence to suggest there was a racial or ethnic component to the dropoff. In fact, the dropoff happened across all ethnic groups with white voters actually seeing the biggest share of that overall third of a percentage point drop in voting because of the law, he said. "It doesn't affect minorities disproportionately -- they were impacted the same or slightly less than whites by the law," said Hood in a phone interview. "From my observation and from my research, it's sort of a been a wash." Speaker Batchelder was correct when he said voting increased in Georgia after its photo ID law took effect. Suggesting that the restriction caused the increase is a logical fallacy that ignores important other factors and is unsupported by research. We rate his statement Half True.	None	William G.

pomt-13062	"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.' "	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/17/blog-posting/no-someone-wasnt-paid-3500-protest-donald-trump-it/	Donald Trump has suggested that paid protesters targeted his rallies during the 2016 campaign, and even stronger charges from conspiracy websites such as Infowars have flooded the Internet. If such claims piqued your interest and you plugged "paid protesters" into Google at mid-day on Nov. 17, at the top of the list is this one: "Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.' " The link cites not one but two seemingly mainstream media outlets. It’s credited to "abcnews.com.co" and includes the abbreviation "(AP)," which is how the Associated Press marks its stories. But the story doesn’t have anything to do with ABC News, and it doesn’t have anything to do with the Associated Press. It is 100 percent fake. It was created by Paul Horner, who posts fake news on a variety of websites. Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google’s news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an interview with the Washington Post -- $10,000 a month in ad sales. In the Post interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500. "His followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything," Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, "His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist." Here’s a screenshot of Lewandowski’s since-deleted tweet: Asked by the Post’s Caitlin Dewey why he posted the fake story, Horner responded, "Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests — trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it." The story’s high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner’s decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11. Automated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has regularly debunked articles from websites operated by Horner. Horner even quoted himself by name in the fake story, something he does in many of his posts. PolitiFact has also debunked at least three fake Horner stories in recent years. PolitiFact was unable to reach Horner independently. Our ruling A web posting headlined, "Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally,' " ranks high on Google searches for the phrase "paid protesters."

pomt-05348	Says "One-third of our healthcare dollars go to wasteful insurance billing and bureaucracy."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/	State lawmakers are fresh off a legislative session in which they passed sweeping health care reforms. But Jennifer Williamson, a candidate running to represent House District 36, isn’t content with just those changes. In a mailer she’s sent to potential voters, she’s promised to fight for a single-payer system. What’s more, she knows how she’d fund it. Here’s what she says: "Jennifer Williamson will work to implement a single, statewide, publicly funded plan that covers everyone in our state. Jennifer knows this doesn’t have to cost more, because one-third of our healthcare dollars go to wasteful insurance billing and bureaucracy that could be eliminated with a universal, publicly-funded plan." There is a lot there -- way more than we can get to in one fact check -- and much of it is hypothetical. There are estimates about how much a single-payer system would cost, for example, but there’s not a clear consensus. So, we’re going to drill down into this idea that nearly a third of our dollars go to bureaucracy and billing. First, here’s a little health care primer. In the insurance industry, there’s something called a medical loss ratio. You might have heard this term back when the health care reform legislation was making its way through Congress. Basically, the medical loss ratio describes the percent of every dollar that an insurance company takes in that goes to medical costs. So, for instance, if a company has a 70 percent medical loss ratio, that means that 70 cents of every dollar goes to health care while 30 cents goes to other areas -- administration, advertising and profit, for example. (Under the new federal healthcare law, the ratio must be 80 percent or insurance companies have to rebate the overage.) With that out of the way, let’s get to what we heard from the Williamson campaign. Spokeswoman Tera Pierce pointed us to several articles on the subject of medical loss ratios. Perhaps the most central to the mailer’s argument was one out of the New England Journal of Medicine called "Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada" by Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell and David Himmelstein. (Campbell comes from the Canadian Institute for Health Information; Woolhandler and Himmelstein from the Cambridge Hospital and Harvard Medical School.) That study found that "(a)fter exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United State." The campaign encouraged us to speak with Dr. Sam Metz, a physician who is both an advocate for Williamson and for a single payer system. Metz noted -- and we’ll come back to this in a minute -- that the average medical loss ratio in the United States is about 80 percent. But the reason this study tacks on another 11 percent is that the medical loss ratio "does not take into account the cost of physicians to collect from insurance companies." When you consider that end of the supply chain -- or at least when this study did -- the amount of cash flowing toward administrative costs increases. Now, it’s worth noting that this study advocated for a single payer system after comparing the U.S. to Canada. It’s also worth noting that the study is not without its critics. Health care, after all, is a very hot issue. With all that in mind, we called Dr. Jeff Luck, a professor of health management and policy at Oregon State University. Luck was less bully on the Woolhandler-Campbell study. "Thirty percent is an overstatement, I think," Luck said. "There are some proponents of a single-payer health care system that I think overstate the contribution of administration in insurance." What about the added costs to doctor offices and other providers? "That's probably a fair statement that physicians and hospitals spend money because of the complexity of the U.S. insurance system," he said. But, "I think even adding the insurance costs ... putting the costs at 30 percent is overstatement." Now, this is all a game of extrapolation. And we’re not health care experts. For a clearer understanding, we decided to dig up Oregon’s numbers, especially given that Williamson is talking about a statewide plan. This is where things get a little murkier. See, while Oregon might not have the best school system, and while we might have sky-high unemployment, we do manage to keep our insurance industry lean. We spoke with Cheryl Martinis, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Insurance Division. The amount of money going to administrative costs varies widely depending on the market. Nationally, large private insurers that provide coverage through employers see about 12 percent of their intake going to non-medical expenses. But if you look at the individual market, those can skyrocket to 30, sometimes 40 percent. Medicare’s overhead, meanwhile, is usually put somewhere around 2 or 3 percent, though some argue that’s a superficially low estimate. Ezra Klein over at the Washington Post has a really nice primer on this for those interested in reading more. All that said, Oregon’s overall medical loss ratio is around 89 percent, according to the Insurance Division. Put another way, in 2011 about 89 cents of every insurance dollar in Oregon went to medical costs. Only 2 cents went to profits. Now, Oregon is in a unique place because not only is our insurance market highly competitive in the Portland area, where the vast majority of Oregonians live, but two of our biggest insurers -- Providence and Kaiser -- are also providers. That means they can cut through administrative costs easily. They’re also not-for-profit. So, where does that leave us? Well, Williamson says that about 30 percent of our health care dollars goes to administrative costs and other bureaucracy. There is a peer-reviewed study that backs this up, even if it’s not the final word. She was also careful not to say that 30 percent of our insurance dollars go to administrative costs and bureaucracy -- just that 30 percent of our health care dollars did. It’s true that one professor we spoke to was skeptical of this study, but it was published in a reputable journal and, moreover, even that professor felt that it was appropriate to tack on the added administrative costs the provider incurs. The campaign also cited other studies that suggest providers incur considerable costs in their administrative dealings with insurance companies. Oregon’s health care industry is leaner than the national average and if Williamson is talking about a statewide single-payer system -- which is really the only sort she could conceivably impact in the position for which she is running -- that is important context. She wouldn’t be able to wring as much out of administrative costs in Oregon as she could nationally. As for the final ruling, we’ll give this statement a Mostly True. It’s accurate, but we think that voters might want additional information about statewide performance.	None	Jennifer Williamson	None	None	None	2012-05-11T16:35:01	2012-05-03	['None']
pomt-13510	Child care costs "in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition."	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/02/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-child-care-some-states-costs-mor/	Touting the Democratic presidential nominee, a Texas legislator said: "Hillary Clinton would provide all working families with relief from child-care costs, which in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition." State Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, floated her comparison in an August 2016 press conference called by Democratic leaders from Austin critical of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was rallying Austin-area supporters later the same day. Clinton has said she’ll focus on ensuring quality child care for all in part by making sure no family has to devote more than 10 percent of its income to child care. For the Truth-O-Meter’s sake, we wondered if child care costs exceed college tuition in some states. In 2014, PolitiFact found Mostly True President Barack Obama’s claim that in 31 states, "decent child care costs more than college tuition." Obama’s conclusion was cherry-picked from several results from an advocacy group’s 2013 survey of child care costs. Obama also ignored uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits might affect the comparison. When we inquired about Howard’s claim, Scott Daigle, her chief of staff, said by email she primarily drew on research posted online by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. A web search led us to an October 2015 institute breakout suggesting child care costs for a 4-year-old exceeded in-state tuition at a public college in 24 states in 2014 -- though not Texas. In Texas, such child care costs were estimated to be 91 percent of average in-state public college tuition. But Texas was one of 33 states where child care costs for an infant — which are usually higher than for older children — amounted to 118 percent of the state’s average public college in-state tuition. SOURCE: Report, "High quality child care is out of reach for working families," Economic Policy Institute, Oct. 6, 2015 And where did this data originate? The institute’s source for college costs was a March 2015 table from the National Center for Education Statistics showing average undergraduate in-state tuition and required fees for each state. By phone, the institute’s Elise Gould told us the institute fetched its child care cost figures from the results of a 2014 survey by Child Care Aware for America, a national nonprofit that says it seeks child care policies improving the lives of children and families. The group says in its 2014 report that the survey relied on state and local Child Care Resource and Referral offices to provide 2013 cost data related to the average price of child care for infants and 4-year-old children "in legally operating child care centers and family child care homes." Six states including Texas didn’t deliver information, the report states, so the price of child care in those states was adjusted from prior years’ data. Upshot, per the group: "In 2013, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 20 states." For Texas, a chart shows, the $6,643 for one year of child care for a 4-year-old (adjusted from 2012 data) trailed $8,522 in average annual tuition and fees at a public college. We noticed that the group’s 2015 report states that its survey taken that year showed that in 2014, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 28 states, though not Texas--a conclusion that differs with the institute's findings. "Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 19 states," the report states, Texas narrowly not among them. Infant care at a Texas center averaged $8,759; child care for a four-year-old averaged $6,730; average in-state public college tuition in Texas was $8,830, the report says. Gould said of Howard’s claim: "That seems true no matter how you measure it." Our ruling Howard said child care costs "in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition." State surveys and federal college tuition data suggest this contrast held in 2014 for around 20 to 30 states. The count varies depending on whether you focus on what's levied to care for a toddler or more costly infant care. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12732	Every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research "will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/03/shenggen-fan/fuzzy-math-foreign-aid-and-trade/	While the details are vague, foreign aid is on the chopping block in President Donald Trump’s pending budget. Non-military assistance accounts for less than 1 percent of federal spending and defenders of aid would like to argue that it actually pays dividends to America. Shenggen Fan, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, a widely respected organization, said his group had a study showing very specific paybacks tied to aid. "If we help the countries developing to invest in agriculture research, every $1 invested will bring $4 (in) trade with the countries and the United States," Fan said Feb. 2 at a meeting in Washington. "So if you're investing in foreign aid, you’re generating employment back in the U.S. It helps economic growth here in this country." Fan’s office said he was referring to a 1996 article that described a sort of domino effect. Agricultural research leads to higher production, which in turn delivers economic growth and the extra income generates demand for more imports. "When the flow of additional imports over time is taken into account, the $1 investment in agricultural research generates $4.39 of additional imports," the article said. That seems to back up Fan’s point, but it terms of what it means for sales by American companies, he pushed the findings a little too far. The article specifically noted that there’s no guarantee "that a particular donor country captures the gains from the increase in exports." Put another way, an investment of $1 might spur $4 in trade, but there’s no guarantee the original investor will be the one to benefit. Fan posted an item later that dialed back on the trade gains, writing that they would help "economies like the United States or Germany." In addition, that study is 20 years old, and we could find no other study that reached the same conclusion. Fan’s office cited a 2006 analysis from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The center wanted to gauge the economic impact of the work it funded. It did find that research boosted trade, but for a number of reasons, that result didn’t do much to bolster Fan’s case. In the first case, the Australians defined trade gains broadly to include increased sales by Aussie firms to developed countries such as Japan. On top of that, they didn’t find a 4-to-1 payback on trade. When we crunched their numbers, it was more like 1-to-1. The authors also warned that their dollar amounts were based on projected rather than actual benefits. "It is possible that these benefits never actually emerged or that the benefits that did emerge were considerably greater," they wrote. We asked a number of researchers if they knew of any study that linked foreign aid for agricultural research to greater exports for American firms. Not one could think of such work. "We are not aware of other quantitative estimates of a relationship between investment in agriculture in foreign countries and trade," Cheryl Christensen of the USDA’s Economic Research Service told us. The consensus that emerged was that the domino effect Fan had in mind might take place in some countries, but no analysis had pulled all the pieces together. "I believe that our foreign aid to agriculture is effective and can boost agricultural production and rural income in developing countries," Phillip Abbott, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us. "As countries grow, they may well -- many do -- need more food than they can produce themselves, and this leads to greater imports, including agriculture imports from U.S. agriculture. Turning this into a causal chain with a fixed multiplier, as claimed by Fan, is a stretch." Robert Paarlberg at Harvard University’s Kennedy School said plenty of research ties aid to greater productivity and rising incomes. "But it starts to become difficult when you look for links back to foreign aid, especially agricultural development aid," Paarlberg said. "There the links remain plausible, at least in countries capable of using aid well, but they become too remote to estimate with any confidence." Our ruling Fan said every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research "will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S." A 1996 article supports most of that assertion except for the part about all the trade being with the United States. However, that article is 20 years old and we could find no other study that mirrored its findings. The leading agricultural researchers we reached told us that in some countries, that general result might come about, but it varies from place to place and it is difficult to show the connection to foreign aid in the agricultural research sector. So Fan went too far on three points: the 4-to-1 payback, the amount of trade with the United States and the idea that this general rule applies to most countries when it is actually less predictable.

pomt-04170	"This week the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/17/allen-west/allen-west-said-house-voted-remove-word-lunatic-fe/	The first week of December in Congress was dominated by news about the fiscal cliff. So you will forgive us if we overlooked this other tidbit tucked into the final weekly newsletter sent by U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens. "This week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law," wrote West, who lost a close race to Democrat Patrick Murphy in District 18 in Florida’s Treasure Coast. "However, that does not mean there isn't plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government!" We can’t fact-check the amount of lunacy in Washington, D.C., but we couldn’t resist looking into whether the House actually voted to remove the word "lunatic" from federal law. On Dec. 5, the House voted 398-1 in favor of Senate Bill 2367, the 21st Century Language Act of 2012. The bill, which the Senate approved by unanimous consent in May, struck the word "lunatic" from federal law. As of Dec. 17, it was awaiting President Barack Obama’s signature. The vote was part of an effort to remove outdated and demeaning language, and it was supported by advocates for people with mental health conditions. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., in response to a constituent’s request. "The term ‘lunatic’ derives from the Latin word for ‘moon,’ " said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, before the House vote, according to the congressional record. "Before the modern era, it was used to describe a person who suffers from mental disease because of the belief that lunar cycles had an impact on brain function. But as science and medicine have progressed, society has come to understand mental illness with more clarity." Rep. Robert C. Scott, D-Va., said "this bill eliminates outdated references in the U.S. Code that stigmatize individuals with mental illness issues. ... The term ‘lunatic’ holds a place in antiquity and should no longer have a prominent place in our U.S. Code." Scott compared it to a law in 2010 that replaced parts of federal law containing the phrase "having mental retardation'' with the phrase "having intellectual disabilities.'' The bill deletes "lunatic" from Section 1 of Title 1 of the U.S. Code which states "the words ‘insane’ and ‘insane person’ and ‘lunatic’ shall include every idiot, lunatic, insane person, and person non compos mentis." The Congressional Research Service summary says the bill "removes references to the word ‘lunatic’ from rules of construction of the U.S. Code and banking law provisions concerning: (1) trust powers of banks, and (2) bank consolidations and mergers." University of Miami banking law professor Stanley Langbein told PolitiFact Florida that, "By lunatics, the law means what today we would refer to as persons ‘adjudicated incompetent’ – and the person’s affairs would probably not be administered by a committee, but by what we would call a ‘guardian.’ ... Moreover, the term ‘lunatic,’ though once commonly used in the law (the late 19th and early 20th centuries) is no longer used; when it was used, I believe it referred to a mentally disabled individual, usually what we would call a ‘special needs’ person, or more harshly a ‘mentally retarded’ person, today." The lone "no" vote was cast by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who issued a statement saying, "Not only should we not eliminate the word 'lunatic' from federal law when the most pressing issue of the day is saving our country from bankruptcy, we should use the word to describe the people who want to continue with business as usual in Washington." For the record, West voted to strike the word "lunatic," but he only gave it a brief mention in his final weekly newsletter, which focused more on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, foreign affairs, and the economy. And West wrote that his final weekly update as a congressman from District 22 wasn’t really his last word. (He represented District 22 but ran in District 18 due to redistricting. For more on his parting thoughts, read his post-election interview with NPR.) Our ruling West said the House of Representatives "voted to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law." Indeed, the House voted 398-1 to do just that. We rate this claim True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2012-12-17T12:24:22	2012-12-08	['None']

pomt-13629	Says Hillary Clinton's plan "would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-plan-would-tax-s/	Donald Trump focused on the economy during an Aug. 8 speech in Detroit, saying he would soon be releasing details of a new economic plan. In the meantime, he launched an attack on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, saying her economic plan was going to pose serious problems for small businesses. "Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent," he said, adding later in his speech, "Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I'm proposing." We wondered whether a Clinton presidency meant that small businesses would be paying nearly half their income to the federal government. But first, a word about small businesses. Most of us think of small businesses as businesses with a handful of employees, such as the corner grocery store, the local gasoline station or a nearby restaurant. Yet according to the government's definition, about 97 percent of all United States companies are classified as small by the Small Business Administration. In some sectors, you can have 1,500 employees or gross income of up to $38.5 million and still be considered a small business. (The IRS has its own set of rules.) When we asked the Trump campaign about the "almost 50 percent" claim, spokesman Dan Kowalski sent us a breakdown. Currently the top tax rate is 39.6 percent. Add 3.8 percent that a business owner could potentially be paying in Medicare taxes and you get 43.4 percent. That's under the current system. Clinton is proposing a 4 percent surcharge on high earners. That would bring the total tax rate to 47.4 percent, which is where the Trump campaign gets its "almost 50 percent" claim. "This rate would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry," Kowalski said, and he referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. We contacted the center, where senior fellow Roberton Williams said Trump's percentages were correct, but there's more to the story. That 4 percent tax only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million. That could be individuals or small business owners who report their business income on their individual tax returns. In addition, it would not apply to that first $5 million. Only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at an extra 4 percent. The surcharge "is not targeted to small business. It's a wealthy person's tax," Williams told us. "To the extent that those people are small business people, you can argue it's hitting small businessmen. But the bulk of small businesses are not at those income levels." Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens for Tax Justice, said only 34,251 of the 150 million tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's about 0.02 percent. And because, in some industries, you are no longer considered a small business when you have more than 100 employees or more than $750,000 in revenue, it's not known how many of the people in that 0.02 percent would meet the definition of a small business. Finally, in August 2011 the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that only 0.5 percent of small businesses report a profit in excess of $1 million, another indication that the surcharge would only affect a tiny fraction of small businesses. The surcharge would not affect corporate tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Clinton's plan "would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent." Clinton's proposal isn't directed at small businesses. Her surtax is intended to apply to rich individuals. The top tax rate (plus Medicare taxes) would go from the current 43.4 percent to 47.4 percent, but it would only be applied to amounts over $5 million. A mere 0.02 percent of tax returns fall into that category and some of those payers will not be small business owners. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details that would give a different impression.

pomt-03205	"Three years after getting the $100 million (from Mark Zuckerberg), less than two-thirds of students in Cory Booker's Newark graduate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/27/bookerfail/super-pac-criticizes-booker-low-newark-graduation-/	It was a match made in social media heaven when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg partnered publicly with tweet-happy Newark Mayor Cory Booker in September 2010. The two, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to announce a $100 million donation from Zuckerberg to be put toward public education in the city. Fast forward three years. Booker’s in the middle of a U.S. Senate race and a super PAC called American Commitment made a website called BookerFail to highlight criticism of him. "Three years after getting the $100 million, less than two-thirds of students in Cory Booker's Newark graduate," said a BookerFail video criticizing Booker for his inability to improve Newark public schools. We’ll look at how Newark schools have done since Zuckerberg’s donation, but first we’ll explain how his donation was made and to whom. Grant specifics Zuckerberg donated $100 million nearly three years ago to start a foundation for education called the Foundation for Newark’s Future. The money is a matching grant, so the foundation only spends as many dollars as other donors also contribute. The money must be used by 2015, said Kim McLain, the foundation’s president and CEO. The foundation divides grant funds into six categories, with "teacher quality and principal leadership" getting by far the largest chunk of money so far. That money goes toward funding merit pay, a controversial system of paying higher salaries to teachers whose students earn high test scores. More than $75 million has been allotted to the different causes in total, the foundation reported. McClain declined to say how much money has been matched so far, so it's unclear how much of Zuckerberg's donation has been spent. How big is this contribution, really? It amounts to little more than pocket change for a school district of Newark’s size, as it turns out. For perspective, consider that Newark’s entire yearly education budget is roughly $1 billion, so that’s $5 billion over the period of time when Zuckerberg’s money can be spent. "It’s not a game-changer," said Paul Tractenberg, founder of the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University-Newark. "If you use the money tactically, it’s enough money to do some interesting things." It’s also key that this money and the matching funds went directly to the foundation, not the city of Newark. When it comes to Newark schools, Booker doesn’t have any legal say in his role as mayor, and neither does any other city government official under his watch. The state has controlled the district’s schools for almost 20 years. The state appellate court ruled in July that the district isn’t yet ready for autonomy, based on its test scores and graduation rates. "Whatever role he has, it’s a secondary, indirect role," Tractenberg said. "My impression is Cory Booker has backed off a lot from his early more direct engagements in education reform." The mayor does sit on the foundation’s board of directors, his most direct involvement with the Zuckerberg funds. The mayor’s primary role has been helping find funders to match Zuckerberg’s donation. Because Booker legally must let the state make education decisions in his city, it’s not as if any successes or failures the district has can be traced back to him or his staff. Just because Booker is on the board doesn’t mean he has full authority in spending the funds. Making the grade Aside from the question of Booker’s control over the district, the other key part of the ad is whether or not "less than two-thirds of students" graduate. The graduation rate for 2012 graduates was 68.72 percent, which is just a tad over two-thirds of students. The video, posted earlier this month, references 2011 numbers, according to an email source list sent by Stephen Manfredi, spokesman for American Commitment. In 2011 the graduation rate was 61.26 percent, which is under two-thirds. So the video features a graduation rate that does, by experts’ standards, indeed leave lots of room for improvement. We won’t go back further than 2011 to check the change in graduation rate over time, because that’s when the methodology used to calculate those numbers, was last changed. What the video doesn’t mention is that the graduation rate has recently improved. Between 2011 and 2012, the graduation rate increased nearly 7 percentage points. That represents the largest growth out of all of New Jersey’s urban districts, Booker for Senate spokeswoman Silvia Alvarez wrote in an email. That’s not for nothing. Still, placing too much importance on good or bad graduation numbers isn’t a holistic way of evaluating schools’ performances, said Eden Kyse, director of the Center for Research and Evaluation on Education and Human Services at Montclair State University. "It doesn’t tell the whole story," Kyse said. "It’s an indicator." As the Foundation for Newark’s Future spends Zuckerberg’s money, they know improving education isn’t something that’s solved with a few years’ worth of graduation statistics, McLain said. "Newark public schools need to be improved and provide for better educational outcomes for kids," McLain said. "We believe our work and our effort will assist that. It’s not going to happen overnight." Our ruling A super PAC’s ad criticized Mayor Booker for Newark’s low graduation rate three years after Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improving the city’s education. Newark does have a graduation rate right around two-thirds -- it's actually a touch higher than that -- but there’s more to the picture. Despite the ad’s implications, the city’s graduation rate is on the rise. The ad’s phrasing also implies that Booker is the official responsible for schools even though he’s not in charge of them. The money is only a small sliver of the school district's overall budget, and it hasn't all been spent yet, so it's not clear if it's had time to make an impact. Because the ad omits necessary context about the grant money and Newark’s improving graduation rate, in addition to implying that Booker is to blame, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08969	"Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/19/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-playboy-connection/	Rick Scott's ties to a company have become, let's just say, the "centerfold" of a new attack being leveled by Scott's challenger for the Republican nomination for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum. In a new campaign mailer called "The Two Faces of Rick Scott," McCollum's camp attempts to counter suggestions that Scott is a unwavering conservative with impeccable Republican credentials. "What Rick Scott does and what Rick Scott says show the completely different faces of Rick Scott," says the mailer, which follows with examples. "Rick Scott says he is an across-the-board conservative," the mailer says. But, "Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating. "Rick Scott: Nothing new. Something bad." The mailer got us wondering -- Is Scott, a former health care CEO, in bed with Playboy? McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said the company referenced in the mailer is Quepasa, which in Spanish means "what's happening." The corporation (NASDAQ: QPSA) owns Quepasa.com, which claims to be one of the world's largest Latino online communities. The company is headquartered in West Palm Beach with offices in Miami, Los Angeles, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Hermosillo, Mexico. As McCollum suggested, Quepasa and Playboy began partnering in 2009 to find and identify "Cyber Chicas" for the magazine's Mexico edition. Quepasa created an online community that features models wanting to be included in Playboy. Users of the website can go to the Playboy community to vote for and rank the women. Three finalists are forwarded each month to Playboy, which selects a winner. A 24-year-old Brazilian, Fernanda Schonardie, was selected as the first "Cyber Chica" and was featured in a full-page layout in the March 2009 edition of Playboy México. The partnership has continued since (We'll skip the links). "The Playboy México community has been a tremendous success," Quepasa CEO, John C. Abbott, said in a press release. "We've received numerous submissions from all over the globe and have recorded hundreds of thousands of impressions and votes from members. We are delighted with the campaign and anticipate ongoing growth in traffic." Quepasa reported that the Playboy México community became the most popular community on Quepasa in just a matter of weeks and represented 28 percent of all community page views. Quepasa.com is much more than Playboy, however. It's an online network that allows people to join discussion groups about everything -- from romance, to music, to culture and politics, to sports, to religion. The company said that as of July it had nearly 15 million online members. Quepasa is definitely a general interest social network, and in short appears to be trying to reach anyone who would want to talk about anything. It makes sense, then, that some of the website's online communities are geared to gays and lesbians. The company also announced in June 2010 that it was partnering with online dating service Zoosk Inc. Zoosk does offer its dating services to gay people. What is Scott's role in Quepasa? McCollum says it's his company. But really, Scott is an investor. According to required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Scott controls 13.8 percent of all of the stock in Quepasa, which translates to 2 million shares. We should note that Scott himself owns just a fraction of those shares. The rest are split between a family partnership and in a trust in his wife's name. Scott also has a warrant to purchase 1 million shares (A warrant is a way to entice investors into a company, by essentially offering them a good deal to accumulate large amount of shares). Scott's stock in Quepasa is worth about $7.6 million, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Scott began investing in the company in March 2006, according to a Quepasa press release. "Hispanic and Latino families have a growing presence in the U.S.; Quepasa has been developing content relevant to the Hispanic community for over seven years," Scott was quoted as saying in the release. "Quepasa should be well positioned to build a viable company if it continues to innovate and deliver value to the Hispanic and Latino communities." As an investor, Scott would have some say in the company's direction, but he doesn't own enough stock to get what he wants, whenever he wants it. He does not sit on the company's board of directors, which is an important distinction considering McCollum's original statement. In McCollum's campaign mailer, he said, "Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating." The company in question, Quepasa does partner with Playboy in an Internet venture and does have community chat rooms that cater to gays and lesbians. But the company and the website is more than Playboy and gay dating. It's also misleading for McCollum to say Quepasa is Scott's company, as if he were the owner, or the one making decisions. As a fourth-largest individual stockholder, he has clout, no doubt. But he's ultimately not in charge of Quepasa. (For instance the partnership with Playboy came in 2009, three years after Scott had already invested in the company). Because of those failures to be more clear with potential voters, we rate McCollum's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Bill McCollum	None	None	None	2010-07-19T18:40:22	2010-07-15	['None']
pomt-13230	"We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-33000-americans-die-each-year/	Early in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton got into a back and forth over guns. At one point, Clinton said, "We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns." Is she correct? According to data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,599 people who died due to guns in 2014, the most recent year available. And the number has topped 33,000 for three years running. So Clinton has a strong point. That said, it’s important to note that she is bundling together homicides, suicides and other types of gunfire, including accidental discharges and legally permissible killings such as those by law enforcement. As the following chart shows, suicides account for the largest share of gun-related deaths -- about two-thirds in recent years. And while gun-related suicides have risen by 10 percent since 2010, the number of non-suicide gun deaths has remained roughly the same. Year Deaths by guns (including suicides) Suicides alone Deaths by guns excluding suicides 2014 33,599 21,334 12,265 2013 33,636 21,175 12,461 2012 33,563 20,666 12,897 2011 32,351 19,990 12,361 2010 31,672 19,392 12,280 Average per year, 1999-2014 31,102 18,223 12,879 Clinton phrased her statement carefully -- she referred to people who "die from guns" without specifying the circumstances of how they were shot. Still, the fact that suicides represent such a large share of gun deaths is a detail worth noting. Our ruling Clinton said, "We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns." She’s correct that all deaths from guns have exceeded 33,000 during the most recent three years for which we have data. That said, it’s worth noting that roughly two-thirds of these were suicides.

pomt-00646	On whether the Iraq War was a mistake.	half flip	/florida/statements/2015/may/18/marco-rubio/rubios-statements-iraq-have-shifted-not-flipped/	After former Gov. Jeb Bush’s comments about whether he would have invaded Iraq drew attention, other 2016 GOP presidential candidates staked out their positions, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace aggressively questioned Rubio on his positions in an interview May 17, asking him if he’d changed positions on Iraq. After rolling film of previous interviews with Rubio, Wallace asked Rubio, "Senator, isn't that a flip? Six weeks ago, it made sense to invade Iraq in 2003. Now, you say it was a mistake." "No, they're two different questions. It was not a mistake," Rubio answered. The two went back and forth in an animated exchange, with Rubio concluding: "I doubt very seriously that the president would have gotten, for example, congressional approval to move forward with an invasion had they known there were no weapons of mass destruction. That doesn't mean he made the wrong decision, because at the time he was presented with intelligence that said there are weapons of mass destruction." We decided to put Rubio’s statements on our Flip-O-Meter, which tracks whether a politician has shifted his views and to what extent without making a judgment about such changes. We found that Rubio’s positions have shifted over the years, but he hasn’t fully reversed himself, either. Rubio as a Senate candidate in 2010 Rubio was a state representative when Congress voted for the Iraq resolution in 2002 that led to the 2003 invasion. We searched and found no statements about the war by Rubio at the time. In October 2010, Rubio was asked about the Iraq war by Tampa Bay Times’ political editor Adam Smith during a Senate campaign debate on CNN. Smith: "Mr. Rubio, is America safer and better off for having gone to war in Iraq?" Rubio: "I think the answer ultimately is yes. First of all, the world is better off because Saddam Hussein is no longer in charge in Iraq. And I think we have to remind ourselves of that, is that the world is a better and safer place because Saddam Hussein no longer is in charge of that country. …You know, there are a lot of issues that that society and that that nation-state faces. But it is better off today than it was when Saddam Hussein (was there)." Rubio as a presidential candidate As Rubio moved toward his presidential bid in April, he has tried to establish himself as the hawkish foreign policy expert. He has called for increased military funding and building up weapons, and he often talks about threats faced from Iran and from ISIS. In March as a deadline approached on the nuclear deal with Iran, Rubio talked about both Iran and Iraq on Fox News’ The Five when asked, "Was it a mistake to go to war to Iraq?" "No, I don't believe it was. The world is a better place because Saddam Hussein doesn’t run Iraq," he said, arguing that Iraq could have pursued a weapon. "So I think, hindsight is always 20/20, but we don't know what the world would look like if Saddam Hussein was still there." Weeks later, after Rubio’s speech to the Council on Foreign Relations May 13, journalist Charlie Rose asked: "If you look at the Iraq war, after finding out there were no weapons of mass destruction, would you, if you knew that, have been in favor of the Iraqi invasion?" Rubio: "Well, not only would I not have been in favor of it. President Bush would not have been in favor of it. And he's said so." Rose: "But Vice President Cheney and others have said, in the same administration, we'd have wanted to go ahead, notwithstanding." Rubio: "Well, President Bush has said that he regrets that the intelligence was faulty. I don't think the Congress would have voted in favor of authorization if they didn't know that. But let's also be fair about the context. Yes, there was intelligence that was faulty, but there was also a history with Iraq of evasion. It was a country that had had mobile units in the past that it used for both C.W., you know, chemical weapons, and biological capability. It is a country that had actively not so long in the past, at the moment that that decision was made, had invaded a neighboring country in Kuwait." So did Rubio change his tune here? We asked experts if they viewed Rubio’s three key statements on Iraq -- in 2010, March and in May -- as a flip-flop or a change in stance. We did not find agreement. Danielle Pletka, a foreign and defense policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she sees Rubio’s statements as consistent. "Had he known that there were no WMD (in the form described at the time by the intelligence), he would not have ordered the invasion of Iraq. However, having invaded Iraq and deposed Saddam, the world is a better place," she told PolitiFact. "One might add that the world would be a better place without Castro, Kim Jong Un, the Chinese Communist Party, and any number of others without implying any intention of invading those countries or removing those leaders." But some other experts saw either conflicts in Rubio’s statements or said that his answers left holes -- albeit in part because of the question asked. "Clearly at the CFR he was recognizing what the majority of the public realizes: The war in Iraq was a huge mistake. But he is also taking a similar line to Jeb Bush in nonetheless arguing that it is a good thing that Saddam is gone," Michael Desch, co-director of the Notre Dame International Security Program. "While these two things are certainly in tension, they are not outright contradictory, which probably explains why they have become the talking point for a number of Republican nominees on a potentially very dicey issue for them." Rubio’s comments during the 2010 Senate debate that the country is better off without Hussein "leaves to the imagination whether we are enough better off to justify the costs," said Barry Posen, director of the MIT Security Studies Program. But in March on The Five, he was asked whether the war was a "mistake." "This requires a full assessment. Not ‘given that we fought the war, did anything good come of it?’ but in the net, was it a mistake? And he answered no. So I think on that one, you can call it ‘flip flop,’ " Posen said. Our ruling In earlier interviews, Rubio said that the United States is safer having gone to war and that it wasn’t a mistake -- but in those interviews he wasn’t directly asked the question about whether he would have favored the invasion, had we known in 2003 that we had faulty intelligence. Rubio was asked May 13 if he would have been in favor of the Iraq War if it was known at the time that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Rubio said, "Not only would I not have been in favor of it. President Bush would not have been in favor of it." As for what he would have favored if it had been known that there were no weapons, Rubio said on May 17 that it was unlikely that Congress would have given approval for Bush to move forward. All these statements seem a little different, and add up to a partial change of position. We rate Rubio’s statements on Iraq as a Half Flip.

pomt-04111	Says Chuck Hagel "opposed sanctions against Iran."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/11/ileana-ros-lehtinen/ros-lehtinen-said-defense-secretary-nominee-hagel-/	The grilling Chuck Hagel, the nominee for Secretary of Defense, will receive from the U.S. Senate boils down to this : How much does he love Israel and hate Iran? Politicians and foreign policy observers have been poring over Hagel’s votes and statements about the Middle East in reaction to President Barack Obama’s Jan. 7 nomination of Hagel, a Republican and former senator from Nebraska, to replace retiring Leon Panetta. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, a member of the House foreign affairs committee who chairs a subcommittee on the Middle East, issued a statement Jan. 8 in which she said Hagel supported legislation that would have provided a lifeline to Fidel Castro, opposed sanctions on Iran and criticized Israel. We zeroed in on this part of her statement about Iran: "He opposed sanctions against Iran, which has brazenly pursued the development of a nuclear weapon in open defiance of the international community as well as called for the destruction of one of our vital allies, Israel." Hagel’s stance on sanctions against Iran has sparked much discussion in recent weeks so we wanted to check Ros-Lehtinen’s statement that Hagel "opposed sanctions against Iran." A conservative group, the Emergency Committee for Israel, made a similar claim about Hagel in an attack ad in December. (We already fact-checked a different claim in the ad on whether Hagel ruled out military action against Iran. We rated the statement Mostly False.) Hagel voted both for and against sanctions Hagel, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, won his first Senate seat in 1996 and retired in 2008 with an expertise in foreign affairs. For some politicians, sanctioning an unpopular foe such as Iran is a no-brainer. But Hagel had a nuanced view of sanctions that can’t easily be summarized in a soundbite. Spokespersons for Ros-Lehtinen sent us a list of Hagel’s votes and actions that they said showed he opposed sanctions. Hagel’s office at The Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes transatlantic cooperation and international security, distributed a fact-sheet about his foreign policy views which shows the opposite, that he supported sanctions against Iran. We found that both documents -- though they cherry-pick to support their viewpoints -- are partially accurate, because Hagel took votes both for and against sanctions against Iran. Hagel consistently raised concern about Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but expressed doubt that sanctions would halt Iran, repeatedly calling for the United States to hold discussions with Iran. He also sometimes argued that sanctions cost the United States billions in lost revenue. But he also left open the door for multilateral sanctions as a foreign policy tool. To illustrate his views on sanctions, we will look at a few examples: Hagel was one of two "no" votes in the Senate in 2001 to amend and extend for five years the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. In a banking committee, his amendment for a two-year renewal, supported by the White House, was rejected. The bill allowed the president to penalize companies that invested heavily in Iran’s energy sector. Some said the law was toothless since President Bill Clinton had waived it for some foreign firms in the past. Hagel said in a speech that year that "unilateral sanctions hardly ever work" and that sanctions only work in the short term if they are multilateral and administered by the U.N. In 2007, Hagel did not join the 72 Senate co-sponsors on The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act to amend the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, which subjects Iran to economic sanctions unless the country dismantled its nuclear enrichment-related program. That bill never got a vote. That same year, the Senate voted 76-22 for an amendment to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp. a terrorist group, leading to sanctions. Hagel voted no. In an interview with the Lincoln Journal Star, Hagel said he feared the administration could use that vote as cover for an attack. "I voted against that resolution for that very reason," he said. "It's a very dangerous resolution." In 2008, Hagel was one of two "no" votes on a banking committee to oppose the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act. Now, let’s look at examples when Hagel supported sanctions: In 1998, Hagel voted along with the 90-4 majority in favor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act. The New York Times wrote that President Clinton vetoed it because he said it would reduce his flexibility in dealing with foreign policy. In 2000, Hagel was part of the Senate’s unanimous vote in favor of the Iran Nonproliferation Act. The bill directed the president to report to Congress on foreign persons who transferred goods or provided assistance related to Iran’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. In 2006, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Iran Freedom Support Act (sponsored by Ros-Lehtinen) to keep sanctions in effect. Under unanimous consent, all senators get a chance to object; none of the senators objected. When Obama nominated him, Hagel defended his stance on Iran in an interview with a Nebraska newspaper: "I have not supported unilateral sanctions because, when it is us alone, they don't work and they just isolate the United States," he said. "United Nations sanctions are working. When we just decree something, that doesn't work." We asked Duke University political science professor Peter Feaver, who worked for the National Security Council in 1993-94 and 2005-07, if there would be reason to oppose some Iran sanctions and support others. "Critics of unilateral sanctions say they let other countries free-ride on our tough policies -- better to get multilateral sanctions where everyone joins in," he told PolitiFact in an email. "Proponents of unilateral sanctions say that they work to leverage multilateral sanctions, toughening them up beyond the lowest-common-denominator approach that typically characterize multilateral sanctions. "Also, some forms of unilateral sanctions -- particularly the financial levers that were used against Iran -- can overcome the free-rider problem because they forbid access to the U.S. financial system, which most countries desperately want access to. The record shows that the tough imposition of unilateral sanctions did help lead to tougher multilateral sanctions, so while Hagel's concerns were reasonable, the backers had a strong, indeed a stronger, case." A Congressional Research Service paper in December 2012 said that while sanctions on Iran have failed to halt its nuclear weapon program "a broad international coalition has imposed progressively strict sanctions on Iran’s oil export lifeline, adversely affecting Iran’s economy to the point where key Iran leaders are considering the need for a nuclear compromise." Our ruling Ros-Lehtinen said that Hagel "opposed sanctions against Iran, which has brazenly pursued the development of a nuclear weapon in open defiance of the international community as well as called for the destruction of one of our vital allies, Israel." Hagel did vote against a sanction bill in 2001, didn’t join 72 colleagues in co-sponsoring a sanction bill in 2007, voted against an amendment in 2007 that would have labeled an Iranian group terrorists and voted "no" in committee in 2008. But he voted in favor of sanction bills in 1998 and 2000, and another such bill passed by unanimous consent while he was in the Senate in 2006. Hagel often said unilateral sanctions don’t work, but he showed more support for multilateral sanctions. When Ros-Lehtinen said Hagel "opposed sanctions against Iran" she oversimplified his lengthy history of votes and comments. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13528	"It has been 269 days since (Hillary) Clinton has held a press conference."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/31/donald-trump/has-hillary-clinton-not-had-press-conference-269-d/	Donald Trump and his allies have seized upon a statistic that they believe reflects poorly on Hillary Clinton -- and they’re hammering it home on a daily basis. On Aug. 30, 2016, the Trump campaign blasted out an email titled, "HIDING HILLARY: DAY 269," going on to explain that "it has been 269 days since (Hillary) Clinton has held a press conference." Among other things, the email pressed Clinton to take reporters’ questions on aspects of her relationship to the Clinton Foundation. The Trump campaign was joined in this call by the Republican National Committee, which sent its own email headlined, "269 days since Hillary Clinton held a press conference." "Today and every day until Hillary Clinton holds a formal press conference, the Republican National Committee (RNC) will issue a reminder of the number of days since Hillary Clinton has faced members of the media in an environment not carefully controlled by her campaign." Is the Trump campaign correct that, as of Aug. 30, "it has been 269 days since Clinton has held a press conference"? (On our publication day, the number would have risen to 270 — an email from Trump's campaign on publication day declared "HIDING HILLARY: DAY 270.") Much depends on the definition of "press conference," which is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. Many independent media outlets have supported Trump’s point. The Washington Post even created a real-time widget showing how long it has been since Clinton last held a press conference: For context, Post political writer Chris Cillizza has written, "The last time Clinton held a press conference was Dec. 5, 2015. That was before: 1. A single state had cast a vote in either a presidential primary or caucus. 2. Major terrorist attacks in Nice, Brussels and Orlando. 3. FBI Director James Comey issued his scathing report on Clinton's email practices while at the State Department. 4. The Bernie Sanders phenomenon. 5. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was run out of the Democratic National Committee in the wake of a massive email hack/leak. 6. This whole Ryan Lochte international gas station incident." And we should note that the Trump campaign has some bona fides for calling Clinton out in this regard: A tally by NBC News counted 17 Trump press conferences in 2016. The Clinton campaign has argued that Clinton has regularly made herself available to the press in ways that are equivalent to press conferences. But with one debatable exception, Trump can make a strong case that Clinton hasn’t given a press conference. The Fort Dodge press conference Clinton’s Dec. 5, 2015 event -- which is the consensus date of her last press conference among reporters and media outlets covering the Clinton campaign -- was held in Fort Dodge, Iowa. (And yes, we counted to make sure Trump's email blast came 269 days later.) The Clinton campaign provided us with a transcript of the exchange, which we’ve posted in full here. Clinton answered eight questions. They were heavily focused on substantive topics, including gun control, terrorism, mental health policy, visa waiver rules, and civil liberties. Given the serious tone of the exchanges and the mix of unfiltered questions by members of the traveling press corps, we think the Fort Dodge event qualifies as a genuine press conference, albeit a fairly brief one by standards of a sitting president. And at least one reporter, CNN’s Dan Merica, referred to the exchange as a "press conference." While stopping short of labeling them press conferences, the Clinton campaign did offer PolitiFact transcripts of four subsequent events for possible comparison to the Fort Dodge exchange. The Queens press availability On April 4, Clinton visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y. The transcript provided by the Clinton campaign is here. This time, the number of questions Clinton took was slightly smaller -- six -- and several were about substantive topics of local interest, including immigration reform and policy toward Wall Street. Other questions, however, were more about campaign tactics and the horse race between Clinton and Sanders. One was on debate preparations, another on incivility among Sanders supporters, and a third was about whether she thought she and her supporters could eventually unify with Sanders and his backers. Notably, none of the articles about the event that we found referred to this as a "press conference." One dispatch, in amNewYork, wrote that Clinton "stopped to take questions from reporters before heading out" from the restaurant. And the Guardian blogged that Clinton "has just taken questions from reporters." The Compton press availability The next event highlighted by the Clinton campaign took place on June 6 in Compton, Calif., a predominantly African-American jurisdiction near Los Angeles. It came one day before the California presidential primary, the last major contest of the Democratic nominating season. Clinton took eight questions, with very little about policy matters. Rather, the questions revolved around her electoral prospects in the primary, her battle with Sanders and when President Barack Obama would begin campaigning for her. Many dispatches cited a more formal news conference by Sanders on the same day, but most didn’t use the term "press conference" for the media’s exchange with Clinton. The Associated Press and the Orlando Sentinel used the phrase "speaking to reporters," while the Guardian used "told reporters." CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin and Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin referred to it as a "gaggle," a term for an impromptu -- and typically brief -- question-and-answer opportunity, often with the politician finishing one event and moving on to another. Griffin referred to it as taking "a few last-minute questions" in Compton. Indeed, by the time of Clinton’s Compton visit, some journalists had begun to specifically question the campaign why she hadn’t taken questions for so long. As Fox News reported, reporters covering the campaign rejected Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon’s assertion on CNN that she often "comes out after an event has concluded" and "she'll literally stand there for 15, 20 minutes and answer questions from her traveling press corps." Washington Post media reporter Callum Borchers called Fallon’s comments "not true." "Talking to reporters in a scrum isn't particularly conducive to live television -- and the comparison here is to Trump's regularly scheduled news conferences, which cable channels often air live -- but at least Clinton would be submitting herself to a similar level of questioning," Borchers wrote. (A "scrum" is essentially the same thing as a "gaggle.") Borchers cited calculations by Liz Kreutz of ABC News, who counted "only nine" such availabilities, "none lasting as long as Fallon claimed. In fact, the total duration of all nine was less than 50 minutes, a length that Trump has eclipsed at one single news conference." For the Compton event, Kreutz reported that it lasted "about eight minutes -- still well shy of the 15-20 that Fallon said was customary," Borchers reported. The Ashland press availability The Clinton campaign also pointed to a joint exchange between Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and the media on July 31 in Ashland, Ohio. Here’s the transcript. Reporters got to ask a small number of questions of the running mates, mainly focusing on Trump’s controversial comments about the parents of a fallen soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, and whether the four fall debates would go off as planned. The opening segment of the exchange is dominated by discussion of the milkshakes they were ordering. We didn’t find any examples of journalists at the time calling this a "press conference." The NABJ-NAHJ conference Finally, on Aug. 5, Clinton gave a speech to a joint convention of African-American and Hispanic journalists and followed up with a question-and-answer session. Here is the full transcript. The Clinton campaign pointed to a remark by the NABJ's president, Sarah Glover, who called the event the "largest press conference with any presidential candidate before a room filled with journalists of color" when introducing Clinton. NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina also called it a "press event" to the Huffington Post. In addition, this was the longest of these events, at roughly 30 minutes. Kristen Welker of NBC and and Lori Montenegro of Telemundo, the moderators, represented the two journalism organizations; they asked multi-part questions. Three other reporters -- Yamiche Alcindor of the New York Times, Ed O’Keefe of the Washington Post and Kevin Merida of ESPN -- asked a question each. They had been pre-selected by the moderators because they had participated in a preliminary panel. However, the fact that the moderators chose the questioners from a limited pool of convention participants (and were convention participants themselves) cast doubt for many in the press corps on whether this fit the full definition of a press conference. Politico’s Jennifer Epstein, the Associated Press’ Lisa Lerer, CNN’s Merica, and the Post’s Chris Cillizza and Abby Phillip were among those making that argument on Twitter. After months of complaints from the traveling press corps that they were not getting a press conference in which they would all have an equal opportunity to ask a question, many were not satisfied that this setup met their demands. Other arguments from the Clinton camp Beyond pointing to these four examples, Clinton campaign officials have noted that Clinton has made herself available for many interviews. For instance, on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, campaign manager Robby Mook said, "She's done over 300 interviews this year, and she takes questions in a variety of formats." When NPR looked at the campaign’s documentation on Aug. 25, they confirmed that Clinton had indeed done 350 interviews this year. The analysis also counted nine town-hall sessions from Jan. 1 to July 31, though these question-and-answer sessions were geared more towards members of the public than the media. However, the analysis noted that about one-fifth of the "interviews" were conducted by supporters, rather than journalists, or were done in settings not typically considered journalistic. In addition, NPR reported, "a spot-check of interviews found most hovered between about three and eight minutes in duration, enough time to be seen on television screens and heard on the air, but short enough time to limit how deeply an interviewer could drill down." "Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, who provided the database to NPR, did not take issue with the network's conclusions when they were shared with him," NPR reported. Cillizza, writing in the Post, found even a large number of interviews insufficient. "Sitdown, one-on-one interviews aren't the same thing as a free-wheeling press conference," he wrote. "There are lots and lots of ground rules that govern sit-downs — most notably a typically strict time limit that makes pursuing any particular line of questioning in any real depth almost impossible. And then there is the fact that an interview with, say, Jimmy Kimmel, isn't the same thing as a press conference with reporters from the Washington Post, New York Times and the TV networks. Kimmel is a comedian, not a reporter." Our ruling Trump’s email said, "It has been 269 days since Clinton has held a press conference." Only one event in the past 269 days -- Clinton’s appearance before the minority journalists’ convention -- could reasonably be considered a press conference, and there are good arguments for why it isn’t. The questioners were limited to a small pool of convention participants, leaving most of the Clinton campaign press corps -- the dozens of journalists who know the campaign the best and who had complained the most about lack of access -- without an equal shot at asking a question. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b54d70d-9710-4f3e-9eff-02268f8a0dc3	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-31T10:02:18	2016-08-30	['Bill_Clinton', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-09481	"Her opponent: zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/27/jan-patterson/patterson-says-meachum-has-no-experience-judge/	Jan Patterson of Austin, a justice on the state's 3rd Court of Appeals since January 1999, touts her experience as she stumps to become the judge for the state's 201st District Court, which decides civil cases in Travis County. Its judge, Suzanne Covington, is stepping down. Opposing Patterson in the March 2 Democratic primary is Austin lawyer Amy Clark Meachum, a partner in the law firm McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore. Meachum's readiness to be a judge draws fire from Patterson in a TV ad that debuted on Austin News 8 on Jan. 20, whose narrator writes Meachum off, saying: "Zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench — our legal system is no place for on-the-job training." Meachum's campaign drew our attention to the ad when her field director, Katie Naranjo, issued this response: "Yesterday, Amy's opponent, Jan Patterson, launched a personal, negative television ad... if you are as disappointed as I am that Jan Patterson would resort to personal attacks against Amy, click here and make a contribution to our campaign so we can respond." Meachum doesn't deny Patterson's charges, though, writing to us: "I have not hidden from nor run from the fact that I have never been a judge." "In the past decade, I have more experience in the civil district court that I am running for than Justice Patterson does," she said. "She has been an appellate judge — I have been a civil trial attorney." Meachum estimated that she's litigated 50-70 cases in Travis County. Patterson is correct that Meachum has never been a judge. We rate her statement as True.	None	Jan Patterson	None	None	None	2010-02-27T22:14:36	2010-01-20	['None']

pomt-09650	When Obama was interviewed by American reporters in Asia, "Not one of them asked me about Asia. Not one of them asked me about the economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/07/barack-obama/obama-said-reporters-didnt-ask-questions-issues-th/	At a jobs summit at the White House on Dec. 3, President Barack Obama closed his remarks with criticism of the media and the political culture in Washington, D.C. Obama was responding to comments from the chairman and CEO of Ethan Allen, a furniture company, who said that the bad economy has forced companies to reinvent themselves and compete globally. Obama said the United States needs to rediscover "a sense of seriousness of purpose" when it comes to education, to government managing money properly and to executives having an obligation to workers. "It is important to understand what's at stake and that we can't keep on playing games," Obama added. "I mentioned that I was in Asia on this trip, thinking about the economy. When I sat down for a round of interviews, not one of them asked me about Asia. Not one of them asked me about the economy. I was asked several times about, had I read Sarah Palin's book? True. But it's an indication of how -- how, you know, our political debate doesn't match up with what we need to do and where we need to go." Obama's audience laughed when Obama mentioned Palin, the Republican Party's 2008 vice presidential nominee. We decided to check the transcripts to see what Obama was asked on his trip. We wanted to see if it was true that he hadn't been asked any questions about the economy or Asia. Obama gave a round of brief interviews while traveling in Asia, with most of his comments airing on American television Nov. 18. The coverage shows that four reporters got roughly 10 minutes each with the president. We reviewed the transcripts and found several examples to contradict Obama's statement. On Asia, Chuck Todd of NBC News asked Obama about human rights in China, and Major Garrett of Fox News asked Obama about trade agreements with South Korea. Both Todd and Garrett asked about the administration's efforts to create jobs. Todd asked how the announced jobs summit would actually create jobs, and Garrett asked if job creation efforts would add to the deficit. Todd did not ask about Palin, though Garrett did. The other interviews we found were with Ed Henry of CNN and Chip Reid of CBS News. Both of them also asked about Palin. Henry also asked a viewer question about what Obama was doing to hold banks accountable for lending to startups and refinancing mortgages. Every interviewer spoke with Obama about making a decision about troop levels in Afghanistan, and most of them also asked about health reform. (ABC News did not join the round of interviews.) Yes, three of four reporters asked Obama about Sarah Palin. A recent Washington Post poll showed Palin to be the top choice of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Palin garnered 17 percent, followed by Mike Huckabee with 10 percent and Mitt Romney with 9 percent. Her memoir was released the day before the interviews aired. Obama said at the Dec. 3 jobs forum that when he was in Asia and granted interviews to reporters, "not one of them asked me about Asia. Not one of them asked me about the economy." That is clearly an exaggeration. We found that two reporters asked him about Asia, two reporters asked him about job creation, and another reporter asked him about mortgages and lending. He said "not one" did, implying that the interviews lacked substance. We rate his statement False.

pomt-02011	"The average student loan debt in Texas is over $22,000...the cost of an average size pickup truck." But unlike car owners, "students are not allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/09/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-equates-average-student-loan-debt-pri/	U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego invoked pickup trucks to frame his case for making it easier for college students and young graduates to refinance student loans. "The average student loan debt in Texas is over $22,000," the Texas Democrat wrote in a May 14, 2014, email blast. "That also happens to be the cost of an average size pickup truck!" "But here’s what’s truly alarming: students are NOT allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates -- the same way car owners can," Gallego wrote. Democratic-sponsored legislation would provide federal aid so students and graduates stuck with high interest rates could repay the loans at the lower rates Congress approved for new student loans in 2013, though a May 16, 2014 National Journal news story called the proposal a long shot in the Senate, where Republicans were described as likely to resist higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for the refinancing wrinkle. Gallegos revved our curiosity thrice over. Average student loan debt By email, Gallego’s campaign manager, Anthony Gutierrez told us the congressman’s average student-loan debt figure came from a news story posted online May 8, 2014, on the GovBeat blog of The Washington Post. That story said more than a million Americans would graduate this year with substantial student loan debt, a conclusion it attributed to the National Conference of State Legislatures. "The graduates will have an average of $26,500 in student loans," the Post story said, "joining the tens of millions of other adults who collectively hold more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. That burden is largest, on average, in many Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, a few Southeastern states and California." An accompanying U.S. map shows more than 20 states including Texas where the average student loan debt is $22,000 to $25,000" The Post credited these conclusions to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, using data from the third quarter of 2012. We ventured to a web page for the reserve bank where its entry on student loan debt led us to a research paper, published in 2012 and revised in April 2013, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. According to the revised paper, student loan debt increased dramatically over the last several years, from about $346 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $996 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, a surge of nearly 14 percent a year. By comparison, the report said, total credit card debt was $679 billion and auto debt was $783 billion. Then again, the report states, increasing levels of debt were driven largely by growth in the number of borrowers, rather than growth in average debt levels of borrowers. The report said that in the fourth quarter of 2012--a few months after the period analyzed in the Post’s chart--the "median borrower holding student loan debt owed $13,924 in student loan debt. The average amount of student loan debt across all consumers with student loan debt was $24,699." That’s the latest available calculation, Bill Medley, spokesman for the Kansas City Fed, told us by email. Pricing average pickup trucks Next, did Gallego capture the price of an average-size pickup? Gutierrez told us the campaign researched average used truck prices on the Cars Direct website. He pointed us to an April 5, 2012, article on the site showing suggested retail prices for five 2010 and 2007 models. "These prices are for a base model pickup truck with standard options and no additional accessories," the article said. According to the story, the average manufacturer’s suggested retail price for a 2010 two-door Ford F-150 was $22,355 and the average for a 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 was $21,510--prices close to the $22,000-plus cited by Gallego. Then again, the Cars Direct article listed estimated prices for two 2010 models at less than $22,000. It also listed the price for another 2010 truck as nearly $6,000 higher. But Gallego priced used pickups; we looked on Edmunds.com, which compiles car and truck prices, for manufacturer’s suggested retail prices for model-year 2013 and 2014 pickups. According to the site, the price for a basic Ford F-150 "regular cab" starts at $24,070 (2013 model) and $24,735 (2014). A Toyota Tacoma "regular cab" starts at $17,625 (2013) and $18,125 (2014), the site says. Limits on refinancing student loans? Finally, are students really not allowed to refinance college loans? Gutierrez pointed out news articles including a Feb. 20, 2013, Time magazine piece stating that unlike other consumers who have taken advantage of reduced interest rates to refinance purchases, student borrowers have been restricted because Congress—not the free market—"sets the interest rate on the vast majority of student debt, and because these loans are not secured by collateral private lenders are loath to undercut the federal government’s terms." The Time story noted that student loan debt was at $1 trillion—and of that, the federal government backed $864 billion. Also, most of the debt was being carried at an interest rate higher than 6 percent, a figure Time attributed to a Feb. 13, 2013, report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. "That’s almost twice the rate of an average 30-year mortgage," Time said. By telephone, Heather Jarvis, a North Carolina attorney specializing in student loan law, said that some graduates may be able to refinance student loans at lower rates through private lenders, though she said this would only happen in cases of substantial income. (Car owners, in contrast, have four-wheeled collateral.) By email, Jarvis said "refinancing federal loans with a private loan is risky. The borrower gives up important protections that accompany federal loans (like flexible repayment and discharge provisions)." Students repaying federally backed loans, Jarvis said, are effectively barred from refinancing opportunities because federal law makes no provision for the government to make such offers. Also by phone, Brian Stewart of the Center for American Progress -- which has urged the Democratic-backed action -- said it’s possible but difficult to refinance student loans with private lenders while there's no way for students to get the federal government to refinance a government-backed loan. Stewart, a spokesman for Generation Progress, a center project focused on young adults, said the center has been researching student-loan issues for about two years. Our ruling Gallego said the "average student loan debt in Texas is over $22,000...the cost of an average size pickup truck." But unlike car owners, he said, "students are not allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates." This claim reflects the latest estimate of average student-loan debt and a findable price for an average-size pickup. It’s also so that most college loans are federally backed and Uncle Sam doesn’t offer a way for students and graduates to refinance. On the other hand, students taking loans from banks or other private lenders aren’t prevented from refinancing; this claim lacks that clarification. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

pomt-06990	Slim Jims "just recently" cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/11/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-price-slim-jims-has-risen-169-per/	In an interview with Newsweek, former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin pointed to Slim Jims -- the iconic beef jerky snack sold in convenience stores everywhere -- as an example of how inflation poses a problem for the American economy. The article explained that Palin has "become conversant on the subject of quantitative easing" -- a Federal Reserve bond-buying plan. The effort was designed to bolster a weak economy, but critics say it risks encouraging inflation. (We rated her on a related statement last November.) In the July 10, 2011 Newsweek interview, Palin illustrated the issue with an anecdote about her husband: "I was ticked off at Todd yesterday," she said. "He walks into a gas station as we’re driving over from Minnesota. He buys a Slim Jim—we’re always eating that jerky stuff—for $2.69. I said, 'Todd, those used to be 99 cents, just recently!' And he says, 'Man, the dollar’s worth nothing anymore.' A jug of milk and a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs—every time I walk into that grocery store, a couple of pennies more." A reader asked us to look into whether Slim Jims have, in fact, been swept up in a huge inflationary spiral recently. We’ll start by noting that Palin used an anecdote to draw broader conclusions. That’s not necessarily a no-no, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. (Or, perhaps, 430 mg of salt, the amount of sodium in a 0.97-ounce original Slim Jim.) Even if Palin’s anecdote is true, it may not support her larger points about food inflation and the dangers thereof. So, let’s look at some of the broader trends in food inflation. The term Palin used -- "just recently" -- is vague, but we thought the past year would be a reasonable yardstick. So we looked at federal inflation data for the period May 2010 to May 2011. For these figures, we turned to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers, or CPI-U-- the most commonly used measurement for inflation. At the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website, you can dig out inflation figures for a wide range of consumer products. There’s no category for Slim Jims, of course, but we did find at least two relevant categories. Beef prices have risen 10.2 percent during the past year, and snack prices have risen 2.8 percent over the same period. (Okay, wise guys: Slim Jims also include other ingredients -- here’s an independent assessment -- but we won’t go there.) For comparison’s sake, the inflation rate for all consumer products studied was 3.5 percent over the same period, and slightly less -- 3.4 percent -- for food products alone. So beef prices have indeed risen quite a bit faster than inflation generally, while snack prices have risen more slowly than overall inflation. Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that inflation has been increasing somewhat in the food sector (as well as in the energy sector), but he added that those increases came after sharp declines during the last recession and that a broad range of consumer products have not increased at similar rates. "Basic commodity prices have risen sharply," Burtless said, "in no small part because (a) they are determined in a world market, not solely by what is going on in the USA; (b) the world market for basic commodities dramatically improved after early 2009, when it became clear that government actions to combat the recession and fix the financial meltdown were going to be successful and all of Asia except Japan enjoyed a big economic rebound; and (c) because those basic commodity prices were rebounding from sharp declines that occurred because of the steep world recession in 2008-2009." But even a 10.2 percent increase in beef prices -- a major ingredient of Slim Jims, even if not the only one -- does not explain a price rise of 169 percent, which is what Palin’s comparison would suggest. Still, national statistics alone can’t settle this question. So we went directly to ConAgra, the food giant that makes Slim Jims. Teresa Paulsen, a ConAgra spokeswoman, said that "we admire Mr. Palin’s taste and appreciate his support," but added that "we haven’t raised the price significantly on any Slim Jim products." She also offered a possible explanation for the confusion. "Our iconic Slim Jim Giant Sticks are priced around $1.30," Paulsen said. "Mr. Palin might have been reaching for one of our Slim Jim Monster Sticks, which offers double the meat for $2.30, or our Slim Jim Kippered Beef Steak, which typically sells for around $2.65." Finally, Paulsen said, "If the Palins want to try something that brings a little extra heat, we’d invite them to try our new Slim Jim Dare sticks. We’d love to know what a seasoned Slim Jim connoisseur thinks." We’ll note that it’s also possible that Todd Palin happened to buy his jerky fix at a store that disregarded ConAgra’s suggested retail price. Paulsen said that the company’s suggested price is just that -- a suggestion -- and that retailers ultimately determine how much they charge. So where does this leave us? Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the Palins are correct and they recently paid two and a half times more for a Slim Jim than they used to. If that’s the case, it wasn’t because ConAgra raised the suggested price. It could have been because they bought from a particularly expensive retailer, or they could have been choosing a different and more expensive flavor of Slim Jim without realizing it. Still, even if Todd Palin paid more for his snack food fix, it doesn’t support Sarah Palin’s argument that food prices are skyrocketing. Food prices -- an always-volatile sector -- are indeed going up, and that may or may not be a worry for the longer term. However, food prices are not rising by anything approaching 169 percent. Her anecdote offers spice, but not a lot of meat. We rate it False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2011-07-11T17:37:27	2011-07-10	['None']

pomt-07852	"Overall we currently have $981 million, almost a billion dollars in active development projects right here in the City of Richmond."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/11/dwight-jones/richmond-mayor-dwight-jones-says-city-has-981-mill/	It was highly symbolic that Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones chose the newly renovated Hippodrome Theater as the site of his State of the City Address on Feb. 3. The city’s economic development successes were a key part of his speech. The theater is emblematic of the triumphs. It opened in 1914 and hosted legendary acts such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald and Richmond native Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. After years of decay, developers are turning the theater into a music hall. The project also includes apartments, retail space and restaurants, one of which is already open. Jones said it was "fitting" he was speaking in a "venue which has sat empty for most of the last 40 years." The mayor then boasted that there are "$981 million, almost a billion dollars, in active development projects right here in the City of Richmond." Our daily commutes take us past many of the works and we wanted to find out if all those cranes really comprise $981 million in "active" projects. Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s press secretary, sent us a project list that added up to $981.7 million in public and private investments. But she added some fine print. While Jones said the ventures were "active," Hawley said the figure is actually based on projects "we know about that are either recently completed, under construction or in the pipeline." The 28 listed projects range in value from $3 million to $158 million. Many of the largest public investments are improvements at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus and at the Medical College of Virginia, its hospital campus. The biggest project is a new school of medicine at VCU. The city’s development office says that project will cost $158 million. The next-largest project, by dollar value, is the building of a new wing at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which the city says cost $150 million. Residents of the city’s Museum District, where the VMFA is located, are hardly troubled by construction noise and dust, however. That’s because the new wing opened on May 1, 2010. The list of projects includes the $64.8 million Williams Mullen building on 10th Street in downtown. But the law firm opened for business at its new location on June 14, 2010, nearly nine months before the mayor’s speech. Also listed are a $10 million expansion of the Virginia War Memorial and the $10.1 million refurbishment of the city’s Manchester Courthouse. Both projects are completed. And the city identifies two Jackson Ward apartment complexes--one targeted at VCU students and the other at the over-55 crowd. Both are completed and open to tenants. We counted $249.4 million in completed ventures that are on the city’s list of "active development projects." Cross them out and the value of active projects is actually $732.3 million. That’s a 25.4 percent difference from the mayor’s figure. Then there’s the case of Crosland LLC’s proposed "Manchester on the James" project for 200 apartments and parking at the southern end of the Lee Bridge. The city says it will cost $26.6 million. The City Council approved the project in June 2008, stipulating the company must get a building permit within two years and begin construction no more than six months after that. The General Assembly has passed a law allowing a grace period for projects delayed because of the recent recession, so the project will not need further approvals before construction begins. No building permit has been issued for that site since 2008, when a demolition permit was issued. The demolition permit expired in October 2009. Let’s review our findings. Jones said in his speech that Richmond has "$981 million in active development projects." His spokeswoman, when contacted a few days later, clarified that the number includes recently completed projects, sites where work is currently ongoing, and planned projects. When completed works are excluded, the number of current or planned development deals falls to $732.3 million, 25.4 percent less than what the mayor cited. And another project, the $26.6 million Manchester on the James, is dormant. No doubt, Richmond has been developing in recent years and several major projects were successfully completed in 2010. But the mayor’s number is not right; it paints a better picture than what exists. Therefore we rate the Jones’ claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04317	Sherrod Brown "voted six times to raise his own pay."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/29/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-ad-claims-sherrod-brown-voted-six-time/	As he campaigns to unseat Sen. Sherrod Brown, Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer, has worked to paint the Democratic incumbent as a free-spending Washington insider. A recent TV ad for Mandel follows that line by saying that Brown "voted six times to raise his own pay." PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out that claim, expecting it would be a straightforward, but instead found it illustrates the daunting complexity of the legislative process. First, some background. Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution requires Congress to determine its own pay. It can use specific legislation to raise the pay. But there is a limitation on that created by the 27th Amendment of the Constitution, which was ratified in 1992. It says: "No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened." In other words, members of Congress can change the pay of the next Congress, but not their own. Seems simple enough. But, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reports -- the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 created an automatic annual cost of living adjustment. The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills, with raises for other federal employees. So the law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system in which pay for members of Congress can increase without members having to cast a straight up or down vote on the raise. Because the pay raises are essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is vote to stop them. There are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases. And it is those procedural votes that the Mandel ad relies on for support. Now, some specifics. The first of the votes cited by the Mandel campaign in support of its claim was one Brown cast July 17, 1996 -- when he was a member of the House of Representatives -- on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal 1997. Brown voted "no" on the $23.1 billion bill, which included a pay-freeze provision to deny the automatic pay increase. "Therefore," Mandel's campaign told us, "he voted in favor of a pay increase." But wait. Brown's campaign, responding to the Mandel ad, said that Brown "has voted against pay increases at least seven times." The first instance it cited was Brown's vote in favor of the provision denying the pay increase on July 16, 1996 -- the day before the vote on the appropriations bill. Did Brown's "no" vote on the appropriations bill the next day cancel that out? Not exactly. According to the Congressional Research Service, the House-passed version of the appropriations bill (H.R. 3756) was sent to conference with the Senate and was incorporated into H.R. 3610, the Omnibus Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal 1997. The omnibus spending act included the provision denying the automatic pay raise -- and Brown voted in favor of the act when it was passed in final action by the House on Sept. 28, 1996. So using the reasoning applied in the TV ad, Brown actually voted against giving Congress a pay increase. Here’s the other examples the Mandel camp cited in support of the ad claim: 1997: On Sept. 24, 1997, Brown joined the majority as the House voted to "order the previous question" on a motion to instruct conferees (participants in the budget conference committee with the Senate) on an issue unrelated to a pay freeze. Because the House permits only one motion to instruct conferees, the Congressional Research Service said, "this vote in effect foreclosed the possibility of instructing conferees to omit the pay adjustment from the conference report." As a result, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill did not include a pay freeze. 1998: On Oct. 7, 1998, Brown voted in the minority against the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal 1999, which included a provision blocking the pay raise. On Oct. 20, however, he voted with the majority in favor of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which had the provision stopping the pay raise. 2000: On July 20, 2000, Brown voted with the House majority on "ordering the previous question" on a rule to consider the fiscal 2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The vote had the effect of not allowing a pay-freeze amendment, and "was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment," the Congressional Research Service said. 2002: On July 18, 2002, Brown voted with the House majority to order the previous question on House Resolution 488, which prevented consideration of an amendment to stop the cost-of-living raise, and allowed consideration of H.R. 5120, the fiscal 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill. The vote "was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment," the CRS said. 2012: The final example cited by the Mandel campaign was Brown's vote in the Senate last March against one of the many amendments proposed to the Senate highway transportation bill. The amendment would have extended the current 2-year pay freeze on the federal workforce of about 2 million, including members of Congress, to help pay for a wide range of tax deductions and credits. But the amendment also included more-controversial items. It would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, approved construction of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and mandated a huge expansion of offshore oil-and-gas leasing. What's the take-home on the ad's claim? The Constitution doesn't permit members of Congress to raise their own pay. The raises cannot take effect until after an election selects a new Congress. Congress, though, essentially built a system, before Brown arrived, that allows for pay raises without direct votes by members. That can make it difficult to say who voted for or against raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills. Mandel's ad exaggerates when it cites six votes to say that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. The votes cited by the Mandel camp were procedural in nature that didn’t raise the pay on their own. In two of the six cases cited, later votes on those same spending bills could be seen as Brown votes against pay raises. And in the most recent case cited, it is misleading to characterize Brown's no vote as a vote to raise the pay for Congress given the other issues that were involved. The vote came on an amendment that contained wide-ranging and unrelated provisions that had been hot points for debate. As PolitiFact Ohio has noted previously, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against something they might normally support because it is included in wide-ranging legislation that also has other provisions they cannot support. In the case of these cited procedural votes, all involved broad pieces of legislation. None were focused purely on the pay raise issue. The Mandel ad claimed that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rates False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-10-29T06:00:00	2012-10-02	['None']
pomt-11339	"All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/09/blog-posting/no-evidence-websites-claim-about-microchipping-rec/	A website claiming to be "exposing one truth at a time" deceptively says citizens will soon need to be microchipped in order to receive government benefits. "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future," said a Jan. 12 story on unseen-pedia.com, operating under the banner Anti News Network. But Anti News Network’s headline is not supported by its story and we found no indication of this being in the works. The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a program formerly known as food stamps that helps low-income individuals. USDA told PolitiFact it has no plans to require microchipping to receive program benefits. Facebook users flagged Anti News Network’s post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. Anti News Network’s story includes accurate information about a software and breakroom kiosks company in Wisconsin, Three Square Market, which offered its employees the ability to get a microchip under their skin. By waving their microchipped hand on sensors, employees can get access into the company’s building, sign on to their computers and pay for snacks. Anti News Network also includes a legitimate quote from a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who said the concept of microchips will likely become more common in the future. The post also said that "the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland." (The Independent reported about that in 2015.) But there’s no mention in the story about this being a settled matter of policy across the United States. Instead, the story raises concerns about microchipping and calls on Americans to be vigilant. "But regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips. … If Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made," the post said. It’s not the first time we’ve fact-checked claims about governments microchipping their citizenry. We’ve rated as Pants on Fire another claim giving the false impression that the Australian government is implanting microchips in its citizens. Anti News Network published a headline that’s inconsistent with its own story and not supported by facts. We rate Anti News Network’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10327	In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, offshore drilling "did not cause any real difficulties."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/25/john-mccain/disaster-no-difficulties-yes-/	At a town hall meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., John McCain promoted the idea of expanding offshore drilling, and downplayed the potential for environmental problems. "Sen. Obama opposes offshore drilling," McCain said on July 15, 2008. "I think if the states want to drill off their coasts, we should do it and do it immediately. And by the way, the governor of Florida has said he thinks it's a good idea. In California, Gov. Schwarzenegger thinks it's not a good idea. I would remind you that off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, they both had hurricanes that did not cause any real difficulties. So the environmental side of it I think is pretty well okay. But we need to do that. " McCain is referring here to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the coasts of Louisiana and Texas within weeks of each other in 2005. Consider the worst-case scenario of years ago: a drilling rig becomes unplugged and spews an unending supply of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Back in June 1979, the Mexican drilling rig IXTOC I malfunctioned off the coast of Mexico and spilled about 140-million gallons into the Gulf before technicians were able to cap it 10 months later. To prevent that sort of disaster, rigs now have safety valves under the ocean floor that prevent spills even if the rig is damaged. Those valves worked as they were supposed to during Katrina and Rita. But it's a stretch to say the storms caused "no real difficulties." Without question, oil spills did occur offshore in the wake of Katrina and Rita. Studies commissioned by the Minerals Management Service, a division of the U.S. Interior Department, concluded that a total of just over 741,000 gallons of oil spilled due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the outercontinental shelf, the technical term for the area offshore. "We have not said that there were no spills," said David Smith, deputy chief of public affairs for MMS. "We've said that there are no reports of oil from federal waters reaching shore or causing environmental damage." Another MMS study looked at offshore oil platforms. It noted that the hurricanes crossed the path of about 3,000 offshore platforms, destroying 117 platforms that either became unmoored or fell into the sea. "They were either completely toppled to the seafloor with no structure visible above the waterline, or were so severely damaged that it was obvious the structure was destroyed by the hurricanes and could no longer carry out its purpose and had to be removed," according to an MMS report. (You can view prestorm photos of the destroyed platforms via this report .) Nevertheless, according to the MMS report authored by Energo Engineering of Houston, "There was no life loss and no significant pollution, which is a tribute to the Minerals Management Service oversight of offshore operations and American Petroleum Institute design codes … for the structural design of fixed offshore platforms." Some of the oil spilled likely came from the pipelines that bring oil from the platforms to shore. When rigs are blown over in the storms, the collapse can damage the pipes, and that's likely what caused most of the offshore spills. A McCain spokesman said McCain was referring to problems associated with offshore platforms, and that the amount of oil spilled from them was minimal. "Senator McCain is exactly right, offshore oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico stood up astoundingly well to the hurricanes," said spokesman Taylor Griffin. Keep in mind, however, that Louisiana's oil business isn't strictly offshore. Oil is piped from rigs in the Gulf to the mainland of Louisiana, where it is stored and processed throughout the area. "Offshore, there were relatively few spills," said Roland Guidry, head of the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office. "Inland, we have a lot of exposed pipelines and tank batteries along the shore. Those are the things that gave us trouble." Mostly onshore sources created oil spills that came to 8.2-million gallons, and possibly reached as high as 9- to 10-million gallons, Guidry said. That includes spills from platforms, pipelines, tankers, oil refineries and storage facilities. The upper end of that estimate would place the gallons spilled near the same scale as the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. The important difference here is that the Valdez spill — at close to 11-million gallons — was highly concentrated, while the Katrina and Rita spills were from numerous sources and spread widely. One of worst spills occurred at a refinery in Meraux, La., operated by Murphy Oil USA Inc., which before the storm handled about 630,000 gallons of oil a day. As Hurricane Katrina roared ashore, it breached an above-ground oil storage tank that disgorged more than a million gallons of oil into a residential area, tainting about 3,500 homes and businesses. As the result of a federal lawsuit, Murphy Oil agreed to a settlement that totaled $330-million. A 2006 report from the U.S. Coast Guard detailed six major oil spills, including the Murphy Oil spill, five medium spills, and approximately 5,000 minor spills that occurred in the wake of the storms. Environmental groups agree that the worst damage occurred away from the offshore drilling platforms, but say it's silly to think that the two things are unrelated. "You can't have offshore development without the onshore facilities to support it," said Athan Manuel, a spokesman with the Sierra Club. McCain's statement about drilling not "causing any real difficulties" is cautiously phrased in comparison to remarks from some other political figures. Trent Lott, the former senator from Mississippi and a McCain supporter, said on MSNBC on July 15, 2008: "We didn't have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in recent history, Hurricane Katrina." That statement is demonstrably false. "The government data itself shows that there were spills," said Manuel. "We're disappointed that that argument has taken root." The divide here seems stark: Oil drilling proponents view the damage as minimal, an acceptable part of doing business. They say safety precautions the oil industry put in place worked. Opponents of drilling, on the other hand, see the amount of oil spilled onshore and near shore as cause for concern, and are angered by attempts to minimize the real damage that did happen. If McCain's point is that no individual well spewed large amounts of oil into the Gulf as a result of Katrina and Rita, he's correct. But his comments at the town hall meeting were more vague. Talking about oil drilling and saying the storms "did not cause any real difficulties" seems like putting a happy face on a situation where damage did occur as a result of the oil and gas industry that permeates south Louisiana. If McCain had been more specific about rigs versus oil development as a whole, we might be inclined to give him a better rating. But in this case, we give his statement Half True.

pomt-02899	Says "new mandates are already reducing full-time employment."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/americans-prosperity/conservative-group-says-mary-landrieu-backs-obamac/	Heading into the 2014 elections, Republicans have targeted several U.S. Senate seats in their bid to flip partisan control of the chamber. One of these targeted incumbents is three-term Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. A full year before the election, one conservative group -- Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire libertarian brothers David and Charles Koch -- has already begun to air a 30-second spot critical of Landrieu. The ad ties Landrieu to President Barack Obama’s health care law. As ominous music plays in the background, a narrator highlights Landrieu’s past support of the law and an on-screen headline flashes on the screen: "New mandates are already reducing full-time employment." "Louisianans told Mary Landrieu to vote ‘no’ on Obamacare. Instead she sided with Barack Obama," the narrator says. "Now we’re paying the price." The mandate in question is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires companies that employ 50 or more full-time workers -- those that work 30 hours a week -- to provide health insurance or else face a penalty. This provision of the law has led some to speculate that large companies will cut back on hours, or on employees, to avoid incurring the added costs. But is there evidence that "new mandates are already reducing full-time employment," as the ad says? We took a look. Economy looms large The headline used in the ad came from an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, which has been critical of Obama’s health care law. The unsigned editorial, published in February, is largely based on anecdotal evidence from companies, mostly in the fast food sector, that have said they plan to reduce employee hours in the wake of the mandates. However, independent analysis suggests that the recession and the slow recovery are a bigger culprit than Obamacare, at least so far. As we noted when we checked a recent claim by CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then. As of the latest data, it stands at 19 percent. The study’s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That’s significantly higher than the peak for the most recent recession. What’s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy. "The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers," they said. "General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high." The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers' hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change. "Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs." Indeed, a Wall Street Journal article published by the paper’s news side, titled "Don’t Blame Health Law for High Part-Time Unemployment," concurs with this analysis. When we contacted Americans For Prosperity, the group pointed us to an article in Investor’s Business Daily that catalogs all the companies that are curbing hours to less than 30 a week as a result of Obamacare. But the data is less convincing than it appears. Most of those employers, many of them in the public sector, are cutting back the hours of workers who already aren’t considered full-time -- a development that wouldn’t provide full support for the contention that "new mandates are already reducing full-time employment." Of the 350 employers listed, about 200 said they will be limiting the hours of their part-time work force, and dozens others were cutting hourly workers or positions for student teachers, adjunct professors, or similar jobs that would not have been counted as full-time workers anyway. Our ruling In its ad, Americans for Prosperity said that new mandates from Obamacare "are already reducing full-time employment." It’s a plausible scenario, but as of now, it’s largely speculative, with the evidence anecdotal rather than statistical. Across the economy as a whole, part-time employment is high, but independent observers say that has to do with the recession and the weak recovery rather than Obama’s health care law.

pomt-08464	Says Lincoln Chafee "settled a union strike by giving the teachers a 19-percent-raise."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/14/frank-caprio/caprio-says-chafee-gave-warwick-teachers-19-percen/	During the Oct. 6 WPRI/Providence Journal gubernatorial debate, candidates were asked for assurances that they would stand up to public employee unions. Independent Lincoln Chafee, whose list of union endorsements includes the state's major teacher unions, urged voters to look at his record as a U.S. senator and as a mayor and councilman in Warwick. He specifically mentioned helping, as mayor, to resolve the city's bitter teachers dispute in the 1990s. When his Democratic opponent, Frank Caprio, was asked the same question, his first reaction was to attack Chafee. "When Linc Chafee says look at his record, you talk about opening up the checkbook and giving the unions a blank check. He settled a union strike by giving the teachers a 19-percent raise. So I don't think looking at the record makes anybody feel too comfortable tonight," he said. Nineteen percent sounds like a big increase, especially in an era when many workers are taking pay cuts, so we decided to look back at what actually happened. In September 1991, before Chafee was elected mayor, Warwick teachers went on strike when their contract expired. The action delayed school for a week. Teachers returned to the classroom after union leaders said they had reached a tentative agreement with the School Committee, but the deal fell through in a dispute over what each side had actually agreed to. The case went to the State Labor Relations Board and was still simmering the following September, when the teachers went on strike again. Eighteen teachers were briefly sent to the ACI for refusing to obey a judge's back-to-work order. Teachers continued to work without a contract and without a pay increase, but they refused to perform extra duties, such as advising student groups, taking students on field trips or meeting with parents outside school hours. The dispute became so disruptive, some parents were putting houses up for sale to get out of the school system, according to Providence Journal accounts at the time. Chafee inherited the dispute in its third year when he became mayor in 1993. At one point, he threatened to take the money set aside for teacher pay increases and use it to cut property taxes unless the union and the School Committee resolved the dispute. "I'm sure a tax decrease will spur some economic development here," he said. In spring 1994, after talks broke down and the state mediator resigned in frustration, Chafee stepped in and cut a deal with the teachers, essentially bypassing the School Committee. Under the agreement, backed by eight of the nine members of the Democrat-controlled City Council, base pay for a top-step teacher went from $39,762 during the 1990-1991 school year to $49,371 for 1996-'97, the final year of the pact. That's a 24.2-percent hike. The deal also included an extra 2.5 percent that teachers who were working during the 1992-'93 school year are entitled to receive when they retire or resign, a bonus that continues to be paid as teachers leave. So Caprio's 19-percent claim actually understates the total pay increase the teachers received. (The Chafee campaign has asserted the overall increase was 19.4 percent, the figure that had been reported at the time of the settlement.) But Caprio leaves out an important bit of information: the agreement covered six years, running through August 1997. We asked the Caprio campaign if the candidate thought the six-year time span was relevant. "I think what's relevant is that the raise was given," said spokesman Nick Hemond. But we think it's crucial. After all, we would hope that if Caprio, as Rhode Island's state treasurer, was promised a rate of return of 20 percent, he would want to know if the 20 percent was over one year, or 20. In the Warwick case, the compounded cost of the salary increases was the same as if the School Committee had awarded 3.67 percent raises during each of the six years of the settlement. And there's another question of context. Annual raises such as those may seem high in this economic climate, but the 1990s was a different era. At the time Chafee reached the deal, the cost of living as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index had increased by 23.6 percent during the previous six years. And according to data from the Rhode Island affiliates of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, the average teacher salary in the state increased by 3.7 percent for the 1993-'94 school year, with 14 school systems giving out raises of 5 percent or higher. To reach a ruling, we focused on three key points: Caprio understated the teachers' overall pay increase and incorrectly said the settlement came during a strike. But his intended message -- that Chafee was overly generous to the teachers -- was clear. He ignored the economic context of the era -- and the turmoil in the city's schools -- when the deal was reached. And he neglected to mention that the teachers' agreement covered six years, which we consider a significant omission. On balance, we find the statement Half True.

pomt-03980	Says his administration has made "progress" on border enforcement by "putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/12/barack-obama/barack-obama-touts-administrations-border-enforcem/	During his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama touted his administration’s record on curbing illegal immigration. "We can build on the progress my administration has already made – putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years," Obama said. We looked at both parts of this claim during the second presidential debate between Obama and Mitt Romney. We don’t see substantive changes in the wording, and we haven’t found any updated data, so we will recap our previous analysis here. As usual, when a speaker makes a claim that suggests either credit or blame, we do a two-step assessment. Is the statement factually accurate? And is the credit or blame fairly assigned? More boots on the southern border than at any time in our history In 2012, the Border Patrol had 18,516 agents on the southwestern border with Mexico, accounting for about 87 percent of all agents. The number of agents on the southwestern border has risen by 6 percent from the 2009 level, and is currently five times higher than the 1993 level. The total number of agents is higher than in any year going back to at least 1924, according to data from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics compiled and provided to PolitiFact by Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues. It’s worth noting that the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents rose by about two thirds. Still, Obama framed his claim carefully. Are there more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history? The answer is yes. Is the flow of undocumented immigrants the lowest in 40 years? When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico for the first time since "probably in the 1930s," Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew, told us last October. This is consistent with the kind of decline Obama was referring to, but both Passel and Massey said Obama was likely referring to a somewhat different statistic -- namely, apprehensions of individuals crossing from Mexico to the United States. Those numbers also support Obama’s claim. Apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Still, while this statistic is not a "direct measure of flow across the border," Passel said, it is "widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow." So what does that data look like? In 2011, according to federal statistics compiled by Massey, the United States apprehended 327,577 individuals, a smaller number than in any year going back to 1970 -- or just outside Obama’s 40-year window. And if you look at apprehensions per agent, it’s the lowest in an even longer period -- since 1943, Massey said. Assigning reasons for the decline Where Obama’s claim runs into problems is when he credits his policies. Passel said Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact. "We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up," he said. "We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous." But Massey considers the economy the primary factor. The recession, he said, had an immense impact in slowing border crossing. In particular, dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey. Two other significant factors were also out of Obama’s control -- the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border). Our ruling Obama said his administration has made "progress" on border enforcement by "putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years." Obama is right about the numbers of Border Patrol agents and on the immigrant flows across the border. However, it’s a stretch for him to suggest that his administration is the primary reason. The growth in agents began under Bush, and while law enforcement matters in curbing flows of illegal immigrants, so do economic conditions in both the United States and Mexico as well as crime on the Mexican side of the border, and these are factors Obama doesn’t directly control.

Next, our web search under that name led to a Feb. 11, 2017 post on liberalplug.com stating the very same Texas Republican had singled out the judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who left in place a U.S. district judge’s ruling blocking President Donald Trump from temporarily barring people from seven countries from entering the country. The post initially says: "GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy." It later says that McCaskill tweeted: "Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan." Liberalplug.com’s post continues: "Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party." First things first: Texas’ 36 House members include no one named McCaskill. Also, when we checked in mid-February 2017, no Rob McCaskill Twitter feed existed. But a fresh search employing cachedview.com, which compiles web pages accumulated over time, led to what looked like the no-longer-in-business Twitter feed for "Rep. Rob McCaskill" of Pecos. On that feed, a photo of a smiling balding fellow with a jacket over his shoulder says McCaskill is "representing Texas’ 37th district beginning 2017!" Note: Texas has no 37th district. Our review of the limited number of tweets on the cached version of the account showed that whoever controls its posts put up about 25 tweets from Jan. 25, 2017 until 10:07 a.m. Feb. 10, 2017, nearly all of them explicitly supportive of Trump. A sampling: LiberalPlug.com’s McCaskill web post, critical of Trump, otherwise encourages readers to click through to another web site that says it centers on discussions of the U.S. and world from a leftist perspective. We didn’t spot mention on the liberalplug site of its chiefs or purpose--nothing suggesting it’s intended to be a news source or, conversely, always a spoof. When we clicked on a Facebook icon on the site, we landed on a Facebook page titled "Liberal Daily," which says it’s a media/news company. We messaged that and didn’t hear back. Otherwise, we noticed, a volunteer-led effort called Media Bias/Fact Check calls liberalplug.com "a news and opinion website with extreme left-wing bias. Some stories appear to be outright fake news. Most others are not properly sourced and amount to left wing propaganda. This source is not credible." Our ruling LiberalPlug.com says Rob McCaskill, a Republican U.S. House member from Texas, posted a message on Twitter wishing for another 9/11. There’s no such Texas congressman to wish for anything.

pomt-02395	Millennials are "more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/11/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-millennials-more-pro-life-boomers-or-se/	In 1980, America greeted the Post-It note, the Rubik’s Cube, and the launch of CNN. Demographers and marketers also labeled it as the first year of the millennial generation, a group that today makes up about a quarter of the adult population. Both political parties have a keen desire to tap into this generation's political and social leanings. During a quick back-and-forth on NBC's Meet the Press, Ralph Reed, conservative activist and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said millennials are hard to characterize. They are "more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans," Reed said. Political columnist Ron Fournier with National Journal quickly disagreed. "Actually, that's not true. They're as pro-life," Fournier said. Enter PunditFact to see what the survey data and the people who study it have to say. We’re checking Reed’s claim, that millennials are "more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans." The staff at the Faith and Freedom Coalition told us that the source behind Reed’s words is a 2010 survey commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization opposed to abortion, and conducted by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The results showed that 58 percent of millennials felt that abortion is morally wrong, compared to 51 percent of boomers and 62 percent of seniors. Right off the bat, we can say that Reed missed the mark. From the numbers in the study itself, seniors are slightly more opposed to abortion than millennials. Reed’s words track better with his comparison to the baby boomers. However, Mary Griffith with the Marist Institute noted that asking someone whether abortion is morally acceptable or wrong is very different from asking if they consider themselves pro-life or pro-choice. "It’s almost comparing apples to oranges," Griffith said. "You get very different results." When Marist asked the pro-life/pro-choice question in 2013, millennials were least likely of all age groups to call themselves pro-life: Millennial: 40% Gen-X: 45% Baby boomer: 47% Seniors: 53% Pollsters define these generations by the year they were born: Millennials - born after 1980; Generation X - 1965-1980; Baby boomers - 1946-1964; Seniors - 1928-1945. Other organizations have also surveyed millennials and one, the Public Religion Research Institute, an academic research group in Washington, noted a paradox around the pro-life/pro-choice labels. "A significant number of millennials identify with both," said Daniel Cox, research director at the institute. "65 percent of millennials claim the label ‘pro-life,' compared to 74 percent who claim the label ‘pro-choice.’ " Still, at 65 percent, millennials in that survey were less likely than other groups to identify themselves as pro-life. Asked if "pro-life describes you well or somewhat well," a higher fraction of baby boomers -- 76 percent -- said yes, as did 72 percent of seniors. Getting away from labels, many pollsters ask whether abortion should be legal in all or most cases. With that approach, the Public Religion Research Institute found millennials are much like the baby boomers, both at about 55 percent, while 43 percent of seniors take that view. These results are similar to the ones from Gallup. In 2010, Gallup reported that millennials, Generation Xers and baby boomers equally supported or opposed abortion, and seniors were least likely of all groups to support it. However, Gallup also noted that over the years, support for abortion has slipped among all age groups. A study just released by the Pew Research Center found that millennials were slightly more likely than boomers to say that abortion should be legal in all or some cases, but again, the results clustered in the same way: Millennial: 56% Gen X: 59% Baby boomer: 52% Seniors: 42% If the surveys don’t back up Reed’s statement today, the views of millennials might be headed in a direction he would favor. Melissa Deckman, a political scientist at Washington College, said there is evidence that if you ask millennials how they feel about abortion under specific circumstances, some of them show more misgivings about the procedure. Especially among Republican millennial women, support drops a bit when specific factors are part of the survey questions, such as the discovery of a serious birth defect in the fetus or the financial ability of the household to pay for a new child. "They are trending slightly pro-life if you consider a wider range of restrictions to abortion," said Decker. Our ruling Reed said that millennial voters are more likely to be pro-life than baby boomers or seniors. Reed relied on a survey that asked about the morality of abortion. The institute behind that survey told us results were considerably different on the question of pro-life/pro-choice. Based on the latest results, millennials were least likely of all age groups to call themselves pro-life. Across multiple surveys, there is no evidence that millennials are more likely to be pro-life than other generations. The general trend is that they are about equally pro-life as Gen-Xers and baby boomers, and consistently are less pro-life than seniors. We rate the claim False.

pomt-02831	"In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/	As Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was about to execute the "nuclear option" -- changing the chamber’s rules to eliminate a 60-vote supermajority for executive nominations -- his office released a graphic designed to show how Senate Republicans had used filibusters to target a disproportionate number of President Barack Obama’s nominees. The graphic -- which quickly went viral among Democrats using social media -- showed a pie chart with the following caption. "In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents." We received numerous requests from readers to take a look at the numbers. So we did. First, some background. Senators can filibuster, or delay, action either by talking as long as they can on the floor, or by making an objection to party leaders. Such a blockage can be overcome by passing a "cloture" motion with a supermajority of votes. Currently, 60 votes are needed to pass a cloture motion and proceed to a final vote on the matter at hand. (Before 1975, it was 67.) Reid pursued the "nuclear option" -- called that because it represents a significant break with Senate tradition -- on Nov. 21, 2013. Using a parliamentary maneuver, Reid secured approval to end the minority’s filibuster right in all but extraordinary circumstances for executive-branch nominations and judicial nominations short of the Supreme Court. It passed with 52 Democrats voting in support. When we asked Reid’s office for their supporting evidence for the graphic, they pointed us to two documents from the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. Collectively, the two documents list every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was attempted. Looking over the documents, we found that the numbers were essentially right, but that the way the graphic described them was wrong. The most recent of the two documents, a CRS memo, said, "In brief, out of the 168 cloture motions ever filed (or reconsidered) on nominations, 82 (49 percent) were cloture motions on nominations made since 2009." This means that the numbers in the graphic -- 82 presidential nominees blocked under Obama and 86 nominees blocked previously -- were described incorrectly. The figures actually represent the number of cloture attempts that had been made, not the people who were nominated . This matters because some of the nominations resulted in multiple cloture efforts. By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147. Reid’s point is actually a bit stronger using these these revised numbers. Using these figures, blockages under Obama actually accounted for more than half of the total, not less then half. Either way, it's disproportionate by historical standards. Indeed, when we presented this finding to Reid’s office, they agreed and released an updated version of the graphic. It now reads, "In the history of the United States, there have been 168 filibusters of presidential nominees, 82 filibusters under President Obama, 86 filibusters under all other presidents." "Point well taken on the number," Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson told PolitiFact. "We have actually been careful to specify that 168 is the number of times a nominee was blocked in our materials. The miswording was unintentional. I don't think the point is any less strong when it is worded as ‘times’ versus ‘nominees.’" We found another bit of questionable wording in the graphic. The report’s count of cloture motions started in 1949, when the Senate first allowed cloture to be sought on nominations. That means that only 11 pre-Obama presidents were included in the count, not the 43 whose thumbnail portraits are included in the graphic. On this one, however, Jentleson said the office was sticking with its wording. "I see your point there, but still feel comfortable," he said. "The record suggests that filibusters against nominees were rare prior to 1949. If there were data suggesting that there were enough filibusters against nominees prior to 1949 to make the ‘half in the history of the U.S.’ statistic misleading, we would consider incorporating that into our wording going forward. But as it stands, we believe that the record suggests the opposite." To support the notion that blocked nominations were rare prior to 1949, Reid’s office provided us with the names of just seven nominations that were rejected before 1949, some of whom were nominated more than once. They are: Roger B. Taney, nominated by Andrew Jackson to be Treasury Secretary; Caleb Cushing, nominated by John Tyler to be Treasury Secretary; David Henshaw, nominated by Tyler to be Navy Secretary; James M. Porter nominated by Tyler to be Secretary of War; James S. Green, nominated by Tyler to be Treasury Secretary; Henry Stanbery nominated by Andrew Johnson to be Attorney General; and Charles B. Warren, nominated by Calvin Coolidge to be Attorney General. None of these appear to have been filibustered, Jentleson said, judging by the relatively short periods between their nomination and their rejection, as well as the fact that each did ultimately get votes. Our ruling Reid’s graphic said that "in the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents." The figures are solidly sourced to the Congressional Research Service, but the graphic’s wording was wrong -- an error that Reid’s office acknowledged after we contacted them, and for which they released a corrected version of the graphic. Meanwhile, the question of how many pre-Obama presidents should be included is a bit murkier. The CRS report doesn’t incorporate data prior to 1949, but there’s evidence that blocked nominations were rare to nonexistent before that. Since the revised numbers actually increase the accuracy of Reid's underlying point -- that blockages under Obama have accounted for a disproportionate share of those undertaken in United States history -- we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00723	"Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/26/peter-schweizer/fact-checking-clinton-cash-author-claim-about-bill/	Did foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband? That’s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend. In an April 26 interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer’s book. "You have an interesting point that I want to put up on the screen that seems to demonstrate exactly the point you're making," Wallace said. "Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches, 13, for which he was paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state." Schweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton’s speaking fees "dramatically" went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009. "When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence," he said. "When you have this many, to me it's a trend." We aren’t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer’s overall thesis here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton’s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,"Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state," according to the New York Times, which has an advance copy. By the millions In 2014, before Clinton Cash was in the public eye, the Washington Post analyzed Clinton’s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States). To find out more about Clinton’s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton’s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, her financial information as well as Bill Clinton’s is available for all those years. Schweizer didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but income information on the financial disclosure forms supports his claim. Here’s a list of all the speeches for which Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, including the year, location, host and actual fee: 2003 -- Japan, $500,000 Sakura Asset Management (Japanese finance corporation) (A note: This speech was canceled, but the fee went to Clinton’s presidential library foundation); 2008 -- California, $500,000, Power Within (life coach Anthony Robbins’ brand); 2010 -- Russia, $500,000, Renaissance Capital (Russian finance corporation); 2010 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk (Danish pharmaceutical company); 2011 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2011 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2011 -- Netherlands, $600,000, Achmea (Dutch finance corporation); 2011 -- China, $550,000, Huatuo CEO Forum (business conference); 2011 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (international environmental information organization); 2011 -- Hong Kong, $750,000, Ericsson (Swedish multinational communications technology company); 2012 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2012 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2012 -- Italy, $500,000, Technogym (fitness equipment manufacturer). So in the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife stepped down from secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton indeed gave 13 speeches for which he made more than $500,000. Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. Only two happened before then. Schweizer suggests that Clinton’s speaking fees went up in 2009 in part because companies wanted leverage within Hillary Clinton’s State Department. For example, New York Times reporters -- building off of Schweizer’s work -- found that while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation. Additionally, "shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock." The article’s talking about speech No. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by Renaissance Capital. ABC News also examined Clinton’s speaking records and found many instances in which he took in money from groups with pending interests at the State Department. State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quid pro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons’ wealth, arguing that Schweizer’s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making. Our ruling Schweizer said, "Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state." We're not checking Schweizer's suggestion that the increased speaking fees were part of a plan to curry favor in his wife's State Department. But on the specific numbers, Schweitzer is correct. Hillary Clinton’s financial disclosure forms from 2001 through the end of 2012 confirm Schweizer’s claim. We rate it True.

pomt-11102	Says that under Scott Walker, on a percentage basis, Wisconsin is "spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance" than before he took office.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/11/kelda-helen-roys/debt-payments-wisconsin-road-work-have-doubled-und/	When it comes to maintaining Wisconsin highways, the more the state spends on debt payments for road work, the less money there is available for actual work. Kelda Helen Roys, one of 10 Democrats hoping to run against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election, claims Walker is spending too much on debt payments. The former state lawmaker, who won a straw poll among the gubernatorial candidates at the state Democratic Convention, made that attack about a month before the convention. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Her claim came May 2, 2018 in a Wisconsin Eye television interview during this exchange with host Steven Walters: Roys: I think we’re seeing the effects of putting things on the credit card when it comes to our roads. Now we’re spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance -- Walters: -- 22 or 23 percent. Roys: Right. And I think when he (Walker) came in, it was something like 10 or 11 percent. So, using percentages, is the state under Walker "spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance"? More from PolitiFact on Walker spending: Roys: In 2011 under Scott Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent "more on our prison system than we did" on the University of Wisconsin System. Mostly True Walker: Work with the Legislature to repay the raids from the Transportation Fund. Promise Kept Increased borrowing On transportation, Walker has been criticized for refusing to raise gas taxes or vehicle fees to bring more revenue into the state’s road fund, opting instead to borrow more money and to delay some road projects. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan state agency, warned in analyzing Walker’s 2017-’19 state budget that "continued reliance on bonds over a sustained period can result in debt service costs that consume an increasing share of transportation revenue." On the other hand, Walker has made good on two promises -- to stop "raids" on the state transportation fund, and to pay back money that had been transferred from that fund to the state’s general fund under his predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. The numbers To assess Roys’ statement, we examined the latest available figures from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which were produced in November 2017. In analyzing 2017-’19 two-year state budget enacted by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, the bureau provided figures on the total of all transportation debt service as a percentage of gross transportation fund revenue -- in other words, what portion of transportation revenue for road work would be going to paying off debt. To look at what’s happened during Walker’s tenure, we use as a base the 2010-’11 state fiscal year -- the second year of the final state budget under under his Doyle: State budget year Amount of transportation debt payments Debt payments as a percentage of transportation revenue 2010-’11: Final budget year under Doyle $197.2 million 11.5% *2017-’18: Current budget year $380.2 million 20% *2018-’19: Starts July 1, 2018 $398.4 million 20.9% Doubling would be 23 percent, so 20.9 percent is pretty close. But it’s worth noting that the figures for 2017-18 and 2018-’19 are estimates, though they are based on the 2017-’19 state budget and are not expected to change much. Our rating Roys says that under Walker, on a percentage basis, Wisconsin is "spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance" than before he took office. The portion of road revenue being used for debt service was 11.5 percent during the final budget year for Doyle, Walker’s predecessor. The figure is projected to reach 20.9 percent during the second year of the current two-year state budget Walker signed, which is nearly doubling. With the caveat that the figure for the current budget is an estimate, we rate Roys’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-11067	"Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/21/blog-posting/no-bill-clinton-law-separating-families/	A popular pro-Donald Trump Twitter account cast blame for family separations at the border on former Democratic presidents of decades past. "Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America. And liberals cheered," Education for Liberals tweeted. "(Barack) Obama enforced this same law throughout his entire presidency. And liberals cheered. President Trump is now left to ‘deal with it.’ And liberals are angry." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ve previously compared the practices of Trump and Obama when it came to separating families. Did Clinton pass a law that separated children from their parents? The Twitter user did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We found two major policies relating to immigration that went into effect during the Clinton administration, but neither did what the tweets said. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act Clinton signed an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration in 1996. But it had no provisions mandating the separation of families, experts told us. The biggest change the legislation brought about for families was deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction. "The 1996 reforms made it easier to remove previously legal immigrants (many of whom had married, settled down, and had kids in the United States) for criminal conviction that had previously not made them eligible for removal," said Rick Su, an immigration law professor at University of Buffalo. "Adult noncitizens who were removed sometimes chose to have U.S. citizen kids remain in the United States," said Peter Marguiles, law professor at Roger Williams University. "But that was a choice made by parents, not a decision by the government." The Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy that has resulted in family separations doesn’t stem from the enforcement of this law, however, but entry without inspection, which had been on the books for decades prior to 1996, Adam Cox, immigration law professor at NYU, told us. Despite the law on the books, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted before the Trump administration. Immigrants with criminal records or illegally re-entering the country were prioritized for prosecution during more recent administrations. Of late, however, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission, prosecuting all illegal border crossings. Children can’t go to detention centers, so they are being handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. (More on this later.) To sum it up: The 1996 law didn’t require, nor did the Clinton administration adopt, a zero tolerance policy requiring that all noncitizens crossing the border in violation of immigration law be prosecuted for federal crimes. That’s a new policy under Trump. The Flores settlement The tweet may also have been referring to a 1997 agreement conservatives have used to justify family separations. The Flores settlement was a January 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. The agreement determined immigrant children must be held in the "least restrictive setting." The Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but it doesn’t condone or require the separation of children from parents. In fact, it stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family. The Obama administration had been placing children with their parents in family detention centers, but the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. Because the detention centers were considered restrictive, the children had to be released. The Obama administration chose to release parents alongside their children. The result of these actions left the Trump administration with three options when apprehending a family trying to cross the border illegally: release parents and their children; send parents to prison and release their children; or send parents to prison and their children to child detention facilities overseen by the government. The Trump administration chose the last option, a decision he reversed on June 20, 2018. Our ruling A tweet by Education4Liberals tried to point out liberal hypocrisy toward immigrant family separations, saying "Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America." There is no law separating children from their parents when they enter the country illegally. The Trump administration chose to pursue that outcome as a result of its zero-tolerance policy. Clinton signed a significant immigration crackdown into law, but it mostly related to immigrants who were already living in the United States with criminal convictions, indirectly impacting some immigrant children. The Flores agreement of 1997 mandated that unaccompanied children be placed in the least restrictive setting while awaiting an immigration hearing, but that allows for a few options so that children are not required to be separated from their parents.

pomt-03218	"There are only four countries in the world that ... legalize abortion after five months -- China, North Korea, Canada and the U.S."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/22/carly-fiorina/only-four-countries-legalize-abortion-after-5-mont/	Former Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina talked abortion on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 18, 2013. When host George Stephanopoulos pointed out Republicans’ failure to capture the single-woman vote in 2012, she responded by saying, "I think first we have to turn it around by having reasonable discussions around the things that are labeled extreme." The former Hewlett Packard CEO went on to say that many Republicans are abortion rights advocates, and that Texas Gov. Rick Perry was not making an "extreme" move by tightening regulations on abortions. "There are only four countries in the world that have -- that legalize abortion after five months -- China, North Korea, Canada and the U.S," Fiorina said. We won’t delve into the question of whether Texas’ law is extreme. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on whether only four countries have legal abortion after five months. For the purposes of evaluating this claim, we’ll set five months equal to 20 weeks, since Fiorina was referring to Texas’ new law, which restricts abortions after that time. What the laws say The U.S. requirements for legally obtaining an abortion vary by state, but the national standard was handed down from the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Lawmakers and physicians refer to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus as "viability." The decision sets the standard that mothers can choose to have an abortion until the point of viability. In citing the leading obstetics publication as a guide, the ruling suggests viability starts at 24 weeks into the gestation period, which starts on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason, not necessarily medical, until at least 24 weeks of gestation. This is known as elective abortion. After 24 weeks, or whenever the resident’s state prohibits elective abortion, the woman can get a therapeutic abortion under a few exceptions: life in danger, physical health or mental health. China, North Korea and Canada do not have federally enforced limits on elective abortion. Gestation period restrictions in Canada, unlike the other two nations, are regulated at the local level, said Johanna Fine, a Center for Reproductive Rights spokeswoman. Provinces can range from 10 to 20 weeks for the maximum gestation period. So Fiorina is mostly right about these four nations. However, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which published a 2013 chart that several reproductive rights experts referred us to, Singapore and the Netherlands also fit Fiorina’s criteria. Both nations allow unrestricted abortion through week 24 of gestation, after which therapeutic abortion is possible. Fiorina’s statement also leaves off an important qualifier. She doesn’t mention that there are dozens of countries that permit abortions after 20 weeks for different reasons. Common exceptions to the gestational period requirement mean women may be able to get therapeutic abortions based on physical health, mental health or socioeconomic status. Fiorina’s point is that the four countries she listed all permit women to get abortions until about that time frame without any of those exceptions, but she omits the bit about exceptions. Just 29 countries (here we include countries to mean independent states and semi-autonomous regions whose populations exceed one million) outlaw abortion entirely, with no exceptions to save the woman’s life. Thirty-seven other countries that routinely outlaw abortion, including Paraguay, Afghanistan and Uganda, make clear exceptions to save mothers. Another 59 will do so in general to preserve the mother’s physical health on a broader scale, with Israel, New Zealand and others also accepting mental health reasons as valid exceptions. India and Japan belong to a group of 13 countries that grant even wider exceptions that include access to the procedure for socioeconomic reasons based on factors like age of the woman or very low income. The remaining 61 countries legalize elective abortions with varying gestational period requirements, with the U.S., Canada, North Korea, China, Singapore and the Netherlands being the six countries with the widest acceptable time periods. "It’s not so much whether abortion is legal, it’s under what circumstances it's legal," said Mindy Roseman, the Human Rights Program academic director at Harvard Law School. "Even where abortion is highly restricted, it’s legal for the health of the woman." Our ruling Fiorina said only four countries allow legal abortions five months into the gestational period. The United States, Canada, North Korea and China do fit that measure, but Singapore and the Netherlands, which Fiorina left off her list, do as well. Far more countries permit abortions in certain circumstances in which the pregnancy would damage the woman’s well-being, be it physical, mental or economic. Fiorina’s claim is based in fact but misses the mark, so we rate it Half True.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2013-08-22T13:54:54	2013-08-18	['Canada', 'United_States', 'China', 'North_Korea']
pomt-07177	Says Rick Perry said there’s an administrator for every teacher in Texas public schools.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jun/10/doug-otto/plano-school-chief-says-rick-perry-said-theres-1-1/	A Dallas-area school leader concerned about state education aid zeroed in on what he characterized as a ridiculous claim by Gov. Rick Perry. In an interview with KRLD-AM’s Scott Braddock posted online March 22, Doug Otto, superintendent of the Plano school district, said the district would adjust to any state reductions by cutting administrative and teaching posts. Asked about whittling first outside classrooms, Otto replied: "Well, certainly we’re going to do that as much as we can... But it’s disingenuous, as the governor says, that somehow we have one administrator for every teacher. That’s idiocy." Otto’s claim about Perry came to our attention after a reader asked us to check a May follow-up interview the governor gave the radio host. Perry, stressing school districts will ultimately decide which employees to shed due to tight budgets, said in the May 11 interview: "In Texas now, we’ve hired a huge number of non-teachers into our public schools — administrators, et cetera." Braddock then asked: "Do you stand by the number you gave previously, that there was (a) 1-to-1 ratio of administrators to teachers?" Perry: "That is absolutely correct." Later, Braddock told us he posed his question that way because of Otto’s earlier characterization of Perry’s view. But we found no evidence that Perry has ever cited a 1-to-1 ratio of teachers to administrators. What Perry did say, in early March, was that non-classroom positions are on the rise. "Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to (Texas public) school rolls," he told reporters. We checked that statement and found that from 1998-99 to 2009-10, the number of non-classroom employees — especially in support and administrative staff — outpaced growth in student enrollment and teachers, though whether this growth qualifies as "extraordinary" is open to debate. Nevertheless, we rated Perry’s statement Mostly True. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email the governor meant to say just that in the May interview -- that the ratio of non-teachers to teachers is 1-to-1. Similarly, in March 2010 we rated Mostly True a statement saying there were about the same number of teachers as non-teachers in Texas in 2008-09. Non-teaching staff is a broad category that includes administrators, typically superintendents, principals, registrars, tax assessor-collectors and athletic and personnel directors and the like, as well as other school employees ranging from custodial staff to librarians. In 2009-10, according to the Texas Education Agency, teachers filled half of the state’s 661,286 full-time school district posts. Administrators accounted for 4 percent of the remaining positions. By email, Otto told us he thinks he saw Perry’s 1-to-1 claim in a newspaper story. Jim Hirsch, another Plano administrator, provided links to news stories. A March 18 Fort Worth Star-Telegram article attributed that erroneous 1-to-1 claim to the Texas Young Republican Federation, but none quoted Perry saying there’s a teacher for every administrator.

pomt-08800	"Warren Buffett called credit default swaps financial weapons of mass destruction. And Greene was the first individual to use them."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/18/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meeks-new-ad-gets-warren-buffett-jeff-gre/	Far too often we at PolitiFact Florida get accused of being too hard on candidates. We're too literal, or we fail to forgive hyperbole, folks tell us. Or they say we don't understand how the political process works. We don't think that's true, but regardless, we hear the argument. So when a campaign takes a second shot at making a strong point that we had labeled Barely True, we think it's proper to give a fresh look to the latest effort. Back on July 30, 2010, we took Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Kendrick Meek to task for his TV ad, "He's the Man," in which Meek criticized primary opponent Jeff Greene's background. Specifically, Meek attacked Greene's trading in something called credit default swaps, a type of derivative that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. The long and short of Meek's argument is that Greene made hundreds of millions of dollars betting that people wouldn't be able to pay off their mortgages. They couldn't. And so Greene won. That prompted this admonition in Meek's ad: "Warren Buffett called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' " After a thorough analysis, we rated Meek's claim False, noting that while Buffett did make the comment, Buffett wasn't talking about Greene specifically. (A earlier version of this item mistakenly said our the previous item on Greene was rated Barely True.) Moreover, Buffett made his statement three years before Greene even invested in credit default swaps. And Buffett coined the phrase to talk about derivatives in general, not specifically credit default swaps. "There's no doubt Greene was heavily involved in buying credit default swaps, which are a type of derivative," we concluded in our analysis. "And Buffett was exceptionally critical of derivatives. The problem with Meek's ad is that it gives the impression that Buffett criticized Greene personally, which he didn't do. By saying Buffett called Greene's scheme a bad idea, Meek personalizes a comment that had nothing to do with Greene." Our friends at Factcheck.org also found Meek's ad misleading. Fast forward to Aug. 11, when Meek began airing a new ad, "All Support," with the same Buffett line worded slightly differently. The new ad says, "Warren Buffett called credit default swaps financial weapons of mass destruction. And Greene was the first individual to use them." We decided to see if Meek's campaign has been listening. Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company renowned for its savvy investment strategies, and he's No. 2 on the 2009 Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Some folks call Buffett "the Oracle of Omaha." It turns out he coined the phrase to describe derivatives back in 2003, when he published his annual letter to investors discussing his thoughts on the previous year's business. Buffett warned that it was difficult to truly evaluate the risks involved in speculative derivatives. "Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values," Buffett wrote. "The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)," he continued. "At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem -- at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty." Buffett warned that speculative derivatives could become unforeseen catastrophes for some companies. "Imagine, then, that a company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown," he wrote. It turns out this is exactly what happened at some of the biggest financial firms in the country in 2008 -- five years after Buffett's warning. Buffett was discussing derivatives in the context of Berkshire Hathaway's investment in a company called General Re Securities. Buffett said he attempted to sell without success. At the time he wrote the letter, he was trying to shut down the business, but was having problems resolving the many derivatives contracts General Re had on its books. "We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside," Buffett wrote. "In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal." Credit default swaps are a speculative derivative like Buffett was talking about, though we should note Buffett didn't specifically discuss credit default swaps in his comments. Now, was Greene the first individual to use them? According to Forbes, Greene is "believed to be the first individual to do so." Banks typically only let major hedge funds participate in credit default swaps, but Greene convinced banks to make the trades with him individually. (Banks thought the investment was too complicated for a single person.) Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about credit default swaps, described Greene as among the first and most successful private investors to ever participate in the trade. "He convinced people like Merrill Lynch to do the trade when they wouldn't do it for other individuals," Zuckerman said. "Greene potentially is one of the only individuals in the country to have pulled this trade off." Zuckerman claims in his book that Greene was the first individual, not hedge fund, to participate in credit default swaps through Merrill Lynch. Back to Meek's claim. He said, "Warren Buffett called credit default swaps financial weapons of mass destruction. And Greene was the first individual to use them." Buffett, in 2003 comments, described derivatives bought speculatively as financial weapons of mass destruction. That would include credit default swaps. And while people invested in credit default swaps before Greene through hedge funds, Greene is believed to be the first individual to do so on his own. Meek's new ad much more accurately describes the relationship between Buffett, Greene and his investments. We rate the statement True.

pomt-08652	"Over 22,000 unique Internet Protocol addresses -- in Wisconsin alone -- have downloaded child pornography."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/15/jb-van-hollen/jb-van-hollen-says-more-22000-ip-addresses-wiscons/	As Wisconsin’s attorney general -- and a candidate for re-election -- Republican J.B. Van Hollen has declared one of his priorities to be fighting Internet crimes against children. The issue is cited on the home page of both the state Department of Justice website and his campaign website. When supporting a bill in March 2010, Van Hollen submitted written testimony to a state Senate committee that said his department’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force included more than 130 local law enforcement affiliates from across the state. That was up from 22 when he took office three years earlier. Van Hollen also cited a statistic that seems harder to put a precise number on: "Over 22,000 unique Internet Protocol addresses -- in Wisconsin alone -- have downloaded child pornography," he said. But how does the attorney general know exactly how many Internet addresses, linked to Wisconsin computers, are involved with child porn? Let’s set aside the number itself for a moment, and look at the rest of Van Hollen’s statement -- that the addresses in question had downloaded child porn. Dean Stensberg, Van Hollen’s executive assistant at the Department of Justice, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that Van Hollen was citing work by department investigators. But Van Hollen was misquoting his own department. When the department announced the figure in November 2008, it said that during the first 9.5 months of that year, people using the 22,000 addresses had attempted to download child pornography -- not that they had actually downloaded it, though undoubtedly many did. The DOJ also noted that some of the pictures and movies involved were confirmed to be child porn, but others were suspected child porn. Now let’s turn to the number itself. To assess the department’s methodology, we reviewed a 19-page affidavit the department used in a June 2010 child pornography investigation. To get a judge to issue a search warrant in such cases, investigators have to describe their procedure: Investigators view computer files of pictures and movies and list those that contain child pornography. They then use computer software to determine which of those files are being offered for exchange over a peer-to-peer network, which allow individuals to connect their computers with other computers around the world. Then the investigators identify the IP addresses -- every computer connected to the Internet has a unique number -- used by people offering to share the child porn files. Judges issue search warrants based on that approach, indicating the DOJ’s methodology for identifying the addresses is sound. We can’t review confidential law enforcement files to see if they tally 22,000. But we can get an outside assessment of the approach. David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, noted the numbers of attempted child porn downloads could include people who legally download a large amount of legal adult pornography and inadvertently end up with some child pornography on their computers. Finkelhor, affiliated with the national Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the 22,000 figure seems plausible for Wisconsin, based on similar statistics he has heard. That assessment squares with some figures we found: Illinois: In September 2010, the Illinois Attorney General’s Office said investigators had identified 6,500 IP addresses in that state that were trading or downloading child pornography in the previous 30 days. That would come to 61,750 IP addresses over 9.5 months, nearly three times as many as the 22,000 addresses Van Hollen said his department found in a similar period. (Illinois’ population is a little more than twice Wisconsin’s.) Indiana: The Indiana State Police said its investigators found 19,000 unique IP addresses that traded child porn movies during a six-month period. That would mean more than 30,000 addresses over 9.5 months. (Indiana’s population is almost 14 percent more than Wisconsin’s.) Nationally: Finally, in an August 2010 report, the U.S. Department of Justice said two programs used by law enforcement agencies -- one in place since 2006 and the other since late 2009 -- have identified more than 20 million IP addresses nationwide offering child pornography pictures and videos on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. That report did not break down state-by-state totals. So where does that leave us? Van Hollen told the Senate committee his department had identified 22,000 IP addresses in the state that had downloaded child porn. That went beyond his Department of Justice’s report, which characterized the number as "attempting" to download images that were "known or suspected to be" child pornography. Given the nature of the claim, we can’t go in and tally up the addresses ourselves. But judges have signed off on the methodology, and at least two other Midwestern states appear to have found even larger numbers of computer addresses involved in child porn. We rate Van Hollen’s statement Mostly True.	None	J.B. Van Hollen	None	None	None	2010-09-15T09:00:00	2010-03-18	['Wisconsin']
pomt-03361	"Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jul/14/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-newark-unemployment-13-percen/	In the months leading up to the gubernatorial primary, Chris Christie was busy flying off to various political events around the country, paying little attention to urban blight, soaring property taxes and double-digit unemployment plaguing some New Jersey neighborhoods. That’s the suggestion of a new Internet ad released Tuesday by a group called ChristieNotForNJ.com. Buono, a Democratic state senator from Middlesex County, is running against Christie, a Republican, in November’s governor’s race. In the ad, Christie is seen campaigning with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a fundraiser in Iowa, followed by a shot of boarded up homes in a blighted neighborhood. "Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark," Buono says in the ad, as a shot from the Iowa State Fair – where fried butter is a staple delicacy – plays in the back. "Just 13 percent unemployment." We’ll leave the butter assessment for the culinary crowd and look instead at the unemployment claim since New Jersey’s had unusually high unemployment figures even after the recession ended in 2009. But 13 percent for the state’s largest city? It turns out that Newark’s unemployment rate since Christie’s been governor has been quite a bit higher than Buono’s estimate. Before looking at unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, let’s note that the data we reviewed was not seasonally adjusted. As a result, BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish told us it’s best to use the same month to compare data from different years. We decided to look at two time frames: February 2010 – Christie’s first full month as governor – to February 2013, and May 2010 to May 2013, the last month for which BLS has unemployment data on Newark. Each time frame allows us to review three years of data. We also looked specifically at the unemployment rate. Standish confirmed that our methodology for determining Newark’s unemployment rate was correct. First, the February comparisons. Newark’s unemployment rate was 15.9 percent in February 2010 and 14.6 percent this past February. For the months in between, the jobless rate seesawed between 14.3 percent and nearly 16.5 percent. Now let’s compare May unemployment rates in Newark for 2010 and 2013. The rate was 15.1 percent in May 2010. The preliminary rate for this past May is 13.7 percent. The only months where unemployment fell to 13 percent during Christie’s entire tenure thus far was in April 2012 (13.8 percent), this past April (13.2 percent) and May (13.7 percent), according to BLS data. Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner and Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts did not respond to our requests for comment. We also looked at unemployment rates in Camden and Trenton – other major New Jersey urban centers with large minority populations -- and found those rates were as high or higher. So why has Newark’s unemployment rate been so high? The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has acknowledged previously to PolitiFact New Jersey that there’s a high rate of unemployment for blacks. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, noted in 2011 that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help improve those statistics. Our ruling Buono said in a new online ad about Christie’s trips to other states, "Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment." Data from the BLS shows that for almost all of Christie’s tenure as governor, Newark’s unemployment rate has been at least a full percentage point or two higher than what Buono’s ad claims. There have only been three months in which the city’s unemployment rate was in the 13 percent range: April 2012, April 2013 and a preliminary rate in that range for May. The point of Buono’s claim is that Newark has had consistently high unemployment, whether during the few months it was in the 13 percent range or when it stagnated in the 15 percent range. We rate her claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Barbara Buono	None	None	None	2013-07-14T07:30:00	2013-07-09	['Newark,_New_Jersey']

pomt-04740	President Obama "funneled" $716 billion out of Medicare "at the expense of the elderly."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-president-obama-funneled-716-billio/	Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has made some of his sharpest attacks yet on Barack Obama’s health care law, calling the law "the greatest threat to Medicare." Ryan himself advocates a plan to give voucher-like credits to seniors, so they can shop for a private plan or choose a traditional Medicare option. That plan has come under withering attack from Democrats. Ryan fired back Aug. 29 during his acceptance speech at the at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. "The biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly," Ryan said. "You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with a new law and new taxes on nearly a million small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn’t have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. "So, they just took it all away from Medicare, $716 billion, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn’t even ask for. The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we’re going to stop it." Ryan’s comments are highly misleading. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Still, the number has a slight basis in fact. The health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The total anticipated savings comes to $716 billion over the next 10 years, as determined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We should note that both parties agree Medicare spending is increasing too fast as baby boomers retire and medical costs increase. The government needs to find savings so those costs don’t overwhelm the federal budget in the future. So, yes, Obama’s law did find $716 billion in spending reductions. They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost the government more than traditional Medicare. The health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures, the overall Medicare budget is still projected to go up for the foreseeable future. There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. We should point out that some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending. Our ruling Ryan said Obama "funneled" $716 billion out of Medicare "at the expense of the elderly." This gives a very misleading impression. In fact, the law limits payments to health care providers and insurers to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Lawmakers said they hoped the measures would improve care and efficiency. Those savings, spread out over the next 10 years, are then used to offset costs created by the law (especially coverage for the uninsured) so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit.

pomt-11941	"Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/11/seth-moulton/have-background-checks-been-unequivocally-shown-re/	On the heels of the Las Vegas shooting, two military veterans-turned-congressmen waded into the debate over the country’s response to gun violence. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a former Marine, appeared with Rep. Scott Taylor, R-Va., a former Navy SEAL, on ABC’s This Week Oct. 8 to discuss issues surrounding gun control and the Second Amendment. As the conversation turned toward background checks, Taylor argued the measure doesn’t necessarily help reduce gun violence. "Actually," Moulton countered, "background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence." We previously found that around 90 percent of Americans support background checks on every gun sale. While the belief that background checks reduce gun violence appears firmly ingrained, we found that proving the theory — especially "unequivocally," which means without a doubt — is not so clear cut. Everytown for Gun Safety data Moulton’s office pointed us to research by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety that explored the relationship between background check laws and gun violence rates. Under federal law, background checks are not required for private sales. But 19 states and D.C. have laws on the books that require some sort of background check on private sales of at least some types of private guns. Everytown for Gun Safety compared the rates of gun violence in states that require background checks for private sales to states that do not. They compared the fatality rates along several categories: women shot to death by intimate partners, suicides by gun and law enforcement officers shot and killed in the line of duty. The group found that states with comprehensive background checks had a roughly 50 percent lower rate in each category: But experts told us that while stark differences between the two groups of states is noteworthy, it should not be taken as unequivocal proof that background checks reduce gun violence. Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and gun control expert, said the comparisons do not control for all of the other variables that may differ between the two groups of states, like relative levels of gun ownership. "No reasonable person could believe that universal background checks could, all by themselves, cut these rates of gun violence in half," he said. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that without controlling for other factors, the data is insufficient for concluding a cause-and-effect relationship about background checks and a reduced gun violence. Connecticut permit law study Moulton’s office also pointed us to research by Webster and several colleagues. The study looked at the effects that a Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license had on subsequent homicides. Under the Connecticut law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a 5-year license to buy handguns (the law did not not apply to rifles and shotguns). Measures such as the Connecticut law are known in academic circles as "permit-to-purchase laws." Researchers found the Connecticut law was associated with a 40 percent reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law was never passed, an estimate referred to as "Synthetic Connecticut" in the graph below (we’d note this methodology was not without some controversy). Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction. But Webster cautioned that the associated reduction in gun violence could not be attributed solely to background checks, because they were part of a larger regulatory scheme under Connecticut’s permit-to-purchase law. The law required all would-be gun buyers to apply for a permit in person with the local police before making a purchase, regardless of whether the seller was a licensed dealer or private seller. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from 18 to 21 years and obliged would-be purchasers to undergo at least eight hours in a gun safety training course. It also criminalized the sale of a handgun to anyone without a license. Webster said the effects of comprehensive background checks alone couldn’t be de-coupled from the other law’s other provisions. "Just passing a comprehensive background check law — without other measures relevant to standards for legal gun ownership and accountability and without commitment to really enforce the comprehensive background check laws — may not be sufficient to reduce gun violence if there is not concerted effort to enforce the law," Webster said. "Bottom line," he said, "comprehensive background checks laws saved lives, but when coupled with permit-to-purchase laws." How strong is the evidence? Experts we spoke to appeared to agree Moulton was partially right, but overstated the case. According to his reading of the scientific literature, Webster said background checks on all gun transfers are necessary to stop prohibited people from getting guns. But it hasn’t been established scientifically that background checks could do so alone, separate from a broader system of laws and regulations, he said. "The best evidence for impact on mortality rates is when comprehensive background checks is coupled with permit-to-purchase law requirements," Webster said. "The impact of these laws depends on the legal standards for gun ownership, systems having necessary records and whether the laws are actually enforced." David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said he tends to agree with the general thrust of Moulton’s claim, but believes "unequivocally" is too strong a word. "Stronger gun laws and fewer guns are associated, all else equal, with lower rates of gun violence," Hemenway said. "Among all the gun laws, there is probably the best evidence that background checks help reduce gun violence. A handful of studies find that they appear to reduce interpersonal firearm violence (and gun trafficking)." Cook also said research into the relationship between background checks and gun violence is less clear cut than Moulton suggested. "The true state of play in the scientific literature is somewhat equivocal," he said. Our ruling Moulton said, "Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence." Research has shown background checks to be associated with reduced gun violence, and they’re believed to be a necessary measure to stop guns from falling into the wrong hands. But it hasn’t been scientifically established that background checks alone could reduce violence, separate from a broader system of laws, regulations and enforcement. In short, the scientific literature is fuzzier than Moulton claims, experts said. We rate this Half True.

pomt-03129	According to the most recent jobs report, "we've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/16/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-more-americans-are-leaving-work-/	In a recent press conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, took time out from discussing the crisis in Syria to remind Americans about shortcomings in the job market. "Last week yet another report showing our economy continues to struggle -- this new normal of slow growth, high unemployment, and stagnant wages," Boehner said on Sept. 12, 2013. "We've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs." We wondered if Boehner was correct that there are "more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs." Boehner is expressing a commonly shared concern. Most economists express worry about an ongoing decline in "labor-force participation" -- the percentage of Americans 16 or older who are working, or who are actively looking for a job. The percentage for August 2013 was the lowest it’s been since August 1978, and if fewer people are working, that’s a drag on the nation’s potential for rapid economic growth. But as we will see, determining how much of this decline in labor-force participation is due to the poor economy, as opposed to broader demographic trends, is tricky. When we asked Boehner’s office for the source of this statistic, a spokesman pointed us to news reports about the most recent employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau found that between July 2013 and August 2013, the economy created a net 169,000 additional jobs, while the size of the civilian labor force dropped by 312,000. (The civilian labor force refers to working-age people who are either employed or were unemployed but looking for work.) That supports Boehner’s comment that more Americans are leaving the workforce finding jobs. But economists say the statistic Boehner chose to illustrate the broader trend isn’t ideal. For starters, it combines numbers from two different surveys that don’t really produce apples-to-apples comparisons. And there are two more worrisome issues: • One-month comparisons are less reliable than longer-term comparisons. There’s a lot of statistical "noise" from month to month in this type of data -- "noise" that tends to balance out over a longer period of time. This is important because, while Boehner was correct about the most recent jobs report, the trends in the most recent month actually run counter to what’s been happening over the longer term. Since the start of the year, the civilian labor force has fallen by 168,000 people, but the number of people employed has risen by 848,000. And over the past year -- from August 2012 to August 2013 -- the civilian labor force has risen by 839,000 people, while the number of people employed has risen by a little more than 2 million. (The numbers are only slightly different if you take into account an annual adjustment for population growth that occurs in January.) Either way, the gain in employment was bigger than the gain (or loss) in people in the labor force. So by choosing to focus on the most recent month, Boehner is essentially cherry-picking the one period for which the trends don’t look very favorable. • Using the full labor force to gauge how many people are "leaving the workforce" isn’t perfect. Americans are aging -- the leading edge of the baby boomers is turning 67, so every month, large numbers of Americans are retiring. In addition, the statistic Boehner used captures Americans as young as age 16, and many Americans between that age and their early 20s aren’t part of the labor market because they are going to school. How much does this skew the numbers? It’s hard to say for sure, but in August 2013, just under 7 percent of those categorized as "not in the labor force" were also categorized as "want a job now." The bulk of the remaining 93 percent are likely school- and retirement-age Americans. So many of the non-workers Boehner’s referring to aren’t people actively engaged in the job market. We can make a more targeted estimate by focusing on those who "want a job now." This particular statistic is not offered in a seasonally adjusted version, so we can’t compare one month to the next. The only valid comparison we can do is between August 2012 and August 2013. What does that show? It turns out that the number of people not in the labor force but who wanted a job fell by 740,000 over that year-long period, while the number of people employed over the same period rose by more than 2.2 million. So, looking at it this way, Boehner’s claim misses the longer-term trend. Our ruling Boehner said that, according to the most recent jobs report, "we've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs." That is what the most recent one-month jobs report found. However, there’s less to this piece of data than meets the eye. Looking at the year-to-date and year-to-year figures show the opposite pattern, and Boehner’s calculation doesn’t account for the large numbers of baby boomers who are retiring because they no longer want to work. In all, Boehner has stated one fact correctly -- and put his finger on an issue of concern to economists -- but he’s ignored other pieces of that give a more nuanced impression.

pomt-10221	"Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/john-mccain/obama-not-keen-on-drilling-but-not-against-nuclear/	In his speech at the Republican National Convention, Sen. John McCain outlined a plan to achieve energy independence from foreign oil, a plan that he called "the most ambitious national project in decades." McCain reiterated his strong support for more offshore oil drilling and the development of more nuclear power plants, and said this is an area of contrast between his energy plan and Sen. Barack Obama's. "Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power," McCain said. It's true that Obama has staunchly and repeatedly opposed expanded offshore drilling in the past. However, just last month, Obama said he would accept some drilling as part of a compromise bill that enacts broader energy reforms. The New Energy Reform Act of 2008 calls for spending $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and includes tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars and trucks. But it also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida's west coast. Obama said he remained highly skeptical about drilling off Florida's coast but that big steps toward energy independence may require compromise. "What I don't want is for the best to be the enemy of the good," Obama said. "If we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise, in which I have to accept some things I don't like and the Democrats have to accept some things they don't like, when it's actually moving us in the direction of energy independence, I'm open to that." Still, McCain is generally correct that Obama would prefer not to open up new areas to offshore oil drilling. But McCain's claim that Obama's plan does not call for more nuclear power is not accurate. Obama has said that nuclear power "has to be part of our energy mix" in attaining energy independence, though it does require environmental safeguards. He's also said that he hopes developing technology will provide better answers to the problem of nuclear waste storage. "Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy" is also explicitly included on page 4 of Obama's energy plan, although the plan emphasizes the importance of securing nuclear fuel and finding safe places to store nuclear waste. Having concerns about safety, though, doesn't mean you're against nuclear energy. So McCain's statement about Obama is more accurate with respect to offshore drilling, but not accurate on nuclear energy. We give it a Half True.

pomt-01736	"Attorney General Eric Holder’s own Justice Department precleared the voting changes in the 2011 law" about early voting in Florida.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/04/rick-scott/eric-holder-signed-floridas-2011-early-voting-law-/	As Florida heads toward a hotly contested governor’s race in November, Attorney General Eric Holder warned Gov. Rick Scott that the feds are "carefully monitoring" voter access in the state. "I am deeply disturbed that during your tenure, your state has repeatedly added barriers to voting and restricted access to the polls," Holder wrote in a July 21 letter to Scott. Holder recapped changes in state election law during Scott’s tenure, as well as the state’s attempt to purge noncitizen voters from the rolls, disenfranchisement of felons and a dispute about where voters can return absentee ballots in Pinellas County. When the Tampa Bay Times blogged about the letter Aug. 1, Scott’s campaign dismissed Holder’s letter as a "bizarre attempt to help Charlie Crist" -- Scott’s likely Democratic opponent in November and an ally of President Barack Obama. Holder and Scott’s campaign made some dueling claims about the state’s early voting law. Holder wrote that 2011 changes in state law "significantly narrowed the early voting window" and that a federal three-judge panel concluded it threatened a "dramatic reduction in a form of voting disproportionately used by African-Americans." Holder wrote: "Accordingly, the court refused to approve reduced early voting hours with respect to the five counties in Florida covered by the preclearance provision in the Voting Rights Act." That led the Scott campaign to point the finger at Holder, for allowing the 2011 early voting law to be implemented: "In fact, Attorney General Eric Holder’s own Justice Department precleared the voting changes in the 2011 law that governed the 2012 general election in Florida," Scott campaign manager Melissa Sellers wrote. At a campaign event in St. Petersburg on the same day, Scott made a similar claim: "In 2011, we changed our voting laws, and they were precleared by the Justice Department ... ." Since Scott, a Republican, is on the ballot this year, we decided to fact-check his statement that the Justice Department approved the early voting changes. On first blush, the claims from Holder and Scott sound like they are in conflict: A federal court refused to allow the reduction in the early voting schedule, but Holder signed off on the changes. We found that Scott left out some important steps along the way to implementing that law. Early voting hours changed In 2011, the GOP-led Legislature passed HB 1355, which cut the number of days of early voting from 14 to 8, among other election changes. The law, signed by Scott, allowed supervisors to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Republican supporters at the time said that the various changes in the law would better protect the state's voting system against fraud. Democrats said the changes were an attempt to suppress voter turnout. Because of past discrimination, five counties in Florida -- Hillsborough, Monroe, Collier, Hardee and Hendry -- were subject to a section of the federal Voting Rights Act, which required any voting-law changes to be precleared by the federal government. (Precleared simply means approved in advance.) Holder signaled early on that he intended to challenge Florida’s new early voting law. In a speech in Texas in December 2011, Holder said: "We're also examining a number of changes that Florida has made to its electoral process, including changes governing third-party voter registration organizations, as well as changes to early-voting procedures, including the number of days in the early-voting period." The state decided to seek preclearance from a three-judge federal panel in Washington, instead of Holder’s Justice Department. The department ended up weighing in anyway, telling the court that the state had failed to prove it was protecting minorities from discrimination. On Aug. 16, 2012, the panel issued a ruling siding with the Justice Department’s position and refusing to approve Florida’s early votings changes. The court said the state failed to prove that minority voters would not be harmed if the five counties held the minimum number of early voting hours. But the panel gave the state a path to get federal approval: The state could submit a plan showing a commitment to offer the maximum number of early voting hours for those counties. The Scott administration quickly filed a plan with the federal court seeking approval for 96 hours of early voting in the five counties. On Sept. 5, Holder filed a motion saying that his department didn’t object to that plan. The state submitted its plan to Holder the next day, and about a week later the Justice Department signed off on it. That November, Florida saw long lines in the 2012 presidential legislation. In 2013, the Legislature passed HB 7013, which expanded early voting to a minimum of 64 hours over eight days and maximum of 168 hours over 14 days. Later that summer, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the requirement for jurisdictions to seek preclearance. But in his letter to Scott, Holder seems to be putting the state on notice that his department still has powers to enforce other provisions in the Voting Rights Act. "Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we will not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at our disposal to fight against racial discrimination, to stand against disenfranchisement and to safeguard the right of every eligible American to cast a ballot," Holder wrote. Our ruling Scott and his campaign said Florida’s 2011 voting changes were precleared by the Holder’s Justice Department. That statement ignores the fact that the department only signed off on the state’s plan after the state agreed to offer the maximum number of early voting hours in some counties to satisfy a court ruling. So approval came only after the state committed to offering the maximum number of hours in places that had a past history of discrimination. Scott's statement leaves out important details that led to Holder’s Department signing off on Florida’s election plan. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-02094	"Estimates for adopting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion show it will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million through 2022."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/may/19/campaign-liberty/ron-paul-group-says-medicaid-expansion-will-cost-v/	An organization founded by former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, is urging Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell to stand firm against expanding Medicaid in the Old Dominion. "Estimates for adopting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion show it will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million through 2022," says an online petition to Howell that was posted April 29 by the Campaign for Liberty. Paul, who served 25 years in Congress and ran three times for president, retired from the House last year. He set up the Campaign for Liberty in 2008 to promote limited government, non-interventionist foreign policies and opposition to the Federal Reserve System. We wondered whether the claim about estimates showing Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million is correct. So we took a look. The Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next two years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. The expansion could add as many as 400,000 Virginians to Medicaid’s rolls. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates, led by Howell, has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget scheduled to go into effect July 1. When we asked the Campaign for Liberty about the $902 million claim, it cited a year-old graph by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative advocacy and research organization, showing the annual costs and savings Virginia would see through 2022 if it expanded Medicaid. Heritage, in a source note under the graph, said its figures came from a November 2012 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that researches health issues. The Kaiser report Kaiser estimated the total added costs each state would incur from 2013 through 2022 if it expanded Medicaid. It concluded that Virginia would spend about $52.7 billion on Medicaid during that span if it broadened its program and about $51.4 billion if did not. So the gross cost of expansion would be slightly higher than $1.3 billion. The main reason for the increase is that the state in 2017 would begin to assume a small share of the cost of insuring the new enrollees. Virginia’s share would cap at 10 percent in 2020, with the federal government paying the rest. Kaiser then subtracted the largest single source of savings Virginia would receive from expansion. The state would no longer need to pay hospitals and clinics as much for their losses from treating indigent patients -- adults who can’t afford private insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. That, Kaiser estimated, would conserve $424 million through 2022. So Kaiser said the net expansion cost to the state -- slightly more than $1.3 billion minus $424 million -- would come out at $902 million through 2022. But Kaiser stressed twice in its report that its net cost estimates had shortcomings because -- outside of considering savings on indigent care -- it did not examine other economies expanded Medicaid offered states. Its source of data did not provide for more detailed research. Kaiser wrote that its net estimates "should be considered an overestimate of costs or an underestimate of savings if states were to implement the Medicaid expansion." The Campaign for Liberty, in relying on this 18-month old estimate on Virginia, neglected a more current and deeper forecast released in January by state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees the Old Dominion’s Medicaid system. The DMAS report The DMAS report contained figures compiled by its actuaries at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. These figures, based on substantial new research in Virginia and trends found in Medicaid expansion in other states, showed lower costs and much higher savings than previously predicted. Virginia’s cost totaled slightly more than $1.1 billion: $933 million for the state’s share of covering newly-eligible Medicaid patients $100 million for administrative costs $75 million in for adding people who were previously eligible for Medicaid but didn’t apply and came out of the woodwork after expansion $9 million in taxes on premiums for Medicaid expansion enrollees. The report identified multiple avenues of savings totaling $1.7 billion: $1.1 billion from indigent care costs $255 million from covering hospital expenses of state prison inmates through Medicaid expansion $227 million in behavioral health services that the state now pays $139 million in moving poorer pregnant women to Medicaid expansion instead of the state’s insurance program The bottom line is DMAS estimated Medicaid expansion would save the state $604 million through 2022. But the longer the state opts out of expansion, the more those savings decline. It should be noted that the expanded coverage will start to cost the state more than it saves during the next decade when Virginia’s 10 percent contribution to cover the added Medicaid enrollees locks in, according to Secretary of Health William Hazel. The state has not released estimates of those long-term costs but Hazel has called them "manageable." Finally, you may have noticed a huge difference in Kaiser’s and DMAS’s estimates of the amount Virginia would save on indigent care over 10 years: Kaiser said $434 million; DMAS said $1.1 billion. That’s because Kaiser assumed each state would see a 33 percent drop in their indigent costs if it expanded Medicaid. DMAS estimated Virginia would see an 80 percent reduction in that expense. Our ruling Campaign for Liberty says estimates show Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million over the next decade. One forecast indeed showed that: A 2012 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation offering broad estimates of the net cost expansion for each state. Kaiser stressed in the report that it did not examine all of the savings states might realize and said its net projections "should be considered an overestimate of costs or an underestimate of savings." The Campaign for Liberty ignores the most current and detailed study, released in January by Virginia’s Medicaid agency. This report, which examined all avenues for savings based on updated trends, concluded Medicaid expansion would save the state $604 million through 2022. The campaign’s use of the plural "estimates" suggests there’s broad agreement Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million. Not so. So the campaign’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06983	"The [Georgia] General Assembly took away the Atlanta Board of Education’s oversight of the superintendent."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/13/ralph-long/georgia-pol-says-atlanta-school-board-had-no-overs/	An alarming state report released last week blamed teachers, administrators and former Superintendent Beverly Hall for a widespread test-tampering scandal in the Atlanta Public Schools system. The report attracted national headlines and punchlines from some prominent comedians. To our surprise, Ralph Long, a state representative from southwest Atlanta, added another group to the culpability list: the Georgia General Assembly, the body Long currently serves. "The General Assembly took away the Atlanta Board of Education’s oversight of the superintendent," Long, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Long was referring to Senate Bill 204, which passed in 2003, six years before he joined the General Assembly. The bill gave the superintendent the power to hire the school district’s general counsel and chief financial officer. It also imposed ethics guidelines for school administrators and the board. The bill’s chief sponsor: then-Sen. Kasim Reed, who is now Atlanta’s mayor. Long has been critical of Reed’s role in the ongoing school district crisis. Long has accused the mayor, who by law has no oversight of Atlanta schools, of solely serving the interests of the city’s business community and the influential Metro Atlanta Chamber. Long was one of the few public officials to side with Reed’s opponent, Mary Norwood, in the 2009 Atlanta mayoral runoff election, which Reed won by less than 1 percentage point. Reed defended the bill Monday in an interview with Channel 2 Action News. The mayor said it was an effort to streamline operations at a time some community leaders complained the district couldn’t keep a superintendent because of board micromanagement. Reed also took a verbal jab at Long. "He’s looking for 15 minutes of fame out of the awful crisis that’s impacting our children," Reed said. Long defended his point to PolitiFact Georgia, saying the legislation left the board essentially toothless. Stacking the deck, were the words Long used to describe the overwhelming influence that Hall was given over APS. Long said he’s considering a bill that would revive the board’s authority to hire a general counsel and CFO. "The board didn’t have any power," said Long. We wondered if Long’s comments about the bill added up. The state report outlines in exhaustive detail a "culture of fear" inside APS for teachers and administrators to produce higher student scores on statewide tests. Hall was named national superintendent of the year by one influential education group for Atlanta’s markedly improved test scores and higher graduation rates. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned irregularities in some scores as far back as 2001, and ramped up its investigative reporting into the matter over the past two years. The state report concluded 178 educators, including three dozen principals, participated in systematic cheating on state curriculum tests. Nearly half of them confessed to wrongdoing. Senate Bill 204 supporters said the legislation was necessary to insulate the superintendent from micromanaging by the board. Atlanta board member Emmett Johnson, who is still on the nine-member board, made that argument to the AJC in 2003, noting that the city school district had five superintendents in 10 years. The board had overseen the chief financial officer and general counsel positions since the 1970s, as part of the so-called "Atlanta compromise" that brought the city its first black superintendent. Critics worried at the time that board ceded too much of its authority. The bill still gave the board power to fire the superintendent. It also gave the board and the superintendent the dual authority to adopt districtwide academic standards. Additionally, they had the power to track progress toward "student learning goals and the academic content and performance standards." Doesn’t this prove the school board had oversight power? No way, said Long. Long maintained that some board members felt they couldn’t stand up to Hall, who was being supported by Atlanta’s business community, which typically bankrolled winning school board candidates through a political action committee called EduPAC. "That’s a lot of intimidation, and people who don’t recognize that are naive," said Long, who called on Hall to resign in August. Reed said the bill strengthened Hall’s power, but argued the board’s oversight "remained exactly what it was." He said many districts considered it a "best practice" to have the general counsel and CFO report to the superintendent. We talked about this with Warren Fortson, who served as the general counsel to APS for 22 years, until he retired in the early 1990s. Fortson said he argued against SB 204 because "it builds a wall between the board and the administration." Still, he said, the APS board had oversight. Fortson said Long’s claim was too broad. "They have oversight of the superintendent," Fortson said of the APS board. "A board has the authority to call in the superintendent for almost anything." SB 204 gave more authority to the superintendent. However, it still gave the board the oversight authority over the superintendent. The board also had consent power over hiring and firing a CFO (Sec. 4-101) or general counsel (Sec. 2-111). Long said state lawmakers "took away" the Atlanta school board’s oversight of the school superintendent. It did not. But it did somewhat diminish the board’s power. Long’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that we believe would give people a different impression. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05494	Says President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant "we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/17/mike-dovilla/mike-dovilla-claims-obamas-refusal-allow-keystone-/	Both houses of the Ohio General Assembly approved resolutions in the past 10 months urging Congress to ask Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to approve the controversial TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project from Alberta to Oklahoma. The Ohio House acted last June. The Senate passed its resolution in January, as President Obama announced he was putting the project on hold by extending the deadline one year to rule on a permit for pipeline operator TransCanada. One of the sponsors of House Resolution 97, State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea who represents the 18th District, wrote to the Strongsville edition of Patch.com that he would introduce a new resolution supporting the pipeline. Delaying the project hurt U.S. energy security and cost "the ability to create over 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs," he said. Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant "we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump." With the price of gas bubbling under $4 a gallon and becoming a political football, PolitiFact Ohio was interested, immediately, in his statement that permit approval would immediately reduce pump prices. We asked Dovilla's office how he backed it up. They steered us to the U.S. Energy Information Agency and its statement, "The single biggest factor in the price of gasoline is the cost of the crude oil from which it is made." Not approving the pipeline, they said, citing the State Department, would lead to increased imports of oil from unreliable sources, leading to increased speculation that contributes to price fluctuation. Dovilla quoted a memo of last June 22 from the Department of Energy's deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis, saying that Keystone XL would eliminate transportation constraints. "Gasoline prices in all markets served by PADD I and III refiners would decrease, including the Midwest," the memo said. (PADD stands for Petroleum Administration for Defense District. PADD I is the East Coast, PADD III is the Gulf Coast.) Supporting Dovilla's statement that prices would drop immediately, his office cited economist and commentator Larry Kudlow, who asserted in 2008 that oil prices dropped more than 6 percent "on news that President Bush was moving forward with plans to develop new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf despite the fact that the oil would not make it to market for 7 to 10 years." "Oil prices," Dovilla's spokesman said, "will react to an announcement regarding future supply long before that supply is actually delivered." We looked further. We found that the Department of Energy memo of last June came in response to a paper by energy economist Philip Verleger, an adviser to the Ford and Carter administrations, who heads a Colorado consulting firm on oil market economics. Illuminating the debate among industry analysts about Keystone's likely impact, Verleger says the pipeline would increase gas prices, particularly in the upper Midwest, by about 10 cents per gallon. The companies involved with Keystone told Canadian regulators that the pipeline will allow Canadians to manipulate prices and add at least $4 billion to the U.S. fuel bill annually, Verleger said. He called Keystone "a long, torturous way to move crude oil from Canada to China." His assessment was echoed in a report in January from the Cornell University Global Labor Institute and by a new study from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group. Both said that the Keystone XL pipeline is designed to divert heavy crude tar sands oil from the Midwest -- where it has overwhelmed refinery demand and depressed the price of crude -- to Gulf Coast refineries, where much of it can be exported to international markets. They quoted the testimony and studies of TransCanada, the principal company behind the pipeline, in saying that the diversion of heavy crude oil to the Gulf would cut "discounting" in the glutted Midwest and bring Canadian oil producers an added $2 billion to $3.9 billion annually. Our colleagues at the Washington Post's Fact Checker, examining another statement about Keystone XL and gasoline, noted that TransCanada itself makes no claims that the project will reduce prices -- only that it will not increase prices. The company's Keystone XL fact sheet says: "The price of international oil prices has no impact on the operation of our pipeline and we do not profit from changing market changes," TransCanada said. "Prices are set on a global level." Ray Perryman, an economist employed by TransCanada, told Forbes magazine that the pipeline would bring down gasoline prices by 3.5 cents to 4 cents a gallon once fully operational. Moody's, the investment ratings firm, had a lower estimate: 1.6 cents per gallon. Even those small reductions would not come until the pipeline was operational, however. The Fact Checker, which was examining the question of whether Keystone XL would lower prices at all, said: "We could not find any experts to say that the prospect of the pipeline being built in the future would somehow impact the price of gasoline today." That would seem to settle the question of whether the pipeline's approval would reduce prices immediately -- except for Dovilla's citation of Larry Kudlow about President Bush influencing prices in 2008. What happened then? In July 2008, Bush lifted a presidential ban on offshore oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf that was established by his father. It carried symbolic and political significance in an election year, but had no immediate effect on exploration because of prohibitions by Congress against offshore drilling. Petroleum prices did drop, but they were continuing what was becoming a dramatic retreat from record high prices. Energy analysts and economists pointed to one reason for it: recession. "Oil markets, analysts said, have been spun around by lower consumption in a U.S. economy weakened by financial instability and by a change in sentiment among financial players, many of whom are scurrying to stem losses or protect much-needed capital," the Washington Post reported at the time. "The overwhelming cause of the collapse in oil prices has been the faltering world economy, which has fueled the drop in consumption," the Post reported. In other words, Bush's announcement was coincidental but not causative. Energy analyst Joseph M. Dukert, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former president of the U.S. Association for Energy Economics, expressed it more plainly to the liberal research group Media Matters when it looked at a similar claim: "Most energy economists applauded President Bush's action in regard to offshore drilling," he said, "but suggesting that this 'caused' the precipitous drop in global oil prices is akin to the rooster's boast that his crowing brought the sun up." Even former Bush White House chief economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin discounted a president's impact on oil prices: "You can‘t change the oil price very much with the U.S. exploration. It certainly can‘t change it quickly," he said in a television discussion. And that returns us to the statement that Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant "we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump." We found debate among oil analysts over the effect the pipeline would have on gasoline prices, especially in the Midwest, where some expect it would drive prices up. And while estimates varied, our research (and that by our colleagues at the Washington Post) found that those experts didn’t expect there would a price impact until after the pipeline were built. Even TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, expressed doubts about any price impact, and an economist with the company projected that wouldn’t happen until after the line was operational. That’s a far cry from Dovilla’s claim of immediacy. On the Truth-O-Meter, Dovilla’s claim rates False.	None	Mike Dovilla	None	None	None	2012-04-17T06:00:00	2012-03-13	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06120	"After filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island, we reached an agreement with state agencies that resulted in more voters being registered in the first full month after our lawsuit than in the entire previous two-year reporting period."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/29/eric-holder/us-attorney-general-eric-holder-says-more-voters-w/	President Obama has made it clear that he believes in the importance of the Voting Rights Act. His administration has signaled its intent to enforce the federal act as states make changes to their laws to require voters to present identification before casting ballots. In a recent speech in Austin, Texas, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the Department of Justice is reviewing recent changes to state laws to determine whether they comply with the Voting Rights Act. Speaking at the presidential library of Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the landmark act into law in 1965, Holder said that his agency is obligated to ensure the country’s election systems are free of discrimination and are more, not less, accessible to citizens. He cited the outcome of one lawsuit as an example of the effectiveness of the Justice Department’s work in enforcing the Voting Rights Act. "For example, after filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island, we reached an agreement with state agencies that resulted in more voters being registered in the first full month after our lawsuit than in the entire previous two-year reporting period," Holder said in the Dec. 13 speech. More voters registered in Rhode Island in a single month than in the previous two years? Really? First, some context. This year, a slew of states passed controversial new voting laws in an effort, according to proponents, to combat fraud. Critics, however, say the laws, which require voters to present identification before casting ballots, will deter the poor and minorities from voting. The list includes Rhode Island. Under the state’s new law, starting in 2012, voters will have to show some form of identification. By 2014, they will have to show a valid photo ID, or cast provisional ballots that will only count if their signatures match their voter registration cards. In the speech, Holder referred to the many new voter identification laws enacted around the country, but, to be clear, the lawsuit against Rhode Island had nothing to do with that issue. In fact, Rhode Island’s law was passed by the General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Chafee after the federal lawsuit was resolved. We contacted the Justice Department, which gave us some information on the lawsuit. Under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, all states are required to provide voter registration at motor vehicle departments and at state agencies that offer public assistance programs or programs for people with disabilities. The aim of the law, which came to be known as "Motor Voter," is to offer low-income citizens the same ability to participate in elections as more affluent Americans. The lawsuit, filed March 18, 2011, by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, alleged that four Rhode Island state agencies failed to provide voter registration and therefore failed to comply with the federal law. The agencies are the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals. In an interview, Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said that although voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles has been thriving -- more new voters are registered there than anywhere else in the state -- the four social services agencies had indeed failed to offer voter registration to people who had applied for services. He attributed the failing to the departure of the employee at the Board of Elections who supervised the program. That person’s duties were passed on to another worker, but monitoring of the four agencies somehow fell through the cracks and the number of voter registrations dropped, said Kando. On March 25, just a week after the lawsuit was filed, the state and the Justice Department reached an agreement to resuscitate the program and improve supervision of voter registration efforts at the agencies. At the heart of the consent decree is an order for workers at the agencies to distribute voter registration forms with each application for services, recertification, renewal or change of address request. Under the two-year agreement, the state is also required to supply the Justice Department with voter registration numbers from the agencies. It was those numbers that Holder used as the basis for his claim in the speech in Texas. Kando gave us the same numbers. In the two-year reporting period before the lawsuit was filed, a total of 457 voter registration forms were submitted by the four social services agencies. The lawsuit was filed in March 2011, so the first full month afterward was April. The Board of Elections received 1,038 voter registration forms that month from the four agencies. That’s more than twice as many as in 2009 and 2010 combined. Out of curiosity, we asked Kando what registrations at the agencies have been like since April. In May, 1,346 voter registration forms were filed, followed by 891 in June and 896 in July. Kando said that he would expect the numbers to drop because the agencies have many repeat visitors. But it’s clear that many voters have been signed up at the agencies since the lawsuit. Our ruling This one’s pretty straightforward. In his speech, Holder said that more voters were registered in the first month after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island for violations of the National Voter Registration Act than in the two years beforehand. Our research confirmed Holder’s numbers. We vote for a ruling of True on this claim. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-05705	"The fact is 90-percent of Down Syndrome children were aborted in this country."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/08/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-says-90-percent-down-syndrome-pregnanc/	Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine caused quite a ripple in the Republican presidential primary race when he dropped his endorsement of Mitt Romney and threw his support behind Rick Santorum. Santorum’s holds some conservative views, especially when it comes to women’s reproductive rights. He opposes birth control and abortion. Enter DeWine, who served with Santorum in the United States Senate and became a close friend. Now that he is backing him, DeWine found himself trying to calm the flames left behind by Santorum as he stomped through Ohio for the March 6 GOP primary. DeWine appeared Feb. 20 on MSNBC’s "The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell" and was asked about Santorum’s assertion that amniocentesis, a prenatal screening test, directly leads to an increase in the number of abortions. Santorum had made the claim earlier that day on the campaign trail in Ohio. Would DeWine advise Santorum to stop talking about amniocentesis, O’Donnell asked. DeWine responded he would not, adding that Santorum was correct. "The fact is 90-percent of Down syndrome children were aborted in this country," DeWine responded. "Maybe some people don’t think that is a problem. I’m shocked by it. I think it’s a sad commentary. And what he was simply saying is the government should not compel every insurance policy that is written to cover that." DeWine went on to share a personal story, saying that his wife declined prenatal testing during her eighth pregnancy when the doctor told her that if problems were detected with the fetus that abortion could be an option. "My wife said, ‘no, I’m not going to do that,’ " DeWine said. DeWine’s 90-percent figure caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. His claim is similar to one made by state Rep. Richard Corcoran during a debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives. Politifact Florida checked Corcoran’s statement in April 2011 and rated it True. More recently, PolitiFact national rated a similar comment from Santorum. After finding some additional information about the data, Santorum’s claim got a rating of Half True. We’ve incorporated that data here. Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used — that "about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion." The story linked to a 1999 study from the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King’s College in London which discussed abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. It compiled results from 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. Other studies showed similar percentages. A study from Wayne State University in Michigan examined 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97 and found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96 and found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent. That data was cited to rate Corcoran’s statement. However, in additional research for the Santorum comment and for this article, PolitiFact found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried. A joint statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies. "No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists," the statement said. "Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives." Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors. "In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so," Evans said. "In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent" in some cases. The issue is addressed, too, in a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine titled "Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome." The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that "almost 100 percent" of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity. "First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics," the paper said. "Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities." There is an element of truth in DeWine’s claim. A number of studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent. But all of those studies were localized. And we found experts who cautioned against applying that kind of research to the country as a whole, as DeWine did. And DeWine’s comment was broader than Corcoran’s or Santorum’s and broader than what was encompassed in the studies. Corcoran and Santorum specifically referred to cases in which there was a Down syndrome diagnosis. That also was the focus of the research. In the interview, DeWine was asked about Santorum’s comments about pre-natal screenings and abortion. But his claim, that it’s a fact that "90-percent of Down syndrome children were aborted in this country," made no such mention of screenings and a Down Syndrome diagnosis. His statement would also include, for example, Down syndrome children born to mothers who had no prenatal testing. That’s a critical fact that would give a different impression of the accuracy of his claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s statement rates Mostly False.

pomt-07340	When "the governor announced his ‘jobs budget,’ 99 folks from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/11/nina-turner/state-sen-nina-turner-says-99-state-workers-lost-j/	Ohio law requires the state to keep its budget in balance. But it's up to the governor and the General Assembly to figure out how to do it and how the burdens of the balancing act should be shared. Gov. John Kasich took the lead in that process with what he called the "jobs budget," a spending blueprint that includes cuts to local governments and school districts and to state agencies to close an $800 billion budget shortfall. Kasich unveiled his spending plan March 15, 2011. At a public forum at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square, State Sen. Nina Turner said she feared the governor was "balancing the budget on the backs of employees" and would impair the government's ability to provide services. When "the governor announced his 'jobs budget,' 99 folks from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day," she said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. On March 16, the state said it will close seven regional Taxpayer Service Centers on June 30 -- the end of the fiscal year -- resulting in the loss of nearly 100 jobs. Tax Commissioner Joe Testa sent e-mail notices to employees at regional Taxpayer Service Centers in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, Youngstown and Zanesville. The Columbus center will remain open. Workers in the Cleveland office told The Plain Dealer the closings are a mistake that will hurt taxpayers and hurt tax revenue. But the tax department said the revenues are about half of the $7 million the state will save. Testa said the offices have only a fraction of the calls and walk-in traffic they once did. We asked the governor's office about the job cuts. "It's in the context of what we want to do with the budget as a whole," spokesman Rob Nichols said. "We inherited an $8 billion budget hole. We had the seventh-highest taxes in the nation last year." The closing of the service centers is in line with a promise the governor made during his campaign: to shrink state government and make it more efficient. "This budget presents a spending blueprint that Ohio taxpayers can finally afford," Nichols said. "We can't keep doing what we're doing and expect to succeed in this state." Whether closing the tax service centers and laying off workers is a good idea is a question for someone else to answer. But Kasich is doing it.

pomt-07530	For the first time in U.S. history, a personal inaction will be deemed unlawful -- not purchasing a health-insurance plan	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/06/ron-johnson/us-sen-ron-johnson-says-federal-health-care-law-fi/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently revisited a favored theme -- predicting harmful consequences if "government-led" health care takes full effect under the bill Democrats pushed through in 2010. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the junior senator from Wisconsin added a new twist, saying the law would make history by requiring individuals to purchase an insurance plan: "For the first time in U.S. history, a personal inaction (not purchasing something, in this case, a health- insurance plan) will be deemed unlawful," Johnson’s piece said. "The person not committing this act (or is it committing an inaction?) will be subject to a fine. Or is it now, as the government contends, a tax? I'm confused." That’s a pretty sweeping claim. After all, all of U.S. history goes back 235 years. And its seems like there are other penalties for not doing something, such as buying auto insurance. We asked Johnson communications director Mary Vought for support for the senator’s claim. She acknowledged there are other examples but said "we’re not aware of any other requirement as broad as this. The 2010 health care law requires every American to purchase health insurance as a condition of being alive and a human being." Johnson is referring to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- which the GOP derisively labels ObamaCare. It does call for monetary penalties against taxpayers who fail to get health coverage. The tax penalties would be collected by the IRS. That mandate is being challenged in court as unconstitutional and likely headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. But that is far from the only example where there is a penalty for not doing something. We mentioned auto insurance, a requirement in most states. There is the requirement that males register for Selective Service at age 18. At various levels of government, there are requirements to pay taxes, clear snow from your sidewalk, install a smoke detector and show up for jury duty, to name a few. All carry penalties for inaction. A spirited debate has taken place over how they compare to the health care mandate. Anup Malani, a University of Chicago law professor, and Henry Aaron, a health care expert at Brookings Institution, listed several instances where legal mandates penalize inaction. They contrasted them with the health care purchase mandate this way: Military and jury duty are political duties. Auto insurance requirements are state mandates. The health care law and others requiring businesses to purchase safety equipment are consumption duties -- they involve a purchase. Critics contend the health care mandate would lead to unlimited government power under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. "Can the government compel you to buy broccoli or buy membership in a health club?" asked Roger Pilon, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies. "The other side can’t come up with any credible argument as to why the government couldn’t do this once you’ve opened the door." Two state attorneys general, Richard Cordray and Tom Miller, took the opposing view at Politico.com. "We live under mandates every day. Without them, society as we know it would disintegrate... "We can -- and do -- argue about what shape these laws should take, without claiming that our leaders are constitutionally barred from dealing with our most pressing problems." Let’s take a closer look at Johnson’s statement. If Johnson had limited his statement to federal penalties under the Commerce Clause for not purchasing a product, that would likely be unprecedented. Pilon and Malani agreed that there is no precedent for the feds using the Commerce Clause to compel an individual to buy a product from a private vendor, under penalty of law. Although it’s dated, a 1994 Congressional Budget Office paper on an earlier proposal to mandate purchase of insurance concluded that "the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States." But that’s not what Johnson wrote -- and his office did not seek to limit the meaning. His statement was much broader, making the comparison to a whole range of duties under local, state and federal law and the constitution. Vought, Johnson’s spokeswoman, said the health mandate trumps all other existing mandates because it is universal. Vought wrote: "Some Americans are not required to file a tax return, because they fall below a minimum income threshold. Millions of Americans are not required to purchase auto insurance, or wear a seat belt, because they do not own a car." But the health care mandate itself has exemptions, so it will not be as broad in practice as Johnson maintains. Taxpayers who can’t afford it, can’t get health coverage or object on religious grounds can be held harmless from penalties even if they lack "minimum essential" coverage, according to a Congressional Research Service summary. Let’s wrap up. Johnson, in a bold and broad claim, says the health care mandate is unprecedented in imposing penalties for failure to get insured. But experts agree there is already a long list of "personal inactions" penalized by the government, such as failure to buy auto insurance or attend jury duty. And Johnson’s contention that the health mandate is broader than all the other mandates -- even if true -- doesn’t negate that fact. This merits a False.

pomt-03408	"(T)he United States government and its Constitution says that people can be put to death."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/01/jimmy-carter/carter-correct-death-penalty-claim/	Former President Jimmy Carter, in preparation for a conference in Atlanta, recently gave an interview in which he highlighted his opposition to the death penalty. "The Carter Center and I personally are very deeply opposed to the death penalty," he told Time magazine. "But when the United States government and its Constitution says that people can be put to death, that sets an example of extreme violence that very few other developed, industrialized nations would have." With all of the debate about capital punishment in recent years, PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the former president was correct about the Constitution and the death penalty. Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27-29 at his Presidential Center in Atlanta. The conference focused on improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, was scheduled as a speaker. Carter cites the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution for his argument that the death penalty should be considered unconstitutional, said Deanna Congileo, a spokeswoman for Carter. There’s plenty of debate about what that amendment says about the Constitution, which we’ll visit later in this article. As for whether the U.S. government says people can be put to death, there’s a long history of federal executions. There have been 37 federal prisoners executed since 1927, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The most notable U.S. execution took place in June 2001, when Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing that killed 168 people, was executed by lethal injection in a federal prison in Indiana. The last federal execution was in 2003. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has authorized several death penalty prosecutions since he took office in 2009. In 2011, he revised some procedures on how federal prosecutors can consider death penalty cases. Now, does the Constitution say people can be put to death? There’s healthy legal debate among scholars and jurists concerning that argument. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says no one can be held for a capital crime "except by due process of law." Death penalty proponents say that language confirms its legality. Capital punishment opponents contend the words "cruel and unusual punishments inflicted" in the Eighth Amendment is an indictment of the death penalty and its legality. The state of Georgia has been the genesis for many of the questions concerning whether the Constitution allows the death penalty, with two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings, one occurring when Carter was elected president in 1976. In the 1972 case, Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court concluded that the arbitrary application of the death penalty and the disproportionate number of minorities that were executed made the death penalty "unusual." By declining to rule that capital punishment was unconstitutional in and of itself, however, the Supreme Court left the door open for state legislatures to draw more narrowly construed death penalty statutes. In 1976, Georgia's newly written death penalty statute was challenged before the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia. This time, Georgia won. The Supreme Court ruled the death penalty could be used under careful conditions. The website ProCon.org highlights the dispute. It contains a quote from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan disagreeing with the Gregg v. Georgia ruling, saying it violated the Eighth Amendment. Brennan later expressed his moral objections to the death penalty. Next to Brennan’s quote on the website is a quote from the current chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. In a 2008 ruling, Roberts wrote that a method of execution "cannot be viewed as probative of the wanton infliction of pain under the Eighth Amendment." To sum up, Carter claimed the federal government and the U.S. Constitution say people can be put to death. The U.S. attorney general’s office has guidelines on prosecuting such cases, and the Supreme Court has ruled capital punishment can be employed under the Constitution, although there is still much discussion about its interpretation.

pomt-10859	"I built that border fence in San Diego...and it reduced the smuggling of people and drugs...by 90 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/03/duncan-hunter/his-numbers-are-right-but-actual-impact-of-fence-u/	No, he didn't really build the fence himself, but we don't think anybody thinks that's what he meant. And he was instrumental in securing the funding to have the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers get the work done. It also is true that building the first strong fence along the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego in the early 1990s, and strengthening it at the end of the decade, did coincide with a sharp drop in apprehension of illegal immigrants in the westernmost area of the U.S.-Mexico border. But analysts dispute to what extent these changes can be attributed to the border fence. Hunter is correct that smuggling along the San Diego-Tijuana corridor dramatically decreased when the fence started to go up. Border Patrol apprehensions at the Imperial Beach station, the most secure point along the fence, dropped from 321,560 in 1993 to 19,035 in 2004, a decrease of 94 percent over the 12-year period. But apprehensions along the entire San Diego County section of the border, which does not have a continuous secure fence, dropped sharply, too -- 79 percent between 1996 and 2002. Meanwhile, apprehensions in the neighboring fenceless El Centro County shot up during the same period. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the federal government, notes that opponents of the fence say there is no way of measuring how many smugglers go through the area without being apprehended. CRS says those same critics also point to other factors, such as a doubling of the number of border patrol agents in the same period that might have deterred illegal crossings. Hunter is also mostly correct about his pivotal role in the construction of both the first fence along the 14-mile stretch between San Diego and Tijuana (begun in 1990) and the subsequent strengthening of the fence. He snagged the funding for the first fence in the early 1990s, then wrote the law authorizing funding for two additional layers in 1996.

pomt-07271	"For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country. I actually did it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/24/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-minnesota-governor-he-kept-state/	When Tim Pawlenty announced his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he touted his record as a two-term governor of Minnesota. He portrayed himself as a fiscal conservative and said he had been successful at lowering Minnesota’s tax burden. "For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country," Pawlenty said. "I actually did it." To check his claim, we turned to statistics from the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group that has assembled annual studies of state taxes for decades. The foundation tracks tax burden rankings among the 50 states going back to 1977. The foundation combines state and local tax burdens by counting items defined as taxes by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal statistical agency. A ranking of 1 means the heaviest tax burden, while 50 means the lowest. Pawlenty (R) 2009: 7th 2008: 11th 2007: 11th 2006: 11th 2005: 15th 2004: 16th 2003: 17th Gov. Jesse Ventura (I) 2002: 12th 2001: 14th 2000: 12th 1999: 8th Gov. Arne Carlson (R) 1998: 11th 1997: 7th 1996: 8th 1995: 8th 1994: 10th 1993: 10th 1992: 11th 1991: 9th Gov. Rudy Perpich (D) (second and third terms) 1990: 5th 1989: 6th 1988: 5th 1987: 9th 1986: 10th 1985: 5th 1984: 3rd 1983: 5th Gov. Al Quie (R) 1982: 10th 1981: 11th 1980: 9th 1979: 7th Gov. Rudy Perpich (D) (first term) 1978: 10th 1977: 10th (The 2009 figures are the latest available.) Now let’s take a closer look at four key questions: -- Did Pawlenty keep Minnesota out of the top 10? Largely, yes. Under Pawlenty, Minnesota ranked in the top 10 highest-taxed states for only one of the seven years where data is available. It never ranked lower than 17th, but that’s still enough to make this part of Pawlenty’s claim mostly accurate. -- Was Pawlenty the first governor to push the state out of the top 10? No. Pawlenty did indeed stand firm against tax increases, but his immediate predecessor, third-party Gov. Jesse Ventura, was really the first to cut income and property taxes, said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn. According to the Tax Foundation data, Minnesota was out of the top 10 for three of the four years Ventura served as governor. Pawlenty largely continued this achievement, and he presided over an even lower ranking for his first three years in office. But Ventura deserves some credit for making it happen initially. "The major momentum occurred under Ventura," Schultz said. -- Did Pawlenty achieve the lower ranking on his own? No. As in other states, Minnesota's tax policies are shaped by negotiations between the governor and the legislature. So any credit, or blame, for tax policy should be shared between the governor and the legislature. The Minnesota Senate was controlled by the Democrats during Pawlenty’s entire term. The Minnesota House was Republican-held for the first four years of Pawlenty’s term and Democratic-held for the final four years. -- Had Minnesota been in the top 10 highest-taxed states for decades? Basically, yes. Prior to Ventura, Minnesota ranked lower than 10th for only three years out of 22, under governors of both parties. And during those three years, Minnesota barely edged out of the top 10, ranking 11th. We should note that an Associated Press fact check came to a different conclusion than we did. The AP wrote that "Minnesota remains among the 10 worst states in its overall tax climate, according to the Tax Foundation. In its 2011 State Business Tax Climate Index, the anti-tax organization ranks Minnesota 43rd, making it the eighth worst state. The ranking slipped from 41st two years earlier. The index considers corporate, individual, sales, unemployment insurance and property taxes." However, we see nothing in Pawlenty’s statement to suggest that he was talking only about business taxes. The data we used encompass a broader variety of taxes. When we asked Richard Morrison, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, to check with his group to see which measurement seemed more appropriate for Pawlenty’s comment, he agreed with us. So we’re sticking with our measurement. So to recap, we conclude that Pawlenty did have an almost perfect record of keeping Minnesota out of the top 10 list for highest-taxed states. And he’s right that three of his predecessors, in both parties, failed to achieve what he did to any significant degree. But when he says that "for decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest taxed states in the country," he ignores that Ventura achieved this in the three years before Pawlenty became governor.

pomt-02935	"If I have affordable coverage in my workplace, I'm not eligible to go into the marketplace. ... It’s illegal."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/30/kathleen-sebelius/sebelius-says-she-not-eligible-exchange-because-i-/	Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before Congress Oct. 30 for the first time since the federal health care marketplaces went online, answering questions about problems with the website and facing accusations that President Barack Obama lied to the American people about who could keep their health care plan. At the tail end of three and a half hours of testimony, Sebelius had a testy exchange with Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who asked the secretary why she wasn’t enrolling in the exchanges herself. "If I have affordable coverage in my workplace, I'm not eligible to go into the marketplace. ... It’s illegal," she said. The Twittersphere lit up after Sebelius’ remarks, questioning whether they were valid. Even the government’s own website instructs people with job-based insurance that "if you'd like to explore marketplace coverage options you can." So was Sebelius right and the Obamacare website wrong, or vice versa? Given the vast amount of misinformation circulating around the health care law and the insurance marketplaces, we thought it necessary to straighten this out. Employer insurance vs. Medicare We went right to the source on this one, asking the Department of Health and Human Services if Sebelius misspoke. It turns out she did. Individuals who have health insurance through their employer can sign up for the online marketplaces, it’s just not financially beneficial for most to do so. If an individual forgoes affordable insurance through work, he or she won’t qualify for subsidies to help pay for insurance on the government-run marketplaces. And plans purchased through an employer are typically cheaper because the company is paying a portion of the costs. A spokeswoman for the department said Sebelius meant to say, "Marketplace plans cannot be sold to a Medicare enrollee, and the secretary is a Medicare enrollee." While Sebelius receives health benefits from her government job, as of May, she is also 65 years old and therefore eligible for free Medicare Part A, which covers hospital visits. She can couple those benefits with her employer insurance, but according to guidelines released Oct. 4 by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, "it is illegal to knowingly sell or issue a Qualified Health Plan to a Medicare beneficiary" on the government-run insurance marketplaces. That hasn’t always been clear, said David Lipschutz, a policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Nothing in the Affordable Care Act mentions whether Medicare enrollees are eligible for the health insurance marketplaces, he said, but the administration lately has cited a section of the Social Security Act also known as the Medicare Anti-Duplication provision that bars private insurance companies from offering coverage to Medicare enrollees. There are some exceptions. A small fraction of individuals who are not eligible for free Medicare Part A and those with end stage renal disease can still buy insurance on the exchanges and receive federal subsidies. Neither of those situations apply to Sebelius. Hypothetically, Sebelius could abandon her government health care plan and get out of Medicare Part A. But that would require her to revoke and forfeit her Social Security benefits for the rest of her life, something we can’t envision anyone volunteering to do. "It’s really not going to be an option to drop it in order to get into an exchange," said Andrea Callow, also a policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Our ruling It’s pretty clear Sebelius was wrong when she said "it’s illegal" for her to buy insurance on the exchange because she already has affordable insurance through her employer. Those inclined to do so certainly can, though the financial incentives to stay with the employer-based plan are quite convincing. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-00154	"The KKK was formed by the Democratic Party."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/24/blog-posting/no-democratic-party-didnt-create-klu-klux-klan/	President Donald Trump has faced criticism for normalizing white nationalists but some conservative bloggers are trying to flip the script, shooing the Klu Klux Klan out of the "Big Tent" and into liberal territory. "I hate when people aren’t smart enough to realize that the KKK was formed by the Democratic Party," reads a Facebook post from Oct. 11, 2017. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though the post is a year old, it continues to circulate online, generating nearly 27,000 shares and 840 comments, many as recently as a day ago. "Just so you know," the post goes on, "the Klu Klux Klan’s original purpose was to oppose the Republican Party’s policies intended to establish economic and political equality for blacks (sic) folks after the Civil War." Facebook isn’t the only place this idea has spread. Back in 2013, Virginia State Sen. Stephen Martin also claimed that the KKK was created by Democrats. The Republican lawmaker soon retracted the statement after after PolitiFact Virginia started to investigate the origins of the KKK. Reporter Sean Gorman discovered then that the group’s founding is murky but that "historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South." One historian confirmed there’s a historic link between the Democrats and the KKK: Many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats, and some joined the KKK. But according to J. Michael Martinez, who wrote the 2007 book "Carpetbaggers, Cavalry and the KKK," it’s misleading to say the Democratic Party founded the Klan. It was a more of a grassroots creation, Martinez said. Plus, the Democratic Party of the past is not the Democratic Party of today. From the 1930s onward, "you think of the Democratic Party being considered the party of the disenfranchised," he said. Carole Emberton, an associated professor at the University of Buffalo, agreed. "Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to the white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964," she said. Back in the mid-19th century, various Klans in the South acted as a "strong arm" for many local Democratic politicians, Emberton said. The Confederate general believed to be the KKK’s first Grand Dragon even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention. By the time the Civil Rights Act became law, the Democratic Party supported so-called liberal causes that "had been the banner of the Republican Party." While some Democrats supported the KKK, there’s no evidence the group was founded by their political party. And context matters—the anti-black Democratic Party of yore is not the party that Hillary Clinton belongs to today. We rate this statement False.

pomt-06193	Says Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, "put into place socialized medicine."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/11/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-former-mass-gov-mitt-romney-/	Hey, Massachusetts, did you know you've got socialized medicine? Michele Bachmann said so at the Dec. 10, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Iowa. "If you look at Mitt Romney as the governor of Massachusetts, he's the only governor that put into place socialized medicine," she said, making the case that she's the only "proven constitutional conservative" in the race for the GOP nomination. Is that true? Did Romney, as governor, "put into place socialized medicine"? What Bachmann said Bachmann mentioned "socialized medicine" more than once in the Iowa debate, once referring to her fight against "Obamacare." ("Our country was going to lose because of socialized medicine.") Earlier, she marshaled the phrase to attack Romney during a short speech against the dangers of "Newt Romney." Texas Rep. Ron Paul railed against Newt Gingrich for lacking conservative consistency and taking taxpayer money as a consultant for Freddie Mac. Debate moderator George Stephanopoulos invited Bachman to jump in: STEPHANOPOULOS: "Let me bring Congresswoman Bachmann in on this because you made similar accusations against Speaker Gingrich. You called him the poster boy of crony capitalism. Did he answer your concerns?" BACHMANN: "Well, when you're talking about taking over $100 million, and when your office is on the Rodeo Drive of Washington, D.C., which is K Street, and you're taking money to influence the outcome of legislation in Washington, that's the epitome of the establishment. That's the epitome of a constant insider. But your question was, who's the proven constitutional conservative in this race? And that would be me. I'm 55 years old. I've spent 50 years in the real world as a private business woman, living real life and building a real business. But you have to take a look at the candidates that are on the stage. You started out with Mitt Romney and with Newt Gingrich, asking them about whether or not they're the conservative in this race. But you have to take a look. When you look at Newt Gingrich, for 20 years he's been advocating for the individual mandate in health care. That's longer than Barack Obama. If you look at Mitt Romney as the governor of Massachusetts, he's the only governor that put into place socialized medicine. No other governor did. " Was Romney's state health care law "socialized medicine"? 'Socialized medicine' vs. Romneycare The phrase "socialized medicine" refers to health systems where the government owns and operates delivery and financing of health care, according to Princeton economics professor Uwe E. Reinhardt. Dictionary definitions are somewhat broader, such as Merriam-Webster's definition that "medical and hospital services for the members of a class or population administered by an organized group (as a state agency) and paid for from funds obtained usually by assessments, philanthropy, or taxation." But in context, the idea is the same. In a socialized medical system in the state of Massachusetts, the government would administer medical services using tax dollars. That's the way, for example, that the military and Veterans Administration operate. PolitiFact has regularly explored details of Romney's health care law, especially as it compares with the federal health care law signed by President Barack Obama. As PolitiFact writer Angie Drobnic Holan has written, both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. The key here is that Romney's plan left in place private employer-provided insurance. Here's some greater detail on Romney's plan from previous PolitiFact work. Notice the focus on private health insurance, employer-provided insurance and the private insurance market. Even with Medicaid, in which the government pays for care, it doesn't provide it: • Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two. • Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. The federal law sets the requirement for companies at 50 employees. • Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. The exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premiums. • Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a decreasing scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. • Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. • Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. They handle the individual and small-group markets differently. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. We asked Bachmann's campaign for support for her claim but didn't hear back. Our ruling "Socialized medicine," describes some health systems in place in the United States, such as those for veterans and active-duty military. But changes to Massachusetts health care under Romney don't begin to approach government-paid and government-provided care. The Massachusetts plan relies, in fact, on the same private employer-based health insurance system most Americans are familiar with. That's so different from "socialized medicine" — practically the other end of the public-private spectrum — that Bachmann's use of the label is, frankly, ridiculous.

pomt-14927	"Under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-median-wage-women-has-dropped-733-un/	Facing the possibility of a historic female presidential candidacy by Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz sought to puncture the notion that Democratic policies have been good for women. "Under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733," Cruz said during the CNBC Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo. Have female workers really fared so poorly under Obama? We took a closer look at the earnings numbers for working women and found that Cruz’s claim is off. The statistic closest to the one Cruz mentioned is calculated by the Census Bureau -- the median wage or salary for workers who are paid through wages or salaries. The bureau breaks those figures down by gender and adjusts the figures for inflation in order to enable comparisons across time. In 2008, the last year before Obama took office, the median for women was $28,574. By 2014, that had risen to $29,098 in inflation-adjusted dollars. That’s an increase of $524 over six years -- not a decline of $733, as Cruz said. So Cruz is wrong using the most obvious benchmark. But he would have been on safer ground if he had said "income" rather than "wages," as he intended to do, Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, confirmed to PolitiFact. The Census Bureau separately calculates inflation-adjusted median income by gender. By this measure, the figure for women in 2008 was $22,945. By 2014, that had fallen to $22,240 -- a decline of $705, which is close to what Cruz said. The wages-and-salaries statistic only includes gross employer compensation of employees. By contrast, the income statistic takes in a much larger mix of income flows, including commissions, bonuses, tips, self-employment income, interest, dividends, rental and royalty income, income from estates and trusts, Social Security and public assistance, child support and alimony, and unemployment and retirement benefits. Cruz specifically mentioned wages, which makes his statement less accurate. Another wrinkle undercuts the relevance of the income statistic. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said the wages-and-salaries statistic only applies to the 72 million-plus women undertaking paid work. The income figure applies to every woman over the age of 15 -- more than 112 million in all. Since Cruz referenced wages -- which are earned from work -- he seems to be talking about bad economic trends for working women. Given this, Burtless said, "I’m not sure why the median income number is relevant." A lot of the 112 million with income of any kind are homemakers or retired, he said, and with the aging of the baby boom generation, lots of women (and men) are retiring from jobs and beginning to draw Social Security or pensions that don’t pay as much as their old jobs did. This could be the source of the decline in income, even as wages are rising for the smaller group of working women. Our ruling Cruz said that "under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733." That's wrong. Wages actually have risen for women since Obama took office. Cruz's spokesperson said Cruz intended to use a different phrase. But at PolitiFact, we say words matter. The statement is not accurate and we rate it False.

pomt-04601	Says "if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/20/jon-runyan/jon-runyan-says-if-nothing-done-stop-700-billion-c/	Medicare’s finances face a troubled future and according to U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan, the national health care law is hastening the program’s decline. Runyan, who is running for another term against Democrat Shelley Adler on Nov. 6, sounded his warning in an interview posted online on Sept. 17 with Townsquare Media New Jersey. Runyan (R-3rd Dist.) said, "for those of you that are still in the workforce and have the ability to manage for retirement, we have to have a serious discussion on how to preserve Medicare for the long haul because if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams." Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- what some call Obamacare -- taking money from Medicare and endangering parts of the program, as Runyan suggests? There are several problems with that claim. The law reduces future growth in Medicare costs by $716 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that money isn’t cut from Medicare’s current budget and spending will continue to increase. It’s worth noting that Runyan voted for a Republican budget that also included those spending reductions. But the larger issue is Runyan’s suggestion that those reductions harm Medicare. The opposite is true. Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, called Runyan’s statement "absolute nonsense." First, Medicare isn’t going away, Oberlander said. "Second, Obamacare improves Medicare’s benefits and its financial condition." Two trust funds pay for Medicare. One of the funds is in good financial shape. When Runyan said certain Medicare accounts would go away, he’s referring to the fund for Medicare Part A, which pays for hospital care. That fund is in trouble; an April Medicare Trustees report said it will run out of assets and be unable to meet all of its obligations by 2024. Even then, if nothing is done, the Medicare Trustees project the fund will take in enough revenue to meet 87 percent of its obligations in 2024. But the trustees note that "in practice, Congress has never allowed a Medicare trust fund to exhaust its assets." Runyan’s campaign spokesman, Chris Russell, said that once the fund "can no longer cover the costs of the benefits it’s supposed to provide, then something needs to give. If it's allowed to get to that point, you will either need to slash benefits or raise taxes to keep it fully intact. That's [Runyan’s] point." Still, the fund will not disappear in less than 10 years. But more importantly, without the Affordable Care Act that fund would be in even worse condition. The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the health care law would boost spending in Medicare Part A by $517 billion, in part by restoring future increases in payments to hospitals. If the law is repealed, the fund would be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2016, eight years earlier than if the law stays in place. That’s because spending would increase and new revenues dedicated to the fund would be eliminated, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Our ruling Runyan said, "if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams." This statement is misleading on several fronts. The health care law decreases growth in future Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years. It does not cut that amount from the current Medicare budget. Analysts project one of the trust funds that pay for Medicare services will be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2024, but the fund would still cover some benefits. Without the Affordable Care Act, the fund would be exhausted in 2016. For those reasons, we rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12812	"If you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/10/john-patrick/labor-leader-says-minimum-wage-workers-families-ea/	Pitching for a bump in the minimum wage, a labor leader suggested a hike could save all Texans money by elevating low-income workers who’d no longer need government help. We don’t know about that. But we flipped on the Texas Truth-O-Meter after John Patrick, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said at a January 2017 Capitol press conference: "If you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps." Really? "Food stamps" is an outdated term referring to food benefits available to income-eligible residents through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Beneficiaries purchase food and groceries using electronic benefit transfer cards. Nationally on average in 2015, about 45.8 million people in 22.5 million households monthly participated in SNAP, according to the federal government, and because benefits are available to most low-income households, participants represent a broad cross-section of the nation's poor. A November 2016 U.S. Department of Agriculture report states that in the year, 55 percent of SNAP households with children included people with jobs. Still, the average gross income of participating households was $786 a month, the report says, which breaks out to $9,432 a year. We asked the Texas AFL-CIO for the basis of Patrick’s claim. By email, spokesman Ed Sills said a full-time minimum-wage Texas worker earns $7.25 an hour (identical to the federal minimum). Multiplied over 2,000 work hours in a year, that’s an annual income of approximately $14,500. The labor group’s use of 2,000 hours in a work year contrasts with the 2,087-hour work year used by the federal government in its data assumptions. Using that figure, a single full-time worker would earn $15,130 in a year. Sills otherwise said that according to maximum monthly income limits posted by the state, a family could easily qualify for SNAP with a single worker earning the minimum wage. He pointed out the relevant chart, posted on a Texas Health and Human Services Commission web page titled "SNAP Food Benefits." We proceeded to crunch the figures, which mostly supported Patrick’s claim, though we also noticed Patrick hadn’t said if he was thinking solely of families with one full-time minimum-wage worker; Sills told us by phone that he believed so. A twist Then came a twist causing us to realize the commission-posted figures were out of date. We recognized as much when Christine Mann, a commission press officer, responded to our inquiry about Patrick’s claim by providing SNAP-eligibility household income thresholds lower than the thresholds on the agency’s SNAP food benefits web page--which Mann told us would be updated. Mann later provided a commission web link to the up-to-date income eligibility figures. For our part, we spotted the same income-eligibility numbers on a USDA web page that describes the figures as in effect for the fiscal year running through September 2017. Mann’s response also indicated that qualifying for SNAP is more complicated than simply grossing less than a particular threshold. "Eligibility for SNAP is based on household size, the countable amount of gross and net income for all mandatory household members, and allowed deductions" for items including shelter, utilities, child care and medical expenses, Mann wrote. Agency confirmation Mann otherwise told us that a single minimum-wage full-time worker in a household of two to three people would draw monthly gross income of $1,255.70. In support of Patrick’s claim, that amount runs short of the up-to-date income thresholds to qualify for SNAP of $1,736 a month for a two-person household or $2,184 a month for a three-person household. Bigger households with a single full-time minimum-wage worker would qualify too, we calculated, as would households of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers. We identified one exception: A household of three with two full-time minimum-wage workers, which would have a combined gross monthly income of $2,511.40, would earn too much to qualify for SNAP at the qualifying gross-income threshold of $2,184 a month for a household of three. We separately asked the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which says it advocates for conditions enabling every Texan to be healthy, well-educated and financially secure, to assess Patrick’s statement. By email, Oliver Bernstein described calculations like our own; he said the claim holds up. Our ruling Patrick said that in Texas, "if you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps." Our finding is that a household of two or more residents including a single full-time minimum-wage worker would clearly qualify for SNAP as would a household of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers. A three-person household with two such workers would gross too much to qualify. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09122	"The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/17/eric-johnson/johnson-says-last-major-drilling-spill-was-1969/	It was 1969. Neil Armstrong took humankind's first steps on the moon. A little town in upstate New York called Woodstock became the world capital of free love and rock 'n' roll. And according to one gubernatorial candidate, it was the year of the U.S.' last major oil spill caused by an offshore drilling accident. Republican Eric Johnson's June 7 blog posting "Despite the spill, we still need to drill" defends drilling in the face of the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He argues that the method is safe, compared with the alternatives. One reason: It hasn't caused a major oil spill in a long, long time. "Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines." This item will deal with the claim about the date of the last major oil spill from a drilling accident. A later one will cover whether tanker spills are more common than ones from rigs or pipelines. As proof, Johnson's campaign sent us a column written by Deroy Murdock, a Scripps Howard News Service columnist and writer for the conservative National Review Online. Murdock's "Offshore oil drilling: cleaner than Mother Nature," states the following: "Capitol Hill Democrats claim offshore drilling poses unacceptable ecological risks. This is yet another overblown worry. Democrats and other environmental naysayers cite the 80,000 barrels that spilled six miles off of Santa Barbara, Calif., inundating beaches and aquatic life. This hydrocarbon Hindenburg haunts the memories of those who witnessed it. But this genuine catastrophe occurred in January 1969 -- nearly 40 years ago." The campaign also sent us other opinion pieces that repeat the assertion, plus a 2008 article by McClatchy Newspapers in which a Minerals Management Services calls the Santa Barbara drilling spill the last "significant" one. To fact-check this claim, we looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that gives a 71-page analysis of oil spills from a variety of sources such as tankers, refineries and oil well blowouts. It states that before 2009, there were 17 blowouts at marine wells in the U.S. since 1964, spilling roughly 249,000 barrels of oil. (This number excludes spills caused by tanker crashes such as the 1989 Exxon Valdez.) The largest in volume was the Santa Barbara spill of 1969 referenced by Murdock and Johnson, in which an estimated 100,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Pacific Ocean, according to the API. The Santa Barbara spill was so big it ranked seventh among the 10 largest oil spills caused by marine well blowouts in the world, the report states. Two other U.S. spills, both in 1970, rank eighth and 10th. Fourteen marine blowouts have taken place in the U.S. between 1969 and 2007. Six of them took place after 1990 and spilled a total of nearly 13,700 barrels. It's clear that there have been numerous marine well blowouts since 1969, but were any one of them "major"? We interviewed three scientists who said that the impact of a spill has little to do with its volume. Scientists have proven that spills far smaller than Santa Barbara's have been devastating. Marine oil spills can take place at any number of points on the fuel's way to your gas tank. The stuff is often shipped in tankers or stored near water. Judith McDowell, a scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a major research facility, cites the effects of a 1969 spill in Buzzard Bay, Mass., caused by a ship that ran aground. It dumped roughly 4,500 barrels into the bay and is still hurting species that play a crucial ecological roles. Some shellfish beds were considered tainted for more than a decade. Jeremy B.C. Jackson, a leading authority on the impact of oil spills and a professor with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was lead author of an influential study on the 1986 Bahia las Minas spill in Panama. It determined that the roughly 60,000 barrels of oil that flowed from a broken storage container destroyed about 60 miles of coastline habitat. Even if the oil never makes it to the coastline, it can kill any sea turtle or dolphin that encounters it, scientists said. Tainted fish can sicken humans and other species that eat them. Species' rates of reproduction can sink for years. Johnson's statement fails the Truth-O-Meter test. While the nation's largest oil well blowout did take place in 1969, it's not factually correct to call it the "last major oil spill." First of all, two of the largest blowouts in the world took place in the U.S. the following year. More importantly, experts agree that spills far smaller in volume to the 1969 disaster have been devastating. From a scientific perspective, Johnson's decision to single out the 1969 blowout as the last "major" one makes no sense. We rate Johnson's claim False.

pomt-01276	"More people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/04/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-more-losing-insurance-through-oba/	Herman Cain’s longshot 2012 Republican presidential bid may be long over, but he’s continued to opine on national affairs. Take, for example, his recent blog post titled, "Nine facts Democrats don't want you to hear before you vote tomorrow." The post, published Nov. 3, 2014, and forwarded to us by a reader, begins this way: "As we all get ready to head to the polls tomorrow, Democrats want you focused on the Koch brothers (that evil, fang-toothed fictionalized version, not the real ones who are excellent and highly successful businessmen) and their ‘war on women’ crapola." The post goes on to offer nine bullet-point items that "Democrats do not want to talk about," including claims about the economy, home ownership, taxes, debt and foreign policy. On health care policy, Cain offers this: "Obamacare is a failure! More people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured, and 51 percent of those enrolled in the exchanges say they will not re-up given the opportunity the next time around. Then there are the 29ers (people being limited to 29 hours a week because of Obamacare mandates) and the 49ers (not the San Francisco ones ... the businesses intentionally staying under 50 employees to avoid the coverage mandate). There are also thousands of doctors refusing patients with Obamacare coverage because they can’t cover their costs on the reimbursements, while thousands more doctors are retiring early." That’s a lot to chew on, but we were especially interested in checking Cain’s claim that "more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured." (An inquiry to Cain’s staff was not returned.) We will start off with a big caveat: The data available on this question is imperfect. For starters, the most historically credible, long-term statistics for health coverage and uninsurance -- the annual figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau -- do not include the big surge in insurance signups that occurred during the first quarter of 2014, which was the deadline for obtaining insurance for 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. What remains is data compiled by the private sector. However, the figures for new signups are somewhat piecemeal, with a less certain historical track record than the Census data. And the figures for cancellations are even fuzzier. That said, we’ll look at the consensus of data compiled by private-sector organizations. These have been calculated on a net basis -- the number of newly covered Americans minus the number of Americans newly lacking coverage. For Cain to be right, this number would have to be negative -- more losses than gains. Is it? The polling company Gallup has been studying uninsurance rates every quarter in a reasonably real-time fashion. In its most recent study, covering the third quarter of 2014, Gallup found that 13.4 percent of Americans lacked health insurance. That’s down significantly from its 18 percent rate in the third quarter of 2013, before the health care exchanges began operations. (As a reminder, insurance-coverage gains from the health care law stem from several sources, including people who signed up for plans on the exchanges, people who were newly able to sign up for Medicaid coverage in the states that allowed it, and young adults under age 26 who were allowed to remain on their parents’ plan.) These Gallup numbers shows a decline in uninsured Americans of 4.6 percentage points since the law took full effect -- the opposite of the direction Cain suggests. All told, between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It’s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014. Gallup’s finding tracks with what other sources have found. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million. An earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. This is a high degree of similarity between five separate studies, pointing to a net increase of 9 million to 10 million through June. And there’s reason to believe that number could be higher. These estimates do not include children under 18, and it’s possible that additional Americans have gained insurance in the months since June. It’s certainly possible that some of the other elements of Obamacare, including employer mandates, will lead to further losses of coverage once they take effect. (The administration has delayed the start of employer contribution requirements.) And the administrative hassle of losing one’s former plan is undeniably a hassle, even if one ends up with a different plan later. But as of now, there isn’t any evidence to back up Cain’s claim that more people are actually losing coverage than gaining. Our ruling Cain said that "more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured." While it’s reasonable to ask questions about the limitations of the available data, there is wide consensus from five private-sector organizations that roughly 10 million more Americans are insured today than were before the law began operations in late 2013. That’s inconsistent with Cain’s claim, so we rate it False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2014-11-04T14:57:50	2014-11-03	['None']
pomt-10307	On offshore drilling.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/05/barack-obama/more-compromise-than-change-of-heart/	For months, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain have jousted over the issue of offshore oil drilling. It's an issue that provides clear contrast between the two candidates, with McCain pushing for more offshore drilling and Obama in steadfast opposition. So when Obama said on Aug. 1 that he was open to supporting the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, it signaled a clear shift. The bipartisan compromise bill calls for spending $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and includes tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars and trucks. But it also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida's west coast. In Chicago in June, Obama was unequivocal about his opposition to offshore drilling off Florida's coast. "And when I am president, I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts," Obama said. "That's how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good." Obama said then that McCain's proposal to lift a moratorium on offshore drilling "will only worsen our addiction to oil and put off needed investments in clean, renewable energy." For months, Obama lambasted McCain's calls for opening up new areas off the U.S. coastline to offshore drilling. "It's a proposal that George Bush's administration says will not provide a drop of oil — not a single drop — for at least 10 years," Obama said in a speech in Las Vegas on June 24. "And by the time the drilling is fully underway in 20 years, our own Department of Energy says that the effect on gas prices will be 'insignificant.' Insignificant." Instead, Obama repeatedly implored oil companies to drill on 68-million acres of land and offshore areas that they have not yet touched. In a July 11 energy speech in Dayton, Ohio, Obama said, "If there were real evidence that these steps (lifting moratoriums on offshore drilling) would actually provide real, immediate relief at the pump and advance the long-term goal of energy independence, of course I'd be open to them. But so far there isn't." So how does Obama now justify throwing tentative support behind an energy plan that would allow offshore drilling within 50 miles of the Florida coast? On Aug. 1, Obama issued this statement: "For too long, partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the American people, and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis. That is why I welcome today's bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and why I look forward to September's bipartisan energy summit. "Today's announcement includes many of the policies I've been fighting for during my time in the Senate and over the course of this campaign. It would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel-efficient cars, help our automakers retool, and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power, solar power, and the next generation of clean, affordable biofuels. "Like all compromises, it also includes steps that I haven't always supported. I remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long-term, though I do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact. "But I've always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis, and today's package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning." Asked by reporters in Florida on Aug. 2 whether his support for the plan was a flip-flop, Obama said he remained highly skeptical about drilling off Florida's coast but that big steps toward energy independence may require compromise. "What I don't want is for the best to be the enemy of the good," Obama said. "If we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise, in which I have to accept some things I don't like and the Democrats have to accept some things they don't like, when it's actually moving us in the direction of energy independence, I'm open to that. "What I will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems." Obama also stressed that he will wait to see the final energy bill proposal before embracing it. Obama's change is that he insisted that as president he would protect Florida's coast from offshore drilling, and now he's open to it as part of the bipartisan compromise energy plan. Obama hasn't sounded like someone who has changed his mind on the issue, so much as someone willing to consider swallowing some offshore drilling as a compromise to get other energy initiatives he really wants. We also note that Obama has not formally endorsed the bipartisan proposal. We reserve the right to revisit Obama's stance on the issue when or if the plan comes up for a vote, but for now, we rule it a Half Flip.

pomt-02414	"Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/06/michael-cerullo/ri-psychotherapist-says-marijuana-contains-50-70-p/	In the ongoing battle over liberalizing marijuana laws, key questions focus on the risks posed by smoking the psychoactive substance. In the past year, PolitiFact affiliates looked at claims that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol (Mostly True), whether today's marijuana is "genetically modified" to have far more THC than in the 1970s (also Mostly True) and whether nobody's addicted to marijuana (False). In a Feb. 20 commentary in The Providence Journal, psychotherapist Michael Cerullo made several arguments against marijuana legalization but this one caught our attention: "Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco," he said. Tobacco is deadly enough. We wondered if marijuana was that much worse. Cerullo said the statement came from the 2007 edition of the Drug Guide for Mental Health Professionals, a specialty edition of the widely-respected Physician's Desk Reference. It says, "Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco." But it offers no source and a spokesman for the publisher said the guide is too old to check the source. We also found references to the factoid in material from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and National Institute on Drug Abuse. But none indicated who had actually done the test or where it had been published. Actually, the statement is ambiguous. It could be saying that marijuana smoke has 50 to 70 percent MORE cancer-causing chemicals or has a 50 to 70 percent greater CONCENTRATION of cancer-causing chemicals. On the first point, we couldn't find a comprehensive tally of cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke. It's not even easy to find a list for tobacco smoke, with different sources giving different estimates. (The National Cancer Institute, on its website, pegs the number at "at least 69." A 2010 Surgeon General's report gives a similar number, and lists 62.) Without evidence, we would rate that reading of the statement as False. In our quest to see if the concentration of cancer-causing chemicals is greater in marijuana smoke, we consulted Dr. Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a leading researcher on marijuana and tobacco. Only a few studies have compared the smoke content of the two, he said in an email. One was from 1975, the other from 1982. They both found that two of the carcinogens in marijuana smoke were higher than in tobacco smoke. Both are hydrocarbons. In the 1975 study, one was roughly 50 percent higher; the other about 70 percent higher. In other words, they supported Cerullo’s claim. But there's more to the story. The concentrations of other cancer-causing chemicals was lower by as much as 73 percent in marijuana smoke, the studies found. Tashkin said the most recent study, published in 2008, found that the concentrations of carcinogenic chemicals were consistently LOWER in marijuana smoke. "These differences could be due to changes in the strains of marijuana studied in 2008 compared to those studied in 1975 and 1982," Tashkin wrote. (This applies to smoke inhaled directly. In contrast, the 2008 study found that the concentration of cancer-causing chemicals was higher in second-hand marijuana smoke than in second-hand tobacco smoke.) Robert Melamede, a medical marijuana advocate and biologist at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, said the carcinogenic content "depends on how thoroughly it's burned" and anyone who says the level of carcinogens is much higher in marijuana "is using meaningless information to make a meaningless point. A lot of people use vaporizers, and vaporizers don't give you any burnt hydrocarbons." Ultimately, the most important question is whether smoking marijuana, on top of its other potential hazards, increases the risk of cancer the way tobacco does. The short answer for now is no. Researchers have been looking for evidence that it does, but they've come up empty-handed. The latest marijuana fact sheet from the National Institute on Drug Abuse says, "It is not yet known whether marijuana smoking contributes to (the) risk for lung cancer." Tashkin said there is speculation that THC, the active ingredient in marijuana "could counterbalance the impact of the carcinogens present in marijuana smoke." Our ruling When Michael Cerullo said, "Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco," he was quoting a reputable source. But we could find no evidence that marijuana smoke contains more kinds of cancer-causing chemicals. And evidence on whether marijuana smoke has higher concentrations of cancer-causing chemicals is hazy at best. It depends on whether you are talking about smoke inhaled by the user, or second-hand smoke. On this burning issue, because the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10361	John McCain has changed position on invading Iraq.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/03/joe-biden/mccain-doesnt-flip-flop-much-on-iraq/	Joe Biden appeared on Meet the Press on June 22, 2008, to promote Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama. One of his first chores was to defend Obama from charges of flip-flopping for opting out of the public financing system. "I'm not sure this is the place this debate should go, but if you talk about flip-flopping, you've got John McCain all of a sudden deciding now we should drill in 600-million acres offshore that he adamantly opposed before," Biden said. "You've got John McCain changing his position on Iraq. He started off talking about how they were going to be accepted and greeted with open arms and how we'd have a lot of money to pay — oil to pay for this war, etc." We've already checked into whether McCain has been consistent on oil drilling, a charge others have made. We concluded that McCain has mostly been consistent in his position on oil drilling. And Biden is on shaky ground when he says McCain changed his position on Iraq. McCain was definitely a supporter of the war and spoke positively about prospects for the invasion. But he also warned early on that creating a functioning government in Iraq would be difficult. "I think we're in a long and difficult process of bringing democracy to a country that's never experienced it," McCain told Fox News on May 31, 2003. "I know it's going to be very, very expensive. This is one of the reasons why I thought the tax cuts were premature. We have to spend a lot more money on this issue, on the reconstruction as well as the cost of the military action in Iraq. And I think we need to get a handle on those costs. I think it's going to be long. I think it's going to be difficult. And this will not be the first — the last extension of the presence of the U.S. military in Iraq, I'm sorry to say. But it doesn't mean it wasn't a worthwhile effort." On the issue of Iraq, McCain was asked specifically about flip-flopping on Jan. 10, 2007, by moderator Tim Russert on Meet the Press. Russert: "Go back, senator, to 2002 — the administration saying we'd be greeted as liberators, John McCain saying that you thought success would be fairly easy." McCain: "Well, it was easy. It was easy. I said we — a military operation would be easy. It was easy. We were greeted as liberators. Look at the films when we rolled into Baghdad. And then there was a period of time where we allowed looting, when the whole country literally evolved into chaos. I went over there. I saw what was happening. I came back, and I made a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and said exactly, tragically, what was going to happen unless we got control of the situation. It was easy, by the way." Russert: "But certainly securing the peace and instilling a democracy in Iraq has been far more challenging —" McCain: "Absolutely. Just as I said it would be." Russert: "But not nearly as much as the administration had suggested to the American people?" McCain: "Well, the mistake and failure ... it's well-documented of what happened. We went in there, we won an easy military victory. They did greet us as liberators. The recent testimony of Saddam Hussein's own words indicate what kind of brutality they were subjected to. And then all of a sudden the looting started, understandably. We didn't have control of Anbar province. We didn't have control — eventually, there was a steady deterioration which led us to the terrible situation that we are in today. And all along, it was because we did not have the classic counterinsurgency strategy which is clear: hold and build. We cleared and would leave. As I've said in other hearings, we were playing a game of Whack-a-Mole." When Biden says McCain has changed position on Iraq, he's pointing toward his comments early in the invasion. As the situation in Iraq has changed over time, elected officials have changed the way they've talked about Iraq. For fact-checking purposes, we have granted them that leeway without calling them out as flip-floppers. For an example, see how we critiqued attacks here and here on Barack Obama that cherry-pick from the time in 2004 when Iraq was relatively calm. And even in the face of poll numbers showing public support for the war in Iraq declining, McCain still holds a fairly firm stay-the-course position. Biden is glossing over too many nuances of McCain's statements on Iraq to make the charge of flip-flopper stick. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00198	Orange County "released" a sex offender instead of turning him over to immigration authorities - "like a sanctuary city."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/18/george-holding/holding-ad-lacks-key-detail-orange-county-immigran/	State leaders outlawed sanctuary cities in North Carolina in 2015, but that hasn’t kept the issue off the airwaves in North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District. Incumbent Republican George Holding is trying to fend off a challenge from Democrat Linda Coleman in the district, which spans several counties around Raleigh. Holding recently released video and radio ads claiming Coleman supports sanctuary cities, with an example of how he maintains they hurt the community. Holding’s ad tells the story of Udiel Aguilar-Castellanos, though it does not mention his name. The video ad says "an illegal immigrant sexually assaulted a child in Carrboro. ICE wanted to deport him, but Orange County released him — like a sanctuary city. Linda Coleman supports sanctuary cities. George Holding opposes sanctuary cities that protect criminals." The radio ad goes into a little more detail: "An illegal immigrant was arrested for a DUI in Durham. However, he was released instead of being deported. Then, he committed a second crime. He sexually assaulted an 11-year-old child in Carrboro. This time, ICE immediately asked local police to detain him, so he could be deported after his trial. But Orange County doesn’t honor ICE requests to detain illegal immigrants. They released him, the same way sanctuary cities do." PolitiFact asked the Holding campaign to explain its claims about how the Orange County Sheriff’s Department handled the Aguilar-Castellanos case. Charles Hellwig, chairman of the Wake County GOP, responded on Holding’s behalf with several news stories about the case. He also provided a video of Coleman saying she supports sanctuary cities. The video, in which Coleman does indeed express support for sanctuary cities, was recorded during an April 23 candidate forum in Raleigh by the LGBTQ Democrats of Wake County, Hellwig said. First, let’s look at what happened to Aguilar-Castellanos. Holding’s ad says he was released. But it doesn’t mention anything about whether he was charged or convicted. Released, after jail time On June 27, Aguilar-Castellanos pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual battery involving an 11-year-old child and was required to register as a sex offender, The Herald-Sun reported. He was initially charged with felony indecent liberties with a child and felony second-degree kidnapping. However, The Herald-Sun reported, an agreement with prosecutors allowed Aguilar-Castellanos to plead guilty to the lesser charge and to be released immediately because he had served 293 days in jail awaiting trial. The maximum sentence he could have received for the sexual battery charges was 150 days, the paper reported. The time served by Aguilar-Castellanos isn’t mentioned in the Holding ad. That omission could leave some believing that he was never punished for his crime. So what did the Orange County Sheriff’s Department do that was "like a sanctuary city?" Sanctuary cities While there’s no formal definition of a sanctuary city, the term often refers to towns or cities that offer some protections to immigrants who are in the country without legal permission. In criminal cases, the local officials often refuse to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Policies and procedures vary by city and state. In NC, the law signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in 2015 makes it illegal for cities or towns to block their police or sheriff’s departments from collaborating with ICE or other federal agencies. The law also forbids local governments from accepting consulate or embassy documents as a form of identification, WUNC reported. State designations aside, no NC town is considered a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low levels of immigration. And no NC town was targeted by the U.S. Justice Department last year when it sent letters to 29 jurisdictions, questioning the legality of their policies for dealing with immigration authorities. However, according to The Herald-Sun and the Associated Press, Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood has said his office does not honor immigration detainers from ICE because it has concerns about potential civil rights lawsuits. That means it doesn’t hold immigrants in custody if there’s no warrant, or if they’re not serving a sentence. Orange County and ICE So the Orange County Sheriff’s department released Aguilar-Castellanos when he had completed his sentence on June 27, the same day he pleaded guilty. (Remember: He was sentenced to time-served.) ICE agents later arrested him in Georgia — and publicly complained about having to track him down. ICE said in a news release that Aguilar-Castellanos had been under a federal immigration judge’s removal order since January 2015. An immigration detainer also was issued to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in September 2017 after his initial arrest, they said. The sheriff’s office said it attempted to contact ICE by phone, but that the effort was unsuccessful. In response to ICE’s public complaints, the Orange County Sheriff said that ICE could’ve assumed custody of Aguilar-Castellanos "at any point" during his nearly 300 days in custody. Our ruling Holding released a pair of campaign ads that say an illegal immigrant assaulted a child in Carrboro and that the Orange County Sheriff’s Office released him "like a sanctuary city." The ad doesn’t mention that the immigrant was convicted and completed his sentence. The Orange County jail did release the man. But the ad doesn’t mention that ICE had nearly 300 days to assume custody prior to his release. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02890	"When you add a dollar value to mandates," government took almost 50 percent "of the American people’s money."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/08/larry-elder/larry-host-says-government-takes-almost-50-percent/	CNN’s Crossfire stacked its panel with Republicans this week to talk about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and how the say-what-he-wants, does-what-he-wants governor divides the GOP. Conservative talk radio host and panelist Larry Elder criticized Christie for accepting the "architecture of the welfare state," pointing to Christie’s embrace of billions of dollars in federal aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In pressing his point, Elder made a head-spinning claim that our governments take almost $.50 of every $1 we earn. "In 1900, at all three levels of government, federal, state and local, government took less than 10 percent of the American people's money," Elder said. "Now we're talking about 35 percent, and when you add a dollar value to mandates, you're talking almost 50 percent. Where’s the outrage on the part of the Republican Party?" Elder’s figures certainly are eye-popping, and his general point -- that the government consumes a lot more money than it did more than 100 years ago -- is true. But on the merits of his specific stats, experts we consulted urged caution. Elder is essentially putting together two separate calculations to get to 50 percent. He’s taking the direct cost of government as a percentage of the economy, then adding to it the cost of government regulations. The first half of this equation is straightforward; the second half is not. Previously, PolitiFact has addressed the question of how large a portion of the economy is accounted for by government expenditures. We’ll recap some of what we found here. For 2012, the gross domestic product -- the size of the nation’s economy -- was $16.2 trillion, according to the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Meanwhile, the expenditures by all levels of government was $5.3 trillion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Using these figures, government at all levels accounted for 32.6 percent of gross domestic product. Given the way Elder phrased his claim -- using as the denominator "the American people’s money" -- it’s possible to use a different calculation. If you replace gross domestic product with personal income (which was about $13.7 trillion in 2012), then the percentage is a few points higher -- 38.5 percent. Neither of these figures gets Elder to "nearly 50 percent." So the cost of regulations has to add an extra 10 to 16 points. Is the cost of regulation high enough to do that? Elder cited 1980s-era work of free-market economist Milton Friedman, though Elder said even Friedman called estimating the burden of regulations "a difficult, if not impossible thing to quantify." Elder pointed us a 2009 report from Americans for Tax Reform Foundation that said the combined cost of government spending and regulatory burdens at all levels totaled "a whopping 61.34 percent" of national income. In 2013, the cost of government was down to 53 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product, according to the anti-tax group, which was founded by Grover Norquist. The data, Elder said, suggests that, if anything, "I understated it." But even economists sympathetic to the notion that government is too big are unwilling to say Elder’s definitively right. They say the numbers are simply too squishy. Government mandates "do have a large burden," said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. "But the estimates shouldn’t be treated with precision." William McBride of the business-backed Tax Foundation said Elder went "out on a limb" with his 50 percent figure. In addition to the softness of the regulatory cost estimates, experts pointed out a few other question marks about the evidence Elder is using. First, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation analysis only attempted to calculate a gross cost of regulations, so it ignored any benefits regulations might have. (We reached out to Americans for Tax Reform but did not hear back.) "Gross rather than a net cost of regulations analysis is pretty much intellectually indefensible," said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in taxes. "Once we get into the net, who knows where it comes out. And, compared to what?" In addition, saying the government "took" your money is misleading. Some of the money government collects comes back to you in the form or Social Security or Medicare, or any of a number of other government programs. While Republicans such as Elder may advocate that Americans should have more control over their money from cradle to grave, suggesting government simply takes $.50 on every $1 someone earns isn’t the whole story. "If Elder wants to talk about mandates as increasing the percentage of government ownership, it’s only fair to consider the other side," said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor. "I pay money in payroll tax during my working years, then I get money back in my retirement years (from Social Security)." "The whole exercise is rather silly (and pointless) because it does not take into account what the U.S. gets for its tax dollar," added Thomas Hungerford, a senior economist and director of tax and budget policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. All in all, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University tax professor, "Mr. Elder’s statement is too vague to be useful for any purpose other than generating ‘hallelujahs!’ from the choir he is preaching to." Our ruling Elder said, "When you add a dollar value to mandates," government took almost 50 percent "of the American people’s money." It’s easy to get to the mid-to-high 30 percent range. But getting the last 10 to 15 percentage points to get to "almost 50 percent" is less certain. Regulation does have a cost, but the exact cost is hard to pin down. Because his larger point -- that government spending has increased, and that mandates have a cost -- is valid, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-00220	In West Virginia, "personal income tax collections (were) up 14% from 2017."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/11/david-mckinley/david-mckinley-correct-about-rise-wva-tax-receipts/	U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., touted his state’s economic performance in an Aug. 14 tweet. He tweeted, "West Virginia’s economic comeback continues. Personal income tax collections up 14% from 2017. Most people working is good news." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The unemployment rate in West Virginia has been steady at either 5.3 percent or 5.4 percent since September 2017, lower than the state’s rate for most of the period between 2009 and 2016. Here, though, we’ll focus on McKinley’s claim about tax collections. To support this point, McKinley linked to an article in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel. However, the 14 percent figure doesn’t appear in the article. So we decided to take a closer look. We turned to the official state budget website and looked at the revenue collection data for July going back to 2000. This data does support McKinley’s data point. In July 2018, the state collected $145,494,000 in personal income tax revenues. By comparison, in July 2017, the state collected $128,146,000. That’s an increase of 13.5 percent, which rounds up to 14 percent -- just as McKinley tweeted. For historical perspective, that’s well below the largest increases, but it’s the third highest year-over-year increase since 2001. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling McKinley wrote that in West Virginia, "personal income tax collections (were) up 14% from 2017." That’s correct when you compare income tax collections in July 2018 to July 2017. It’s also the third-largest July-to-July improvement since 2001. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02707	"This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/dec/29/david-rible/assemblyman-david-rible-says-gov-chris-christie-ha/	Some gubernatorial sound bites never die – they just become fodder for other politicians, it seems, even if the facts behind them are a bit questionable. Take, for example, a comment that Assembly Conference Leader David Rible (R-Monmouth) said during a Nov. 30 panel discussion on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ program. Rible appeared with Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) and Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and Bob Singer (R-Ocean) to discuss Gov. Chris Christie’s attempt to unseat Sen. Tm Kean Jr. (R-Union) as minority leader, as well as other political topics. "This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes," Rible told Aron in response to the host’s question about the likelihood of Christie’s success in having the Legislature approve a tax cut. Christie first floated the idea two years ago, but Democrats, who control the Legislature, have nixed the idea because they said the state can’t afford it. Rible’s claim is neither new nor original. Christie himself has said it on multiple occasions. And like Christie, Rible’s left out a few important details that we’ll explain again. It is true that Christie has produced continual balanced budgets since taking office in January 2010. But that’s nothing special. State law requires every governor to do it, so it’s hardly a singular, significant achievement. And the claim about not raising taxes is questionable. While the rates for corporation, income and sales taxes – the three biggest sources of revenue in New Jersey -- have not increased under Christie, his slashing of funding for tax credit programs has had the same effect as tax increases, experts have said. The state’s Treasury Department has disagreed with that assessment, particularly in the case of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which Christie cut during his first year in office. New Jersey at one time sent checks to homeowners and certain low-income individuals with the goal for that money to be used toward tax bills. The checks – what Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said amounted to subsidies for very low-income people -- eventually became credits on their bills instead, and at lower amounts. Christie also cut two tax credit programs, the Homestead Benefit Program among them, giving recipients less than what they received previously. In some cases, some taxpayers are receiving less than half of what was once an average $1,000 rebate. State Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases. Of the 2010 EITC cut, Quinn has noted that more than 76 percent of EITC recipients that year owed no New Jersey tax. But experts with The George Washington University, the University of Connecticut and the University of California Davis School of Law, have said funding cuts in tax credit programs are essentially tax increases because those recipients end up with less money to put toward their tax bills. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, has said it’d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. "They have elements of both and are strictly neither," Joseph Henchman, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of legal and state projects, has told us. Rible could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Rible said during a panel discussion, "This governor has given us continual balanced budgets without raising taxes." There’s varying degrees of accuracy here. The governor has given New Jersey balanced budgets, but the law requires it. And while Christie hasn’t hiked the rates for the three biggest revenue-generating taxes in the state, he has cut some programs that experts say are essentially the same as tax increases because people have less money as a result to offset tax bills. For these reasons, we rate Rible’s claim Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	David Rible	None	None	None	2013-12-29T07:30:00	2013-11-30	['None']

pomt-03847	"There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/14/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-3-million-jobs-unfilled-due-lack-/	During his speech to the annual CPAC conference of conservative activists, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said one key for economic growth is to have workers with better skills. "There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs," Rubio said in his March 14, 2013, speech. Coincidentally, just moments before Rubio uttered those words, we posted a fact check of a similar comment by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. Foxx had said in a House floor speech that "there are 3.6 million jobs sitting vacant, in part because there aren’t enough qualified applicants to fill them." Because the analysis required for both quotes is so similar, we will rely heavily here on the Foxx fact-check. But while we rated Foxx’s claim Mostly True, Rubio’s statement was worded differently. Foxx hedged her comment by saying that it was "in part" because of unqualified applications, but Rubio’s wording suggests that all the vacancies stem from skill shortages. We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s scorekeeper on employment data. The 3 million figure Rubio used is similar to the 3.6 million figure Foxx cited. It comes from a monthly survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. The most recent seasonally adjusted data covers January 2013 and showed that there were just under 3.7 million job openings in January, up slightly from 3.6 million in December 2012. But Rubio specifically said "there are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs." A close look at the survey reveals it doesn’t actually support that thesis. The bureau’s official definition of a "job opening" is "a specific position of employment to be filled at an establishment" that satisfy these conditions: "there is work available for that position, the job could start within 30 days, and the employer is actively recruiting for the position." However, there are always job openings -- even in a healthy economy. In a phenomenon known as "churn," people change jobs. Just because their old job is unoccupied when the BLS takes its monthly data snapshot doesn’t necessarily mean that the employer is having trouble filling the job, or finding the skills of the applicants lacking. Rather, the employer could simply be going through the process of hiring, with the job filled a month later. Over the past decade, the December monthly totals for job openings have ranged from 2.9 million to 4.4 million. So, if Rubio means to say that 3 million of the 3.7 million job openings are open due to skill shortfalls, he has no way of knowing that because that sort of data is not collected. The same is true if he was simply using "3 million" as shorthand for "3.7 million." The data from this survey "has important limitations," said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, because it "provides little information about the distribution of vacancy durations" and "no direct information about the reason why some job openings take a long time to fill." So what can we say about the scale of the skills mismatch? It boils down largely to a battle of anecdotes. Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us for this story, but Foxx’s office provided links to a variety of news reports that suggest a divergence between applicants’ job skills and the ones employers are seeking. Economists we consulted agreed that that is part of the issue, particularly for high-skill jobs. But it’s probably not the only reason. For instance, there appears to be a "hiring paralysis" among employers who are acting with unusual caution because they are uncertain whether the economy will remain strong rather than stagnating, according to economists and hiring professionals quoted in the New York Times earlier this year. Our ruling Rubio said, "There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs." If one allows him some space for using shorthand, Rubio is basically right that there are "3 million jobs available in America." But while there is anecdotal evidence of a job-skills shortage, there is no data to prove his contention that the 3 million jobs in question are all open because of a mismatch in job skills.

pomt-13530	Milwaukee has "the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/31/gwen-moore/does-milwaukee-scene-unrest-after-fatal-police-sho/	After a weekend of arsons and attacks on police in the Sherman Park neighborhood of her home city, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was interviewed Aug. 15, 2016 on MSNBC. There was this exchange between talk show host Lawrence O’Donnell and the Milwaukee Democrat: O’Donnell: One of the things that the history of this subject shows everywhere in the United States, is that when you get a violent community reaction like this, it is never for that one individual incident, it's always an accumulation of past grievances that have not been satisfactorily addressed in terms of the community's understanding of them, at least. Is that the case in Milwaukee? Moore: Oh, absolutely, Lawrence. You know, we have one of the youngest African-American populations in the country. And the dearth of resources for summer jobs, for economic well being, for basic things like the ability to pay rent for women and the high incarceration rate for black males. We have the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country. And it creates a powder keg. Similar claims were made by other Milwaukee Democrats, including state Sen. Lena Taylor on CNN, and have been reported by national media. So, does Milwaukee have the nation’s highest incarceration rate for black males? There is data to indicate that Milwaukee ranks very high. But there isn’t city-level data on a national level to know whether it ranks highest. Moore’s evidence To back Moore’s claim, her office cited a study from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee entitled "Wisconsin’s Mass Incarceration of African American Males: Workforce Challenges for 2013." It has been widely cited, but its major finding is about Wisconsin, not Milwaukee, and it is dated. The study said that as of 2010, 12.8 percent of working-age African-American men were in state prisons or local jails -- the highest such rate in the country, with Oklahoma ranking second. The study also said that in Milwaukee County, over half of African-American men in their 30s and half in their early 40s had been incarcerated in state correctional facilities at some point in the past. Other experts Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who has written on the black incarceration rate, and Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, said the UWM study appears to be solid research. They also said both Milwaukee and Wisconsin have high rates of black male incarceration. But they and University of Wisconsin-Madison sociology professor Pamela Oliver, whose research work includes the Wisconsin Racial Disparities Project, told us there simply isn’t city-level data nationally in order to rank Milwaukee. Oliver said it’s likely Milwaukee would rank high among larger U.S. cities with large black populations, but that "many members of the general public incorrectly assume that because 70 percent of Wisconsin’s black people live in Milwaukee County that anything that is true about Wisconsin really refers to Milwaukee. It is more complicated than that." Mauer noted that his organization, which works to address racial disparities, reported in June 2016 that -- among black males and females -- Wisconsin has the second-highest rate of black incarceration in the nation, behind Oklahoma. (Unlike the UWM study, the Sentencing Project study didn’t include local jails. And no local-level data was reported.) Our rating Moore said: Milwaukee has "the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country." There are indications that Milwaukee has a very high black male incarceration rate, including a 2016 study that ranks Wisconsin ranks second in the incarceration of black males and females in state prisons. But there are no local-level data on a national basis to determine exactly where Milwaukee ranks. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91b436b6-67cf-4226-ac00-c6d946b6808c	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2016-08-31T05:00:00	2016-08-15	['None']

pomt-15064	Salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government "have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/sep/25/don-zimmerman/don-zimmerman-says-non-city-workers-havent-seen-3-/	The salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government "have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years." Austin City Council Member Don Zimmerman objected to a 3 percent pay raise for Austin city employees partly by saying other Austin residents haven’t landed similar hikes. An Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Sept. 1, 2015, quoted Zimmerman, the District 6 Austin City Council member, telling colleagues that Austin residents who aren’t city employees face the same taxes, fees and utility bills that employees confront. "And," Zimmerman said, "their salaries have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years." In recent years, city employees actually fielded raises ranging from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent; the council gave no raises in the 2009-10 budget year. Days after Zimmerman piped up, the council voted 9-2, with Zimmerman voting "no," for a 2015-16 budget that includes 3 percent raises for the city’s 12,000 workers. Brian Kelsey, principal of Civic Analytics, an Austin economic consulting firm, urged us to check Zimmerman’s 3-percent analysis, saying on Twitter the declaration seemed like a candidate for our Truth-O-Meter. We embarked on this fact check with some wariness. Outside of government, which is subject to open-records laws, who knows about anyone else’s pay? With guidance from expert number-crunchers, we landed several federal estimates for average changes in overall wages paid Austin-area workers, though we didn’t identify data strictly limited to people working in Austin. Zimmerman’s backup To get started, we asked Zimmerman how he reached his conclusion. He put us in touch with his chief of staff, Joe Petronis, who emailed a spreadsheet drawing on Occupational Employment Statistics collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that include wage estimates for over 800 occupations nationally and, closer to home, metropolitan statistical areas. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos MSA takes in Travis County, home to the capital, plus nearby Hays, Bastrop, Caldwell and Williamson counties. Petronis focused on changes in median hourly wages across all occupations (including city workers) in the region from May 2010 to May 2014. These data suggest the 2012 hourly median of $17.12 in the Austin region was down 0.5 percent from the 2011 median of $17.20. In 2013, per the Occupational Employment Statistics, the $17.48 in median hourly wages was up 2.1 percent from the year before and the 2014 median hourly wage of $17.62 was up 0.8 percent from the 2013 median, all figures we confirmed on a BLS website. That’s one way of ballparking wage changes. Then again, Beverly Kerr, a lead researcher for the Austin Chamber of Commerce, pointed out by email that the government counsels against using OES data to compare figures from different years. "This is not the best dataset to use to compare the changes in wages over time," Kerr wrote. The bureau’s explanation/warning (question F. 1. here) runs nearly 1,100 words, a lot of that about how definitions of jobs and industries and even geographical classifications change. Yet Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based BLS spokeswoman, replied to us by email that while the OES and another bureau data set, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, aren’t intended for use as "a time series," topline pay-change comparisons we were considering made the caveats less worrisome. Other analyses It turned out there are many ways to attempt wage-change comparisons. Kerr and Abbot each said the bureau’s quarterly census would be the most comprehensive way to gauge pay changes among workers not employed by the city. The census, which launched in the 1930s, tracks employment and wages of establishments which report to the federal government’s unemployment insurance programs, hence representing about 97 percent of the nation’s civilian wage and salary civilian employment. Abbot sent us a chart showing, per the quarterly census, 10 years of changes in average weekly wages for people working in Travis County, enabling us to calculate that wages for individuals employed in the county, including city employees, escalated an average of nearly 3 percent a year from 2010 through 2014. This figure rolled in changes in wages for city employees and other government workers. But it’s also possible to isolate changes in wages solely for local government workers, including city employees, which the census indicates increased an average of nearly 2 percent a year. According to the chart, average wages for private-sector workers employed in the county rose an average 2.7 percent a year over the five years. And, in keeping with Zimmerman’s claim, what of the last several years? Wages for all workers in the county escalated an average 3.1 percent in 2012, 1.1 percent in 2013 and 4.2 percent in 2014, according to the bureau’s census. Meantime, private-sector wages went up 3.3 percent on average in 2012; decreased 0.2 percent in 2012; and increased 3.9 percent in 2014, Abbot’s chart indicated. BLS analyst suggests regional focus We pressed Abbot on how best to gauge pay raises for Austin residents not working for the city. She suggested we look at changes in private industry average weekly wages per the quarterly census across the five-county Austin MSA rather than in the county alone. "This QCEW measure is as close as the bureau can come to average annual pay raises for Austin workers, excluding city employees," Abbot emailed, though she noted that her run through the data excluded all government workers, leaving out workers at every level from the city, county, state and federal offices. According to the quarterly census, the average weekly wage in the five-county region across private industries escalated 3 percent in 2012 to $1,023, decreased 0.5 percent in 2013 to $1,018 and increased 3.6 percent to $1,055 in 2014. YEAR AVG WEEKLY WAGE, ALL PRIVATE INDUSTRIES, AUSTIN MSA CHANGE (%) 2012 1023 3.0 2013 1018 -0.5 2014 1055 3.6 SOURCE: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, U.S. Bureau of Labor (chart received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, BLS, Sept. 22, 2015) Other indicators Kerr offered up another data source overseen by the bureau, its Current Employment Statistics, which Kerr tapped to find that annual private industry wages increased in the five-county region by an average 2.2 percent from 2008 through 2014 with average annual raises ranging from 1.3 percent to 4.8 percent. Most recently, average wages were up 1.1 percent in 2012; increased 3.2 percent in 2013; and rose 4.1 percent in 2014, Kerr’s chart indicates. When we asked, Abbot called the survey-based CES a "perfectly valid choice" for gauging wage changes. But we couldn’t make a run at checking changes in median wages per the quarterly census or CES. Abbot told those data sets don’t produce median figures. Next, we spotted data posted by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicating that the average wage per job in the Austin region escalated 3.6 percent from 2010 to 2011; 3 percent from 2011 to 2012--and a scant 0.1 percent from 2012 to 2013, the latest period analyzed. Our ruling Zimmerman said the salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government "have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years." By various indicators, wages of Austin-area workers have not gone up 3 percent every year, as Zimmerman said. Yet some measures suggest there were some 3 percent (or better) average increases though we also found evidence of an average wage decline one recent year.

pomt-15340	Says Hillary Clinton's "campaign hasn't been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/12/brianna-keilar/when-did-hillary-clinton-delete-her-work-emails/	Questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State aren’t going away. One part of the story that remains unknown, CNN’s Brianna Keilar says, is when exactly Clinton wiped her email server clean. The answer could be an important marker in the Clinton email story, as House Republicans continue to press for answers to Clinton’s reaction to the death of four U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Keilar, who interviewed Clinton on July 7, said on CNN's State of the Union July 12 that she was "surprised" Clinton "didn’t show a little more contrition" about her use of a private email account and seemed a bit irked by Clinton’s spin that she "never had a subpoena." (She did, though Keilar and Clinton interpreted the point differently.) "What the campaign will say is I was asking her about facing a subpoena that she wiped her server. They’ll say that’s not true," Keilar said. "But the other thing is, the campaign hasn't been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails, so there's no way to even really completely fact-check what she's saying, because they don't want to get into all of the details of those things." We were curious about Keilar’s claim that Clinton "hasn’t been clear" about when she wiped her server clean. The Clintons began using the private server in question when President Bill Clinton was in office, Hillary Clinton said at a press conference March 10, 2015. According to Clinton, it contained around 30,000 personal emails and 30,000 work-related emails from during her tenure as Secretary of State. Clinton said she deleted the personal emails — "emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations," she said — sometime in the fall of 2014 and sometime after the State Department asked on Oct. 28 for Clinton’s work-related correspondence. Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and communication relevant to her role as head diplomat to the State Department on Dec. 5. Sometime after that, the entire server was "wiped clean," said Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Benghazi committee, on March 27. When exactly did that happen? Keilar has a point when she says it’s unclear. The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server shortly after they were turned over to the State Department on Dec. 5. They referred us to a letter Clinton’s lawyer David Kendall wrote to Gowdy. The Benghazi committee subpoenaed Clinton’s emails on March 4, 2015, and Gowdy asked for the physical server about two weeks later on March 19. According to Kendall’s letter, dated March 27, the emails relevant to Benghazi were in the State Department’s possession and the committee had no legal right to the server. What’s more, what Gowdy wanted no longer existed. "During the fall of 2014, Secretary Clinton’s legal representative reviewed her hdr22@clintonemail.com account for the time period from Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013," Kendall wrote. "After the review was completed to identify and provide to the Department of State all of the secretary's work-related and potentially work-related emails, the secretary chose not to keep her non-record personal emails and asked that her account (which was no longer in active use) be set to retain only the most recent 60 days of email." "No emails from hdr22@clintonemail.com for the time period Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013, reside on the server. Thus, there are no hdr22@clintonemail.com e-mails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate and legally authorized." To recap, Clinton’s private server was wiped clean —technically, filtering out emails older than 60 days — sometime between Dec. 5, 2014, and March 27, 2015. No clearer timeline has been stated. Why does this matter? After receiving Kendall’s letter, Gowdy issued a statement accusing Clinton of "unilaterally" and "permanently" deleting all the emails when she wiped the server. The Clinton campaign and Kendall, meanwhile, contend that all the emails relevant to Benghazi and her time as Secretary of State still exist and are in State Department’s possession. Our ruling Keilar said, "The (Clinton) campaign hasn’t been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails." The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server "shortly after" she turned them over to the State Department on Dec. 5, 2014, but did not provide a date. The paper trail so far gives us a window of sometime between December 2014 and March 2015, but no more. That’s better than nothing, but Keilar is largely correct when she says the picture isn’t clear. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-03938	Says after Hurricane Sandy, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg "refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/20/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-new-york-mayor-refused-nationa/	Buy more guns, says Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, or you’ll be thrust into the "hellish world" of south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy. LaPierre, in an appeal to gun owners published Feb. 13, 2013, by conservative news site Daily Caller, wrote that "looters ran wild." And, he added, the mayor didn’t help: "Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!" Did Bloomberg, co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, refuse "to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns"? We dug into the facts and found that, while Bloomberg did mention guns when he said there wasn’t need for additional help from the National Guard, his main reason was that the New York Police Department was doing fine at keeping the peace. What Bloomberg refused The NRA’s director of public affairs, Andrew Arulanandam, pointed us to the mayor’s Oct. 31, 2012, news conference, two days after Sandy’s storm surge devastated parts of New York City. When Bloomberg opened up the floor to questions, a reporter jumped in: "Mr. Mayor, Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz has requested additional National Guard in Brooklyn. Do you agree?" Markowitz had called on the governor to "allocate as many troops as possible" to help the city’s "brave — but overwhelmed — first responders." "There have been unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations," said Markowitz’s statement, published the day of Bloomberg’s news conference. "All of our resources have been stretched to the limit, but in the name of public safety we need to send more National Guard personnel into Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Red Hook and any other locations the governor deems appropriate." Bloomberg, who could formally request such help from the governor, disagreed. New York City didn’t need the help, he said. Here’s what he told the reporter who asked about Markowitz’s National Guard request: "No, we appreciate the help. The National Guard has been helpful, but the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns, and we don't need it. There has been one or two minor outbreakings, disgraceful though they may be, of looting reported in the paper, but the vast bulk of people are doing the right thing. And in Brooklyn people are safe the same way as they are in the rest of the city. We have the resources. The NYPD is 100 percent confident that we can protect the public. We've been doing this for an awful long time. You just have to take a look at the crime rate to understand how good a job this is. And the National Guard has plenty of responsibilities. There are plenty of locations upstate and into surrounding states where they don't have a police department the size of New York, and they can use help from the state, and that's where they should be." But even though the full context of his remarks indicates his reason was that the NYPD didn't need the help, the media pounced on his gun reference. The NRA pointed us to a snippet from the Atlantic Wire, which covered the briefing live: "3:19 p.m. ‘The NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns,’ Bloomberg says when asked if he asked for National Guard help in Brooklyn." The NRA also noted that the next day, the Brooklyn Paper wrote that Bloomberg "snubbed Borough President Markowitz’s impassioned plea to bring the National Guard to Hurricane Sandy-scarred Brooklyn — arguing that approving the Beep’s request would be a waste of federal manpower and turn the borough into a police state." Conservative media picked up the story from there: • NewsBusters: "Thursday Report: Bloomberg Wouldn't Let Guard Into Brooklyn Over Their Possession of Guns." • Fox Nation: "Report: Bloomberg Denied National Guard Assistance In Brooklyn Because Of Their Possession Of Guns." • Hot Air: "Bloomberg kept National Guard out of NYC because they had guns?" • Breitbart: "BLOOMBERG TO BROOKLYN: NATIONAL GUARD NOT ALLOWED WITH GUNS." Did Bloomberg refuse to allow the National Guard into the city? Not exactly. He requested National Guard support from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and got it. The day before Bloomberg’s news conference, Cuomo "mobilized more than 2,300 Soldiers and Airmen" to help, including in New York City. Several days later, Cuomo’s office announced that more than 3,300 members of the National Guard had been deployed, including 850 from out of state. The out-of-state reinforcements were housed at Floyd Bennett Field — in southeast Brooklyn. John McCarthy of Bloomberg’s office told PolitiFact that the National Guard was in the city "before, during and after the storm." Order and disorder But LaPierre’s partly right: Bloomberg didn’t ask for National Guard troops "to restore civil order." Law enforcement wasn’t part of their requested mission, said Eric Durr, director of public affairs for the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs. Local government ran the show, requesting help from the state, he said. And Bloomberg didn’t ask for armed troops. "Our soldiers were there to assist in storm recovery," Durr said. "They were not carrying weapons." And that’s "incredibly typical," said Durr, who joined the New York National Guard in 1988. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, for example, he didn’t carry a weapon. Bloomberg’s office confirmed the mayor "did not want security provided by anyone other than NYPD." Why? "Because they are the best police force in the world," McCarthy said. The city’s police force, with about 34,500 in uniform, is more than twice the size of the New York National Guard. But LaPierre also suggested there was a loss of civil order that required restoration. Just how much disorder was there? According to Bloomberg’s office, Brooklyn borough president Markowitz, the New York Police Department and a congressman representing Brooklyn — not so much. In the week after the storm, crime overall was down. Burglary was up. The day Markowitz had appealed for more aid, the New York Times and New York Post had reported isolated looting in the evacuated Rockaways and Coney Island, with about two dozen arrests. The Post quoted unnamed sources describing people grabbing shirts from an Ann Taylor display, plus gadgets from a Brookstone store "before cops arrived to stand guard." In response to LaPierre’s Daily Caller article, the Los Angeles Times reported that while crime overall dropped in the city after Sandy, there had been some spikes in burglary — 17 burglaries in a precinct that last year had eight and 14 burglaries in a precinct that last year had three. But citywide, the Times reported, "there was a drop of 17% in shootings, 47% in rapes, 22% in robberies, 18% in assaults, 45% in grand larceny, and 22% in stolen cars. The city also went a record eight days without a murder directly after Sandy." Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries, a Democrat who represents New York’s Eighth District, wrote a letter to LaPierre, saying his "suggestion that the residents of southern Brooklyn were in grave danger due to 'looters' that 'ran wild' is baseless." "I spent countless hours in the communities of Coney Island and Sea Gate. Nothing about your characterization of lawlessness rings true," Jeffries wrote. And Markowitz, the borough president who had requested the National Guard help, wrote to LaPierre, "Your assertion that ‘looters ran wild in South Brooklyn,’ proves just how totally ignorant you are of what’s really going on in Brooklyn and what’s really in the best interest of Brooklynites. Your perception of Hurricane Sandy is nothing but fiction." (Seemed a little harsh to us from the guy who had pointed out "unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations." But that’s certainly more reserved than "looters ran wild.") Our ruling LaPierre described a "hellish world" in south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy where the mayor "refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns." He is wrong that Bloomberg refused to allow the National Guard into the city -- troops were already there and more arrived in the days afterward. However, he's right that Bloomberg rejected an armed National Guard, although the full context of the mayor's remarks indicate his primary reason was he felt the NYPD was able to keep the peace without the Guard's help.

"The state of Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates," said Rogers, the state Senate’s majority leader. Wow! Is it that bad here? We searched for answers. First, let’s look at SAT scores. The College Board, which administers the SAT, warns people against using the exam to make competitive comparisons because the results do not account for factors such as demographics and other variables that can affect test scores. The warnings are usually ignored by curious reporters, some educators and, apparently, elected officials. We looked at Georgia’s SAT mean scores in 2010, the most recent year available. The combined mean score in math, reading and writing was 1,453. The only states that ranked lower were South Carolina (1,447) and Maine (1,389). Students in Washington, D.C., also were below Georgia, with a mean score of 1,404. For the curious, Iowa students had the highest mean score of 1,798. To be fair to Georgia students, a larger percentage of them are taking the SAT than their peers in most other states, which likely brought down the mean score. Only six states had more students who took the SAT. So what about graduation rates? PolitiFact Georgia tackled this topic in November when we checked then-Gov. Sonny Perdue’s claim that this state’s graduation rate topped 80 percent in 2010. We differed with Perdue on the claim, concluding he may have used flawed data. In April, for example, the U.S. Department of Education rebuked the state Department of Education and Clayton County, one of the state’s largest school districts, and determined the county's 2006-2007 dropout rate was undercounted. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation discovered problems with graduation rate data for another large school district, the city of Atlanta. The newspaper found many students were marked as transfers even though there was no evidence they re-enrolled elsewhere, which may explain Atlanta’s rising graduation rates in recent years. We ruled there is no clear way to know what the true graduation rate is in Georgia and rated Perdue’s claim as Half True. Even with what may be flawed numbers, Georgia does not fare well nationally, according to data on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. A review of its most recent data (the 2007-08 school year) showed about 65 percent of students who were freshmen four years earlier graduated that year. Georgia ranked ahead of only Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Washington, D.C. Rogers is correct to say Georgia SAT scores are "near the bottom" nationally. The graduation rates are trickier, but even with potentially flawed data, Georgia was ahead of just three states. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-02069	I turned "a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/25/angel-taveras/providence-mayor-angel-taveras-says-he-has-turned-/	After Angel Taveras was sworn in as mayor of Providence on Jan. 3, 2011, he discovered that the city was facing big financial problems. Now that the Democrat is running for governor, he is boasting about how he brought that debt under control. "I'm proud of my record as mayor, which includes turning a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city," he said in a May 12, 2014, fundraising letter. That's a lot of money saved in a city where the 2014 budget is $662 million. We know that the Taveras administration found substantial savings by getting concessions from the city's unions, closing some schools, making other cutbacks, and raising revenue through additional taxes, including increased payments from tax-exempt institutions. But was the city really $110 million in the red and is it now $1.6 million in the black? Not exactly. During his budget address on April 29, 2014, Taveras was more precise: "Last year, we finally eliminated the $110 million structural deficit and ended the year with a $1.6 million surplus," he said. The key word here is "structural," and we suspect that most people don't even know what a "structural deficit" is. When cities and towns draft budgets and get audited, the term is usually nowhere to be found. You have a "structural deficit" if you're going to lose money unless you increase your revenue or cut your spending, regardless of whether the economy is doing well or not, said Edward M. Mazze, former dean and current professor of business at the University of Rhode Island In other words, if the tally of your projected expenses for the coming year -- food, electricity, mortgage, and the rest -- comes to $50,000 and your projected income is only $40,000 a year, you have a structural deficit of $10,000. In January 2011, after it appeared the city was spending far more money than it was taking in, Taveras commissioned a report from a team of outside experts which concluded that, unless things changed, Providence would accumulate $109.9 million in new debt during the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first full fiscal year of the Taveras administration. That was its projected structural deficit for the year. The actual deficit for that year never got that high because his administration, in conjunction with the city's unions, moved quickly to bring down costs and raise revenue. (The structural deficit for the previous fiscal year, which began when David Cicilline was mayor, was estimated to be $69.6 million.) How big did the actual deficit get under the Taveras administration? The best numbers come from the city's annual audit. According to the report from the period ending June 30, 2012, the accumulated deficit from that year, combined with previous years, had grown to $11.4 million. That's a far cry from the $110 million deficit Taveras talks about in his fundraising letter. And was there really a $1.6-million surplus? Yes. It was in the 2013 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2013. But because the debt, technically known as cumulative deficit, was so large to start with, the extra $1.6 million simply trimmed the debt to $9.8 million. The cumulative deficit for the current fiscal year won't be released until December. The city is hoping to shrink it by another million dollars. We asked city finance officials how they know that the $110 million structural deficit estimate was reasonable at the time. The city’s Administration Director, Michael D’Amico, said $110 million in changes were made based on the $110 million projection. If the projection had been inaccurate, the city would have seen a huge surplus, which it didn't. When we asked the Taveras campaign why the term "structural deficit" was not used in the letter, spokeswoman Dawn Bergantino said "there wasn't any motive for not using the term in that email." "We are pretty consistent in using the term 'structural deficit,' but in this instance we just didn't," she said. "No, the city didn't end up $110 million in the red. But had he not taken action to close that deficit, it would have." Our ruling In a fundraising letter, Angel Taveras said he turned "a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city." The average reader would get the impression that the city was $110 million in debt but now has an extra $1.6 million. The threat of a $110 million deficit was real, but the city's actual debt never accumulated to anything close to that amount. To their credit, Taveras, his staff and the city's unions engineered a major turnaround in the city's finances that prevented that from happening. The $1.6 million surplus was also real, but only for that year. And by then the city was so deep in debt, its general fund was still $9.8 million in the hole. And if the city hits its target this year, it will still be roughly $8.8 million in the red when the fiscal year ends June 30. Although Taveras accurately characterized the potential deficit in his budget speech, the campaign letter that initially caught our attention gives the false impression that (a.) the city was $110 million in debt when it wasn't and (b.) it's not in debt anymore, which it is. The campaign fundraising letter oversimplifies and overreaches to the point of being deceptive. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00759	On in-state tuition for unauthorized immigrants.	half flip	/texas/statements/2015/apr/15/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-immigrant-tuition-law-made-sense-2/	Rick Perry recently made us wonder if he’d flip-flopped on his politically touchy support for the Texas law enabling thousands of young unauthorized immigrants to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities — a provision that might be repealed by the 2015 Legislature. What he said The former Texas governor, a Republican exploring a second run for president, was in South Carolina April 7, 2015, when Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune asked if his "thinking" on the 2001 law had changed "over the years." Perry initially replied by stressing the importance of the federal government securing the U.S.-Mexico border. "This is a result of Washington, D.C. failing at their constitutional duty and then forcing states to deal with it." Perry also said the 2001 Legislature, Republicans and Democrats, overwhelmingly supported the in-state tuition provision, thinking "that we had a choice to make economically: Are you going to put these people in a position of having to rely upon government to take care of themselves, or are you going to let them be educated and be contributing members of society, obviously working towards getting their citizenship? And that’s what that legislation did; I supported that at that particular point in time." Perry continued: "I’m going to leave it up to the Legislature; you know, I’m not the governor any more. They’ll make a call on whether this is right for Texas or not." Perry went on to say he’ll continue to call on the federal government to secure the border. Reporter’s follow-up Svitek followed up: "And just to be clear: You supported it in 2001. So you don’t have a position today on whether it should be in place?" Perry: "Listen, I’m going to leave that up to the Legislature. They’re going to look at all of the impact. But I hope what the Legislature will do is really send a powerful message to Washington, D.C., to their congressmen, to the senators that you must deal with this issue of border security, you must allow the states to be able to know that they’re not going to have to pick up the costs because the federal government is failing to do their job to secure the border." Perry before We’ve been writing about the 2001 law since this February 2010 fact check, which noted that on June 16, 2001, Perry signed into law the proposal allowing certain immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. Students lacking proper immigration documentation but with a Texas high school diploma or GED and who have lived in Texas for at least three years may qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can. Thousands of students have since taken advantage of the law. According to the latest available data, in the fiscal year through August 2013, 24,770 students partook, accounting for 1.9 percent of all students in the state’s public colleges and universities, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. In 2011, during his bid for president, Perry accurately pointed out very few legislators opposed the measure before it reached his desk 10 years before. In a September 2011 interview with Newsmax, Perry also apologized for saying in a Republican candidate debate that anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not "have a heart." In an article about the interview, Newsmax noted that Perry also stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. "I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate," Perry was quoted as saying. "In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature — only four voted against this piece of legislation — because it wasn't about immigration; it was about education." By our count, five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition measure. Perry in 2014-15 Via the Nexis news database, we searched for more recent Perry comments about the law. Has his support slackened? In a September 2014 public interview with the Tribune, Perry expressed regret for his "have a heart" comment while he continued to stand by the law, the Tribune then reported. Asked how he would handle the issue if it came up again, he said: "I wouldn’t say they were heartless. I would say I hope I can explain to you why in 2001 this was the right thing to do for the state of Texas." Perry, then poised to leave the governor's office in early 2015, acknowledged that some Republicans intended to repeal the program in the 2015 legislative session. He also suggested the 2001 law came about out of frustration with the security of the U.S.-Mexico border--an aspect we don’t recall from debate at that time. In answer to a question from a UT student, Perry said, "We have to remember that the reason we had to address this as a state was because of the federal government's total and abject failure of securing our border with Mexico. So we don't have the luxury of doing anything other than addressing this, and in 2001, members of the Legislature debated it, they talked about it, and they came to the conclusion that we had some options and the option they chose was in the best economic interests of the state of Texas. "Young people who were here by no fault of their own, and I would suggest in every case that decision wasn't made by a 6-year-old - ‘We're going to the state of Texas so I can go to the University of Texas' - but economically what was in the best interests of the state of Texas was to give these young people the opportunity to be givers rather than takers, to be a constructive part of this society, and that's what we did," Perry said."Economically, what was in the best interest in the state of Texas was to give these young people the opportunity to be givers rather than takers, to be a constructive part of this society," Perry said. Most recently before his comments in South Carolina, Perry stuck by his support for the 2001 law in a January 2015 interview with the New York Times; its news story quoted Perry saying: ''I still support the concept of allowing those people to be contributors to our society rather than takers." We did not spot other comments about the law by Perry prior to the April 2015 exchange that got our attention. Perry aide says no flip-flop By email, we asked Perry’s spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, if Perry’s answers to the Tribune’s April 2015 questions indicated he’s changed his position and his mind on the in-state tuition law. "No," she replied, not elaborating. No Texas DREAM Act Footnote: In his initial question to Perry, Svitek referred to the 2001 law as the Texas DREAM Act. That’s common incorrect shorthand for the 2001 law, which had no memorable title. Rather, the final version of the legislation began: "An act relating to the eligibility of certain persons to qualify as residents of this state for purposes of higher education tuition or to pay tuition at the rate provided to residents of this state." Worth noting, too, the "DREAM" label might leave the misimpression that the law affords beneficiaries a path to citizenship or other immigration-related benefits presented in federal DREAM Act proposals that have yet to win full congressional approval. The Texas law solely focused on particular Texans who might newly qualify to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities. Our ruling In April 2015, Perry declined to take a position on whether Texas should repeal provisions he signed into law enabling certain unauthorized immigrants living in the state to qualify for in-state tuition. That was a step back from his previously consistent defense of the law, though not an all-out repudiation; he also said, as before, that he and lawmakers did the right thing in embracing the change in 2001.

pomt-01930	"Part of the increase in the cost (of higher education) has been because state support has dropped. We now spend, under Governor Walker, more on corrections than we do on higher education."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/27/mary-burke/citing-scott-walker-mary-burke-says-wisconsin-spen/	The state has historically made higher education one of its top budget priorities, along with K-12 education and aid to local governments. But have prisons jumped ahead of higher education? That’s what Democratic gubernatorial challenger Mary Burke claims. "Part of the increase in the cost (of higher education) has been because state support has dropped," she said in a June 2, 2014 discussion with the Fond du Lac Reporter’s editorial board. "We now spend, under Governor Walker, more on corrections than we do on higher education." Burke’s claim really has two parts. First, that state support for higher education has dropped, which has resulted in a greater cost to students. Second, that thanks to Walker’s budgets, we are now spending more on corrections than higher education. Is she right? Education spending At a time when college-trained workers are in high demand, the UW System often feels the heat of state budget cuts. When asked for backup, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed to the state budget, which shows state support for the UW System has dropped in each of the last three budget cycles to 18.99% of the state’s 2013-15 budget. In raw numbers, the state spent $2.273 billion on the UW System before Walker took office and spent $2.247 billion in the 2013-2015 budget. That is a drop of about $26 million. Adding to the squeeze: The UW System’s enrollment rose by 10 percent in the past decade, while the system’s share of state appropriations shrank, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis from August 16, 2012. It’s part of a national trend. "Budget-strapped states have had to cut what they spend on higher education," said a study released by the College Board in 2013. The report said total state appropriations for public universities have fallen by 19 percent nationwide since 2007. So, state support is down. But have costs to Wisconsin students gone up as a result, as Burke claimed? In the past three budgets, tuition increased annually by 5.5 percent from 2007-2012. That is the maximum allowed under state caps that regulate increases. For the 2011-12 academic year, this meant a tuition hike of $422 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and $681 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2012, Gov. Scott Walker launched a systemwide tuition freeze. He extended this freeze to last through the 2015-16 academic year based on projections that the UW System would end 2014 with more than $1.7 billion on hand in reserves. While tuition remains frozen, the Board of Regents in June 2014 hiked student segregated fees by an average of $39 per student and raised the the average cost of housing by $178. Its budget also called for increasing spending by 1.7 percent for the 2014-15 academic year. Tuition freezes are not a sustainable solution to the problem, said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. "In a sense, today’s students are being given tuition freezes because prior students got tuition increases," Berry said. Sinking state support also makes public universities rely more on tuition, fundraising fees, and other revenue sources to cover more of their costs. But these sources can’t cover it all, so this has lead to a strained reliance on them. So students’ families end up with more of the cost, since state and federal aid to students has dried up considerably since 2009-10, according to the College Board study’s co-author Sandy Baum. There is a similar picture when you consider the state’s technical colleges. Since Walker took office, state spending for tech colleges fell by $65 million to $221 million. But they will get a $5 million bump in support for their 2014-15 academic year. Given all this, Burke is essentially on target on this part of the claim. Corrections vs. higher education Now, let’s take a look at the second part. Burke cites the state’s 2013-15 budget as her source for saying that state corrections spending now trumps state support for higher ed. The budget documents show $2.315 billion in state appropriations to corrections, and $68 million less, or $2.247 billion, to the UW System. It was in Walker’s first budget, covering 2011-13, that the lines crossed. This chart shows the recent trend: Budget UW System appropriations (GPR) UW System percentage of total GPR expenditures Corrections appropriations (GPR) Corrections percentage of total GPR expenditures 2003-2005 1,908,506,300 8.51% 1,702,971,700 7.59% 2005-2007 1,930,780,800 7.49% 1,802,134,800 6.99% 2007-2009 2,237,870,400 8.03% 2,167,424,300 7.78% 2009-2011 2,273,309,900 8.215% 2,252,212,400 8.139% 2011-2013 2,095,251,600 7.218% 2,250,923,800 7.754% 2013-2015 2,247,320,900 7.398% $2,315,095,600 7.621% The 2011 Journal Sentinel story that examined more than 20 years of budgets found this trend has been in the works regardless of which party was in charge of state government, through policy changes and shifts in budget priorities. Changes in sentencing and correctional policy launched in the 1980s led to the state’s rising prison population in the 1990s as more and more prisons were being built, the Journal Sentinel story found. Since 1990, state spending on corrections grew by 620%, without inflation. Spending tapered off in 2012 and has been mostly flat in the last decade, Berry said. The state’s inmate population also grew in the past 20 years -- from about 7,000 to 22,000 inmates. This requires more personnel costs to guard, feed, and provide medical care to them so it will be difficult to cut state spending on corrections anytime soon, the Journal Sentinel story notes. One last point. The higher education vs. corrections comparison Burke does not include state spending on technical colleges and the Higher Education Aids Board, the board which runs students’ financial aid. Together, they add another $512.7 million to the higher education tab in the 2013-’15 budget. When the tech colleges and aid board are included, corrections no longer comes out on top. The state still spends slightly more on higher education than corrections when those items are included. Our rating Burke said that "Part of the increase in the cost (of higher education) has been because state support has dropped. We now spend, under Governor Walker, more on corrections than we do on higher education." The first part of Burke’s claim is on target. The drop in state support for higher education -- even with the recent tuition freeze -- has meant increased costs for the students. The lines crossed between corrections and the UW System during Walker’s time in office. But the trend had been heading in that direction for years so the blame does not fall squarely on Walker. What’s more, when spending on technical colleges is considered, the lines have not yet crossed. We rate Burke’s statement Half True.

pomt-06656	Social Security is a "Ponzi scheme."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-social-security-ponzi-scheme/	One of the most talked-about comments from the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s claim that Social Security is a "Ponzi scheme." At the Sept. 12, 2011, GOP debate in Tampa, Perry toned down his rhetoric somewhat -- but didn’t disown the phrase that caused such a stir. The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme became fodder for sparring between Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- the two candidates many observers consider the frontrunners for the nomination. Romney and his camp argued that the comparison of the retirement-security program for older Americans to an insidious financial fraud raised questions about Perry’s commitment to the program, which remains popular among Americans, and particularly older Americans who are statistically likelier to vote. Here’s the original quote and context from the Sept. 7 debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.: "People who are on Social Security today, men and women who are receiving those benefits today, are individuals at my age that are in line pretty quick to get them, they don't need to worry about anything. But I think the Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program, and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you're paying into a program that's going to be there. Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right." Perry didn’t explicitly back away from the term, but he has sought to reframe the issue in a less polarizing fashion. In an op-ed in USA Today titled, "Rick Perry: I am going to be honest with the American people," Perry didn’t mention the phrase "Ponzi scheme," but he reiterated his concerns about Social Security’s financial outlook using less controversial language. "Our elected leaders must have the strength to speak frankly about entitlement reform if we are to right our nation's financial course and get the USA working again," he said, adding, "We must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix Social Security and make it financially viable for generations to come." During the Sept. 12 CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Perry why he had changed his tone in the op-ed. Perry maintained the cooler tone but didn’t back away from the terminology. "Well, first off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something," he said. "Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there. "But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face, young mid-career professionals or kids that are my children's age and look them in the eye and said, listen, this is a broken system. It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, here is how we're going to reform it. "We're going to transform it for those in those mid-career ages, but we're going to fix it so that our young Americans that are going out into the workforce today will know without a doubt that there were some people who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth." As Perry noted, he was hardly the first person to compare Social Security to a Ponzi scheme; it has popped up frequently as an analogy among conservatives for many years. And in the wake of Perry’s comment, conservatives have gleefully dug up examples of liberals writing similar comparisons. A Sept. 12 article in the conservative National Review Online by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, detailed Ponzi comparisons made by a half-dozen left-of-center columnists, including William Raspberry, Max Frankel and Michael Kinsley. Still, Perry’s use of the comparison in the midst of a heated Republican primary campaign has attracted far more public and media attention than previous mentions -- and the fact many commentators have made this case doesn’t mean the comparison is justified. So we thought it would be worth recapping the evidence we’ve found for and against the idea that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. ***** So what is a Ponzi scheme? PolitiFact Texas looked at this question when researching the issue for a fact-check of Perry’s Ponzi-related comments from November 2010, when he was touring to promote his book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington. According to an online post by the Social Security Administration, the term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his "profits" consisted of money paid in by other investors. "The reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy is that the geometric progression it depends on is unsustainable," the government post says. "You must continually get more and more new people into the system to pay off the promises to the earlier members." In contrast, the administration says, Social Security is more like a "pay-as-you-go" system transferring payroll tax payments by American workers to American retirees. Its web post closes: "The first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days." When PolitiFact Texas asked Perry for back-up on his Ponzi scheme description, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said that "this year, Social Security is expected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Americans today are being forced to pay for a program that they will no longer see any benefit from or return on their investment as it currently stands, similar to a Ponzi scheme." So how valid is the comparison? Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme, which by definition is both fraudulent and unsustainable. "First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled," Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. "...Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns." Second, he wrote, "A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted. That's when the last people to participate are out of luck; the music stops and there's nowhere to sit. It's true that Social Security faces a huge burden — and a significant, long-term financing problem — in light of retiring Baby Boomers. … But Social Security can be, and has been, tweaked and modified to reflect changes in the size of the taxpaying workforce and the number of beneficiaries. It would take great political will, but the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing." Third, Zuckoff wrote, "Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see "Social") resolved to create a safety net (see "Security") in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones.That might rankle, but it's not fraud... None of this is to suggest that Social Security is a perfect system or that there aren't sizeable problems facing the incoming administration and Congress. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi himself, who died in a hospital charity ward with only enough money for his burial, would never have recognized it as his own." We agree with Zuckoff’s interpretation. We rated Perry's November 2010 comparison of Social Security and Ponzi schemes False, and we stand by that ruling. The comparison still deserves a rating of False.

pomt-11861	Says Jake Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a "beautiful phrase" after a terrorist attack in New York.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/02/sebastian-gorka/seb-gorka-misquotes-jake-tappers-comment-about-all/	In an interview on Fox News, former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka mischaracterized a statement CNN’s Jake Tapper made about the Arabic exclamation "Allahu Akbar" during coverage of a terrorist attack in New York. Gorka appeared on Sean Hannity’s Nov. 1 show to discuss the Oct. 31 attack, when 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a truck into a crowd of bicyclists and pedestrians in Manhattan. Eight people were killed and another 12 were injured. Saipov is believed to have been influenced by the terrorist group known as ISIS, or the Islamic State. Eyewitnesses said they saw Saipov shouting "Allahu Akbar," a common Muslim phrase that affirms faith. Hannity and Gorka, along with former Milwaukee County, Wis., sheriff David Clarke, were discussing Tapper’s coverage the day of the attack. "I’m still trying to struggle with what kind of mind goes on live television as seven bodies are on the streets of Manhattan, and a child, and talks about the ‘beautiful phrase’ Allahu Akbar," Gorka said. "Where does that motivation come from for Jake Tapper?" But that’s not what Tapper said. During The Lead on Oct. 31, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz told Tapper about witnesses hearing Saipov shout the phrase. "The Arabic chant Allahu Akbar, ‘God is great,’ sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances, and too often we hear it being said in moments like this," Tapper said as an explanation. Tapper clearly is saying that "Allahu Akbar" is often said during joyous occasions, not implying that a terrorist’s use of the phrase is somehow a good thing. Fox News’ Jason Chaffetz pointed out Tapper said "how beautiful the phrase ‘Allahu Akbar’ can be," but later walked back his comments. Conservative website DailyCaller.com also criticized Tapper, then updated their story. The CNN anchor refuted Fox News’ coverage of his coverage on Twitter on Nov 1. "Fox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack)," he wrote in a thread about a tweet to the Chaffetz clip that Fox News later deleted. "‘Allahu Akbar’ is a prayer; if we don’t understand how radical Islamic terrorists justify their evil using religion, West cannot defeat it." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Tapper responded to Gorka by tweeting, "And, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a "beautiful phrase." Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie." See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Tapper had no further comment to add when we reached out to him. Gorka did not respond to our attempts to contact him. The Council on American-Islamic Relations pointed us to a Nov. 1 opinion piece on CNN.com explaining the phrase. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, wrote that "the words ‘Allahu Akbar’ simply mean ‘God is greater.’ It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns." "They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them." Suleiman also pointed out that U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had said on Fox News in 2013 that while "Allahu Akbar" has been appropriated by radical Islamists as a battlecry, the words themselves aren’t to be feared. "McCain said the phrase is no more troubling than a Christian saying ‘Thank God,’ " Suleiman noted. Our ruling Gorka claimed Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a "beautiful phrase." What Tapper actually said was that the phrase is used "under the most beautiful of circumstances" by Muslims, and not just by radicals committing terrorist acts. Gorka misquoted Tapper and ignored the larger context of his comment. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-12462	In some cases, a sex offender "who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry" would be able to drive for Uber or Lyft when ride-hailing is allowed upstate in July	true	/new-york/statements/2017/may/08/thomas-croci/some-sex-offenders-will-be-allowed-drive-uber-and-/	When ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft start in upstate New York in July, will registered sex offenders be allowed behind the wheel? Republicans in the State Senate have introduced a bill that would prohibit all sex offenders from driving for the ride-hailing companies. State Sen. Thomas D. Croci, R-Long Island, said that when lawmakers passed legislation this year allowing the companies to operate upstate, they left a loophole allowing some who are on New York's Sex Offender Registry to drive for the companies. Lower-level sex offenders can become drivers seven years after their prison release "Allowing anyone who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry to be drivers for ride-share companies presents an unacceptable risk to our citizens," Croci said in a statement. Is Croci right? Can some sex offenders drive for Uber and Lyft? What’s in the law? Lawmakers in April added a new section to the state Vehicle and Traffic Law allowing ride-hailing companies to operate outside of New York City. The legislation outlines who can drive for those companies and what type of auto insurance they must carry. The law requires ride-hailing companies to perform a background check on prospective drivers. They have to check New York’s Sex Offender Registry and the National Sex Offender Public Registry. Those who are on the national registry are barred from ever driving for ride-hailing companies. But not all registered sex offenders are on it. New York state recognizes three levels of sex offenders, based on their risk of committing another sex crime. Those categorized as Level 1 pose the lowest risk. Level 2 and Level 3 offenders pose moderate and high risks, respectively. New York state’s Level 2 and Level 3 offenders are listed on the national registry, and they remain on it for life. So they will never be able to drive for the companies. The waiting period New York state's Level 1 offenders are not on the national registry. And, state law does not allow information about Level 1 sex offenders to be posted online. Federal agencies have access to the information but state law blocks it from being posted on the national registry. That does not mean all Level 1 sex offenders can drive for the ride-hailing companies. Level 1 offenders must wait seven years after their release from jail or prison before they are allowed to drive. If the offenders are not incarcerated, the seven-year waiting period starts when they are convicted, according to state law. It is not just sex offenders who can eventually drive for ride-hailing companies.Several other crimes have a waiting period to drive for Uber or Lyft, according to the law. Someone convicted of manslaughter or a burglary would be eligible to drive for Uber or Lyft seven years after their conviction or release. A misdemeanor offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs has a three-year waiting period. Our ruling Croci, a state senator from Long Island, said that in some cases a sex offender "who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry" would be able to drive for Uber or Lyft. Level 1 sex offenders are not listed on the national sex offender registry, and would therefore be allowed to drive for ride-hailing companies seven years after they are released from prison or, if they were not incarcerated, after their conviction.

pomt-09653	"In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/03/barack-obama/obama-says-extremists-sent-us-afghanistan-pakistan/	President Barack Obama has decided to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and he made the case for the increase in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. "I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan," Obama said. "This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. "This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al-Qaida can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al-Qaida, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region." An alert reader asked us about Obama's comments on capturing extremists in the United States who had been sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was apparently referring to the case of Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old Colorado resident whom authorities arrested on Sept. 19, 2009. Zazi was charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. Authorities say Zazi received training from al-Qaida in Pakistan on how to build explosives and was constructing a bomb from chemicals he purchased at a beauty supply shop in Colorado. Zazi then traveled to New York City on Sept. 10 "in furtherance of the criminal plan," according to the Justice Department. Authorities say he left the city after being tipped off that he was under surveillance; he was arrested a short time later. Zazi is actually a legal resident of the United States. His family arrived in the United States in the early 1990s, according to news reports, and Zazi went to high school in New York City, speaks fluent English, and ran a coffee cart for several years in lower Manhattan. Zazi has traveled to Pakistan several times to visit friends and family, and authorities say it was during his last trip at the end of 2008 that Zazi went to an al-Qaida-run training camp and received instructions in explosives and weapons. His attorney said Zazi did travel to Pakistan and purchase items at the supply shop, but neither of those activities are illegal, and that the government has not indicted anyone else to prove charges of conspiracy. (Zazi's father and another man were arrested on charges of lying to investigators.) Prosecutors told a judge on Dec. 3 that they expect to file additional charges soon. Obama said during his speech, "In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror." Is it fair to say Zazi was "sent here" from the border region? We could argue this point, since Zazi lived in the United States for many years, but it seems trivial: If people receive training in al-Qaida camps in the border region to commit acts of terror, does it really matter if they were originally from that region or just visiting temporarily? We'll note here for clarity's sake that Zazi was a U.S. resident who allegedly visited the training camps before returning to the United States. We don't believe it's quite accurate for Obama to flatly state that the arrested men were intent on committing "new acts of terror" when the trial has not yet started. In fact, there are many questions surrounding the case, most notably who Zazi's co-conspirators might have been. The other two men arrested so far were charged with lying to investigators, not committing acts of terror. If a court had convicted Zazi, we would likely rate Obama's statement True. The Justice Department is backing Obama's statement, but these men have not been convicted. Given that, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-13028	"We spend less than 2 percent more every year. That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers."	true	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/02/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-spending-increases/	The Cato Institute recently issued fiscal policy report cards to America’s governors, and the libertarian think tank gave Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a B for his "impressive tax cutting." But Cato also warned New York state’s spending is rising briskly. Since then Cuomo has boasted about the state’s restrained spending since he took office in January 2011. Holding the line on spending let Albany pass on the savings to taxpayers, he said. "We spend less than 2 percent more every year," Cuomo said. "That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers. No other governor has reduced spending as much as I have, Democrat or Republican. George Pataki, Nelson Rockefeller, Republicans. I spend less." So who’s right? Is the state’s spending rising briskly, or has it been restrained? We checked if Cuomo posted the smallest spending increases since Rockefeller. Tracking the spending The state has kept consistent data on spending since Nelson Rockefeller’s days as governor. The state Department of Budget says the data dates back about 57 years. Data before then is unconfirmed or doesn’t exist. Rockefeller held office from 1959 to 1973, when he left to become President Gerald Ford’s vice president. Malcolm Wilson, his lieutenant governor, served out the rest of his term until 1974. Annual spending increases averaged 11.1 percent during the four terms of Rockefeller and Wilson. Here’s how the other governors, with legislative support, spent since then: Hugh L. Carey increased spending by an average of 8.7 percent each year during his two terms in office from 1975 to 1982. Mario M. Cuomo increased spending by an average of 6.9 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1983 to 1994. George E. Pataki increased spending by an average of 5.1 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1995 to 2006. Eliot L. Spitzer took office in 2007 but remained governor only until 2008 when scandal prompted him to resign. David Paterson, his lieutenant governor, took over for the remainder of the term ending in 2010. Spending increased by an average of 3.8 percent annually between 2007 and 2010. Cuomo’s record Cuomo has approached budgeting differently than other governors. Instead of using anticipated revenue to craft a spending plan, he’s imposed an annual 2 percent cap on state spending. This year’s budget marked the sixth consecutive year of spending increases at or lower than 2 percent. In Cuomo’s six years in office, spending has increased an average of 1.4 percent each year, when adjusted to exclude federal emergency aid for disasters like Hurricane Sandy recovery. Without adjusting for federal aid, average annual spending under Cuomo rose 2.2 percent, still less than his predecessors dating back to Rockefeller. So what’s Cato talking about? The Cato Institute’s report in October says the state’s general fund "increased more than 8 percent in 2016 and is expected to increase more than 5 percent in 2017." The report’s numbers are correct, but they do not show the whole picture of the state’s spending. The Cato report refers only to the state’s general fund, not total state spending. New York state over the decades has created hundreds of special revenue accounts that exist outside the general fund. The general fund is the largest but only makes up about 60 percent of state spending. The state has cut spending in the other accounts to come to the 2 percent or less increases during Cuomo’s time in office, according to the Department of Budget. Our ruling At an event in Fishkill last month, Cuomo said, "We spend less than 2 percent more every year. That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers." It’s true that Cuomo has enacted the lowest spending increases since state government started tracking that data. No comparable data exists before the Rockefeller administration.

pomt-13559	Says Donald Trump’s "Make America Great Again" caps are "made in China."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/aug/24/celia-israel/celia-israel-repeats-unverified-claim-donald-trump/	Not welcoming Donald Trump to the Texas capital, a legislator said she can’t wait for Hillary Clinton’s election and improved chances of comprehensive immigration reform. State Rep. Celia Israel, joining fellow Austin Democrats at a press conference before Trump’s August 2016 Austin events, also declared that voters wouldn’t forget the Republican presidential nominee’s vows to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to round up and deport people living here without legal authorization. "Your words are cheap, Mr. Trump," Israel said, "as cheap as the made-in-China gimme caps that proclaim that you will make America great again." Hold on; PunditFact in October 2015 found incorrect and ridiculous tweets claiming that Trump’s "Make America Great Again" caps were made in China. Snopes.com reached a similar conclusion; the campaign hats were made in California, each organization found, with knockoffs sewn elsewhere. At the time, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told PunditFact: "All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA." Hicks was more specific when we asked about Israel’s comment, saying by email: "All official campaign product, including the hats, are made in the USA." A November 2015 Los Angeles Times news feature story centered on a tour of Cali-Fame, the company credited with making the hats. It quoted Brian Kennedy, a co-owner, saying the company--employing about 100 people, many of them Latino--had been making hats for Trump’s golf courses for about a decade, which is how Kennedy got connected with the campaign, the story said. The story called the made-in-China claim about Trump’s hats a "short-lived rumor." We’re unsure about that. A web search combining Trump and "hats made in China" yielded more than 3,000 results. Meantime, a July 2016 Associated Press news story said that its commissioned tests of fabric in five Trump campaign hats showed that one sampled hat was stitched from cloth of unknown, possibly foreign origin. Federal law requires that items labeled "Made in USA" be made from materials "all or virtually all" from the United States, the story said. Kennedy told the AP: "I'm not using imported materials. We're playing by the rules." Hicks, the Trump spokeswoman, previously confirmed other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, which continues to be sold for $25 to $30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at Trump’s campaign store. Separately, Kennedy said the company had been making that style of hat since the 1970s. PunditFact found the hats were distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company. Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said: "Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA." For this fact check, we called Cali-Fame to check on changes in where the hats are made, if any. Tim Kennedy, a co-owner, declined to comment except to direct us to Hicks. There’s heft to claims that some Trump gear has been made outside the U.S. In 2011, then-Late Show host David Letterman brought out various buttoned shirts and ties included in the Trump brand clothing line for Macy’s (which later dumped Trump after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July 2015). Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs. Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying "it’s very hard to get product that’s not made in China" because of the country’s currency manipulation. By email, Israel initially told us she’d misspoken. Asked if she intended her China mention to be factual, Israel said by phone: "I did. I am surprised that the hats were not made in China because everything else around him seems to be outsourced." She said she’d also seen an ad featuring the Letterman interview of Trump about his namesake items made abroad. Our ruling Israel said Trump’s Make America Great Again caps are made in China. Far as we can tell, that’s still not correct--as widely reported starting 10 months ago. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-03126	"1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/sep/17/van-jones/van-jones-says-just-1-percent-nra-endorsed-candida/	Both supporters and critics of the National Rifle Association have acknowledged that the pro-gun group flexes significant political muscle. But Van Jones, one of the hosts of CNN’s Crossfire, suggested in a recent show that the NRA’s reputation of invincibility is exaggerated. "The NRA is not popular on a big scale," Jones said. "They can cherry-pick their focus. ... 1 percent of candidates that they endorsed in 2012 won -- 1 percent." We wondered whether the NRA was really as ineffectual in 2012 as Jones suggested. Neither Jones nor the NRA responded to inquiries for this story, but we suspect that Jones was referring to research released after the 2012 election by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics. The foundation looked at a variety of politically active groups to determine how much of the money they spent on the 2012 election was directed toward supporting candidates who won or opposing candidates who lost, as opposed to money spent on candidates who lost or against candidates who won. The foundation then produced a "return on investment" -- the percentage of the group’s money that was spent on races that ended with the group’s desired result. In 2012, a year when President Barack Obama won a second term and the Democrats held the Senate, a number of liberal groups fared well on this score: Affiliates of Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union and the League of Conservation Voters finished with returns on investment of 80 percent and higher. By contrast, conservative or pro-business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the Karl Rove-founded American Crossroads finished with percentages in the single digits. So how did the NRA do? Sunlight looked at two of its affiliates -- the Political Victory Fund and the Institute for Legislative Action. (The two groups are organized under different parts of the tax code, but they have the same goal -- promoting candidates who support the NRA’s agenda.) According to Sunlight, the Political Victory Fund spent $11,159,493 but generated a minuscule 0.83 percent return on investment. A big reason for the poor showing was that more than four of every five dollars the group spent was either against Obama or for Mitt Romney in the presidential race, and of course Obama won. Meanwhile, the return on investment for the $7,448,017 spent by the Institute for Legislative Action was a bit higher -- 10.74 percent. So right off the bat, Jones’ summary is misleading -- one of the two NRA affiliates produced a success rate of better than 1 percent. But we see an even bigger concern: Jones was talking about endorsements, but the Sunlight Foundation was looking at money. And the NRA has endorsed candidates without necessarily spending money. In fact, while receiving money from the NRA is nice for any candidate that supports its goals, an NRA endorsement even in the absence of money is a treasured asset. Once an endorsement is made, a candidate can reap benefits among voters who trust the NRA. It can be touted on a campaign’s lawn signs, at candidate forums, in newspaper profiles and on social media. To more accurately gauge Jones’ claim about endorsements, we tried to assemble a more complete list of endorsements, regardless of whether they came attached to money. First, we tallied the number of candidates who had received funding (or found themselves targets of opposition funding) from either of the two NRA affiliates. Then we added any additional candidates for whom the NRA issued an endorsement news release in 2012. To remain in tune with Sunlight’s methodology, we limited our list to federal candidates only. Ultimately, we found 49 NRA endorsements that ended up as "failures" -- that is, where the group backed a losing candidate or failed to defeat a candidate they opposed. But the NRA notched an even higher number of "successes" in 2012 -- 72 candidates that the group helped carry to victory, or that it helped defeat. That’s about a 60 percent success rate for endorsements -- far higher than the 1 percent Jones cited. Our ruling Jones said "1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won." An independent analysis did find that about 1 percent of money spent by one particular NRA affiliate either helped elect a winning candidate or helped defeat a losing one. But that ignores a second NRA affiliate that did much better, and the study in question looked at dollars spent -- not endorsements. From the data we compiled, the NRA’s endorsements were about 60 percent successful. We rate Jones’ claim False.	None	Van Jones	None	None	None	2013-09-17T12:13:14	2013-09-13	['None']

pomt-03736	Says rejecting federal aid to expand Medicaid in Texas will "send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor."	false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/12/lon-burnam/lon-burnam-says-rejecting-expansion-would-send-9-b/	State Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, said the Texas House was throwing money away when it voted March 4, 2013, to reject federal Medicaid expansion dollars. In a press release, Burnam said refusing to expand would accomplish nothing except to "send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor." Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Under the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare), the federal government would pay all costs for the first three years for Texas and other states that extend Medicaid to households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. To offset such federal costs, congressional Democrats wrote new taxes into the law, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry, alongside a number of measures intended to reduce the growth of Medicare spending. Texas officials have estimated that from 2014 through 2023, the state would receive $79 billion in federal money to cover the adults who are newly eligible under the higher income limit. Because states begin paying a share of the costs after three years (gradually rising from 5 percent in 2017 to 10 percent in 2020 and beyond), Texas would chip in an estimated $8.8 billion over ten years from its own general revenue fund. Burnam spokesman Conor Kenny told us by email that Burnam’s number was based on another state estimate for the same 10 years: $90.6 billion, which includes the $79 billion in Medicaid expansion money plus $11.6 billion the feds will send Texas to help cover people who are already Medicaid-eligible but not enrolled. Those folks will have to sign up for insurance plans when Obamacare’s individual mandate kicks in Jan. 1, 2014. Burnam’s $9 billion figure, Kenny said, was the average amount of federal money coming in per year ($90.6 billion divided by 10) calculated in Feb. 6, 2013, legislative testimony from the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. Both the $79 billion in expansion money and the $90.6 billion total for expansion plus newly-enrolled-but-already-eligible Texans are 2012 estimates from the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman sent us a March 8, 2013, presentation from the agency and a spreadsheet with estimated year-by-year federal and state costs. Burnam also relied, Kenny said, on part of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s Jan. 14, 2013, state-of-the-state speech, in which she said not expanding Medicaid would mean that $2 billion of "Arizona’s tax dollars would simply be passed to another state – generating jobs and providing health care for citizens in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico or any other expansion state." Her office did not respond to our inquiries about Brewer’s basis for the statements. Kenny also said that he had talked to Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. First, a misconception: Burnam referred to "$9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans," much as Brewer referred to $2 billion in Arizona tax dollars. But the money a state gets won’t come directly from the federal taxes its own residents paid. Experts told us that federal payments to states for expanding their Medicaid programs -- some 25 states had signed on when Burnam spoke -- will come out of the U.S. Treasury, where everybody’s tax dollars go to mingle. So in a general sense, Texas dollars might be a part of any Medicaid expansion payment to any state. There’s just no telling which paid-in-Texas federal taxes go where. And money won’t be sent from one state to another, the experts told us. In fact, there’s no dedicated dollar amount for Medicaid expansion. Rather, the states will be sent federal money for new participants as they come in. We spoke with two of Burnam’s sources, Park and Center for Public Policy Priorities associate director Anne Dunkelberg, as well as two Washington, D.C., groups -- the American Action Forum, a conservative think-tank, and Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for the health care law. Dunkelberg contrasted Medicaid expansion with the federal Children's Health Insurance Program, in which states do get block grants. Twice, Texas lawmakers have decided against taking the CHIP money, she told us by phone, and "those funds really did get redistributed to other states." Similarly, Park told us the Medicaid expansion funding is "not a fixed pot of money." Whether one state chooses to participate or not does not affect the other states or the money they receive, he said. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Foundation and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told us by phone that when revenues are collected from the new Obamacare taxes, that money is not set aside. "Every single one of those dollars flows into the federal treasury" with other tax revenues, Holtz-Eakin said, and "there’s no link" to the dollars that states will then receive in the Obamacare spending programs. "They’re all stirred together," he said. Spokesman David Lemmon of Families USA told us by phone that any projected Medicaid expansion money Texas turns down "is not redistributed to other states." But if Texas does opt out, he said, "certainly Texas taxpayers are not able to benefit from that money." Similarly, Dunkelberg said it’s "true that Texas taxpayers are helping to fund the expansions of all the other states. And we don’t get any break on our federal taxes (if we decide) not to participate in Medicaid expansion." Our ruling Burnam said that if Texas fails to expand Medicaid, $9 billion of Texas taxpayers’ money would flow toward insuring the working poor in other states. Burnam meant $9 billion per year over 10 years, though that clarification didn’t appear in his press release. But: Texans’ tax dollars aren’t handled separately from others in this program. What Texas decides won’t affect how much money is available for other states. Burnam’s $9 billion is based on a $90 billion ten-year estimate that includes $11.6 billion Texas would get whether it expands Medicaid or not. We rate Burnam’s statement False.

pomt-03982	"After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/12/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-created-half-million-manu/	At several points in his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama noted the importance of manufacturing to the nation’s economy. "Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing," Obama said. "After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again." The claim about job numbers is an update of a line Obama included in his acceptance speech at the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. We checked that one and rated it True. The main difference between Obama’s two versions was that the timeline in the most recent claim has been extended by six months. Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs. Shedding jobs for more than 10 years It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce. Between March and April 1998 and December 2009 -- the decade-plus that Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.6 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had been "shedding jobs for more than 10 years" by the time he took office. Added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to January 2013 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 490,000. We think that qualifies as "about 500,000," as Obama put it. It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the "decade of decline." The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline. Our ruling The rise in manufacturing jobs that Obama is referring to is modest compared to the prior decade’s decline, but he has described the numbers carefully. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04147	Says that under Texas law, it takes six years to close a failing school.	false	/texas/statements/2013/jan/01/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-under-texas-law-it-takes-six-y/	A headline-grabbing plan to help students transfer isn’t the only way Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst wants to handle "unacceptable" schools in Texas. "Currently under Texas law, it takes six years to close down a failing school. That’s nuts. I’m going to move for legislation to make it two years," Dewhurst told the Dallas regional chamber of commerce Nov. 19, 2012, according to a news story from KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas. Well, "nuts" is an opinion, but "six years" is something we can check. We asked Dewhurst and spokesman Matt Hirsch for details and support for the claim but did not hear back. Dewhurst repeated his call to "shorten that time period" and also made it clear he was referring to academic failure during a Dec. 19, 2012, news conference announcing a proposal to give businesses tax credits for donations to a scholarship fund helping students switch schools. Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email that it takes six years of "unacceptable" academic ratings before the Texas schools commissioner is absolutely required to shut down a campus. But by law, Ratcliffe said, the commissioner can close a school for purely academic reasons after three years. That’s "two years of academically unacceptable ratings plus one year in which the school fails to successfully implement a reconstitution plan," she said. We reviewed the Texas education code and found that it clearly states that "after a campus has been identified as unacceptable for two consecutive school years, the commissioner shall order the reconstitution of the campus." That process, Ratcliffe said, typically includes replacing faculty members. If the commissioner is not satisfied with the progress under the reconstitution plan, he or she can order "repurposing" of the campus, install new management or order it closed. So, the commissioner could close a school after three years. If the school receives three consecutive "unacceptables" after reconstitution, the law says, the commissioner "shall order" the campus be repurposed, be put under "alternative management" or closed. The only exception is that if it appears the school will improve its rating in the next year, the commissioner can grant another year’s leeway -- bringing the maximum time to six years. Schools can be -- and have been -- closed more quickly for "financial, health and safety or other reasons," Ratcliffe said. "Some of those had academic problems; just not five or six years of low ratings." Charter schools -- public schools under private management -- can also be shut down more quickly for violating a charter contract, Ratcliffe said, which can involve academics. Only three public schools have been closed for purely academic reasons since the current accountability system began in 1993, Ratcliffe said. Each of those cases took five to six years. Johnston High School in the Austin school district and Sam Houston High School in the Houston district were ordered to close in 2008, after five years at "unacceptable" for Johnston, according to a June 5, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news story, and six years of "unacceptable" ratings at Sam Houston, according to a June 6, 2008, Houston Chronicle news story. Pearce Middle School, also in the Austin district, was ordered to close in 2009 after five years of "unacceptable" ratings, according to a July 9, 2009, Statesman news story. Agency data Ratcliffe sent us for 2004 through 2011 showed that of the 223 schools ordered to reconstitute, 205 achieved sufficient improvements to get out of the danger zone before an ultimate sanction was triggered. Fourteen schools had posted more than two consecutive "unacceptable" years but hadn’t yet reached five. Ratcliffe said that although a new accountability system is in the works, the six-year requirement won’t change unless the state law governing closure is modified by the Legislature -- for example, if Dewhurst’s two-year suggestion were adopted. Our ruling Dewhurst said it takes six years under Texas law to close a failing school. That’s the maximum, and it’s usually taken nearly that long, but by law a commissioner can order closure after just three years. We rate Dewhurst’s statement as False.

pomt-02558	"We’re trailing every other state in the Midwest in terms of job creation since January of 2011."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/02/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-trails-every-other-midwe/	Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke says Wisconsin’s job-creation record not only lags behind the national average, but ranks as worst in the Midwest since Gov. Scott Walker took office. "I think we have to focus on what’s going to create jobs here," Burke, the former state Commerce secretary, said Jan. 14, 2014 in Kenosha. "That’s how you’re going to get taxes down, if you grow the economy." Burke added this, according to WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee: "You have to get the base larger in Wisconsin — and we haven’t seen that. We’re trailing every other state in the Midwest in terms of job creation since January of 2011." Wisconsin’s national job-growth ranking of 37th was highlighted in December when quarterly jobs data through June 2013 was released. Other figures suggest that Walker, now in the final year of his term, is only about 40 percent of the way to his goal of creating 250,000 private sector jobs in his four-year term. But is the state last among its neighbors? When we asked the Burke campaign to back up its claim, it pointed us to a chart on the Capital Times website that tracks monthly job-creation data covering January 2011 -- Walker’s first month as governor -- through November 2013, the latest available at that time the statement was made. The chart showed Wisconsin’s 4 percent growth rate trailing its four adjoining neighbors -- by a wide margin in two cases (Michigan and Minnesota), and by slim margins in the other two (Iowa and Illinois). We confirmed Wisconsin’s ranking by examining the data, which is reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as state of Wisconsin officials. We’re not done yet. Regular PolitiFact readers know there is more than one way to paint by numbers on employment. There are two distinctly different sources of jobs data. Burke cites the Current Employment Statistics figures, gleaned from a monthly survey of business establishments that provides estimates of employment, hours and earnings data by industry. Those monthly figures are frequently cited by researchers and the media, but the are estimates subject to revision, sometimes quite large ones. They are based on surveys of about 3 percent of businesses but are valued for their timeliness. The more accurate, if less timely, source of jobs data comes from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which is drawn from a census of 98 percent of U.S. businesses. The counts, though, lag behind real time by six to nine months. How does Wisconsin fare under the quarterly data, which economists consider the most credible source of jobs data? We looked at the data reported in December 2012, the latest quarterly data that can be directly compared to the numbers from December 2010, the baseline month just before the start of Walker’s term in January 2011. In the two-year period, Wisconsin’s growth rate of 2.8 percent trailed Illinois (2.98), Minnesota (4.3), Iowa (3.4) and Michigan (5.99). Wisconsin was not last at every measuring point along the way, but the bottom line growth rate trailed the pack. Geography question Burke’s claim, though, raises the question of how to define the "Midwest." She said "Midwest," but cited contiguous states as evidence. The Journal Sentinel typically adds Indiana and Ohio into the mix in jobs stories. The federal agency that reports the jobs data uses an even broader definition preferred by the U.S. Census Bureau. It adds Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas to the Midwest, with the states that touch Wisconsin. In this broader region, Wisconsin no longer brings up the rear. The quarterly data shows Kansas and Missouri with slower growth than Wisconsin over two years. And the less-reliable but more up-to-date monthly surveys put Ohio, Nebraska and Missouri behind Wisconsin. Wisconsin fared somewhat better compared with its Midwest rivals early in Walker’s tenure, but by late summer 2011 was lagging behind its adjoining states. Manufacturing hiring growth slowed to nothing in the one-year period ending June 2013. We came across a couple of interesting side notes from the monthly data. Among Wisconsin’s contiguous neighbors, Minnesota and Iowa have rebounded to the best employment level they had in 2008, the year the Great Recession gained steam nationally. Minnesota, in fact, is actually a bit above that level; Iowa is right at it. Wisconsin is still 1.6 percent off its 2008 high, while Illinois and Michigan are more than 2.5 percent shy of it. We should note that PolitiFact Wisconsin uses a hybrid of quarterly jobs figures from 2011 and 2012 plus monthly jobs numbers from 2013 to provide a rough up-to-date gauge of progress toward Walker’s 250,000 goal. State Workforce Development officials point out that when applying that counting method to other states’ job-growth, Illinois and Ohio come in with lower growth than Wisconsin since Walker’s term began. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the monthly and quarterly numbers are separate survey tools and are not designed to be used in combination to compare states. Our rating Burke claimed that under Walker, private job growth is lowest in the Midwest. The claim is accurate for adjoining states, based on either the monthly or quarterly jobs data. But viewed another way, three states in the Census Bureau-defined "Midwest" -- Ohio, Nebraska and Missouri -- show slower private job-growth rates than Wisconsin. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-00663	"We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts 1 million people a year, legally. No other country in the world even comes close to that."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/may/13/marco-rubio/does-united-states-have-highest-number-immigrants-/	The United States leads the world in terms of the number of immigrants it allows to enter the country, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. "We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts 1 million people a year, legally," Rubio said at the National Review Forum May 1. "No other country in the world even comes close to that." Is Rubio correct that no other country in the world comes close to the number of legal immigrants that come to the United States each year? Legal immigration First, some background on Rubio’s efforts to change the nation’s immigration laws. Rubio and seven other senators crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate in 2013. The bill included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, albeit one with significant hurdles. But the House wasn’t interested in that approach, and after that died, Rubio said he still favored changing immigration law through piecemeal bills. We sent Rubio’s spokesman a summary of our findings, and he noted a similar fact-check we did in 2012. Immigration has been such a hot topic in the 2016 presidential race, though, that we decided to take a fresh look at the numbers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security keeps track of the number of new legal permanent residents a year, and in 2013 (the most recent year available) it was 990,553. Of this number, about 46 percent were new arrivals, and about 54 percent were people already in the United States whose status was upgraded to "permanent." For data on the number of new immigrants in the United States compared with other countries, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Formed in 1961, OECD collects data on a wide range of topics, including immigration. We looked at the data in two ways for 2013: first, the sheer number of legal immigrants and secondly, the number of new immigrants as a percentage of the population. Comparing the sheer number of new legal immigrants in the United States with other countries is complicated because countries use different requirements to define an "immigrant" for their statistics. For example, Germany -- which has had big increases in immigration in recent years -- uses a broad definition of an immigrant that catches a lot of short-term flows. That means that the figures reported by Germany are not directly comparable with those in the United States, which only counts permanent immigration, said Thomas Liebig, an OECD immigration expert. OECD standardizes the data from various countries to make them comparable with those in the United States. That process aims to count only permanent residents and exclude other categories such as seasonal workers or students. The OECD is in the process of standardizing the data for 2013, but the United States will be in the top spot for the sheer number of immigrants with nearly one million immigrants. Provisional figures by OECD show that Germany had 466,000 while the United Kingdom had 291,000. In per capita rates,the United States place 19th out of 24 countries. That means that the United States received fewer immigrants per capita in 2012-13 compared with several European countries, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. "While the United States remains the largest destination of new permanent immigration in the OECD in absolute terms, inflows in per capita terms (i.e. relative to its population) are less than half of the OECD average," Liebig told PolitiFact. Several other immigration experts pointed to the OECD data but also offered additional caveats. People moving within the European Union will not necessarily get citizenship in their new country, while those in the United States given greencards can become citizens after three or five years, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. "It is correct to say that in total number of people admitted with what I would call a ‘clear path to citizenship,’ the United States vastly exceeds all other countries. And these absolute numbers matter a great deal. One million people is still a lot of folks, whether they are 1 percent or 3 percent of a nation's population," he said. "As a percentage of the population, the number who can get citizenship is still very high in the United States, but some countries are higher. What is very generous about the United States is that we give so many folks with no historical or ethnic tie to the United States a clear path to citizenship." Our ruling Rubio said, "We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts one million people a year, legally. No other country in the world even comes close to that." The United States accepted just under 1 million people in 2013, the most recent numbers available. As a percentage of population, though, the United States ranked 19th out of 24 countries in 2013. Still, Rubio is correct that the overall figure puts the United States ahead of other countries. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06634	Says CNN's Wolf Blitzer was wrong to say that "the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax."	false	/florida/statements/2011/sep/16/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-wolf-blitzer-was-wro/	Editor's note: On Sept. 13, 2011, we checked Wasserman's Schultz's claim that it's not true that 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax. But we broadened this fact-check on Sept. 16, after her spokesman said she was referring to the other portion of Wolf Blitzer's statement. Before the Republican candidates for president took center stage in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz talked with CNN's Wolf Blitzer -- and the conversation quickly turned into a back-and-forth over taxes. Blitzer tried to make the point that wealthy Americans might already pay the most taxes, while Wasserman Schultz countered that their tax rates are the lowest they've been since the 1950s. We watched the ships pass in the night. The lead-in was about President Barack Obama's jobs bill, and how Republicans seem steadfastly opposed to raising any tax on anyone. Here's what followed: BLITZER: All right, we don't have to debate the whole issue of taxes and wealthy and all of that. (But) the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax, because ... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, that's actually not true, Wolf. BLITZER: Fifty percent, you don't ... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We're at the low -- in terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: I know, but they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But they're still at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: Yes, 35 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And there have been significant tax breaks from President Obama. BLITZER: All right. We're not going to get into all of that. Blitzer cut cut off the debate there -- and we picked it up. Originally, we measured Wasserman Schultz's assertion that Blitzer was wrong to say that "50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax." But we then heard from Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse, who told us that Wasserman Schultz's objection to Blitzer -- "No, that's not actually true, Wolf" -- wasn't in response to his statement about the 50 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income tax (despite what it might have sounded like to viewers). Instead, she was arguing against his claim that "the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already," he said. Since it's impossible to say exactly which part of the statement she was disagreeing with, we decided to check both. (In another item we examined Wasserman Schultz's claim that the wealthiest Americans have the lowest comparative "tax rate since the 1950s." We found that Mostly True.) To keep it simple, we'll break this fact-check into two parts. First we'll look at whether the wealthiest Americans pay the most in taxes. Then we'll examine whether 50 percent of people pay no federal income taxes at all. What the wealthy pay in income taxes Blitzer explained his statement about the wealthy's tax burden by saying, "they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent." Just how big is that chunk? As PolitiFact has reported, the most recent hard data on this question comes from the 2007 tax year. It can be found in a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2010. CBO's report shows what share of the federal tax liability was shouldered by various income groups. We'll show you the information in a chart. The top line of the chart groups households by income: The first five columns break down taxpayers in five equal groups, poorest to richest. The last three columns focus solely on the wealthiest Americans. Blitzer first said the wealthiest Americans "pay the most in taxes," then clarified "federal income tax." So we've provided a breakdown of both total federal taxes, in the top row -- which also includes Social Security taxes, corporate income taxes, and taxes on goods like gas, tobacco and alcohol -- and in the bottom row, federal income tax. Share of federal taxes in 2007 Lowest quintile Second quintile Middle quintile Fourth quintile Highest quintile Top 10% Top 5% Top 1% Share of total federal tax liabilities 0.8% 4.4% 9.2% 16.5% 68.9% 55% 44.3% 28.1% Share of individual income tax liabilities -3.0% -0.3% 4.6% 12.7% 86% 72.7% 61% 39.5% Blitzer said, "they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent." The most recent CBO report shows that just the top 1 percent of households paid nearly 40 percent of income taxes. Meanwhile, their share of total federal tax liabilities was nearly 30 percent. For a more recent look, we have to rely on estimates based on 2010 law by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. They show the top 1 percent paying 32 percent of federal income taxes and 22 percent of all federal tax. That means, if anything, Blitzer's statement about the top 2 or 3 percent's income tax burden may be conservative — he's on the mark just for the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, Wasserman Schultz responded not with information about share of taxes paid, but with arguments about tax rates. Indeed, Woodhouse provided us with four articles, three of which focused on tax rates, and a fourth that looked at Americans' total tax burden falling as a share of the economy. None of them proved false Blitzer's claim about the size of the wealthiest's share of the tax burden. Instead, they made a separate observation -- that while the wealthy may pick up a bigger percentage of the federal tab, they're paying a smaller percentage of their income. It's a strong point, but it doesn't make Blitzer's statement any less true. How many people pay no federal income taxes When it comes to the number of people not paying federal income taxes, Blitzer is pretty close to right. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress found that in 2009 roughly 22 percent of "tax units" ended up paying nothing. Another 30 percent actually got money back from the government — meaning they made money — through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. The caveat here is that the statistic is measured in "tax units" — which is people or families who file tax returns. (The calculation will exclude some people, but not, for instance, people who receive unemployment benefits. The Internal Revenue Service considers that taxable income.) How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? The main reason is that the United States employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well. Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called "tax expenditures." "There are lots and lots of them," he said. "We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution." However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don't whittle their taxes down all the way to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook. To be fair, we wanted to see if there are more up-to-date figures. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said the number actually has dropped slightly -- and that 49.5 percent of tax filers ended up paying nothing in federal income taxes in 2010. In 2011, the predict the number might drop even more, down to 46.4 percent . Our ruling During a back-and-forth between Blitzer and Wasserman Schultz, Blitzer said that "the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax." Wasserman Schultz responded by saying "that's actually not true." But both of Blitzer's points are valid. About half of tax filers pay no federal income tax at all, and the wealthiest Americans -- though they may have a lower rate than they did in the 1950s -- still pay a huge chunk of federal income taxes. We rate Wasserman Schultz's claim False.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2011-09-16T11:47:49	2011-09-12	['United_States', 'Wolf_Blitzer', 'CNN']

Hillary Clinton cited the bankruptcy statistic to make the point that people suffer financially from not having health care coverage. The statistic comes from a 2005 study published in Health Affairs, The Policy Journal of the Health Sphere . The problem with her statement is that she chose the biggest figure — half of personal bankruptcies — at the expense of precision. In the study, only 28.3 percent of bankruptcies were attributed to "illness or injury" alone. In response to questions, 46.2 percent of people declaring bankruptcy cited illness or injury; unpaid medical bills; lost income due to illness; or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills. Forty-six percent is closer, but still less than half. The bankruptcy number only goes above 50 percent when the cause includes such things as gambling addiction, drug and alcohol addiction, the adoption of a child or the death of a family member. As serious as these issues may be, they are not what most people think of as "medical bills."	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-09-18T00:00:00	2007-09-17	['United_States']

pomt-08551	The Republican election platform "was actually written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon-Mobil."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/30/barack-obama/former-lobbyists-wrote-pledge-america-not-plural-a/	President Barack Obama was back on the stump recently, giving a fiery speech to a crowd of young people at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Obama said they should vote for Democrats this fall, or Republicans would gain control of Congress and stall his agenda. "If the other side does win, they will spend the next two years fighting for the very same policies that led to this recession in the first place, the same policies that left the middle class behind for more than a decade, the same policies that we fought so hard for to change in 2008," Obama said. "Just look at the agenda that the leaders of the other party unveiled last week. They call this 'Pledge to America.' That's what they called it. And in case you're wondering how serious they are about changing Washington, this pledge was actually written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon-Mobil." Obama has often decried the influence of lobbyists on the federal government. And while he does have policies in place to keep former lobbyists out of his administration, his administration has made some signficant exceptions. We've found enough exceptions to his campaign promise that we've rated his promise on tougher rules against a revolving door for lobbyists as Promise Broken. Still, many ethics experts say Obama is doing a better job at closing the revolving door than previous presidents. We wanted to fact-check Obama's statement that lobbyists had helped write "A Pledge to America." The document, created by the House Republican leadership, is a mix of broad principles and specific proposals, such as "permanently stop all job-killing tax hikes" and "repeal the job-killing health care law." It is largely silent on how to fix the significant imbalances in the federal budget that will reach a critical point in the coming decades. When Obama said the pledge was "written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon Mobil," we thought he meant lobbyists, plural. But he was actually talking about one person who lobbied for two corporations, the White House confirmed. That person is Brian Wild, a staff member for the Republican leadership. How does Obama know Wild helped author the document? That news came from a report from the the liberal website The Huffington Post. Wild is listed as the document owner on an electronic draft of the report obtained The Huffington Post. Wild is also a former lobbyist who worked for The Nickles Group. Public filings show that Wild was listed as a lobbyist for the insurance giant AIG from 2006 to 2008 and for Exxon Mobil Corp. from 2006 to 2009. He also lobbied for other companies, including Comcast, the Southern Co., the National Mining Association, Monsanto, FedEx, General Motors and others. A Republican spokesman didn't dispute that the digital signature on the document was Wild's or that he worked on the document. But Republican members themselves wrote the document -- collaborating on different sections, and Wild simply coordinated the project, said Brendan Buck, the communications director for the "Pledge to America" project. "The Pledge to America was written by Republican members of the House based on the priorities they heard from the American people," Buck said. "Suggesting anything else is an ugly act of political desperation." Because of Obama's wording, rating this item is a bit tricky. He said the pledge "was actually written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon Mobil." First, we think the reasonable interpretation here is that two former lobbyists worked on the pledge, but that's not the case. We've only been able to find one former lobbyist who worked for AIG and Exxon Mobil. Next, Obama said the the pledge was written "with the help of" a former lobbyist. In this context, what does "help" mean? Wild certainly "helped" in the sense that he was a staff member who worked on the project. But we don't know how much he did or didn't contribute to the actual text. We asked to interview Wild on this point, but we were turned down. Buck said that members themselves wrote the document, but we can't independently verify that. We should add here that we're not entirely naive; we know the unwritten rule among staff members of both parties is that you always downplay your role to make the boss look good. So we don't know how much Wild did or didn't help write the pledge. And the point here is that Obama's doesn't know either. His implication is that former lobbyists had some sort of nefarious influence on the document that would benefit powerful special interests. Actually, the document is a compilation of fairly general talking points and principles that Republican members have been talking about for months. So we take that together and find that one former lobbyist -- not two -- helped write with the document. And it's unknown whether that help was anything more than cutting and pasting. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-09-30T17:43:31	2010-09-28	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'ExxonMobil', 'American_International_Group']

pomt-04648	Says that if Texas, California and New York all voted for Democratic presidential nominees, "it would be mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president."	false	/texas/statements/2012/sep/12/gilberto-hinojosa/gilberto-hinojosa-says-if-democrat-carries-texas-c/	Talking up the importance of Texas turning blue, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party said at the Democratic National Convention that if Texas voted for Democratic presidential nominees, the combination of its electoral votes with those of California and New York mean "it would be mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president." Hinojosa’s comment came to our attention in a news article on Hinojosa’s work for the party in the Sept. 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman. Two days earlier, a news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted Hinojosa along similar lines. After saying a Texas Democrat has not won statewide since 1994, it said: "But the growing Latino population is expected to tip the Lone Star State from Republican to Democratic by the end of the decade," meaning Texas would shift to preferring Democratic presidential nominees, the story said. "If Texas becomes a blue state, it will become blue because of the Hispanic vote," Hinojosa was quoted as saying. "And the day that Texas becomes blue, it becomes mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect the president of the United States." Really? We made a run at testing Hinojosa’s statement as noted by the Austin newspaper. Nationally, it takes 270 of the country’s 538 electoral votes to win the presidency, as spelled out on a federal website devoted to the Electoral College. If the 38 electoral votes of Texas, 55 votes of California and 29 of New York flow to the Democratic nominee, he or she would have 122, leaving 416 votes unclaimed. So the Republican nominee would need to win 270, or 65 percent, of those remaining votes. That’s not mathematically impossible. We failed to reach Hinojosa. But Bill Brannon, the Texas party's executive director, suggested Hinojosa’s point is that if a Democratic presidential nominee carries each of the states, it becomes nigh impossible for a Republican to prevail. "What ends up happening is there is no coalition out there that creates a path to victory for a Republican candidate," Brannon said by phone. "In the current political environment, it is fair to say that it’s beyond highly improbable that any path to victory would exist for a Republican presidential nominee." The party’s deputy director, Jacob Limón, later made a similar point. For outside perspective, we turned to Allan Keiter, the founder of the 270towin website, which features an interactive Electoral College map for 2012 as well as information on past elections and a reminder that presidential candidates can win without winning a majority of the national vote: "Since electoral votes are generally allocated on an ‘all or none’ basis by state, the election of a U.S president is about winning the popular vote in enough states... It is not about getting the most overall popular votes." By telephone, Keiter said that mathematically speaking, Hinojosa’s claim is incorrect. If a Democrat carried Texas, California and New York, he said, a Republican still could win. Broadly, he said by email, the "minimum number of states needed to reach 270 (electoral votes) is 11." Then again, Keiter said, in the context of how voters in the states lately lean, such a claim has verve. That is, with California and New York considered Democratic territory, he said, if voters in Republican-leaning Texas preferred the Democratic nominee, President Barack Obama, he would likely pile up 239 electoral votes -- presuming the other states choose one candidate or the other as polls were signaling as of early September 2012. For Romney to prevail, Keiter said, he would then have to a goodly share of the 11 remaining "battleground" states. Those states are, west to east, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire and Florida. (Obama carried each one in 2008.) And "practically speaking, since Texas would likely only go to the Democrat in a landslide, most of these other states would also likely be blue," Keiter wrote. Separately, we reached Elchanan Mossel, a professor of Statistics and Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley who has compared the risks of the Electoral College method resulting in errors affecting the winner of the race as opposed to simply tabulating total votes nationwide. Mossel emailed that Hinojosa’s comment "is not correct on the math," and even "nonsense." He added later that he would prefer to characterize the Republican's chances under the chairman's described scenario as "extremely unlikely." The Democrat's statement, he said, indicates "some assumptions are being made." Our ruling Hinojosa said that if Texas, California and New York all backed the Democratic presidential nominee, it would be mathematically impossible for the Republican nominee to win. Mathematically speaking, that is incorrect. A case can be framed for the notion that if a Democrat carried the three states, he or she would hold a commanding position. Maybe, but that also assumes that many states would stay politically fixed one way or the other through the indefinite future based on voters' current leanings -- "ifs" that are, at the least, open to debate and speculation. All told, regardless, Hinojosa put no qualifiers on his statement. We rate it as False.

pomt-15007	On the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-now-opposes-trans-pacific-partners/	Since the start of her 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton hasn’t taken a strong position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal -- saying she would reserve judgment until the deal was finalized. Well, the negotiations recently came to a close, and Clinton promptly announced that she opposes the deal. "As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it," she said in an Oct. 8 interview with PBS Newshour’s Judy Woodruff, adding, "I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set." This stance has some people scratching their heads, because she praised the negotiations while serving as secretary of state. We thought we should take a look back and see how Clinton’s position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has evolved. She has addressed the trade deal on a number of occasions since official negotiations started in 2010 (CNN counted at least 45 comments), so we’ll note her most representative remarks in chronological order. Sept. 8, 2010, remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations: "We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end ... we're pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home." March 9, 2011, remarks at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum: "The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies." July 8, 2012, remarks with a Japanese official: "The United States welcomes Japan's interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we think will connect economies throughout the region, making trade and investment easier, spurring exports, creating jobs." Nov. 5, 2012, remarks in Australia: "This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." July 2014, in her memoir Hard Choices: "Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers… The TPP became the economic pillar of our strategy in Asia." May 22, 2015, at a press conference in New Hampshire: "I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards," adding she had some "concerns" about the TPP. There is an obvious difference in tenor between Clinton’s remarks as a member of the Obama administration and today as a presidential candidate. Across the whole time period, she has said details needed to be hammered out, and they had to meet certain standards. But her comments were more positive on the whole from 2010-13 than they have been recently. Here are some of the words she used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high-quality," "high-standard" and "gold standard." She also publicly encouraged more nations to get involved, such as Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, and she expressed hope that the negotiations would wrap up by the end of 2012. As a presidential candidate she has used more hedging language, for example saying she has "some concerns," and now she has said she outright doesn’t support the deal as it stands. While some pundits have painted Clinton’s transition as political -- an appeal to liberals who oppose the deal -- she might have legitimately changed her mind. It’s possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it’s hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she represented the Obama administration, which remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. "I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state," Clinton said in an Oct. 7 statement. "I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it." It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but we rate Clinton’s reversal as a Full Flop.

"Roughly one-fourth of rural Missourians are unable to purchase high-speed internet which puts them at a disadvantage in everything from education to entertainment to health care," Hartzler said in the release. In a tweet from the next day, she expanded the spectrum of her assertion and said, "Roughly one-fifth of Missourians are unable to purchase/access high-speed internet." In an era of unceasing digitalization, access to the internet is only becoming a greater daily necessity. We wanted to fact check her numbers. An outdated report We reached out to Hartzler’s spokesman, Kyle Buckles, to find the source of this information. Buckles provided us with the Eighth Broadband Progress Report compiled by the Federal Communications Commission and released on Aug. 14, 2012. The report was also included in the news release, via hyperlink. According to these 2012 numbers, Hartzler’s statement about rural residents is correct: some 24.2 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don't have access to high-speed internet. However, in her tweet she noted that one-fifth of all Missourians don’t have access to high-speed internet. This figure is inaccurate, according to the 2012 report, which says that 7.5 percent of the total state population doesn't have access to high-speed internet. The problem gets worse, though. The 2012 report provided by Buckles used an outdated benchmark internet speed. Measured in megabits per second, or mbps, the speed of an internet connection is a measurement of data transfer. The first number refers to the download speed, which is how fast your connection can retrieve data from the server, and the second number refers to the upload speed, which is how fast you can deliver data to the server. The benchmark number for high-speed internet used by the old FCC report is 4mbps/1mbps. The 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report has a benchmark of 25mbps/3mbps. The raised benchmark has drastically reframed the picture of access to high-speed internet in Missouri. Faster internet According to the 2016 report, 1,257,622 Missourians — or one-fifth of the state population — don’t have access to high-speed internet. (This is the same figure that Hartzler cited in her tweet, which leads us to believe that she gathered the data for her tweet from the most updated FCC report.) Additionally, 61 percent, or 1,053,213 Missourians, who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet. That is a drastic increase from the 25 percent Hartzler cited in her release. It should also be noted that of those without access to high-speed internet, roughly 84 percent live in rural areas. Missouri ranks behind the national figures in both the percentage of the total population that lacks access to high-speed internet, 10 percent, and the percentage of rural the population without access, 39 percent. The importance of high-speed Which brings us to the question: why does having high-speed internet matter? Heather Shoenberger, an assistant professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication who formerly worked on the Missouri Broadband Project, put it simply: "Just think of all of the things you use internet for." In addition to the rapid potential that continues to be unlocked by the internet and the internet of things, Shoenberger pointed to more mundane tasks like applying for a job. "You can’t get online to Monster(.com) and put your information in," she said. "My parents actually have a small company and they often post to (job) boards that people supposedly have access to, (but) they’ve had some ads that have had zero response. And it’s not a result of the fact that people don’t need jobs in that area, because they most certainly do." She continued, "Everything we do almost is connected online now; almost everything is in the cloud and if you’re not part of that, you’re really sort of part of a group of people who are kept in the dark from a lot of information that’s out there. Anything from political information, to jobs, to the ability to search for a better price online, to compare car prices, to know if your car is a lemon." But Shoenberger also said she wasn’t sure that expanding broadband infrastructure was the right solution, partly because of how much of Missouri’s farmland would have to be torn up to lay the broadband fiber, and partly because of the price. "Having access, that’s great, but then you have to have it at a price that people can pay for," she said. "And I’m not certain that they can. I’m not certain that people in many of our communities can even afford a computer. "I think most people in these more poor communities are using cellphones for all of their internet accessing needs. That may be the best way of attacking the issues: just making the cellphone service really topnotch," she said. Our ruling Hartzler said that one-fourth of Missourians who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet, but her numbers were based on an outdated FCC report from 2012 that used a much slower benchmark speed for internet. According to the most recent 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC, which uses a benchmark speed of 25mbps/3mbps for high-speed internet, nearly 61 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet. Hartzler’s point is definitely correct, but her numbers are out of date and incorrect, which exacerbates the problem even more. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03339	The ocean is now "much more acidic . . . than it has been for many millions of years."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/22/al-gore/al-gore-says-ocean-acidity-levels-havent-been-high/	Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process "disrupts ocean chemistry," he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, "but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years." That's important, he said, because, "This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now." On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We ruled that Mostly True. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently "much more acidic" than it has been for "many millions of years?" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse’s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: "Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years." That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back "many millions of years" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that "the uncertainty in the data points is very large." She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. "If you go back 4 million years, you're there," Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. "The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now." Again, that's not "many millions of years." Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, "Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today," he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, "The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years." Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today "is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years." It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution. It's also clear that many millions of years ago it was much more acidic. But the best estimates suggest that the oceans reached levels of acidity comparable to today’s levels sometime between about 900,000 years ago and 3 million to 4 million years ago -- far more recently than the "many millions of years" ago that Gore suggested. "If I had one of your meters, this would be halfway up," said Dickson, one of our experts on ocean acidification. We agree and rate Gore’s statement Half True.

pomt-10923	Says he’s been Wisconsin secretary of state "around 25 years."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/30/doug-la-follette/doug-la-follette-says-hes-been-wisconsin-secretary/	The first question posed to Doug La Follette in a July 18, 2018 interview on WisconsinEye, the public affairs television network, was simple enough. "Now, you have been secretary of state for how long, total?" host Steven Walters asked. "Well, I think around 25 years. I’d have to look it up," La Follette replied. Um. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Perhaps La Follette couldn’t recall. Or perhaps he wanted to downplay how long he has held the job. Counting the years La Follette’s opponent in the Aug. 14, 2018 Democratic primary, Madison Ald. Arvina Martin, told the Capital Times when launching her campaign "it may be time for some new ideas, new blood and someone with a different point of view." So, just how long has La Follette held the secretary of state’s job? Nearly 40 years. From the official Wisconsin Blue Book’s list of secretaries of state: Doug La Follette 1975-1979 Vel Phillips 1979-1983 Doug La Follette 1983-present So, La Follette served four years before being replaced by Phillips, the only black person ever elected to statewide office in Wisconsin. That was when he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor. After reclaiming the office by defeating Phillips in the 1982 election, La Follette has since served in the job for another 35.5 years and counting. (La Follette is more accurate about his time in office on his campaign website. He notes that he served as a state legislator for two years until 1974, and "was then elected secretary of state and has been re-elected every four years for the past 30 years.") All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Over the years, the Legislature has gradually reduced the duties of the secretary of state. La Follette said in the interview his office once had 50 employees and now it’s just him and one other full-time employee. The winner of the La Follette-Martin race will face the winner of the two-way Republican primary in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. Spencer Zimmerman of Janesville is campaigning to make the secretary of state’s position Wisconsin’s "chief protocol officer for international relations," while Jay Schroeder of Neenah is campaigning to eliminate the office altogether. When we contacted La Follette about his statement, by the way, he said he would have to "do a little calculation." Then later he emailed us, saying: "Wow, I did some math. It looks like it is more like 40 years; let me say, time flies when you’re having fun. Thanks for calling this to my attention." Our rating La Follette says he’s been Wisconsin secretary of state "around 25 years." He’s held the job for a total of nearly 40 years. We rate his statement False.

pomt-06576	The federal government is spending $46,000 a year per family (or group of four) and could balance its budget by dropping that to $30,000.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/28/mark-neumann/mark-neumann-says-federal-government-spends-46000-/	Mark Neumann, the first Republican to enter the 2012 U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, says it would make perfect business sense to balance the federal budget at the current revenue level of $2.3 trillion -- immediately. And although he says it is more practical and realistic to phase it in over time, he frames the issue in terms of what balancing the budget means for a typical family. We interviewed the former GOP congressman after listening to his Sept. 16, 2011, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television’s "Here and Now" program. On the show, Neumann described his view of narrow federal government authority, his hopes for across-the-board tax-rate cuts and his emphasis on as-yet unspecified spending cuts. And the former math teacher unveiled an ear-catching bit of budget arithmetic: "Let me lay out a number for you, it’s a staggering number," Neumann told anchor Frederica Freyberg. "Did you know that if the federal government spent $30,000 on behalf of every family of four or group of four in America, that the federal budget would be balanced today? They’re spending $46,000 on behalf of every family of four in America today, every year." He concluded: "If that number was $30,000 -- $30,000 is a lot of money – – if they spent $30,000 on behalf of every family of four, the federal budget would be balanced today." With fiscal matters likely to dominate the race to replace U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, the four-term Democrat, we thought it was worth checking Neumann’s math and to explore the point he was making with it. First, we did a little homework of our own. Balancing the budget immediately would be a dramatic move. In 2011, the U.S. government is expected to run a 35% deficit -- spending $1.28 trillion more than the $2.3 trillion in revenue it takes in, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. We asked Neumann his timetable for how quickly it could be balanced and he said less than nine years -- maybe five or seven. He promised a detailed spending cut plan as the campaign unfolds. He said a phase-in is dictated by political realities, and avoiding a shock to the economy that an all-at-once change might bring. Neumann told us that he’d like to see federal spending sink even lower than $30,000 a year per family of four -- and it can, he said, if people take more personal responsibility for their lives. Now let’s look at the math, and Neumann’s presentation of it. To be sure, Neumann is not talking about actually sending money to any families, and he’s not suggesting that all families receive the same benefits. What he means is that the federal government exists to serve the public, so every expense – from the White House light bill to the cost of a grenade launcher – is "spent" on the public. By taking the total amount of money the government spends, dividing the U.S. population by four and spreading the money evenly over that theoretical family, Neumann arrives at the $46,000 amount. We crunched the numbers ourselves and asked three outside experts for help: all agreed Neumann’s math is on target. And if the government pulled back and only spent what it actually took in, the per-four amount would be about $30,000. Neumann told us he chose a family of four because it was a common size. Some federal budget experts found mild fault with Neumann’s approach, but none said it was misleading. A better way to illustrate the size of the budget is by households, the standard unit used by the U.S. Census Bureau, said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. Based on that measure, the current figure is about $30,000 per household, compared with the $46,000 figure that Neumann’s approach generated. Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan budget-hawk group, said Neumann’s numbers didn’t provide a very useful road map to thinking about solutions. "We do need to start thinking about bringing spending and revenues more in line, but given the depth of our fiscal challenges we likely won’t be able to fully ‘balance the budget’ this decade," Peuquet said. Neumann said he would outline his proposals for entitlement reform and other moves later in the campaign. He’ll face tough choices, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. The federal government’s growth has been fueled by spending on wars and the aging of the population, Lilly said. "The first problem we can fix by agreeing that if we are going to war we will raise the taxes to pay for it. The second we can fix by raising taxes or cutting benefits." Our conclusion Neumann said you could balance the federal budget by reducing the amount spent from $46,000 per family of four to $30,000 -- a reduced amount that is, in his view, still too high. We can’t rule on his opinion, but the math claim adds up. It’s not a common calculation and therefore limited in its meaning, but experts agreed it’s not misleading. We rate the statement True.

pomt-10645	"I don't describe your plan as amnesty in my ad. I don't call it amnesty."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/mitt-romney/amnesty-amnesty-amnesty-amnesty/	During a testy exchange in the Jan. 5, 2008, debate, John McCain accused Mitt Romney of mischaracterizing his stand on immigration by calling it "amnesty" for illegal immigrants. Romney sternly replied, "I don't describe your plan as amnesty in my ad. I don't call it amnesty." This denial earns Romney a Pants on Fire ruling because two ads he released in recent days use that exact language. The only thing possibly saving the former Massachusetts governor is that the ads feature other people using the controversial word, not Romney himself. In a Romney ad called "Remember" launched on Jan. 3, a group of New Hampshire residents praise McCain's military experience and record of public service, then tick off grievances with McCain's positions on taxes and immigration. One, identified as Collett Hill, says of McCain, "He wrote the amnesty bill that America rejected." A second Romney spot called "Twists" released Jan. 4 opens with an eight-year-old clip of McCain accusing George W. Bush of twisting the truth during the 2000 presidential campaign. An announcer then enumerates reasons McCain was wrong then, and why he's not as conservative as Romney. Among the reasons cited, "Higher taxes, amnesty for illegals." If the message in ads isn't clear enough, press releases for the ads that are posted on Romney's Web site are chock-full of references to amnesty. The release for "Remember" uses the word 17 times, while the one for "Twists" drops the loaded word 10 times. Clearly, Romney has two ads where McCain's plan is described as amnesty. And even though his isn't the voice making the charges, he is responsible for the message. So, Romney, they're your ads, and they do "call it amnesty," so Pants on Fire it is.

pomt-02263	"Of all the jobs President Obama claims to have created since he started, only 38.5 percent are women. So 61.5 percent have gone to men."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/09/eric-bolling/fox-news-eric-bolling-says-61-percent-new-jobs-und/	As the White House and its Democratic allies were spending a day decrying a persistent wage gap between men and women, critics of President Barack Obama worked just as aggressively to poke holes in the Democratic narrative. On the April 8, 2014, Fox News’ The Five, panelist Eric Bolling offered several statistics that suggested that Democrats were themselves retrograde on gender equity. Bolling began by repeating a claim that women in the White House are paid 88 cents for every dollar earned by men. Then he said that, as a senator in 2008, Obama paid his female staffers 70 cents for every dollar his male staffers earned. Then Bolling offered a claim that really raised our eyebrows. "Of all the jobs President Obama claims to have created since he started, only 38.5 percent are women," Bolling said. "So 61.5 percent have gone to men." Is that correct? To find out, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal office that calculates employment data. We looked at the gender breakdowns for the increase in employed Americans between January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2014, the most recent month for which data is available. By the numbers, Bolling was on the mark. During that period, the number of men holding jobs increased by a little more than 2.2 million, while the number of women holding jobs rose by a bit less than 1.4 million. So 61 percent of the increase in employment during that period was accounted for by men -- just as Bolling said. Just to be safe, we also checked the period between July 2009 -- the official end of the last recession -- and March 2014. We found that the men’s share of added jobs was even higher for this period, at 65 percent. We also confirmed that this proportion of men isn’t just simply a reflection of the overall gender makeup of employment in the United States. Over the period we were looking at, the universe of employed Americans has broken down pretty consistently -- 53 percent men, 47 percent women. So for 61 percent of job gains to go to men is a disproportionate share. This may be an embarrassment for the administration -- that’s a matter of opinion. On the other hand, there is an explanation for the male-centric nature of job creation during the recovery, and it doesn’t have much, if anything, to do with Obama. Put simply, the recession was a "man-cession" -- meaning that men were hit disproportionately. And given that, it’s not surprising at all that the recovery has been something of a "man-covery." Let’s take a closer look at the data. During the recession -- from December 2007 to July 2009 -- the number of men working fell by almost 4.7 million, but the number of women working fell by a much smaller amount, about 1.7 million. In other words, during the recession, 74 percent of the job losses came from jobs held by men. And the fact that men are now getting 61 percent of the newly created jobs means they’re actually not even regaining jobs at a rate high enough to wipe out the losses they suffered during the recession. "The first 12 or 13 months of the recession -- the pre-Obama recession -- were terribly hard on men, because it was hard on the industries in which men hold a disproportionate share of the jobs, especially construction and durable manufacturing," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "After President Obama took office, the recession spread to many more industries -- industries in which women held a higher proportion of the jobs." Then, Burtless continued, when the recovery began, employment tended to increase in industries that were "severely affected in the early, pre-Obama recession, the industries where men were more likely to hold most of the jobs -- durable manufacturing at first, then construction." Meanwhile, there’s one sector of the economy that has seen steep declines since the last recession -- government, which has shed 738,000 jobs since January 2009. The government workforce, notably, is disproportionately female. Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research, added that there’s historical precedent for this kind of male-dominated recovery. "In the year from December 1982 to December 1983, employment of men increased by 2.26 million while employment of women increased by just 1.7 million," Baker said. "And this was a period when there were still large numbers of women entering the workforce for the first time." Our ruling Bolling said that, "of all the jobs president Obama claims to have created since he started, only 38.5 percent are women. So 61.5 percent have gone to men." Bolling is right on the numbers, but as a shot against Obama, the claim rings somewhat hollow. The male tilt to job gains during Obama’s presidency follows a strong pattern of male job losses in the months of the recession before Obama took office. So the gender balance of job creation has more to do with cyclical economic factors than anything the administration did or didn’t do. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-06455	"New Jersey's poverty rate has increased since this governor took office and the number of New Jerseyans without health insurance has risen."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/20/stephen-sweeney/stephen-sweeney-blames-chris-christie-rising-pover/	While Gov. Chris Christie is focused on meeting with wealthy supporters, New Jersey’s economy is struggling, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney. Just as election season was getting under way, Sweeney offered two examples in a Sept. 15 message on Facebook of the state’s deteriorating economic conditions during Christie’s tenure: the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance has increased. "New Jersey's poverty rate has increased since this governor took office and the number of New Jerseyans without health insurance has risen," Sweeney, a Democrat representing a southwestern part of the state, said in the message. "It's time this governor does something about the economy, other than veto things because they weren't his idea." Sweeney’s numbers are accurate, but PolitiFact New Jersey determined the senator’s wrong to solely blame Christie for those economic woes. First, let’s talk about the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance. Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for Sweeney, directed us to a news article regarding data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. According to that data, the number of Garden State residents living in poverty increased from 9.3 percent to 10.7 percent between 2009 and 2010. The Current Population Survey also shows that the number of uninsured individuals grew to about 1.3 million in 2010 from roughly 1.2 million in 2009. The bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey shows a similar pattern. According to the ACS, the number of New Jerseyans below the poverty level increased from 9.4 percent in 2009 to 10.3 percent in 2010. So, the latest federal statistics prove Sweeney’s point that the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance have increased since Christie took office in January 2010. But after reaching out to three poverty experts, we learned that while state policy can impact the level of poverty -- such as a decrease in the State Earned Income Tax Credit -- the main driving forces include the recession and the level of unemployment. "Most of the factors that determine a state's poverty rate are beyond the control of a governor in the short run," Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, said in an email. Pennsylvania State University professor John Iceland, who wrote the book "Poverty in America," said understanding the current level of poverty must come with the realization that recovery is fairly slow after such a sharp and deep recession across the country. Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, also noted how child poverty rates have increased in the last decade mainly due to the faltering labor market. Due in part to unemployment across the country, Nichols added: "This whole country is in bad shape. I think some increase in poverty in unavoidable." But two changes during Christie’s tenure could lead to rising poverty -- the reduction in the number of public-sector employees and the cut to the State Earned Income Tax Credit, Nichols said. The State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is awarded to low- and moderate-income residents, was reduced from 25 to 20 percent of the federal benefit in 2010. It's worth noting that New Jersey has seen an increase of approximately 50,000 private-sector jobs since Christie entered office. Donnelly refuted that Sweeney’s Facebook message blames the governor for these economic conditions. "The point was to convey that while things have gotten worse, the governor spent his time at fundraisers with the Koch brothers (GOP fundraisers Charles and David Koch) and not dealing with economic issues," Donnelly said in an email. "Your interpretation, frankly, deserves a ‘Pants On Fire’ rating." However, we told Donnelly that the tone of the message and marking the time frame as "since this governor took office" indicate that Sweeney is blaming Christie. Our ruling In a Facebook message, Sweeney said that since Christie took office, New Jersey has seen increases in its poverty rate and the number of people without health insurance. Those statistics are backed up by census data, but a state’s poverty rate is largely dependent on labor market conditions. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14236	"Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/jeff-bridges/rubbish-experts-degrade-claim-every-bit-plastic-ev/	Paper or plastic? It's not just a question being posed at the checkout counter anymore. Activists have been arguing for years that plastic bags harm the environment, but now there's also concern that plastic products may be a detriment to the planet because they break down so slowly -- or not at all. That's the point made by actor Jeff Bridges in a March 28 Facebook video that he narrates on behalf of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. When last we checked, it had over 453,000 shares. A statement at the beginning caught our attention: "Plastic is a substance the Earth cannot digest, and every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists," he says. "Plastic never goes away." Every bit still exists? Never goes away? We wondered how quickly that claim would degrade under scrutiny. Unlike some types of plastic, it fell apart pretty quickly. Yes, some types of plastic are very slow to decompose, and under some conditions plastics can persist for decades or centuries. Bridges has a point that these types are pollutants and major causes for concern. But all the researchers we talked to said plastics have gone away. Eric Grulke, associate dean for research in the college of engineering at the University of Kentucky, said a lot of plastic products are no longer around because they've been burned. Incinerators consume them, sometimes to generate electricity, he said. That's most often done in Europe and Japan, where about 12 percent of solid waste is plastic, said Anthony Andrady, a chemical and biomolecular engineer at North Carolina State University. Other plastic decomposes at varying rates, depending on the type of plastic and where it is. Polyethylene, "which is your basic hefty bag material, breaks down really, really slowly, and in a landfill it might not break down at all because it's typically starved of oxygen and water. So a polyethylene bag made in 1960 might still be with us, particularly if it's in a landfill," said Eric Beckman, a chemical and petroleum engineer at the University of Pittsburgh. "On the other hand, if you're talking about polylactic acid, which is popular in disposable tableware these days, that's actually designed to degrade," he said. "And if it's in a composting environment, it will go away in a matter of weeks to months." "If it's sitting out in the environment, within a year it would be dust," said Grulke. Sheets of polylactic acid that line rows of crops on a farm, allowing the plants to poke through but deterring the growth of weeds, are made to decompose in sunlight. The same ultraviolet light that damages our skin "chops up organic molecules fairly efficient," said Beckman. Not a lot of microscopic bugs have a talent for breaking apart the strong bonds that make many plastics so durable. But they exist, said Rigoberto Advincula, chairman of the polymer chemistry division of the American Chemical Society. And not all decomposition is good. In the ocean, there's two types of degradation, said Beckman. "The good type is when it's actually chemically falling apart. When you have water and sunlight, that helps things go faster. There's also mechanical degradation, where you have a bottle that slowly gets ground down by bumping into other things and becomes chips. That's bad because fish will eat that. You can find fish with bits of plastic in their stomach." Andrady said it's not universally desirable to have plastics break down or be burned because it takes a lot of energy to make them, energy that could be saved if they were recycled. To throw away a styrofoam cup or plastic cutlery "is a waste," he said. And someday, if we run out of the oil that serves as the raw material for making resilient plastics and there are landfills with high concentrations of plastic waste, "I can imagine people mining the landfills to get that resource. That is not inconceivable at all." Andrady said. We contacted Bridges' press spokeswoman, called the Plastic Pollution Coalition (their voicemail wasn't accepting messages) and emailed the group two different ways. None of our inquires produced a response. Our ruling Bridges' statement was absolute: "Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists." The experts say that's rubbish. "It's too all-encompassing," said Beckman. Although far too much plastic persists in the environment in places and in forms that are unwanted, too much has been burned or degraded to make the assertion accurate. Because his provocative claim leaves no room for subtlety, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f027af23-dc79-499a-9868-6a2140f87505	None	Jeff Bridges	None	None	None	2016-04-14T12:00:00	2016-03-28	['None']
pomt-09844	"I'm 59. In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke my hip, I couldn’t get it replaced."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/19/roy-blunt/59-gop-congressman-says-he-couldnt-get-hip/	Critics of President Barack Obama's health care plan have often cited problems with government-run health care in Canada and Britain to make a point that there could be long lines or inadequate care under the Democratic plan. During a meeting with with reporters and editors at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in early August 2009, Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he was living proof of the drawbacks of the Canadian and British systems. "I'm 59. In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke my hip, I couldn't get it replaced," he told them, asserting that he was too old to be eligible for the expensive surgery. Our friends at the Post-Dispatch checked the assertion and found it to be false. We did our own fact-checking and verified their work. In an Aug. 16 editorial challenging Blunt's assertion, the newspaper wrote that "at least 63 percent of hip replacements performed in Canada last year and two-thirds of those done in England were on patients age 65 or older. More than 1,200 in Canada were done on people older than 85." Let's take those numbers individually. On the question of Canadian hip replacements, the Post-Dispatch cited a report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, which describes itself as "an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides essential data and analysis on Canada’s health system and the health of Canadians." The report draws on information from several databases, including nationwide figures on medical procedures undertaken in hospitals. Using those statistics, it found that in all of Canada (except for the province of Quebec, for which information was unavailable), 63 percent of all hip replacements in 2006-2007 were performed on patients 65 and older. So Blunt was wrong, and the newspaper was right. As for the the number of Canadian hip replacements for the 85-and-older demographic, the newspaper actually underestimated how many there were. The number for 2006-2007, according to the same report, was 1,577. Just to make sure these numbers were valid, we checked with Shirley Chen, a senior analyst at the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry, a project of CIHI and orthopedic surgeons in Canada that collects statistics on hip and knee joint replacements. She confirmed the numbers reported here. For Britain, the Post-Dispatch got its figures from a 2000 report by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, a group that determines whether particular treatments are covered by the British National Health Service. The report said that "the over 65-year age group accounts for two in every three" hip replacements. When we called Britain's National Health Service's Information Center for Health and Social Care — the NHS's hub for medical statistics — they provided new numbers showing that 87 percent of hip replacements were performed on people age 60 or over. That's a different age bracket than what the newspaper used, but it still means Blunt was wrong. Blunt acknowledged his mistake to the Post-Dispatch and promised to do better. "I'm glad you pointed that out to me," he told the newspaper. "I won’t use that example any more." He blamed the bad information on testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, given by "some people who are supposed to be experts on Canadian health care." We looked through past congressional testimony using both Congressional Quarterly and Google but we couldn't find a reference that fit the description. Blunt's office did not respond to our request for an explanation. Unlike others who have been caught in falsehoods in the health care debate, it's notable that Blunt has acknowledged his mistake and said he was sorry. But still, he was wrong about both countries and would be eligible for hip replacements for many years to come. Public officials have a duty not to get things wrong, especially when it has the potential to frighten people. (You may recall we gave Vice President Joe Biden a Pants on Fire for saying during the swine flu scare that when you sneeze, it travels through the whole plane.) Likewise, this claim could scare many senior citizens. So we have to set the meter ablaze and give Blunt a Pants on Fire!	None	Roy Blunt	None	None	None	2009-08-19T16:49:06	2009-08-12	['Canada']
pomt-01504	"In 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/23/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-isis-tried-attack-fort-knox-20/	There’s considerable debate in Washington whether the Islamic State, the terrorist group now occupying parts of Iraq and Syria, presents a direct threat to the homeland. But to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., there’s little doubt the threat is real. Why? Because, he said, they’ve tried to attack the United States before. "They're coming at us, and we have to be on our guard at all times," King said Sept. 21 on Fox News Sunday. "If (the Islamic State) went into Australia, they could certainly come into the U.S. In 2011, they attempted to attack Fort Knox." An attack on Fort Knox? That claim caught us by surprise. Maybe it shouldn’t have, though, because it’s not even the the first time King has said it. We found at least seven instances of King making similar comments — including more than a year ago — in multiple variations. Aug. 31 on CBS: "I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States. Even three years ago their predecessor organization attempted to attack Fort Knox, and two people were arrested and convicted in Kentucky for that attempted attack." July 10 on Fox: "In fact, three years ago when they called themselves al-Qaida in Iraq, there were three of them, three members were arrested attempting to attack Fort Knox in Kentucky." July 31, 2013, on CNN: "It was a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)-related program that uncovered an al-Qaida cell in Sen. Paul's own state of Kentucky, which apparently was going to attack either Fort Campbell or Fort Knox." Is it two people or three? Was the plot against Fort Campbell or Fort Knox? No matter how many times he repeats it or how he says it, there’s no public evidence that it’s accurate. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, does not list an attempted attack on Fort Knox (or Fort Campbell, for that matter) on its extensive list of 60 terrorist plots in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Similarly, researchers at the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism went through their database of foiled terrorist attacks for PolitiFact and told us "nothing came up." Iraqi nationals in Kentucky King’s office did not respond to multiple calls and emails over several days asking for more information. Nonetheless, based on his various comments, we were able to discern that King was referencing the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in western Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. The details of the case are indeed alarming. In September 2009, the FBI, based on a tip, launched an investigation into Waad Ramadan Alwan, an Iraqi nationalist living in Bowling Green, Ky. A confidential source for the FBI started talking with Alwan in 2011. Alwan discussed how he previously worked as a bombmaker in Iraq. He boasted about blowing up American Hummers and targeting U.S. soldiers, claiming he used improvised explosive devices, referred to by the military as IEDs, hundreds of times, according to court documents. The FBI even matched a fingerprint from Alwan to an unexploded IED that was discovered by the military in 2005. (If you can believe it, there’s a warehouse outside of Washington that houses thousands of bombs found by the military). Through that, investigators were able to determine that Alwan likely killed U.S. troops while in Iraq. The confidential source continued to meet with Alwan and recruited him to assist in an operation in the United States to send explosives, firearms and money to al-Qaida of Iraq. Let’s stop here for a second. It is reasonable to consider al-Qaida of Iraq a predecessor of the Islamic State, said Gary Ackerman, director of the Unconventional Weapons and Technology Division of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. What is now the Islamic State is rooted in the Iraqi branch of al-Qaida after multiple name changes and fusions with other groups. "The core ideology and leadership have remained the same, with the strategy evolving from expelling the U.S. from Iraq and sectarian warfare in Iraq, to include toppling (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad, and eventually forming a Caliphate," Ackerman said. The sting On five occasions, Alwan helped procure and load money and weapons he believed were going to help al-Qaida of Iraq fight U.S. troops. In January 2011, Alwan recruited a friend to assist him — Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, another Iraqi who had moved to Bowling Green after first living in Las Vegas. (Alwan and Hammadi entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork.) From January to May 2011, the two worked together on five missions to send grenade launchers, machine guns, explosives, sniper rifles, hand grenades, missile launchers and $565,000 to al-Qaida of Iraq. Of course, this was all a sting operation. While Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping insurgents in Iraq, in reality, the FBI was monitoring all of their actions. The weapons, which the FBI rendered unusable, were merely transferred from one location under FBI control to another. In May 2011, Alwan and Hammadi were arrested. In December 2011, Alwan pleaded guilty to a 23-count indictment, including conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and multiple charges of weapons and terrorist activities. Hammadi pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment, including attempting to provide material support to terrorists. For cooperating with authorities, Alwan received a reduced sentence of 40 years in prison followed by a lifetime under house arrest. Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. The charges None of the charges filed against Alwan and Hammadi were for domestic terrorism plots. There is no mention of a plot against Fort Knox in their charging documents or in the affidavit of their activities from investigators submitted at trial. They were not convicted of any crimes related to domestic terrorism. All of the charges against these individuals were for actions committed while in Iraq or for trying to assist terrorist groups operating overseas. We combed through hundreds of pages of court documents available online. The only conceivable reference to any other terrorist activity is in Hammadi’s sentence appeal. There, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote: "Hammadi and Alwan also plotted to murder a U.S. Army Captain whom they knew from Iraq." An ABC investigative report had slightly more details: "Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home — and to possibly attack other homeland targets." It’s possible this captain was located at Fort Knox, which was about 90 miles from Bowling Green (for what it’s worth, Fort Campbell is about 70 miles away). Perhaps King, who sits on the House intelligence committee, knows more details about this. However, even in the most generous interpretation of the facts, King’s account is still radically misleading. For starters, his comments inferred (and, in fact, he has said as much in the past) that the individuals were arrested for attempting to attack Fort Knox. Again, nothing in the charging documents goes so far as to even mention a domestic plot. Second, while it’s fair to say Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping a predecessor of the Islamic State, al-Qaida of Iraq had no communication with them. Even if Alwan and Hammadi had discussed a domestic attack, it would not be accurate to say the plan came from the Islamic State or al-Qaida of Iraq. They would have been acting alone, without any approval from an actual terrorist organization. This was more or less two Iraqis with dangerous background who were duped by the FBI into believing they were helping Islamic insurgents fight Americans overseas. Our ruling King said, "In 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox." There is no public account of such a plot and King’s office did not respond to us to provide any evidence to suggest a foiled domestic attack on Fort Knox. In 2011, two Iraqi nationals were arrested in Kentucky about 90 minutes outside Fort Knox for attempting to help al-Qaida of Iraq by sending weapons, explosives and money to insurgents fighting overseas. However, their efforts were actually part of an FBI sting operation, and they never helped or connected with al-Qaida groups operating in Iraq. The two ultimately pled guilty to multiple counts of terrorist activities; however, there was no mention of a domestic plot in any of the charging documents. No doubt this is a troubling case, but the public record does not back up King’s conclusions about it. We rate King’s statement False.

pomt-12630	"Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/mar/30/jacqueline-collins/fact-check-has-gov-rauner-consistently-pushed-cut-/	Things are getting tense among members of the General Assembly as Illinois continues its historic budget impasse. Democrats and Republicans are hurling attacks at opposition party leaders, hoping to assign blame for the state’s lack of a budget for 22 months. Republicans continue to target Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, while Democrats, like state Sen. Jacqueline Collins of Chicago, often slam Gov. Bruce Rauner. In a Feb. 24 newsletter from state Sen. Collins, she zeroes in on several of Rauner’s claims as she attempts to debunk them. One of her counterclaims said: "Fact: Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We wondered: Did Rauner actually call for the elimination of these programs each year he’s been in office? Budget proposals and vetoed bills We contacted Kenneth Lowe, a media and outreach specialist for the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, to see where the state senator found her sources. Lowe provided us with five instances from 2015 to 2017 in which the governor announced he intended to freeze or cut homeless prevention, autism or after-school programs for at-risk youth. We looked into each instance to verify that it actually happened and to see whether it accurately depicts Collins’ claim. • Collins’ claim: On Feb. 18, 2015 Rauner announced his Fiscal Year 2016 budget in which he proposed freezing grant funding for autism and homeless prevention programs at DHS. He also called for the elimination of the After School Matters program at the Illinois State Board of Education. • Our finding: Rauner’s FY16 budget proposal shows the governor did look to freeze funding for homeless and autism programs, as well as cut After School Matters. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com • Collins’ claim: In April 2015, Rauner announced his plan to freeze funding for autism and homeless prevention. • Our findings: On April 3, 2015, Rauner did, in fact, call for a $26 million suspension in social services and public health grants. The Chicago Tribune reported, "The Republican’s office released a list of targeted programs…that included funding to pay for…smoking cessation, teen programs, autism, and HIV and AIDS programs, among other things." The Tribune story showed the governor called for a $1 million cut for autism programs, a $300,000 cut for Assistance for the Homeless and a $3.1 million cut to Teen REACH, an after-school program run by the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for high-risk youth. The cuts were dubbed by Democrats as the "Good Friday Massacre" and funding to the programs was restored a few weeks later when the administration reported higher-than-expected tax revenue. • Collins’ claim: In June 2015, Rauner vetoed a bill that would fund autism programs and homeless prevention programs. • Our finding: On June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed HB4165. The bill would have provided $4.3 million to the Autism Diagnosis Education Program and $4.5 million to Homeless Youth Services. It is worth noting, however, that the bill was in a batch of 19 budget bills Rauner vetoed simultaneously under a single veto message that faulted Democrats for passing a budget that was $4 billion in the red. "We must be partners in enacting a balanced budget that meets critical public needs within the resources available. The surest way to do that is by enacting structural reforms inside government and economic reforms that stimulate our economy and bring new jobs to Illinois," Rauner wrote in his veto message. As he has said repeatedly since then, Rauner, at the time, had said he would look to new revenue sources if the General Assembly enacted parts of his "Turnaround Agenda." This became the opening salvo in a budget impasse that endures to this day. • Collins’ claim: Governor Rauner’s FY17 budget proposal called for the same types of freezes and cuts from his FY16 budget proposal. • Our finding: Rauner’s budget did call for these freezes and cuts. The Project for Autism, DHS’ Homelessness Prevention program and After School Matter wouldn’t have received funding. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com • Collins’ claim: Rauner, again, introduced a budget without funding the above-mentioned programs. • Our finding: Rauner’s proposed FY18 budget shows this claim is correct. By looking at Rauner’s budget proposals, vetoed bills and past news stories we found Rauner has called for the elimination and freezing of funding for autism, homelessness and after school programs each year he has been in office. However, Rauner has not been successful in his attempts to eliminate or freeze this funding, a point Collins’ email does not make. 'It’s not pretty’ Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, said claims like the ones in Collins’ email are common these days. Illinois has been without a budget for almost two years, and Mooney said it’s starting to grate on people. "People inside and outside the legislative process are having their nerves frayed," Mooney said. "There’s a lot of tension, especially in the statehouse because they can’t get their jobs done. That’s frustrating for anybody." Mooney said this feeling is probably amplified after the 12-bill budget package known as the "Grand Bargain" stalled. "It was the one real attempt the (state) Senate had and it was shot down," Mooney said. "It offered hope and those hopes were dashed. It’s like we’re starting back at square one." Our ruling In an email newsletter, state Sen. Jacqueline Collins accused Gov. Bruce Rauner of calling for the elimination of "funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children" each year he's been in office. A Democratic staffer pointed to five instances where Rauner proposed cuts or freezes to these three programs. We verified these instances by looking at Rauner’s current and former budget proposals, a vetoed bill and news stories. Rauner has proposed budgets that would eliminate funding in the areas Collins cites. But his 2015 veto of a bill that contained autism funding was in the context of rejecting 19 budget bills on the grounds that the entire package was unbalanced. His veto message did not specifically mention eliminating autism funding. Rather, he said he was vetoing several bills because he wanted structural reforms as part of a balanced budget which majority Democrats did not send him. Collins’ statement is accurate, but needs clarification and additional information. We rate Collins’ claim Mostly True.

pomt-08005	"When we look at the number of murders in the United States (in) 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see ... large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/13/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-us-has-9500-gun-murders-year/	After the Jan. 8, 2011, attack by a gunman in Tucson, Ariz., that left six dead and and 14 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a number of politicians and pundits brought up the issue of whether stricter gun control laws were needed. One of the lawmakers who made the case for tightening gun laws was Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. In an interview on MSNBC on Jan. 11, 2011. Lautenberg -- who is preparing legislation to ban high-capacity gun clips like the ones used in the Tucson attack -- said, "But the fact of the matter is, when we look at the number of murders in the United States, 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see large companies -- large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year." We wondered whether Lautenberg's statistics were correct. First, we'll look at the statistics for the U.S. (Lautenberg said "murders," but the full context of the interview clarifies that he actually meant to say murders by guns.) According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports for 2009, there were 10,224 homicides in the U.S. that involved a gun. So by this count, Lautenberg's number was actually a little low. International statistics are harder to come by, but we'll report the best data we could come up with. Mamoru Suzuki of the National Research Institute of Police Science in Japan e-mailed us to say that there were seven gun murders in Japan during 2009. (This was no anomaly: In 2007 and 2008, Suzuki said, the number was 21 and 10, respectively.) For the United Kingdom and Germany, we had to extrapolate a bit. We took firearm murder rates -- that is, firearm murders per 1,000 people -- for a variety of nations across the globe, then used national population statistics to reverse-engineer the number of firearm murders in both countries. The data comes from the Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, covering the period from 1998 to 2000. While more recent data exists for homicides overall, we weren't able to find more recent international figures for killings by firearms specifically. In any case, for the most recent year available, we found that the United Kingdom had 63 firearm murders, and Germany had 381 firearm murders. These aren't as current as the statistics from U.S. and Japan, and because they're reverse-engineered, they are estimates. But experts we consulted said the figures sounded about right. They were also on par with Canada: Sara Beattie, the homicide survey manager at Statistics Canada, e-mailed us to say that there were 179 firearm homicides in her country in 2009. So, Japan and the United Kingdom were well within Lautenberg's stated threshold of 200 murders per year. Germany's total exceeded that threshold, but it still represented less than 4 percent of the number of killings in the United States in 2009. We'll point out three additional bits of context. The first is that Lautenberg offered an absolute number of killings, not one adjusted according to population size. Population differences can be a significant factor, but in this case, the differences in killings are so great that even adjusting for a country's size doesn't change the comparison very much. The second is that while the U.S. firearm murder rate is indeed high when compared to most advanced industrialized countries, there are nations that do have higher rates. In the U.N. study, the U.S. ranked eighth out of 32 nations studied, with South Africa, Colombia, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Belarus and Costa Rica reporting higher rates. The third is that not everyone agrees that guns by themselves are the key factor of the relatively high U.S. rate of firearm murders. "The U.S. also has a far higher rate of murders committed with knives, but I doubt that cutlery ownership is any higher in the U.S. than in Japan, Germany, and the U.K.," said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. "America is more violent than other nations in ways unrelated to guns and for reasons having nothing to do with the rate of gun ownership." We still don't think these pieces of context undermine the accuracy of Lautenberg's statement. The senator was actually a little low in his estimate of firearm homicides in the U.S. for 2009, and he was accurate in saying that Japan and the United Kingdom had fewer than 200 firearm murders. Germany's number is higher than 200, but is still dramatically lower than the U.S. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-03676	"The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/25/leonard-lance/leonard-lance-claims-us-has-highest-corporate-tax-/	The United States may lead the rest of the world in a number of areas, but not all of them are positive. Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.), for example, notes that the nation tops the list when it comes to certain types of taxes. "The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world," Lance said in a news release last week that emphasized the need for tax reform. PolitiFact New Jersey has tested this claim before, when it was cited twice by state Sen. Joe Kyrillos (R-Monmouth). Kyrillos’ claims were rated Mostly True. Lance’s claim hasn’t broken new ground in the six months since Kryillos’ last claim about corporate tax rates. Let’s revisit this popular talking point. As far as corporate tax rates, the U.S. leads the pack worldwide – but not after factoring in various tax breaks paid by U.S. businesses. But first, let’s review the two types of corporate tax rates: statutory rates and effective rates. The top statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1 percent and represents a combination of federal, state and local tax rates imposed by law before any tax breaks are factored into the equation. Japan once had the highest combined tax rate in the world, but lowered it in April 2012. That move bumped the United States’ statutory rate to the highest among industrialized nations, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group. So the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world in terms of statutory rates. Now let’s look at the effective tax rate, which is typically lower than the top statutory rate because of tax breaks. In a September 2011 report, the Tax Foundation summarized the findings of the latest 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world. Due to different methodologies, those studies determined U.S. effective tax rates ranged from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, according to the report. The United States did not rank first in any of those studies, but in most of them, U.S. effective rates were among the top five highest for the countries analyzed, the report stated. Apart from that Tax Foundation report, it’s worth noting that a separate analysis found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes for the 2008-2010 period. That study was done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. So, what’s the better measure -- statutory or effective rates? Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge told us previously that statutory rates make for better comparisons. Effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries, while statutory rates are fixed, he explained. "(The effective tax rate) will differ from industry to industry and business to business, whereas the list price is what it is and everyone starts at that point," Hodge said. But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has argued that "effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens." Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told us for our Kyrillos fact-check on this claim that "both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax." Our ruling Lance claimed in a news release, " The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world." It’s accurate that, at 39.1 percent, the United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. But with various tax breaks, U.S. effective corporate tax rates range anywhere from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, studies show. Those effective tax rates may not land in first place, but they’re still among the highest in the world. As we did with Kyrillos’ two claims on this topic, we rate Lance’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-11111	On participating in a debate for Democratic gubernatorial candidates.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/07/kelda-helen-roys/kelda-roys-democrat-governor-commits-participating/	The Wisconsin Broadcasters Association’s decision to hold a debate with no more than four of the 10 Democratic candidates for governor caused so much consternation among the candidates and others that the association is reconsidering its decision. Amid the backlash, did Kelda Helen Roys, arguably one of the leading candidates, change her position on attending the debate? We go to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines an official's consistency on an issue. (It does not pass a judgement on a politician who changes positions, or determine if any shift is good policy or good politics.) The decision The broadcasters association, which represents nearly all radio and television broadcasters in the state, announced June 4, 2018, the criteria it would use for determining which candidates would be invited to its debate on July 27, 2018, in Madison, less than three weeks before the primary election. Saying it would invite "the most significant candidates," the association detailed how up to four of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates (as well as up to four Republicans in the U.S. Senate race) would be included. The main criterion: Results of the Marquette University Law School Poll released closest to the date of the debate. The Flip-O-Meter The Flip-O-Meter rates an official's consistency on an issue. Some voters appreciate politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of their voters. Still, accusations of shifting positions are common in politics, and we’ve found that an analysis of the shift and the degree of change can be informative. The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings: NO FLIP – No significant change in position. HALF FLIP – A partial change in position. FULL FLOP – A complete change in position. The same day – as some candidates and the Wisconsin Democratic Party called on the association to reconsider – Charles Franklin, the poll’s director, said the law school does not support using the poll to determine which Democratic gubernatorial candidates would be invited. "All polls have a margin of error, making small percentage differences between candidates in a crowded field especially uncertain," he said. Roys: I’m in On June 5, 2018, the day after the criteria were announced, Roys’ campaign issued a statement to Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer, saying in part: Kelda is looking forward to joining three of her competitors in this debate and continuing to share her positive vision for the future of Wisconsin. Roys campaign spokesman Brian Evans told us that when Bauer asked for the campaign’s reaction to the criteria, he thought Bauer wanted to know whether the campaign thought Roys would meet the criteria to participate. The campaign’s statement was later clarified to say the statement had been based on the campaign’s assumption that Marquette would do another poll before the debate. Roys didn’t fare well in the most recent Marquette poll, done in March 2018, which asked respondents if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of the candidates. On Roys, 92 percent of respondents said they hadn’t heard enough about her or didn’t know her enough to have an opinion. Two days before the broadcast association’s announcement, however, she gained momentum by winning a straw poll at the state Democratic Party convention. So, Roys committed to participating in the debate, even going so far as to presume she would qualify. But she would withdraw her commitment. Roys: Actually ... The change came later the same day, when Bauer quoted Roys as saying to the broadcasters association: We are confident that my campaign will qualify for inclusion in the debate, but given the flawed criteria you are using to decide who is included in your debate, I cannot in good conscience commit to attending. So, Roys didn’t flatly state she would not participate in the debate. But she was no longer committing to participate. Moreover, after Bauer tweeted that Roys had changed her position and was now against the debate, Evans tweeted in response: Mistake was mine, apologies. Statement was based on the work Kelda has done to attend as many forums as possible all across WI, as well as our confidence that she will meet the criteria the WBA put out. I had not checked whether Kelda thought the criteria were fair or democratic. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Then on June 6, 2018, two days after the criteria were announced, Roys released an open letter to the association, which said in part: I strongly object to limiting the number of candidates in the debate, especially using the arbitrary, inaccurate, and undemocratic criteria put forward by WBA. … We are confident that my campaign will qualify for inclusion in the debate, but given the flawed criteria you are using to decide who is included in your debate, I cannot in good conscience commit to attending. Again, no more commitment to participate. (Later on June 7, 2018, the day we published this article, the association canceled the debate.) Our rating Initially, Roys essentially committed to participating in a Wisconsin Broadcasters Association debate that would be limited to four of the 10 Democratic candidates for governor, saying she "is looking forward to joining three of her competitors in this debate." But later the same day, and again the following day, Roys issued statements changing her position. She didn’t flatly refuse to participate. But saying she objected to the criteria, she withdrew her commitment, saying: "I cannot in good conscience commit to attending." For a complete change in position, we give Roys a Full Flop.

pomt-14444	"NASCAR endorsed Trump"	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-claimed-nascars-endorsement-and-hes-n/	Donald Trump has lapped the field in some recent state primaries, but he caused a caution flag Monday when he claimed that he had NASCAR’s endorsement in a speech in Concord, N.C., just miles from the NASCAR Hall of Fame and the Charlotte Motor Speedway. "NASCAR endorsed Trump," Trump said. "Can you believe that?" At first glance, one might be tempted to believe it. Trump did, after all, win the endorsement of NASCAR’s CEO, Brian France, and several current or retired drivers, including Chase Elliott and Mark Martin. Martin introduced Trump at Monday’s rally. But France has made it clear, in an email to NASCAR employees, that his endorsement was merely his own. "This is my personal and not a corporate position," he wrote, according to Motorsport, an online news source that covers NASCAR. A NASCAR spokesperson didn’t immediately respond Monday after Trump’s comments, but a spokesman did tell The Charlotte Observer on March 1 – the day after France’s original endorsement – that NASCAR itself did not endorse Trump. Granted, it can be difficult to separate NASCAR and the France family. Brian France’s grandfather, Bill France Sr., founded NASCAR in 1948, and it has been controlled by the France family. In 2013, a spokesman told The Sporting News that NASCAR is a private company owned by the France family but the ownership structure was proprietary. The elder France endorsed another controversial presidential candidate, George Wallace, in 1972. But last summer, NASCAR pulled annual banquets from the Trump National Doral property in Florida, after Trump made controversial remarks about immigrants. And Trump seems to have missed France’s email. In his speech Monday, he doubled down on the murky claim of corporate support. "I want to thank NASCAR," Trump said. "And, you know, Brian France was with us last week at a venue and he got up on behalf of NASCAR. … For them to endorse me was really a great honor, so thank you very much." Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, acknowledged after the speech that NASCAR itself hasn’t endorsed Trump. Trump was in Concord ahead of the March 15 North Carolina primary election. The state is home to NASCAR and many of its racing teams, but support for NASCAR isn’t as high as it once was. According to a 2013 report by Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, about a third of North Carolinians consider themselves NASCAR fans. Among North Carolina natives, the poll found, that number rises to 39 percent. And NASCAR fans are heavily Republican. Among people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, the poll found, 43 percent considered themselves NASCAR fans. Among 2012 supporters of Barack Obama, on the other hand, 21 percent called themselves NASCAR fans. Our ruling Donald Trump claimed multiple times in his speech Monday that he was endorsed by NASCAR. He was endorsed by its CEO, Brian France, who went out of his way to say it was merely a personal decision – a statement echoed by a company spokesman. Still, NASCAR is synonymous with the France family. And for several of its drivers, including well-known racer Mark Martin, to lend support also increases the public appearance of an endorsement.

pomt-09993	Gov. Sarah Palin "got precisely zero support for her call for Alaska's Democratic Senator Mark Begich to resign because Ted Stevens' corruption conviction was overturned."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/10/rachel-maddow/maddow-claims-palin-got-zero-support-her-idea-only/	MSNBC host Rachel Maddow recently portrayed Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as plagued by personal problems and, on at least one high-profile issue, isolated politically. After running through the Palins' various family troubles, Maddow said on her April 6, 2009 show: "And [it's] not just the personal stuff. Gov. Palin stumbled through the stimulus fight, rejecting federal money for Alaska before backtracking and taking it. Last week, she got precisely zero support for her call for Alaska's Democratic Senator Mark Begich to resign because Ted Stevens' corruption conviction was overturned." It was that "precisely zero" that caught our attention. It so efficiently painted Palin as out of step politically with her fellow Alaskans. A little context: Stevens, a longtime Republican senator from Alaska, was convicted in October 2008 for omitting from his Senate financial disclosure forms free work done on his house by an oil-field services company. Days later, the 85-year-old narrowly lost his re-election bid to former Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich, a Democrat. Then on April 1, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the government would move to dismiss Stevens' indictment, citing several instances of Justice Department prosecutors withholding evidence that should have been provided to the defense. A day later, Palin did indeed endorse the idea of Begich resigning so the state could have a do-over of sorts. But did Palin get "precisely zero support" for the idea? No. In fact, it wasn't even her idea in the first place. It was the Alaska Republican Party that suggested it. "The only reason Mark Begich won the election in November is because a few thousand Alaskans thought that Senator Ted Stevens was guilty of seven felonies," the party said in a press release on April 2, 2009. "A special election will allow Alaskans to have a real, nonbiased, credible process where the most qualified person could win, without the manipulation of the Department of Justice." The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner then contacted Palin, who has often been at odds with Alaska Republican Party Chairman Randy Ruedrich, to ask what she thought of the idea. (Palin had called on Stevens to resign following his conviction in October.) "I absolutely agree," she responded to the paper by e-mail. "This drastic change in circumstances, wherein truth is finally being revealed, leads me to support the call for a special, fair election." Later, in an interview with the Anchorage Daily News, Palin seemed to backtrack somewhat, saying she did not want to "split hairs" on whether Begich should resign but that she agrees with the call for a special election. No one in Alaska's three-person congressional delegation — made up of Begich and two Republicans — supported the calls for Begich to resign and a special election to be held, the Anchorage Daily News and the political news site Hotline reported on April 3, 2009. But the idea was pushed by Randy Ruedrich, the state Republican chairman who first proposed it, and it was backed by conservative blogs. (Remember, Maddow said there was "precisely zero" support.) ConservativeHQ.com, for example, sent out an e-mail alert saying, "The people of Alaska, and all Americans, must rise up and demand that Mark Begich resign." Wev Shea, a former U.S. attorney now in private practice in Anchorage, did not specifically call on Begich to resign but he endorsed the idea of a special election and told the New York Times, "There’s a groundswell all over the state for a special election." So Maddow left her viewers with two incorrect impressions — that Palin had initiated the idea for Begich's resignation, and that no one else supported her. In fact, it wasn't Palin's idea, and she wasn't particularly wedded to it, and others supported it. We find Maddow's claim False.

pomt-03944	"Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-phoenix-one-kidnapping-capital/	National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre attracted wide media attention recently when he suggested in an op-ed that after Hurricane Sandy, New York City had become a violent, post-apocalyptic wasteland -- thanks to an absence of guns. A reader asked us to check out a claim in LaPierre’s op-ed, which ran on Feb. 13, 2013, op-ed in the conservative Daily Caller. "Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States," LaPierre said. "Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S.-Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last." The claim that "Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world" was already familiar to us, since we had debunked it in 2010 (it was a finalist for our Lie of the Year). But that was three years ago, so we decided to take another look. The NRA did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But we found a lot happened in the interim -- though the statement is still wrong. What we found in 2010 Our original fact-check, coming at a time when Arizona’s tough immigration law known as SB 1070 was a major topic nationally, looked at a comment by Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. He said that Phoenix "is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City." ABC first reported on Feb. 11, 2009, that: "Phoenix, Ariz., has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone." Several news organizations then repeated it, including the Associated Press, the Arizona Republic and United Press International. The Los Angeles Times went so far as to note that Phoenix "police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports" in 2008 and that they estimate "twice that number go unreported." However, none of the stories cited an authoritative source for the ranking or for how the kidnapping ranking was calculated. We did extensive checking and couldn't find anything to back it up. We found that neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to the international police organization, compiles city-based kidnapping statistics. We also contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston company that coaches clients through kidnappings. "From our internal experience in the last year," he said, "Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents. This fit broadly with the perspective of Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin, Texas global intelligence company. "According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping, and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America," he told us in 2010. A Stratfor spokesman reached for this article said Stewart’s comments remain accurate today, and we found evidence to back up high and often growing rates of kidnapping in Latin America. In all of Mexico, the official count for 2012 was four kidnappings a day, though a non-governmental organization pegged it at an astronomical 72 per day. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, the official statistics show kidnapping rates rising from 44 in 1999, to 1,105 in 2011, not counting "express" kidnappings, in which a perpetrator forcibly takes a victim from ATM to ATM until their checking account is depleted. Police sources told the newspaper El Universal that Caracas alone experiences perhaps two express kidnappings a day. But there’s no good way to compare cities, and even countries, Johnson and Stewart agreed. It's "extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the recordkeeping in many of the most affected countries is inaccurate." Even among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of "kidnap" varies. In 2010, we concluded that there was no evidence proving that Phoenix was No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We rated the statement False. Subsequent doubt cast on Phoenix’s 2008 statistics Since then, there have been additional revelations that indicate the claim is still wrong. Prompted by media coverage of the Phoenix kidnapping claim, an investigative team led by reporter Dave Biscobing of ABC-15 TV news in Phoenix spent two months in 2011 reviewing the city police department's 2008 statistics. They concluded that "Phoenix police routinely inflated their kidnapping statistics throughout the year, including at least 100 cases that legal experts said should not have been counted, plus dozens of other questionable reports." Among the problems cited by ABC-15 was that the count included "cases where officers concluded no kidnapping occurred, reports that were counted multiple times, and even reports for kidnappings that happened in other cities and other states." In one case, a police report described a woman "claiming she was abducted from a Wal-Mart parking lot and then driven around for hours. But when officers checked surveillance video, they watched her get into her car and drive away -- alone." She had made up the story. There were other new developments -- a police department whistleblower who said the numbers were inflated, a city audit that insisted they had not -- but they either failed to support the kidnapping-capital claim or further knocked it down. The city's police chief lost his job at least partly because of the controversy. Last year, an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general looked into the numbers because the city had used them in a grant application. The investigation found that of the 358 incidents submitted as support for the grant applications, only 208 met Arizona’s requirements of a kidnapping, and only 195 met a uniform crime reporting standard. Phoenix then submitted an additional 175 cases -- two years after its initial grant application -- which enabled the inspector general’s certified count to reach exactly 358 under Arizona standards. The count stood at 254 under the more stringent uniform crime reporting standards. The inspector general concluded that even if the data Phoenix submitted late was counted, the city "likely overstates the number of kidnappings," and it argued that the Phoenix Police Department "has significant problems with its coding and classification of cases and, consequently, with the accuracy of reports from its case management system." Meanwhile, it’s worth pointing out that, as we noted in our previous fact-check, kidnapping levels in Phoenix have fallen from their 2008 peak of 358 in 2008 to 318 in 2009 and 105 from January through May 2010, which amounts to an annualized total of 252 kidnappings for 2010. In the wake of the controversy, we were unable to obtain more recent data for this story. A police spokesman declined to provide new data. Our ruling LaPierre bought himself a little running room by avoiding specific international rankings and claiming instead that "Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world." Still, we find no justification to support such a sweeping claim. Two and a half years later, there remains no reliable international comparison for city kidnapping rates, and an independent expert continues to express skepticism about the claim. In addition, federal investigators have given credibility to claims by ABC-15's investigative reporters and a whistleblower that the city’s claim of 300-plus kidnappings in 2008 were exaggerated. Finally, the most recent official numbers for Phoenix show a decline since 2008 even as kidnappings have soared in several Latin American countries. We rate LaPierre’s claim False.

pomt-10577	Hillary Clinton "actually differed with (John McCain) by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/01/barack-obama/clinton-changed-on-torture/	Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican frontrunner after winning Florida's primary. In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things. After naming a number of areas where he said Clinton and McCain had the same positions, Obama attacked Clinton for diverging from McCain on the issue of torture. Clinton "actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed," Obama said. It sounds a little convoluted, so here's the step-by-step. In October 2006, Clinton spoke about exceptions to a no-torture policy when speaking to the New York Daily News. Clinton mentioned a "ticking time bomb" scenario in which a captured terrorist has knowledge of an imminent terror attack and interrogators want to use torture. "In the event we were ever confronted with having to interrogate a detainee with knowledge of an imminent threat to millions of Americans, then the decision to depart from standard international practices must be made by the president, and the president must be held accountable," she said. "That very, very narrow exception within very, very limited circumstances is better than blasting a big hole in our entire law." Then, on Sept. 26, 2007, Clinton said something different. During a debate, Tim Russert asked her about the ticking bomb scenario and here's what she said: "As a matter of policy, it cannot be American policy, period." She said she met with military generals who told her there is "very little evidence that it works." In the days after the debate, the Republican National Committee criticized her for flip-flopping, and Obama said he would oppose torture "without exception or equivocation," according to Daily News reports. Did Clinton change position because of her talks with the generals or because of the "politics of the moment"? We can't see inside Clinton's head, so our ruling doesn't reflect on that part of the statement. But it is clear she changed her mind about the "ticking bomb" scenario. So we rate Obama's claim True.

"If you look at the bill that passed the Ways and Means Committee yesterday, for every dollar that is spent to help small businesses, $4 is being spent to help upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington," Cantor said. So there's two sides to this equation: the amount of the money in the plan to help small businesses versus the amount to "upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington." Let's start with the grass. Cantor is referring to $200 million in the stimulus plan for revitalizing the National Mall, the sprawling grassy park and gravel walkway that links the Capitol with the Smithsonian museums, the Washington Monument, and the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials. The Mall, which gets more than 25 million visitors a year, is in serious disrepair. Perhaps most dire is that the sea walls next to the Jefferson Memorial are slowly collapsing into the Tidal Basin and need to be repaired, said Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. According to stories in the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and Newsweek, much of the Mall's underground sprinkler system doesn’t work, reflecting pools are cloudy with muck, the oldest structure on the Mall has missing and boarded-up windows, and yes, the lawn has been trampled brown in many places. "The Mall is just in bad shape," Brost said. "To laugh it off as replacing grass, it's not appreciating the fact that the place that holds our national treasures is in severe disrepair." The House bill states that the money would be used for "construction, improvements, repair or replacement of facilities related to … the National Mall." Although the bill doesn't contain specific numbers, a "discussion draft" of the package considered by the House provides a little more detail. It says the "many" projects that would be funded in the Mall project include "repair of the Jefferson Memorial’s collapsing Tidal Basin walls and the replacement of mall turf." In order to make his equation work, Cantor assumes all of $200 million is for the new turf. It's not. In reality, only a small portion of the $200 million would be for new turf, Brost said. "It's one of a lot of things that need to get done." Okay, how about the other side of Cantor's equation, the part about help for small businesses? Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring said the stimulus package in the House only includes $41 million in "direct" benefit to small businesses. He referred us to a line in a Joint Committee of Taxation revenue table for the stimulus bill that lists a tax provision "Temporary increase in limitation on expensing of certain depreciable business assets." But they are taking a very narrow approach in estimating how long that benefit would last. They are assuming it would end in 2010 because that law and many other tax provisions expire that year. But they're ignoring the likelihood that Congress will extend it, said Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks government spending. "This is a very popular provision supported by both parties," Ashdown said, and so it's very likely to continue after two years. Brost, the spokeswoman for the Appropriations Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., said Cantor's equation also ignores other provisions in the stimulus package that could help small businesses, even if they are not the sole beneficiary. Among them: • $430 million in loan guarantees and other incentives to free up capital and make lenders more willing to loan money. • $100 million for grants and loans to guarantee $2 billion in lending for rural businesses. • $100 million, including $70 million for the Technology Innovation Program, to accelerate research in technologies with high job growth potential, and $30 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships to help small and midsize manufacturers compete globally by providing them with access to technology. • $250 million in grants to address long-term economic distress in urban industrial cores and rural areas. It is distributed based on need and ability to create jobs and attract private investment. Although it would be inaccurate to tally all of these and count them as direct assistance to small businesses, it is fair to say that many small businesses would benefit from these $880 million in programs, Ashdown said. In addition to these provisions, Brost said, small businesses will surely benefit from the many infrastructure projects the plan proposes. We're not taking sides about whether it's proper for the National Mall improvements to be included in the stimulus bill. But Cantor's rhetoric is inflated. He says the money would help "the lawns of Washington," which suggests it might go to homeowners when it is really for a sprawling public park. And both sides of Cantor's equation are flawed. The plan does not call for $200 million worth of new grass for the National Mall, and we think there's clearly more than $41 million in help to small businesses. Cantor has grossly distorted the numbers to make a point about the need for more small business benefits. We rule his statement False.

pomt-07134	"The Public Employee Retirement System is making more millionaires than the Oregon state lottery."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/16/ted-ferrioli/oregon-pers-making-more-millionaires-oregon-lotter/	Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, does not shy from controversy. In 2003, he took on Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard over urban-rural school funding. Earlier this year, Ferrioli told an out-of-country wolf lover to "go away." And in April, he posted online a column on Oregon’s Public Employees Retirement System that generated more than 220 comments and more than 350 "likes." Ferrioli swipes hard at Oregon’s public retirement system in his "PERS makes more millionaires than the lottery," saying that its whacked-out generosity means fewer dollars for public schools and more money for public workers. He writes, "The Public Employee Retirement System is making more millionaires than the Oregon state lottery" and later, "You'd be hard pressed to find any place in the private sector where individuals retire as millionaires but don't contribute a dime to their retirement." There is probably no topic in government that frosts Republicans more than PERS. What, you ask, is PERS and how is it that people can retire as millionaires without contributing "a dime to their retirement?" as Ferrioli says. We’ll explain. In the op-ed, Ferrioli said there were 241 employees who had more than $500,000 in their PERS accounts as of December 2009. These employees could choose to retire under an option that gives them $1 million in one payout. Megabucks, he wrote on the other hand, had produced 227 millionaires. However, the numbers are not accurate. PERS spokesman David Crosley said PERS goofed and the 241 should have been 214. And the number of lottery winners is higher than indicated by Ferrioli. According to Oregon Lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, there were 229 Megabucks millionaires, 26 Powerball millionaires, eight Lotto-America millionaires, five Wheel Spin millionaires, seven Raffle millionaires, one Keno millionaire, and eight Scratch-it millionaires for a total of 284 Oregon Lottery millionaires. We asked Michael Gay, Ferrioli’s spokesman, to reassess given the corrected figures. Gay expanded his boss’s argument, saying that while there are 214 accounts with at least $500,000, there are in fact, thousands more actual retirees who are collecting at least $4,500 a month, which would make their annual pay $54,000 and their eventual pay over 20 years of expected living $1.08 million. (We looked at the figures, and found there are 441 retirees as of December 2009 who are collecting at least $9,000 a month, or $108,000 a year. These people would easily hit $1 million with just 10 years of retirement.) Still, we don’t think it’s fair to count among the "millionaires" people who are expected to get paid in future installments. To check that instinct, we called Brent Hamilton, president of the Financial Planning Association of Oregon and Southwest Washington. He said he doesn’t count personal assets, such as cars and homes, when screening people for investment purposes. Instead, he focuses on "investable assets," like liquid money in the bank. A monthly check isn’t the same as money in the bank. On the face of it, Ferrioli is wrong in stating that PERS has created more millionaires than the Lottery. But we get his larger point. These are people who can retire with at least $1 million under the "double lump sum" option -- even $2 million in a rare handful of cases. His analysis also doesn’t include retirees in previous years who may have taken the double lump sum option. These retirees most likely didn’t contribute any part of their pay into retirement, unlike people in the private sector because in Oregon, the public employer "picks up" most employee contributions -- 6 percent -- on behalf of workers. Some lawmakers, including Ferrioli, have fought to make employees pay the cost of their own contribution. Public employees argue that they are paying out of their pockets, because it’s a bargained-for right they negotiated years ago as part of their compensation package. Just out of curiosity, we wanted to know how $1 million retirement balance ranks in size. Jack VanDerhei of the Employee Benefit Research Institute says that for people in their 60s with at least 30 years on the job, the average 401(k) balance is closer to $192,000. So $500,000 -- or $1 million under the option -- is pretty plush. The retirement system certainly is generous for some of Oregon’s oldest public employees, with a retirement provision no longer afforded those in the private sector. That’s not the case with younger and newer Oregon employees, who may have the government pick up their contribution, but who didn’t benefit from the generous returns of the 1980s and 1990s. In short, most state workers don’t end up as millionaires, and with PERS reforms in 2003 and possible reforms this year, the number of potential millionaires should go down. Plus, all lottery winners have to do to win is buy tickets, while the PERS "millionaires" have worked at least 30 years on the job. We’re not going to get hung up over the actual numbers. We rate the claim Half True: partially accurate with some important details and context missing.	None	Ted Ferrioli	None	None	None	2011-06-16T06:00:00	2011-04-26	['Oregon']
pomt-05331	"20 million people could lose their current coverage" … "including our senior citizens who are on Medicare."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-seniors-20-million-health-care-law-lose/	An ad from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claims seniors could lose coverage thanks to "Obamacare." It pins the blame on Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. The ad intercuts its own commentary with video footage of Nelson speaking on the Senate floor. U.S. Chamber: "Obamacare will be a nightmare for Florida seniors. Did Bill Nelson consider the consequences when he cast a deciding vote for Obamacare?" Nelson: "This legislation is gonna let folks that are happy with their insurance keep it …" U.S. Chamber: "Wrong. 20 million people could lose their current coverage." Nelson: "... including our senior citizens who are on Medicare." U.S. Chamber: "But Senator, seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare. Call Bill Nelson. Tell him to support the repeal of Obamacare." Here, we’re checking whether "20 million people could lose their current coverage," and whether those people are older Americans on Medicare as the ad strongly suggests. For evidence, the ad’s fine print cites a March report from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. We should note that PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions. However, we do fact-check whether ads accurately portray predictions made by others, particularly ones that carry a great deal of credibility, like CBO. So that’s what we’ll do here. We read the report, which analyzes the health care law of 2010, also known as the Affordable Care Act. We quickly realized the ad was mixing apples and oranges. The ad makes it sound like 20 million seniors will be losing coverage. The report’s estimate has to do with people who get health insurance through work, which the CBO calls employer-provided insurance. But most seniors don’t get their insurance through work; they get their health insurance through Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for older Americans. The ad blurs these distinctions in a way that’s highly misleading. Even if the ad had provided proper context of employer-provided insurance, it’s still not exactly the case that 20 million people will lose coverage under the health insurance law. First, that estimate is the highest number of several estimates and scenarios that the CBO examined. Second, some portion of that number are people voluntarily switching to other, better coverage -- not being forced out of coverage against their will. Third, these numbers ignore estimates that say 9 million people who didn't have employer coverage will get it because of the law. For more details on the report, read our fact-check of Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said that "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare." We rated his statement Half True. Unlike the chamber ad, Preibus put the number in the more appropriate context of health insurance through work. The CBO report does not make any mention of Medicare beneficiaries losing coverage. And in fact, in our many reports on Medicare, we’ve never seen that claim that seniors would lose Medicare coverage because of the health care law. Yet it seems like that’s the reasonable interpretation of the ad. We contacted the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that works with Medicare beneficiaries to educate them on the program and help them get access to care. We asked executive director Judith Stein if there was any scenario in which seniors would lose coverage under the new health care law. "If they’re stating that 20 million people would lose Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act, that is simply not true. In fact, the health care law strengthens Medicare coverage," Stein said. Our ruling The ad from the U.S. Chamber makes it sound like 20 million older Americans will lose coverage under the health care law. We found no evidence that Medicare beneficiaries will lose coverage under the health care law, and the ad’s evidence points to one cherry-picked statistic that applies to employer-provided insurance, not Medicare.

pomt-09906	"We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/09/eric-cantor/Cantor-and-other-republicans-say-obama-promised-s/	With unemployment rates continuing to rise nearly five months after the economic stimulus plan was passed, House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said the Obama-backed plan is a bust. "Clearly the stimulus or so-called stimulus plan that spent almost $800 billion dollars has not worked," Cantor said in a PBS interview on July 8, 2009. "We were promised, the president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent. We're now over 9.5 percent, on our way to 10 percent." The claim that the Obama administration "promised" the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent is a popular talking point among Republican critics of the stimulus. We've heard it from House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, Reps. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., as well as conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, to name a few. They all called it a "promise." They are referring to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create between three and four million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also includes a graphic predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. But in June, the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent. In the past week, the administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. Here's what Romer herself said in a July 2 interview on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated. What the private forecasters are saying now is that they do anticipate that the economy will start growing again in the second half of the year, and that usually, then, employment and unemployment start to respond shortly after that. So I think that is a realistic expectation." Biden also acknowledged the discrepancies in a July 5 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. "The truth is, we and everyone else misread the economy," Biden said. "The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures in most of the blue chip indexes out there. ... And so the truth is, there was a misreading of just how bad an economy we inherited. Now, that doesn't — I'm not laying — it's now our responsibility. So the second question becomes, did the economic package we put in place, including the Recovery Act, is it the right package given the circumstances we're in? And we believe it is the right package given the circumstances we're in." Stephanopoulos correctly noted that projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the time were slightly less optimistic than the administration's. In January, the CBO projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein, the co-author of the February projections, said they were off because the fourth-quarter economic numbers weren't available at the time. When they were released a short time later, they revealed the economy was in more dire shape than economists realized. Bernstein maintained in that June news conference that the stimulus is working, and that without it, the unemployment rate would be even worse. The debate about the numbers comes from the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. How can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate gets to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The same holds true for Republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus isn't working. Again, it's difficult to empirically prove whether they're right or wrong. We're certainly not going to try here. What we can rule on, however, is whether the Obama administration "promised" that unemployment rates would not rise above 8 percent if the stimulus were passed. We could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making such a public pledge. What we saw from the administration in January was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." That sure doesn't sound like a full-fledged promise to us. We think it's a big stretch to call an economic projection a "promise." The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." And so we rule the statement by Cantor — and other Republicans who have said the same thing — Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2009-07-09T17:22:45	2009-07-08	['None']

pomt-12403	Under the American Health Care Act "people with pre-existing conditions are protected."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/24/american-action-network/conservative-groups-ad-misleads-about-pre-existing/	A political group backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan has come to the aid of fellow Republicans who voted for their party’s Affordable Health Care Act. The American Action Network has launched two weeks of ads in 21 House districts that could face competitive races in 2018 because members voted for the bill May 4, including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami and U.S. Rep. Brian Mast of the Treasure Coast. The politically conservative group has spent $5.6 million on TV, digital and radio advertising campaigns since the House passed the legislation. The ads, which will also run on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, are narrated by a mom who says her family lost their insurance and doctor because of the Affordable Care Act. "But now, we have hope," she says. "House Republicans are keeping their word and fixing our broken health care system: more competition and choices resulting in lower costs and better coverage. Families get tax credits to make insurance cheaper, and people with pre-existing conditions are protected. Thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for fighting for the better health care we deserve." While AHCA has some language that is intended to protect those with pre-existing conditions, health care experts have previously told us that the legislation would allow insurance companies to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions. We contacted the American Action Network’s spokeswoman but did not get a reply. GOP bill would allow insurers to charge more for pre-existing conditions The Affordable Care Act adopted in 2010 prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage — or charging higher premiums — because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. The American Health Care Act, as passed by the House, does not approach pre-existing conditions the same way. The literal language of an amendment appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions. It states that "nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." Here’s the issue: That language says insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions. It says nothing about the costs for those patients. The legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on the "health status" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and making a guess as to how they will use medical care in the future. That means the costs would rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor. "Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions," Jost said. "Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable." The exact amount might differ regionally, as some states might not allow the higher rates. The legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the "essential health benefits." The waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. Republicans argue that the high-risk pools will protect those consumers with pre-existing conditions. (Curbelo’s spokeswoman sent us a copy of the Republican talking points that make that argument.) To sweeten the legislation for Republicans on the fence before the vote, the GOP added in more money for those risk pools. In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status. However, many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks, and questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. Many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. Our ruling An ad by the American Action Network says that under the American Health Care Act "people with pre-existing conditions are protected." The only kernel of truth here is that the amendment has language that states insurers can’t limit access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, the ad omits that the House GOP health plan would weaken protections for these patients. The legislation would allow states to give insurers the power to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition. While Republicans point to the fact that those patients could get help through high-risk pools, experts question their effectiveness. Current law does not allow states to charge people with pre-existing conditions significantly more. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11500	"Mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/23/ted-deutch/did-mass-shootings-increase-200-percent-assault-we/	Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., claimed mass shootings increased substantially after an assault weapons ban expired in 2004. The Democratic lawmaker represents the Parkland, Fla., community, where on Valentine’s Day a 19-year-old man killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Authorities say the gunman who’s been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder used an AR-15 rifle. "Let's be clear, mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired," Deutch said during a Feb. 21 CNN town hall with survivors of the mass shooting. We’ve fact-checked several claims about gun control since the shooting and wondered if this one was true. At least one researcher found a significant increase in mass shootings since the assault weapons ban expired. But overall, experts caution against pegging an increase solely to the ban’s expiration, and told us Deutch’s claim is based on a flawed analysis. Background on assault weapons ban A federal law from 1994 to 2004 banned the manufacture of 19 military-style assault weapons, assault weapons with specific combat features, "copy-cat" models, and certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Congress did not renew the ban once it expired in September 2004. What happened next? Advocates on both sides of the gun debate often point to the same report assessing the ban published in 2004 for the U.S. Justice Department. One key takeaway: The report said it was premature to make a definitive conclusion about the ban’s impact. It said there had been mixed results in reducing criminal use of the banned guns and magazines. If the ban were to be renewed, it might reduce the number of gunshot victims, but the effect would likely be "small at best and possibly too small for reliable measurement," the report said. If the ban lapsed, the report said, it would be possible for new assault weapons to be used in mass murders. Experts dissect Deutch’s evidence Former President Bill Clinton made a similar point as Deutch in 2013 when he said, "Half of all mass killings in the United States have occurred since the assault weapons ban expired in 2005, half of all of them in the history of the country." The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded the claim Three Pinocchios. The fact-check found that Clinton was exaggerating research from Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Why is that relevant? Deutch’s office cited commentary posted on The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, as support for his statement about a 200 percent increase in mass shootings. The commentary criticizes the Fact Checker article for missing the big picture behind Clinton’s point. Part of the Century Foundation commentary said: "If we look from September 2004 all the way back to 1900 (104 years), as the Washington Post lays out, there were 118 mass shootings. That breaks down to 1.13 mass shooting incidents per year, on average, from 1900 to 2004. In the eight years since the assault weapons ban has expired, there have been 28 mass shooting events. That equals an average of 3.5 a year — an increase of over 200 percent." But several experts, including Duwe, pointed out flaws in that examination and consequently, in Deutch’s relay of that information. "This claim is, at best, very misleading for a few reasons," Duwe told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. For starters, to arrive at a 200 percent increase, the claim actually has to go back to 1900, and not the decade after the ban’s expiration that Deutch cited. "The assault weapons ban was only in effect from 1994 to 2004, and that is the relevant period to compare with the period after 2004 if one is making a claim about the impact of the assault weapons ban," said Gary Kleck, David J. Bordua emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. It’s also important to factor in population size changes, experts said. In an October piece for Politico, Duwe noted that "since the mid 2000s, the incidence of mass public shootings on a per capita basis has been a bit higher than it was in the preceding 10 years." But the rates over the past 10 years were not higher than in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Duwe said. "If you have more shootings after the ban but also have a larger population, then when the numerator and denominator are increasing, the outcome number stays the same," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an expert on mass shootings research and an assistant professor of public justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Nonetheless, mass public shootings have become deadlier over the last decade, as the number of victims shot and killed has increased since the expiration of the assault weapons ban, Duwe said. It’s also worth noting that there isn’t an universally accepted definition for mass shootings. Deutch’s office said their definition for mass shooting involved an individual with a firearm who targets four or more victims with intent to kill, not including the perpetrator. Duwe defined mass public shooting more narrowly as any incident in which four or more victims are killed with a gun within a 24-hour period at a public location in the absence of other criminal activity (robberies, drug deals, gang "turf wars"), military conflict or collective violence. Other supporting evidence Louis Klarevas, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts-Boston and has also written about mass shootings, told us his research generally supports Deutch's claim. Klarevas examined incidents before, during and after the assault weapons ban when six or more people were shot and killed. • 1984 to 1994: 19 incidents • 1994 to 2004 (ban is in effect): 12 incidents • 2004 to 2014: 34 incidents That shows a 183 percent increase of incidents in the decade after the ban, compared to the years during the ban. However, several experts also cautioned against concluding that an increase in mass shootings would be solely tied to the expiration of the assault weapons ban. A critical question in the assessment of the assault weapons ban would be how often assault weapons, however defined, were used in mass shootings, said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. "I do not expect the effect of a ban to be instantaneous, nor to end when the ban ends," Koger said. "If there are a certain number of assault weapons in circulation when the ban goes into effect and these weapons are removed from circulation over time (say, if they are destroyed, become ineffective, or are seized by the police), then the effect of a sales ban increases over time." If gun manufacturers find a way around the ban, its effects decrease over time, Koger said, adding that once a ban is lifted, "its effects may linger to the extent that it decreased the supply of assault weapons in circulation." Among other factors also worth considering is media coverage of mass shooters, which Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama, said rewards perpetrators with fame and can lead to copycat effects. "Although firearms availability is the primary reason why the United States has more public mass shooters than other countries, media coverage of perpetrators may largely explain why the United States has seen more public mass shooters and deadlier incidents over time," Lankford said. Our ruling Deutch said, "Mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired." Researchers of mass shootings told us the analysis Deutch relied on is flawed because it did not adjust for population changes and used irrelevant data points for comparison. Trends in the incidence and severity of mass public shootings on a per capita basis also show that the rate per 100 million is similar now to that of the 1980s and early 1990s, an expert told us. A separate analysis found an 183 percent increase in mass shootings where six or more people were killed in the decade after the ban, compared with the 10-year ban period. But experts caution against inferring that an increase is due only to the ban’s expiration. Deutch’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01235	"4.7 million people have lost their insurance in 32 states" due to Obamacare.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/18/dana-loesch/conservative-talker-loesch-says-47-million-people-/	Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch gamely agreed to debate Obamacare last week with liberal pundit Ed Schultz on Schultz’s program on MSNBC. Unfortunately, what emerged was the verbal equivalent of mixed martial arts as one would interrupt the other, and the preferred rhetorical device seemed to be talking louder and louder. (We also checked Schultz's claim about 10.3 million people benefiting from Obamacare.) In the course of the melee, Loesch delivered a salient criticism about the Affordable Care Act. "4.7 million people have lost their insurance in 32 states," Loesch said. We reached out to Loesch to find the source of that claim and did not hear back. However, it matches a list compiled by the Associated Press in December 2013. It represents a tally from AP staffers and calculates a low-end figure of how many Americans received insurance cancellation notifications. (Not every state was able to provide a figure, hence Loesch isolating on 32 states.) You likely remember stories about the cancellation notices, which were the result of individual insurance plans not meeting the minimum standards of the new health care law. PolitiFact’s 2013 Lie of the Year was a claim by President Barack Obama that "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." Since that chaotic time, however, some clearer data has emerged. While the AP said that millions of people had received cancellation letters, there are reasons to doubt the numbers in certain states. For example, the list said 333,000 notices went out to Blue Cross/Blue Shield customers in Florida. But as reported by PolitiFact Florida, a company spokesman said it mailed only 44,000 cancellations letters. The AP said 290,000 cancellations letters were sent in Washington state. A few weeks later, the state’s insurance commissioner called that "inaccurate." Analysts at the Urban Institute explored the discrepancies in a survey conducted the same month as the AP published its list. When they asked people with individual insurance, they found that about 20 percent said the plan they had in 2013 would no longer be offered. Based on this survey, the analysts estimated that about 2.6 million people had lost their existing plans due to the minimum standards set by Obamacare. But the institute analysts also noted that a great deal of churning always takes place in the individual market. They found that less than 20 percent of the customers ever kept a plan for more than two years. This fits with the experience of another health care researcher, Christine Eibner with the RAND Corporation. "It appears that the number of people that lost coverage from 2013 to 2014 is similar or less than the number of people who lost coverage in previous years," Eibner told PunditFact. So, while the Affordable Care Act’s standards played a role, some people would have changed, dropped or altered coverage anyway. Moreover, the AP figure fails to factor in that due to the outcry in November 2013, Obama gave states the option to allow people to keep their existing plans, if insurers agreed. In Florida, the 44,000 people who did get a cancellation letter later received a second one that said they could keep those policies for another year, if they wanted. In fact, the key problem with Loesch’s statement is that she said these people "have lost their insurance," as if none of them replaced one plan with another. A study published by RAND in April 2014 painted a very different picture. Of an estimated 9.4 million people with individual insurance, fewer than 1 million ended up without any coverage at all. Over half of the original group bought another policy in the individual market. About 2 million took coverage offered through an employer, and a bit under a million found a plan through one of the government’s online insurance marketplaces. Finally, we should note that while some people have lost insurance since most of the main elements of Obamacare took effect, the net impact has been a boost in the ranks of the insured. An estimated 10.3 million more people have insurance today than did right before October 2013. Our ruling Loesch said that 4.7 million people have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare. That number matches one cited by the Associated Press based on preliminary estimates and incomplete data. The best estimate from independent researchers is that perhaps 2.6 million people received notices that their health care insurance policies were being canceled. However, Loesch spoke as if these people, whatever their number, did not find replacement coverage. In reality, fewer than 1 million people who had been part of the individual insurance market ended up with no coverage at all. Given the constant churn in that market, it is unlikely that the Affordable Care Act caused all of them to be without health insurance. Loesch’s number is off, both in terms of the cancellations and what people did afterward. Still, the new law did hurt some people. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04751	Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says climate change is a problem.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/29/florida-wildlife-federation/convention-billboard-touts-john-kasichs-view-clima/	Republican devotees who have traveled to Tampa, Fla. for their party’s national convention expect a week filled with activities aimed at unifying the GOP around the central policy and agenda messages as they nominate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. But as thousands of out-of-towners arrived and made their trek to the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the arena hosting the convention, they have been greeted by some well-placed advertisements featuring some prominent conservative leaders -- including Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- that are not quite in lock-step with the message Republicans have long touted. Kasich is prominently featured on a billboard outside the arena and on one at the most central interstate highway crossing in the city, as well as, on some placards adorning 40 city taxi cabs proclaiming his belief that global warming is real. "I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change," reads a quote attributed to Kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling Ohio governor. But wait, Kasich is still as staunch a conservative as ever, isn’t he? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if the ad accurately reflects the governor’s position. The billboard was sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation, a private membership group with about 60,000 members who are hunters, fishermen and outdoorsmen with a keen interest in environmental issues. It told PolitiFact Ohio it partnered with the Evangelical Environmental Network, a Washington lobbying group, to place the advertisements. The Federation’s policy consultant, Jay Liles, said his group is desperate to get politicians to view climate change as a life-changing issue and not a partisan issue. They have skin in this game. And there it is true that some Republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor. In addition to Kasich, the federation also has sponsored similar ads with similar messages from similarly conservative leaders, such as, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President George W. Bush. We checked with Kasich’s staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor’s spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio, that was sponsored by The Hill, a Capitol Hill media organization. "What they have on the billboard is accurate," Nichols said, adding that Kasich has uttered similar comments four or five times during various private speeches, some of which were before Republican gatherings. But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich thoughts on global warming. "He has said this several times but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said," Nichols said. "Each time he says it he has added, ‘How big is this? I don’t know. Should we overreact to this? No.’" In fact, The Hill published an article on May 2, 2012, about Kasich’s speech at the energy conference. The quote on the billboard came from that story, according to the Evangelical Environmental Network. The full quote is: "I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don’t want to overreact to it, I can’t measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it." Liles said the Federation was approached by the evangelical group and agreed to sponsor the Tampa advertisements to convince Republicans to stop viewing global warming through political lenses. "We believe at the core that people don’t treat our environment as a right or left issue, it is an issue that affects all of us. It is an issue that affects our pocketbooks," Liles said. "Whether it is addressed more through market driven means or through proposed regulatory means," he said, "we believe somewhere in the middle is a road forward and they need to stop making this a partisan issue." Alexei Laushkin, of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which paid for the advertisements said his group intentionally sought out key conservative leaders to push this agenda. "We in the evangelical community are tired of the politics of the issue and wanted to highlight conservatives who agree with us on this issue," Laushkin. For the most part, Republicans have doused talk of global warming saying Democrats are pushing it to enforce more government regulations on the energy industry. The Hill article notes that the Environmental Protection Agency has already begun to try to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and proposed carbon dioxide standards for new power plants to help mitigate the suspected effects of global warming. And that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real. But some Republicans have challenged the proposed EPA standards and questioned scientists conclusions. "We’re hoping at the end of the day it will be a bi-partisan issue, one party can’t solve the issue so we want to highlight conservative leadership on this," said Laushkin. Laushkin said he suspects that many Republican delegates who see the signs at the convention will be surprised. But as far as the quote from Kasich, his own staff confirms its accuracy. As long as Kasich’s comments aren’t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is OK with how he is being portrayed, Nichols said. And that’s how the billboards convey the message. No scare tactics. Just Kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Florida Wildlife Federation’s claim rates True.

pomt-03500	"My judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-judicial-nominees-have-faced/	In the Rose Garden on June 4, 2013, President Barack Obama announced three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In unveiling the nominees, Obama criticized Senate Republicans, accusing them of consistently obstructing his court picks. While Obama acknowledged that Democrats "weren’t completely blameless when I was in the Senate," he added that today’s Republican opposition to his judicial picks "is unprecedented." "Time and again, congressional Republicans cynically used Senate rules and procedures to delay and even block qualified nominees from coming to a full vote," Obama said. "As a result, my judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor … This is not about principled opposition. This is about political obstruction." Is Obama really correct that his judicial nominees "have waited three times longer" than those nominated by President George W. Bush? The answer hinges on how you define the phrase "to receive confirmation votes." First, a civics reminder. The president is responsible for nominating judges, and the Senate is responsible for confirming them. Once a nomination is made, it goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Once it clears the committee, it goes to the Senate floor. By the book, the final confirmation vote only requires a majority, but in recent years, senators have increasingly threatened to filibuster -- that is, block -- judicial picks. This forces the Senate to first vote on ending the filibuster threat, a vote that requires 60 votes, not 51. The fact that there’s a two-step process -- first moving from nomination to committee, and then from committee to a confirmation vote -- has led to contradictory trends on nominee delays. Bush’s nominees tended to get delayed before winning committee approval, while Obama’s have more often been delayed on the floor. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, published a thorough analysis of judicial nomination delays on May 2, 2013. Here are some of the highlights. From nomination to confirmation Measured one way -- from nomination to confirmation -- Obama’s claim is off base. According to CRS, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for first-term circuit court nominees -- which include the D.C. Circuit -- was 240.2 for Obama. That was shorter than the 277 days faced by the nominees of George W. Bush. (Obama’s waits were, however, longer than for presidents George H.W. Bush, Reagan and Clinton.) Using the median wait, rather than the average wait, Obama’s nominees did face slightly longer delays than Bush’s did -- 225.5 days for Obama compared to 216 days for Bush. But even that was nowhere near the three-times-longer figure Obama cited. Obama was on safer ground regarding nominees to district courts, which are the trial courts one level below circuit courts. Obama nominees waited an average of 221.8 days, which was 42 percent longer than Bush’s nominees waited. Still, this isn’t three times as long. (Using the median showed essentially the same pattern.) From committee approval to confirmation Where Obama has a point is if you measure the time from the point of committee approval to confirmation -- in other words, the period when the nomination is on the Senate floor, where it can be filibustered. For an Obama circuit court nominee, the average wait from committee approval to confirmation was 138.5 days -- almost four times the duration under George W. Bush, which was 35.3 days. The median waits were similarly divergent: Obama’s nominees waited 131.5 days, compared to 18 days for nominees of George W. Bush. (Just to show how slow the process has become, George H.W. Bush's nominees waited just 7.8 days.) The same pattern held for district court nominees. For Obama, the average number of days was 98.5, compared to 34.9 days for George W. Bush -- about three times as long. The median figures were similar as well -- 91 days for Obama, 18 days for Bush. A White House spokesman, Eric Schultz, confirmed that Obama was talking about time spent on the floor after committee approval, and he argued that this is the fairest measurement. Schultz argued that it’s only fair to start measuring once all the preliminary requirements are done, including the paperwork, the rating process by the American Bar Association, the scheduling of hearings, the submission of senators’ written questions. Each of these steps, he said, could easily produce delays for logistical reasons rather than political opposition. We asked three academic experts on judicial nominations whether they agreed with Schultz’s preference for the committee-to-confirmation measurement, but we failed to secure a consensus. Paul Finkelman, a law professor at Albany Law School, said he thought the White House’s favored measurement was better, but Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who worked in the White House counsel’s office under George W. Bush, argued that measuring the full time period was preferable because committee tactics can "include secret holds, delayed hearings, delayed votes and more." And Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that while he thinks the White House’s argument is reasonable, Obama should have been specific about the measurement he was using in his remarks -- something he could have done easily by saying, "My judicial nominees have waited three times longer on the floor to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor." Meanwhile, Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, created an "index of obstruction and delay" in a paper published a decade ago in Judicature Journal. His aim was to come up with a single number that measured both obstruction (that is, unsuccessful nominations) and delay (taking longer than 180 days from nomination to confirmation). Goldman has found that the index for Obama’s circuit court nominations was 0.9524, the highest he’s ever recorded. In a comparable period -- 2003 to 2004, when Bush was president and the GOP controlled the Senate -- the index was significantly lower, 0.6176. Still, Goldman told PolitiFact that his index "does not address the three-times-as-many claim" that we are checking here. Our ruling Obama said his judicial nominees "have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor." That’s true if you count from committee approval to confirmation, but not if you count the full period from nomination to confirmation. As it turns out, the average wait for George W. Bush’s circuit court nominees was actually longer from nomination to confirmation. Because Obama didn’t specify the measurement he was using -- and because an alternative number exists that runs counter to his claim -- Obama has essentially cherry-picked a figure that puts his situation in the most sympathetic light. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-06-07T10:08:42	2013-06-04	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-03448	"In the past four years, (the U.S. Senate) has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/21/jack-kingston/senate-record-appropriations-draws-kingstons-scrut/	The race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Saxby Chambliss is in full swing -- at least on the GOP side, where at least four major hopefuls have announced for the seat. One of the contenders made a point of denouncing the work -- or lack of work -- carried out by the current Senate over the past few years. In a speech announcing his run for the Senate last month, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah said: "The United States Senate has not passed a credible budget in four years. In the past four years, it has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills." "It has killed any attempts to rein in entitlements, reform out-of-control spending or reduce government interference in our lives," he continued. "If we are going to turn America around, we have to start with the United States Senate." Our fact-checkers have examined some aspects of this argument before. Last year, PolitiFact Tennessee found that the Senate had not passed a budget in three years. And PolitiFact Georgia recently found that with the exception of a few very, very short meetings, Congress had spent 66 of the first 100 days of the current session in recess. So now, has the U.S. Senate really passed little more than one-fifth of the appropriations bills that have come before it, as Kingston claims? We decided to track down the numbers and check out the claim. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford responded to our inquiry in an email. The congressman’s statement was about "regular order appropriations measures" that should have passed for fiscal years 2010-2013, he said. The claim was based on figures from the Status of Appropriations Legislation charts for 2010-2013 maintained by the Library of Congress. There are 12 regular annual appropriations, or spending, bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies. When those bills are passed individually, through the traditional committee process, they are considered to have gone through the "regular order." The 12 appropriations bills are included in the annual budget resolution. According to Kingston’s count, the nine bills that were passed were in fiscal year 2010, Crawford said. The nine appropriations bills were for: agriculture, commerce-justice-science, defense, energy and water, homeland security, interior and environment, the legislative branch, military construction-veterans affairs, and transportation-housing and urban development. We also checked the Library of Congress charts and found that Kingston’s count was accurate for the past four fiscal years. And in fiscal 2010, while the Senate passed nine spending bills, it did not pass regular order spending bills for financial services, labor/health and human services/education and the State Department and foreign operations. When lawmakers in the Senate and House chambers -- or even within the same chamber -- can’t agree on the individual spending bills in time for the new federal fiscal year on Oct. 1, the bills can sometimes be lumped together in "omnibus" bills. In December 2011, the Senate passed an omnibus spending bill of almost $1 trillion that combined nine of the 12 appropriations bills. Before that, the federal government had operated throughout 2011 on a continuing resolution that maintained policies and program levels set in the fiscal 2010 appropriations bills. For fiscal 2013, the Senate passed another continuing resolution at the end of March, almost six months after deadline, to keep the government running. President Barack Obama signed the stopgap plan into law a week later. So what does this mean? Has the Senate been derelict in its duties? The Senate hasn't been passing individual spending bills, "but I see this largely as a reflection of the majority's (Democrats) inability to secure the necessary 60 votes for passage given GOP opposition and willingness to filibuster the bills," said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political science professor at George Washington University. For Kingston’s argument, from a very far bird’s-eye view of the Senate, this is an institution that is having a hard time functioning under its rules during these times of political polarization, Binder said. Kingston is right to say the Senate is having a hard time, she said. But before criticizing this Senate too much, Binder said, we need to remember that this has happened before. In the 1980s, for example, the House and Senate passed none of the 12 spending bills individually but put them all into omnibus bills, she said. "Ultimately there are no innocent parties here," Binder said. To sum up, Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston said the U.S. Senate has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills in the past four years. Data from the Library of Congress, which tracks bill histories, show that his statement is correct. But digging a bit deeper into his claim -- and into history -- shows that this congressional stalemate that lingers over federal spending is not new. Also, while the Senate may not have passed its portion of bills, there are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have prevented real progress on solutions to reduce the national debt and grow the economy. Kingston’s statement is accurate but needs more information. We rated it Mostly True.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2013-06-21T00:00:00	2013-05-02	['None']
pomt-10527	"I committed to public financing; (Obama) committed to public financing."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/03/john-mccain/mccain-says-accept-obama-says-pursue/	Sen. John McCain says Sen. Barack Obama committed to a campaign restricted to public financing and suggests the Illinois senator is reneging on that promise. "I committed to public financing; he committed to public financing," McCain told reporters Feb. 20, 2008, in Columbus, Ohio. "It is not any more complicated than that. I hope he will keep his commitment to the American people." First, some basics: When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who pay a voluntary $3 on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount determined by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election. Keep in mind that $84.1-million is less money than Obama raised in January and February 2008 combined, according to campaign estimates. And, given his longshot status in early 2007, this prolific fundraising was not foreseen. To the question of whether Obama committed to public financing as McCain asserts, we have to back up to one year ago, when the two candidates were vying to break out of a crowded candidate field. This is how we got here: • On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the Federal Election Commission on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. • On March 1, 2007, by a vote of 5-0, the FEC approved an advisory opinion: "Senator Obama may solicit and receive private contributions for the 2008 presidential general election without losing his eligibility to receive public funding if he receives his party's nomination for president, if he (1) deposits and maintains all private contributions designated for the general election in a separate account, (2) refrains from using these contributions for any purpose, (3) refunds the private contributions in full if he ultimately decides to receive public funds." • The same day, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. "Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same," Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, tells the New York Times. • And Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: "If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." The next key development in this saga is a questionnaire sent to all presidential candidates in the fall of 2007 by the Midwest Democracy Network. McCain didn't respond, but Obama did and his answer to the question of whether he would participate in public financing was clear: "Yes. ... In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." It would appear then, from public statements, that Obama and McCain both wanted a publicly funded general election. In the midst of this developing dispute over the general election fundraising, McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying, "I ... am withdrawing from participation in the federal primary-election funding program." McCain was one of the few candidates to seek public money during the primaries and as such, his spending is limited through the convention in September. His campaign apparently has nearly reached the limit already. Problem is, the FEC cannot rule on McCain's request because the six-member commission has four vacancies. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling. Against this backdrop, the McCain-Obama dispute has grown hotter. The League of Women Voters and other reform groups wrote to Obama on Feb. 15, 2008, urging him to renew his commitment to public financing. And Obama wrote an op-ed for USA Today, which his campaign now says is the clearest explanation of Obama's position. "I propose a meaningful agreement in good faith that results in real spending limits," Obama writes in the Feb. 20, 2008, piece. "The candidates will have to commit to discouraging cheating by their supporters; to refusing fundraising help to outside groups; and to limiting their own parties to legal forms of involvement. And the agreement may have to address the amounts that Senator McCain, the presumptive nominee of his party, will spend for the general election while the Democratic primary contest continues." Then in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, moderators pushed Obama to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. "What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody." Stephen Weissman, associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit institute affiliated with George Washington University, says Obama is hedging his bets. "The hedges that he's raised are very considerable because he's mentioned two things — outside groups and pre-convention spending by McCain," Weissman said. "I think that what's happening is someone said to Obama, 'We think we can raise $150-million or something, or $200-million, through the election and you never know what the Republican will throw at us, so be careful, don't commit yourself to this. We have a possibility here for really winning this election and restoring the Democrats.' " Evaluating the truthfulness of McCain's statement, "I committed to public financing; (Obama) committed to public financing," it's clear that McCain committed to public financing in March 2007, and reiterated that commitment in February 2008. It's also clear that Obama has committed to "aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." And in answering the question, "Will you participate in the presidential public financing system" on the Midwest Democracy Network questionnaire, Obama said, "Yes." But every comment Obama makes is in the context of reaching an agreement with the Republican nominee. It is not a blanket commitment to public financing. For this reason, we rule McCain's statement to be Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-03-03T00:00:00	2008-02-20	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02496	"The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when (Mary) Burke was commerce secretary."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/14/republican-party-wisconsin/1988-wisconsin-unemployment-rate-greater-us-rate-o/	Republicans have made it clear that between now and the November 2014 gubernatorial election, they will be reminding voters about Democratic former Gov. Jim Doyle -- who has been out of office, and largely out of sight, for more than three years. They are casting Doyle as an ineffectual, or worse, chief executive and tying him to Gov. Scott Walker's main challenger, Democrat Mary Burke. On Feb. 4, 2014, the state Republican Party issued a news release attacking Burke, who served as state commerce secretary during part of Doyle's tenure, for not having proposed a jobs plan. Among other things, the party said Doyle-Burke policies led to the loss of 133,000 jobs, a claim previously made by Walker that we rated Mostly False. Walker had said Burke "implemented the policies" of Doyle and those policies "saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs." The number was right but other factors, namely the Great Recession, were primarily to blame. Another line in the state GOP's news release also referenced Burke, albeit more benignly, in making this claim: "The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary." Let’s take a look. The numbers Asked for evidence to back its claim, the Republican Party referred us to monthly unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. from 1988 through 2013. They are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government's official job counter. More specifically, the party cited 15 months in 2006 and 2007 when Wisconsin’s unemployment rate exceeded the national rate. That was in May, June, September, October, November and December of 2006; and the first nine months of 2007. Burke was commerce secretary during all 15 months, having served in the post from Feb. 7, 2005 to Nov. 2, 2007. And BLS statistics confirmed that the only times since 1988 that the Wisconsin unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. rate were those 15 months. It's worth noting that although state unemployment rates exceeded U.S. rates during that period, the rates were under 5 percent whereas they are now above 6 percent. And the difference between the Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates was relatively small in the period cited by the GOP. For example, in May 2006, the state unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and the national rate was 4.6 percent. The largest difference was 0.4 percent -- the state rate was 4.8 percent in May 2007, while the national rate was 4.4 percent. The Republican Party did not have evidence to back the other part of its claim, which links the higher state unemployment rates to Burke. Other factors Marquette University economist Abdur Chowdhury told us that state government policies, such as providing business incentives, can affect unemployment and that Burke clearly was part of the team that developed policies in the Doyle administration. But many factors, particularly trends in the national economy, affect unemployment rates in the states. "I wouldn't give Mary Burke full credit for any job that was created and she should not be solely blamed for the loss of any job," Chowdhury said. Indeed, when Burke cited her work as commerce secretary and said in October 2013 that when she left the job in 2007, Wisconsin had 84,000 more jobs than it does today, we rated her statement Half True. The numerical part was on target, but Burke overstated the credit that she and Doyle deserved. In this case, the state GOP notes higher unemployment rates while Burke was in the commerce job, but doesn’t directly blame her or her policies for the higher rates. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP said: "The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average" was when Burke was state commerce secretary. The statistic is accurate and the claim only indirectly blames Burke. We rate it Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-04927	Embryonic stem cell research is at a "dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/31/dave-weldon/dave-weldon-claims-embryonic-stem-cell-research-de/	Former Space Coast Rep. Dave Weldon wants to debate the front-runner in the GOP primary for Florida’s U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Connie Mack IV. Mack, riding high in the polls with enviable name recognition, isn’t game. So in an unusual yet entertaining move, Weldon created his own six-minute debate with Mack and posted it on his website. Though Mack’s responses were phony, Weldon used the "debate" to talk up his social conservative credentials. Moderator: "The government has been paying for stem cell research despite majority opposition. Mr. Mack?" Fake Mack: "HUH?!?" Moderator: "Okay, I see you voted for more spending. Dr. Weldon?" Weldon: "The truth is, research into embryonic stem cells is not only immoral but scientifically it has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment." It’s not the first time Mack has differed from fellow Republicans on the issue. Mack voted in favor of bills that would have expanded federal research on embryonic stem cells beyond limitations set by an executive order from President George W. Bush. Bush vetoed the bills Mack supported, but President Barack Obama kept his promise to lift Bush’s restrictions that federal money not be used for research on embryonic stem cell lines created before 2001. Obama in 2009 talked of "broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by federal funds." With that background in mind, we wanted to check Weldon’s claim that embryonic stem cell research "has proven to be a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment." We should note that Weldon is an internist and a practicing physician. Embryonic stem cell research involves experiments on live embryos obtained through extra eggs of in vitro fertilization patients, who must sign consent forms allowing for experimentation. These eggs were not fertilized inside of the women’s body, according to the National Institutes of Health. Research on human, non-embryonic stem cells is older and less controversial. The key difference is embryonic stem cells can become all cells of the body, while adult stem cells are limited to the cells of their original tissue. Weldon obviously disagrees, arguing the research is an affront to the sanctity of life because embryos are destroyed in the process. Proponents of expanding embryonic stem cell research say these embryos would be discarded anyway, and it’s worthwhile to explore more uses for embryonic stem cells. The National Institutes of Health spent about $123 million on research involving human embryonic stem cells in the fiscal year ending in 2011, according to the NIH. The government spends more on other areas in this field, doling out $620 million in 2011 for non-human, non-embryonic stem cell research and $395 million on human non-embryonic work. The National Academies of Science has also issued guidelines for stem cell research. In its 2008 revision of stem cell research guidelines, it noted that "it is far from clear at this point which cell types will prove to be the most useful for regenerative medicine, and it is likely that each will have some utility." One group that doesn’t think embryonic stem cell research is at a "dead end" is the Genetics Policy Institute, which will host the World Stem Cell Summit in West Palm Beach, in December 2012. The first isolation of embryonic stem cells happened just 14 years ago, said Bernard Siegel, the advocacy group’s executive director. It’s a huge discovery -- akin to "nuclear fission in a petri dish" -- that will take time for scientists to unravel, he said. "I would say the United States could be much further along without opposition to stem cell research, and certainly Dave Weldon is a prime example of someone who has put the brakes on promising research," Siegel said. A website for which Siegel is a spokesman, StemCellAction.org, lists "recent advances" in embryonic stem cell research across the globe. Yes, he said, Weldon is right that no successful treatments have emerged from these cells, but that perspective dismisses multiple research efforts across the world. " ‘Treatment’ means something that has gone through an approved clinical trial," Siegel said. "And in fact, one of our very first approved clinical trials is going on now." That trial involves macular degeneration, which leads to blindness. A preliminary report released in January 2012 described improved vision for two legally blind patients through therapy using human embryonic stem cells. While the New York Times noted a few problems with the report, it was welcome news to proponents who were discouraged after the Geron Corporation called off the world’s first clinical trial around embryonic stem cells. In announcing the end of its trial, which aimed to treat spinal cord injury, Geron said the company wanted to focus on cancer therapy experiments that were further along, and that it had not lost hope for the embryonic stem cell field. Many scientists and politicians are hopeful about a recent development that may quell questions of morality. The technique reprograms skin stem cells with embryonic qualities without destroying an embryo. However, the resulting cells are not free of complications, and some studies show they may increase the risk of cancer. "There’s a lot of potential for them," said Stephen Duncan, director of stem cell biology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "But human embryonic stem cells are the gold standard." University of Wisconsin developmental biologist James Thomson -- whose research team was first to derive embryonic stem cell lines from human embryos in 1998 -- was among researchers who in 2007 discovered the reprogrammable cells. Even with the discovery, he said it was not time to stop researching embryonic stem cells. Thousands of stem cell researchers assembled in Yokohama, Japan, for the annual conference of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in June 2012, including Lawrence Goldstein. Goldstein is one of the society’s board members and director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego. "I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a dead end," he said, referring to his own research that aims to develop a therapy for ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. "The (academic) papers are not saying ‘we’re closing this area down because there are no interesting scientific leads.’ In fact, the area fuels research on embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed stem cell research. The area (Weldon) would support would be going more slowly without the work on embryonic." Our ruling Weldon’s synopsis of embryonic stem cell research as at a scientific "dead end" does not appear to be widely shared by scientists. Research is ongoing, and scientists say it’s too early to call it quits on a discovery made in 1998. Weldon’s second point about there being "no one good successful treatment" from embryonic stem cell research is accurate, though scientists say it is premature and unrealistic given the field’s bureaucratic constraints. On the whole, we rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Dave Weldon	None	None	None	2012-07-31T12:25:47	2012-07-23	['None']
pomt-05987	"Under this tax cut, middle-class families don't save enough for a week's worth of groceries, while millionaires save enough to go on an exotic vacation."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/22/lou-greenwald/lou-greenwald-claims-governors-proposed-income-tax/	Millionaires, pack your bags. Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald claims the wealthy can take a trip to paradise with the money they’ll keep under the 10 percent income tax rate cut proposed by Gov. Chris Christie. Middle-class families, meanwhile, won’t save enough to stock their cabinets for a week. "Let's be clear about this - Gov. Christie's income tax plan may sound nice, but it would save a family earning $50,000 per year just $80.50 and a family earning $100,000 per year just $275, all [the] while ... millionaires get a $7,265.75 tax break," Greenwald (D-Camden) said in a Jan. 17 press release. "Under this tax cut, middle-class families don't save enough for a week's worth of groceries, while millionaires save enough to go on an exotic vacation." The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services analyzed the impact of the governor’s proposed income tax cut for the Assembly Democrats. The cut would be phased in over three years. Savings are estimated by reducing the amount of income tax joint filers pay by 10 percent. According to the analysis, a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 pays $805 in income tax now. Under Christie’s proposal the same couple would pay $724.50, or $80.50 less. A couple with a taxable income of $1 million pays $72,657.50 now. A 10 percent reduction in that bill equals $65,391.75, or $7,265.75 less, according to the analysis. James R. Hines Jr., co-director of the law and economics program at the University of Michigan Law School, said it’s fair to estimate the impact of an income tax rate cut by calculating the reduction in the tax bill. "There’s nuances but by and large, it’s roughly right," he said. Under the proposed cut higher income filers benefit more than lower income filers. Hines said that’s expected. Suppose you say "the lion’s share of the benefits go to the rich," he said. "It tells you the lion’s share of the taxes must be paid by the rich." Christie also responded to that charge in a recent WNYC interview: "Those folks who are paying more in a progressive system, when you cut those taxes are going to get more. That's the definition of a progressive system." So Greenwald’s numbers are reasonable, but what about his comparisons: Are savings under the proposed income tax cut too little to cover a week’s worth of groceries for a middle-class family? And can a more than $7,000 tax break pay for an exotic vacation? Federal data and a review of travel websites back the assemblyman up. Greenwald based the grocery figure "on paying bills and providing for a family in the real world, such as going to the supermarket for a week’s worth of groceries to feed 3 growing kids, with healthy meals for breakfast lunch and dinner," according to a spokesman. A family of four with school-age children on average spends between $233 and $283 a week on food with a moderate-cost to liberal meal plan, according to November 2011 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture A two-week vacation for two, including airfare, accommodations, taxes and fees, from Newark to Fiji costs more than $7,500 in a package listed on the travel website Kayak.com. Expedia.com prices a similar vacation in Bali at about $5,800. Our ruling After the governor announced his proposal to cut income tax rates by 10 percent, Greenwald said in a press release that the cut wouldn’t be enough to pay for one week of groceries for a middle-class family, but millionaires would save enough to take an exotic vacation. Greenwald is right: those who make more in New Jersey will save more from an across-the-board income tax cut. And federal data and vacation package deals listed on travel websites back up the assemblyman’s comparisons. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03631	"We’re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/05/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-spending-proposed-fy14-budget-/	If New Jersey is going to see any fiscal progress, the state has to reduce spending, according to Gov. Chris Christie. And those steps have already yielded significant results, he claimed recently. "We’re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008," Christie said during his monthly "Ask the Governor" program that aired April 22 on NJ101.5 FM. Christie’s claim is a variation on one he made in January, also during that month’s "Ask the Governor" program, when he tied the 2008 budget to Democratic predecessor Jon Corzine. Now he’s also tying it to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie in November’s gubernatorial election. As we determined in a February fact-check, state spending is down since 2008, but Christie ignores that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office on Jan. 19, 2010. Let’s review the numbers. It’s worth noting that Christie first made the comparison of his administration spending less than Corzine’s between the fiscal 2008 and 2013 budgets, so we’ll look at those two years first. The spending difference was $1.5 billion. For fiscal year 2008, spending was $33.6 billion, according to Treasury department reports. Christie’s budget for fiscal year 2013 contained $32.1 billion in spending. So Christie is correct that spending on his watch is below what Corzine spent, but the governor’s spending isn’t so innocent, either. Christie’s first budget for fiscal year 2011 was $28.4 billion. For fiscal year 2012, the governor approved a $29.6 billion budget. Christie’s fiscal year 2013 budget was $32.1 billion and his proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $32.9 billion. So, Christie’s budgets are lower than Corzine’s, but they’re still growing every year. We should note that the fiscal year 2014 blueprint is still subject to hearings and possible cuts. Christie has until July 1 to sign it. In PolitiFact New Jersey’s February fact-check, Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn said the increased spending since fiscal year 2011 was due in part to Christie’s policies boosting the state’s economy, leading to higher tax revenues. At that time Quinn noted that two of the major areas of higher spending had been in education and pension contributions. There’s also another reason why Christie’s budgets have spent less than the ones crafted on Corzine’s watch: Corzine used more money for property tax relief than Christie. Also, Christie imposed a 2-percent cap on spending that didn’t exist when Corzine ran the state. Additionally, although Christie ties Buono in to the fiscal year 2008 budget, she did not chair the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2007, the year that Corzine’s spending plan was created. Buono chaired that panel in 2008 and 2009, when the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 budgets were created. Said David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, in an e-mail: "The Governor would rather rewrite history than own up to cutting property tax relief, slashing education aid and reducing the Earned Income Tax Credit." Our ruling In responding to a caller during New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program last month, Christie claimed, "We’re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008." Christie is correct that the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget of $32.9 billion is less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008, at $33.6 billion. But Christie’s claim leaves out some details. First, state spending has increased every year that Christie has been governor. Second, he ties the higher-spending budgets in part to Buono, but she did not chair the Senate budget panel that crafted the fiscal year 2008 budget. Overall, Christie’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That makes it Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12911	"I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/18/betsy-devos/education-nominee-betsy-devos-says-wyoming-school-/	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary thinks some K-12 schools may decide they need a gun on campus — to protect themselves from bear attacks, for example. At her Senate confirmation hearing, education activist and major Republican donor Betsy DeVos mentioned a meeting she had with Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. He told her about a rural public school in Wapiti, Wyo., that has a fence surrounding the schoolyard to keep grizzly bears out. Later in the hearing, DeVos suggested a fence might not be enough. When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked DeVos if she thinks guns should be allowed on school premises, DeVos said that decision should be left up to local lawmakers who might have specific needs. Like grizzly bears. "I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies," she said, referencing the school in Wyoming. We couldn’t bear not knowing whether the elementary school in Wapiti, Wyo., keeps a gun on hand to defend against grizzlies. So we called up Park County School District No. 6, which includes Wapiti Elementary School. "No, we do not," said Angie Page, assistant to the superintendent, citing the district’s no-weapons policy. The entire state of Wyoming actually has a policy banning weapons on elementary, middle and high school campuses, state Department of Education spokesperson Kari Eakins said. Decisions about wildlife defensive measures are made at the local level and not reported to the state. Even though Wapiti Elementary doesn’t keep a gun for use against a grizzly, there really is a fence to keep bears out. Wapiti, an unincorporated community with a population of about 165, is located on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. More than 700 grizzlies live in the Greater Yellowstone area, according to the National Park Service. The Wapiti school put up a fence to keep the grizzlies out of the playground in 2002, according to the Billings Gazette, a newspaper in Montana. Between 1990 and 2000, 16 grizzly bears were captured within a 4-mile radius of Wapiti, the article said. The Denver Post reported in 2005 that a Wyoming Fish and Game biologist had recently captured two cubs hanging around the Wapiti school, and that a grizzly hide was nailed outside of the principal’s office. Even after finding that DeVos’ claim was incorrect, we wondered if it’s advisable to use a gun when faced with a potential grizzly bear attack. Adult males can weigh up to 700 pounds and are about 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder. "Without question, guns can protect people from bears," said Tom Smith, a wildlife sciences professor at Brigham Young University. "But, and this is a big but, to be able to use a firearm under duress effectively is limited to a very small group of persons." Smith told us that people would be much better off using some sort of bear spray (about $40 on Amazon). It’s non-lethal to the bear, it’s less cumbersome than a gun, and because it creates a plume of spray, the user’s aim doesn’t have to be as accurate as it would be if he or she were using a gun. A study of bear attacks in Alaska found that in 27 percent of cases involving guns that failed, the person couldn’t get their gun ready fast enough to shoot the bear, according to an article Smith wrote for Alaska Magazine in 2012. Firing a warning shot was only successful at getting the bear to leave in 33 percent of incidents. "So while some may carry firearms for protection, and it certainly is their right, the vast majority of persons would do themselves — and bears and quite honestly the rest of us — a big favor by carrying bear spray," Smith said. Our ruling DeVos said, "I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies." The elementary school in Wapiti certainly faces the threat of grizzly bears, given its proximity to Yellowstone National Park. It has a fence surrounding the playground to keep bears out. However, the state of Wyoming and the school district ban weapons in K-12 schools, so Wapiti Elementary does not have a gun on hand to defend against potential bear attacks. We rate DeVos’ claim False. Correction: Due to a transcription error, the word "probably" was left out of DeVos' statement in an earlier version of this article. It read, "I would imagine there's a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies."

pomt-00899	Texas this fiscal year will "have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/mar/04/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-errs-saying-texas-will-end-fiscal-year/	Texas state government can afford tax cuts and targeted investments and will still have billions of dollars left over, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM. In the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, which we caught online, Patrick said: "We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We’ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That’s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined." This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined? We emailed Patrick’s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction—rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state’s expected fiscal-year-end reserves. The Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state’s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017. Per Patrick’s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined. Texas, Alaska outpace other states An online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined "Year-End Balances" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, "a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015." Pew official For more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds. By email, spokeswoman Sarah Leiseca passed along analyst Brenna Erford’s conclusion--drawing on Fiscal 50, a Pew interactive breaking out the fiscal status of each state--that Patrick got it wrong. At the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. "The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days," Erford said. SOURCE: Online interactive, Fiscal 50, Pew Charitable Trusts (chart received in an email from Sarah Leiseca, communications officer, Pew Charitable Trusts, attributing information to research by Brenna Erford, manager, state budget policy team, Pew Charitable Trusts, Feb. 26, 2015). Going forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. "According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas’ reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas’ reserves are not more ‘than the other 49 states combined,’" Erford said. NASBO charts With a nudge from Michael Leachman, a state budget expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we spotted charts in the NASBO report indicating the 50 states together in fall 2014 were projecting 2015 fiscal-year-end reserves, meaning regular balances plus rainy day fund set-asides, of about $53 billion--with Texas accounting for $10.7 billion of that and Alaska $10 billion and other states all together projecting nearly $32 billion in ending reserves. An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds. Texas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don’t dwarf all other states’ projected savings combined. Patrick: ‘Unintentional error’ After we looked over the charts, Patrick’s office told us Patrick made "an unintentional error" in the radio interview. By email, spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick takes pride in the state stockpiling reserves, but he’d meant to talk up jobs created in Texas versus jobs created in all other states combined "as he ad-libbed the comment." Our ruling Patrick said Texas this year will "have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined." On our inquiry, Patrick acknowledged this was a misstatement. Indeed, what he celebrated turned out to be incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-05130	"Three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/24/lamar-alexander/lamar-alexander-says-three-tennessee-cities-among-/	Even as coal advocates applied political pressure on Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the state’s senior senator stood his ground in refusing to join the fight to kill the Environmental Protection Agency’s planned implementation of clean air rules. Commercials by the group American Commitment, a conservative group recently focusing on boosting the coal industry, branded him an ally of what it calls a "war on coal" by President Obama. The group asked people to call and write Alexander to make him switch his stance and vote for a resolution by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, to disapprove the EPA's new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants. Alexander responded by saying he was "standing up for Tennessee." He cited the pollution created from "dirty air" blowing into Tennessee from other states causing smog in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and even pointed out that more Tennesseans work for companies that make pollution-control equipment required under the rule than work mining coal. At a Congressional field hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee in Murfreesboro, Alexander also claimed that one result of "dirty air" is that, in Tennessee, "three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma." We decided to see if that was indeed true. A quick primer on asthma from the Mayo Clinic: It is "a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath." The Mayo Clinic says, "It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors." Alexander’s office said he was referring to the 2012 Asthma Capitals rankings released in May by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). The AAFA describes itself as a non-profit founded in 1953 that "is the leading patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma and allergy patient group in the world." Sure enough, the rankings have Memphis at No. 1, Knoxville at No. 3 and Chattanooga at No. 5, with New Haven, Conn., at No. 2 and Pittsburgh, Pa., at No. 4. And it was apparently no fluke -- the 2011 rankings had those Tennessee cities ranked Nos. 2-4, though Knoxville was ahead of Memphis last year. Nashville, it’s worth noting, ranked No. 26 this year after coming in at No. 10 in 2011. It’s important to note that the AAFA emphasizes the rankings are an attempt to measure which cities "are more challenging places to live" for asthma sufferers, not necessarily just a listing of places with the highest prevalence of people suffering with asthma. The report also notes that air pollution is not the only factor it considers, with a total of 12 data sets that include the number of high-ozone days, pollen counts, medication utilization, poverty rates and public smoking laws. Our ruling Alexander wasn’t saying dirty air was the only reason Tennessee cities rank high on a list showing the most challenging cities in the country for asthma, just that the nation’s 17th-largest state placed three of its cities in the top five of those rankings. We rate that statement True.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2012-06-24T06:00:00	2012-06-18	['United_States']

pomt-00506	"We have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/25/cornell-william-brooks/how-many-hate-crimes-are-there-united-states-2/	After the Charleston church shooting, residents of the South Carolina city came together to rally behind the families of the nine victims. One notable moment came during suspect Dylann Roof’s arraignment, when a relative of one of the dead told him, "You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people. But God forgives you. I forgive you." Some pundits see the response as proof that race relations in the United States are improving; others are more skeptical, with many pointing out that the number of hate crimes committed has remained stubbornly steady and worryingly high. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks falls firmly into the latter category. "The level of hate crimes in this country has remained constant over years," he said on Face the Nation. "We have to allocate resources to address these hate groups and these hate crimes. The fact of the matter is, the Justice Department underestimates the degree of hate crimes in this country because they have to rely on self-reporting. That is a challenge. And the fact that we have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year is unconscionable and inconsistent with our values as Americans." Brooks’ claim about the number of hate crimes surprised us, so we decided to see if we could confirm the number. Conflicting collections Written for the purpose of collecting statistics on the phenomenon, the Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as "crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity." There are two main programs for data collection on hate crimes in the United States. The first is the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, known as UCR, which aggregates voluntary data from law enforcement agencies around the country. The agencies reported 5,796 hate crime incidents for 2012, much lower than the amount Brooks claimed. But the UCR program relies solely on crimes that are reported to the police. In an attempt to account for crimes not reported to the police, the federal government instituted the National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. This household survey, currently conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, asks nearly 160,000 people annually whether or not they have been the victims of crime. In 2012, the survey estimated that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred, well in line with Brooks’ statement. So, what accounts for this surprising discrepancy? For one, the two methods simply approach the problem differently. The FBI program asks the police to report the number of hate crimes they have logged in a year, while the survey asks possible victims if they have experienced a hate crime. Beyond that, however, there are serious questions about how the methodology of each study affects its results. To begin with, the UCR program is generally considered highly susceptible to underreporting as a result of agency non-participation. "There is a structural and institutional problem, which is that a lot of agencies aren’t participating," said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. "For instance, states with the highest percentage of African-Americans are participating least in the program, but 31.3 percent of victims are African-American. They’re the single largest group victimized." Levin also cited the unbelievably low numbers of reported hate crimes in states such as Alabama (six) and Mississippi (four) as proof that agencies frequently fail to aggregate and report the number of hate crime incidents they process. The FBI’s participation rates further corroborate Levin’s assertion. The Anti-Defamation League compiled a table from the FBI data showing that in 2013 there were 85 cities with populations greater than 100,000 that either reported no hate crimes, or failed to report at all: notable cities on the list include Miami, Tulsa, Tampa, and Honolulu. (Hawaii’s police agencies have not reported a single incident in the past two years.) Furthermore, local police officers may be incapable of properly identifying hate crimes when they are reported to them. A study on crime classification errors by James Nolan of West Virginia University found that officers undercounted hate crimes by 67 percent. Finally, experts told us some victims are reluctant to report incidents to the police. Immigrants, for example, can oftentimes perceive the language barrier as insurmountable, while other victims have grown up in an environment where reporting a crime to the police is not socially acceptable. For its part, the National Crime Victimization Survey avoids many of these issues, since it simply asks victims of a crime whether or not they think they were targeted because of bias related to their membership in a protected category (those listed in the law). On the other hand, that means the survey may overcount the incidence of hate crimes; Levin suggests that respondents "might be reporting biased incidents that aren’t crimes, or crimes that they think are prejudice-related but aren’t." Nevertheless, the general consensus among experts is that the survey numbers come much closer to telling the truth than the FBI reports. Our ruling Brooks said, "We have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year." Looking at the National Crime Victimization Survey does confirm his claim, with a 2012 report finding nearly 300,000 estimated victims of hate crime. And while the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, an alternative method of data collection on hate crime, only found around 6,000 reported hate crimes in 2012, experts said it’s widely accepted that crimes are underreported with this method, mainly because of police non-participation and miscategorization. Admittedly, the survey does carry its own flaws related to possible overcounting, but experts tend to agree that it comes closer to accurately estimating the total number of hate crimes.

pomt-11531	"One-third of Floridians own guns. One-third."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/feb/15/joy-reid/Do-one-third-of-people/	After 17 people were killed in a Florida high school shooting on Valentine’s Day, MSNBC political analyst Joy Reid blamed lawmakers’ inaction on gun control and the gun lobby for allowing a proliferation of guns in Florida. "One-third of Floridians own guns," Reid tweeted Feb. 14. "One-third." Reid continued: "Florida is where ‘stand your ground’ laws were born. Florida politicians tried to ban doctors from asking abuse victims if there's a gun in the home. Florida is awash in assault weapons. Want to know why? Ask Marion Hammer and the NRA." The first "stand your ground" law was passed in Florida in 2005, but we wondered about Florida’s gun ownership rate that Reid cited. We found that Reid’s claim about gun ownership is accurate, based on a study that used 2013 survey. But that study is chock-full of caveats. 2013 survey data backs up Reid’s point According to a brief report by Injury Prevention, an international peer-reviewed journal, the gun ownership rate in Florida in 2013 was 32.5 percent, the same as the one-third figure Reid cited. The study, led by former Columbia University public health researcher Bindu Kalesan, extrapolated its numbers from a nationally representative survey of 4,000 people in 2013, that were 18 years or older. Kalesan, now a professor at Boston University School of Medicine & Boston School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Florida that Reid’s claim is accurate based on the study. The study also found that roughly one-third of the nation owns guns, about 29.1 percent. By state, gun ownership varied considerably, from 5.2 percent in Delaware to 61.7 percent in Alaska. Florida is not an outlier when it comes to gun ownership, based on this study. For example, it showed Texas ownership at 35.9 percent. We ran the survey by a few experts to get their take on its findings. The biggest complaint was that the survey wasn’t large enough to establish state-based numbers with certainty. "The survey is not representative of state ownership," said Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University. "The researchers applied the data to the states even though the source of the data cautioned people not to do that." Miller and David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the best measurement for gun ownership in Florida comes from the early 2000s. The Centers for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System asked health-related questions to hundreds of thousands of people each year. There were gun questions on the 2001, 2002, and 2004 national questionnaire. Hemenway said in 2001, 24.5 percent of Floridians said they had a gun in the home. It’s worth noting we also found research on the national level from a June 2017 Pew Research Center survey, which found three in 10 U.S. adults said they own a gun, and an additional 36 percent say that "while they don’t own one now, they might be open to owning a gun in the future." Just like the Injury Prevention study, the sample size for the study was around 4,000 respondents, but it was not extrapolated to a state level. Our ruling Reid said, "One-third of Floridians own guns." Reid’s claim is accurate based on a 2015 survey that showed that 32.5 percent of Floridians owned guns 2013. However, experts said that the national survey data was not meant to represent the state level. Having said that, experts agreed there hasn’t been any good research on state ownership levels since the early 2000s when it was around 25 percent in Florida. Reid’s number seems to be in the ballpark, but it’s important for people to know there is some uncertainty. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-09664	"Although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida's 25 districts, their districts received 60 percent of the stimulus funds."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/24/jeff-miller/recovery-gov-assigns-statewide-education-jobs-one/	The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. Some Republicans say the site is a bunch of unreliable propaganda. Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on the Web site and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and "00th" districts. "The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist," Miller wrote. "Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts." "We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high," Miller wrote. "The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida’s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption." Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation "unassigned congressional district." ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and we archived the Florida page that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data. We rated Miller's statement on this Mostly True. So Miller was correct about the errors on Recovery.gov congressional districts, though they're fixed now. But was he right that Democratic districts are receiving more money than Republican districts? It's worth noting that Miller is criticizing the data but is still using it to make a political point. We ran the data ourselves using the Recovery.gov numbers, and found he was correct. In Florida, Democratic districts are getting 57 percent of money reported thus far, about $3.9 billion, while Republican districts are getting 43 percent, or $2.9 billion. It's important to understand that at this point, Recovery.gov is pretty much the only game in town for quantifying the stimulus. The numbers are reported by government agencies and private businesses from around the country, and they automatically feed into Recovery.gov. The government does not independently verify the numbers, but officials have taken steps to remove numbers that seem obviously incorrect once they are pointed out. Nevertheless, officials are aware that the data at times contain errors. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that does investigations for Congress, found that while agencies and employers were making good-faith efforts to report data, the reporting has been inconsistent. "Even recipients of similar types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they developed their jobs data," the agency said in a report filed last week. Looking at stimulus money in Florida, we noticed that the money and jobs reported for District 2 -- a seat in North Florida held by Democrat Allen Boyd -- stuck out like a sore thumb. That district reported almost 24,000 jobs saved or created and $2.2 billion in funding. The next closest is District 11, a seat in Tampa held by Democrat Kathy Castor. Her district listed 430 jobs saved or created and $428 million in funding. We suspected that statewide funding is being applied to Boyd's district because it includes the state capital in Tallahassee. In fact, we found a project for the Florida Department of Education that listed close to 13,200 jobs saved or created and $1.5 billion in funding -- all credited to District 2. The project details said it was intended to pay for teachers, teachers' aides and other educational staff. The fund was tagged as being for the "State Fiscal Stabilization Fund," which aimed to make up statewide budget shortfalls. This suggested that much of the money credited to Boyd's Tallahassee district was actually spent statewide. We contacted the office of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, and a spokesman confirmed our observation about the 13,200 jobs. "These jobs represent statewide information and statewide jobs," said spokesman Sterling Ivey in an e-mail. "Showing them in the Tallahassee Congressional District or in Leon County does not reflect that the jobs are statewide. Our hope is that the federal reporting system will be refined to more accurately reflect the information." We also asked him whether there was any evidence that the money was being distributed in a partisan manner. "Most of the funds are distributed through existing federal funding formulas or through competitive processes. Don Winsted, Special Advisor to Governor Crist, has closely observed this process throughout and has seen no evidence of partisan distribution of funds. "It is probably fair to criticize the federal reporting process (and last week’s GAO report on job reporting does exactly that), but the shortcomings are largely attributable to a first attempt to report very complex information rather than any partisan dimension," Ivey said. Remove the Department of Education funding from the Democratic side of the ledger, and the total for Democratic districts actually drops a bit below the total for Republican districts: $2.4 billion vs. $2.9 billion. We asked Miller's staff about this, and they sent us the following statement from the congressman: "Recovery.gov made numerous errors in reporting of jobs and Stimulus money disbursements on their website. Although some of their errors have been removed from the site, it would not surprise me if there were other errors in the assigning of disbursements to the wrong Congressional District." Clearly, the data on Recovery.gov is subject to some amount of clerical errors and distortions. Those errors might be unintentional, but the data should still be approached with caution. And we should note this isn't the first time that we've seen problems with the Obama administration's aggressive promotion of stimulus numbers. Back in May, President Barack Obama said the economic stimulus has " saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs " in its first 100 days. That was an estimate created by White House economic advisers, and independent economists we interviewed said that it was far too early to create a definite projection with a high level of accuracy. So we rated his statement Barely True. On the other hand, our reporting has also found the stimulus is properly credited for contributing to 3.5 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product during the third quarter. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said all that was due to Cash for Clunkers and a homebuyers tax credit , but we found that Half True. In the claim we're examining here, Rep. Jeff Miller said, "Although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida's 25 districts, their districts received 60 percent of the stimulus funds." Recovery.gov is the primary source for data on the stimulus, and it does show more money going to Democrats. But it didn't take us long to notice that the projects reported in at least one Democratic district are way off. Miller himself said the data was unreliable, but then uses the same data to say Democrats are getting more money. That doesn't seem to be the case. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00014	"If you cross the border illegally in the U.S., you get a drivers license, medical insurance, housing, career training, the right to vote."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/viral-image/facebook-meme-misleads-about-benefits-immigrants-w/	A popular meme on Facebook gives the false impression that people who cross into the United States illegally are automatically given a wide range of benefits, including the right to vote. The meme says that people who cross illegally into Canada, Iran, and North Korea face harsh consequences as punishment for that action. For instance, it says that crossing illegally in Iran gets you eight years in prison. Whereas crossing illegally into the United States leads to benefits. "If you cross the border illegally in the U.S., you get a drivers license, medical insurance, housing, career training, the right to vote," said the meme posted Oct. 31 on the Facebook page Judge Jeanine Pirro Fans. It's been shared more than 90,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Immigrants who are apprehended by Border Patrol are not provided the benefits the meme claims, they're rather placed in removal proceedings or returned to their countries. Some may apply for immigration protections such as asylum, but that still doesn't immediately grant them priviliges such as a driver's license or the right to vote. Immigrants who live in the United States illegally are generally barred from most federal benefits. However, in some states, low-income children can be eligible for health insurance regardless of immigration status. Some states also issue driver's licenses to people who are illegally in the United States. But those things are not guaranteed or broadly available across the country. The meme misleads and leaves out significant context to create a false narrative. Driver’s license States are responsible for issuing driver’s licenses — and most don’t issue them to immigrants in the country illegally. About a dozen states do grant driving privileges regardless of immigration status. Those cards are limited for driving and not valid as official forms of identification for federal purposes. Some states call the cards a Driving Privilege Card or Driving Authorization Card. Immigrants must provide certain required documentation in order to get the cards. Medical insurance Immigrants in the country illegally are ineligible to buy medical insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. They are also ineligible for non-emergency Medicaid. However, some states, such as California, allow low-income undocumented children and youth under 19 years old to get medical coverage through their state’s Medicaid program. Under law, hospitals can’t turn away someone needing emergency care based on immigration status. Housing Individuals living illegally in the United States are ineligible for federal housing assistance. But it’s possible that they live in a household where someone is a lawful permanent resident or U.S. citizen eligible for housing benefits. In 2017, the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development asked the department to clarify and offer guidance on noncitizen eligibility for some programs. Career training This is vague. But children in the country illegally are allowed to go to public school regardless of immigration status. This was guaranteed by a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case. Right to vote Noncitizens are not allowed to vote for candidates running for federal office, such as the presidency or congress. However, a small number of jurisdictions allow noncitizens to vote in local elections for school board or city council. If someone crossed into the United States illegally and eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen, that person would have the right to vote as would someone born in the United States. Our ruling A Facebook post said, "If you cross the border illegally in the U.S., you get a drivers license, medical insurance, housing, career training, the right to vote." The post attempts to contrast illegal border crossing consequences and punishments in other countries and the United States. If someone is caught crossing U.S. borders illegally, they're placed in removal proceedings or returned to their countries. They don't automatically get the benefits outlined in the meme. People who already live in the United States illegally may be able to get some priviliges such as a driver's license or medical care — if their state allows it, not many do. Those benefits are not guaranteed across the country. Immigrants in the country illegally are barred from federal housing benefits. Children can go to public school regardless of immigration status, though it's unclear if that's what the post suggests by "career training." Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, a few jurisdictions allow noncitizens to participate in local elections. The post leaves out important context to distort the facts.

pomt-13285	Donald Trump has said "nuclear proliferation is OK."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/11/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-donald-trump-ok-nuclear-prolifera/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner had the back of Tim Kaine, his longtime Democratic ally and fellow Virginia senator, after last week’s vice presidential debate. "I think that Tim clearly won the debate," Warner said in an interview with Fox News. He credited Kaine with confronting Mike Pence, the GOP vice presidential nominee, on some of the controversial statements made by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Warner said, "What you had, though, is Mike Pence, and understandably, not being willing to answer, you know, some of the outrageous things Trump has said like, you know, nuclear proliferation is OK." We took a look at whether Trump really has sanctioned nuclear proliferation. Warner’s office pointed us to a variety of Trump statements that PolitiFact has vetted in the past in examining other claims about the nominee’s view on nukes. His positions on proliferation sometimes seem contradictory, so we decided to lay them out. But reading through them, it’s clear that Trump thinks it might not be bad if South Korea and Japan developed their own nuclear weapons, given the threat they face from North Korea. "Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons," Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said. Here are some of Trump’s key comments this year about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons: March 27 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump replied, "At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem." He added later in the same interview: "If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us." March 29 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, "If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?" In response, Trump seemed to indicate that he both opposes proliferation and that he wou ldn’t mind a few nations getting nukes for the first time. "No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any," Trump said at one point. At another point, he said, "I don't want more nuclear weapons." But during the same segment, Trump contradicted himself. "Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?" he asked Cooper. Cooper asked Trump, "So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?" Trump replied, "At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have … Cooper: "Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?" Trump: "Saudi Arabia, absolutely." Cooper: "You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?" Trump: "No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us. Here’s the thing with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves." Cooper: "So if you said, ‘Japan, yes, it's fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well,’ and Saudi Arabia says ‘We want them, too?’" Trump: "Can I be honest with you? It's going to happen, anyway. It's going to happen anyway. It's only a question of time." April 3 Chris Wallace, host of "Fox News Sunday," asked Trump, "You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula?" Trump: "In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes." Wallace: "Understood." Trump: "It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would, in fact, be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." Wallace: "With nukes?" Trump: "Maybe they would be better off - including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." Wallace: "In South Korea, with nukes?" Trump: "South Korea is right next door, just so you understand." Wallace: "But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula." Trump: "You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race." May 4 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, "You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?" Trump replied, "I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world." A final note: During the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence said Trump "never said" more nations should get nuclear weapons. PolitiFact National rated the denial Mostly False. Warner - in suggesting Trump sanctions proliferation - made a broader statement than Pence. Our ruling Warner said Trump has said "nuclear proliferation is OK." Trump hasn’t quite gone that far. He’s voiced his "hate" for nukes and said, "I don’t want more nuclear weapons." But Trump also repeatedly has said that the nuclear race is "going to happen anyway," and that Japan and South Korea - both facing threats from North Korea - might be "better off" with nukes of their own. In discussing the issue, Trump has said the U.S. "cannot afford to be the military and the police for the world," and that allies don’t pay enough for U.S. protection. So Trump certainly has said he’s open to proliferation by certain allies but isn’t sold on it.

pomt-15104	Says Donald Trump supports the Wall Street bailout.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/15/club-growth/did-donald-trump-support-wall-street-bailout-club-/	The Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, portrays Donald Trump as a liberal in a new TV ad. "Which presidential candidate supports higher taxes, national health care and the Wall Street bailout?" asks the narrator in the Sept. 15 ad in Iowa as it shows photos of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. "It's Donald Trump." The ad then shows a clip of Trump saying in 2004: "In many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat." We have already fact-checked Trump’s statements on taxes (he’s supported increases), health care (he’s had different views over the years) and an attack about his party affiliation (he was once a Democrat). Here, we will fact-check if he supported the Wall Street bailout. Trump on the bailout In October 2008, Congress created a $700 billion emergency bailout fund called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. President George W. Bush pressed for passage, and it also drew the support of GOP presidential nominee John McCain and the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama. The Club for Growth cited three statements by Trump in support of the bailout. However, the ad omits that he expressed some skepticism about whether it would work. On Sept. 30, 2008, CNN’s Kiran Chetry asked Trump about the bailout days before its final passage. The ad includes this segment of that interview: Chetry: "Do you think that this bailout plan needs to pass in some way, shape or form for things to stabilize?" Trump replied: "Well, I think it would be better if it passed." But the ad omits the rest of Trump’s statement in which he expressed some doubt about the bailout: "I'm not sure that it's going to work. You know, it is trial and error. This is very complicated. This is more complicated than sending rockets to the moon. "Nobody really knows what impact it's going to have. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. But certainly it is worth a shot. I don't love the idea that the government's buying back all the bad loans. How about some of the good loans? You know? I don't like the idea that the government, frankly, is going to be negotiating with people to sell those loans, because maybe we'd be better off having the best bankers in the world do that. "But I think overall, it's a probable positive, other than you have to control the price of oil. Because if you don't, whatever happens with the bailout, if you want to call it the bailout, whatever happens with the bailout, is will have no impact, no positive impact." On Larry King Live on April 15, 2009, King asked Trump his opinion of Obama and Trump turned to the bailout in part of his answer: "I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going," Trump said. On Feb. 18, 2009, Trump talked about the bank bailout on David Letterman: "The one thing is, the government came in and intelligently put money into the banks, so that if you have your money in CDs or whatever in the banks, you’re not going to lose your money at least." In response to the ad, Trump tweeted: "Little respected Club for Growth asked me for $1,000,000 -- I said ‘NO’. Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!" Trump’s charge relates to a June 2 letter from Club for Growth president David McIntosh to Trump asking him to contribute $1 million to the group. Trump then issued a press release saying that the group was trying to shake him down. Club for Growth spokesman Doug Sachtleben told PolitiFact that Trump had asked for the meeting and was interested in donating to the group. Our ruling A Club for Growth TV ad states that Trump supports the Wall Street bailout. Trump made multiple statements in support of TARP, the bailout of the banks, in late 2008 and 2009. However, the ad omits that he raised concern that the banks had received billions and were not loaning them out. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09950	"Walking in the door (Sonia Sotomayor) would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/26/barack-obama/sotomayors-experience-does-not-significantly-outst/	President Barack Obama introduced his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court with much praise. "It's a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat, Bill Clinton," Obama said. "Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed." Listening to that quote, you might think Sotomayor was way ahead of the other justices when they were nominated. But after our review of the current justices, we find that Sotomayor has roughly the same experience they had. Nevertheless, Obama's statement is technically accurate. Here's why: It appears Obama is only counting legal experience obtained on the federal district courts or courts of appeal. It may surprise you to know that a judge need not sit on the district court level before being named to the higher appellate court. Compared with the sitting Supreme Court justices, Sotomayor is the only one to have experience on both the district court level and the appellate level. Hence Obama's claim that she has "more varied" experience. But drill down into the numbers, and Sotomayor has more total federal court experience only by a single year, and two justices have more appellate experience than she does. Sotomayor served six years on the district court level and 11 years on the appellate level for a grand total of 17 years. Contrast this with Samuel Alito, who sat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 16 years, or Stephen Breyer, who sat on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals for 14 years, with four of those as the chief judge. If you consider Sotomayor more experienced than these justices, it's only by a margin of a year or two. And constitutional lawyers (or the judges' moms) might argue that Alito and Breyer's additional appellate experience is more relevant than experience at the district court level. If we take a broader view of experience than only federal court service, Sotomayor is about the same as most of her would-be fellow justices. (We have compiled a detailed chart on the professional experience of Sotomayor and the Supreme Court justices and have included it at the end of this article.) This year, Sotomayor will have graduated from law school 30 years ago, with a full legal career under her belt. This is very close to the average number of years of experience we calculated for other justices at the time they were nominated. We calculated the average working experience of the current justices — omitting David Souter, whom Sotomayor may replace — and found that the average professional career prior to Supreme Court appointment was 28.7 years. By our count, four justices have slightly more years than Sotomayor in their legal careers: John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Chief Justice John Roberts and Alito. To be clear, people could argue a lot over what kind of legal experience is more relevant or important to serving on the Supreme Court. Our analysis is based on years of service, and doesn't reflect the quality of the work of any of the justices. Listening to what Obama said, though — "Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed" — you might conclude that Sotomayor is more qualified than previous nominees to be a Supreme Court Justice. In fact, her legal career and years of experience are in line with the other justices. Obama's statement is technically accurate, but also implies she's more qualified. We don't find that to be the case. We rate Obama's statement Half True. Editor's note: For brevity, we've omitted some details of their experience, such as additional educational credentials or service on some boards and commissions.

pomt-06676	Since Rick Perry became governor, "Texas has gone from 46th in the country to 50th in the population that graduates from high school."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-texas-graduation-rate-fell-50th-unde/	In their attacks on Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the new front-runner for the Republican nomination for president, Democrats are taking aim at his record on education. Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, criticized Perry's record on high school graduation rates. "Since Perry became governor, Texas has gone from 46th in the country to 50th in the population that graduates from high school," Buckley charged in an August 17, 2011 interview with The Telegraph of Nashua. Buckley is not the first Democrat to take swings at Texas’ education system. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan last month said that there were "massive" increases in class size under Perry. PolitiFact Texas rated that False. But as for Buckley's claim: Does Texas rank 50th in high school graduates? And, if so, is Perry really to blame? We hit the books. The state numbers were easy enough to track down. N.H. Democratic officials first led us to the CQ State Rankings series, published by CQ Press. But the rankings, based on U.S. Census data, were only available back to 2005. So, we decided to go straight to the source. The census figures show Buckley’s numbers to be slightly off but in the ballpark. In 2000, when Perry first took office, 75.7 percent of state residents 25 or older had graduated high school, according to the Census bureau. That figure placed Texas 45th among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia were lower.) By 2009, nearly a decade later, the percentage of Texas residents with a high school diploma had increased to 79.6. But other states increased at a greater rate, leaving the Lone Star State ranking dead last. The Census Bureau includes Washington, D.C. in its data, so Texas actually ranked 51st, though Buckley claimed it ranked 50th. Either way, Buckley is largely correct about the numbers. But it's worth noting that the percentage increased under Perry, although the state still lost ground in the rankings because other states increased even faster. As for the reason behind Texas’ low ranking, analysts cite a number of different factors, but few of them relate back to Perry. Demographers and immigration experts say the state’s diversity weighs heavily on its ranking in regard to educational attainment. With nearly 4 million immigrants, Texas boasts the country’s fourth-largest foreign-born population. And, of those immigrants over the age of 25, 46.8 percent did not have a high school diploma in 2009, according to census figures, compared to 32.3 percent for the nation. Most immigrants, both legal and illegal, didn’t drop out from Texas schools but instead arrived in the state as adults without high school diplomas, according to Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization in Washington, D.C. "Texas has one of the less-educated immigrant populations," Camarota said. "Texas and a whole series of states in the Southwest have lower educational attainment rates than they would in the absence of the immigrant population." Of the state’s native population, 12.9 percent did not graduate high school, according to census data provided by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based agency that studies the movement of people, compared with 9.6 percent for the nation. Texas’ diploma troubles aren’t simply an issue of immigration, however. The state’s deep ethnic diversity, even among Texas natives, also weighs heavily, other demographers told us. Nearly 40 percent of Texas residents -- about 9.5 million of the state’s 25 million people -- are Hispanic, and another 11.5 percent is African American. Of those, 26.4 percent of Hispanic residents live in poverty along with 23.1 percent of African Americans, according to census data provided by Steven Murdock, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau under President George W. Bush. Poverty is typically a strong indicator of educational attainment, Murdock said. And that is reflected in the state’s high school dropout numbers. Figures provided by the Texas Education Agency show that 11.8 percent of African American students scheduled to graduate high school in 2010 dropped out, along with 9.1 percent of Hispanic students 3.5 percent of Caucasian students. "Minority populations tend to have lower levels of education," said Murdock, who works now as director of the Hobby Center of the Study of Texas at Rice University in Houston. "That’s not Texas specific. That’s a nation-wide problem. But, it is a big issue in Texas, which has a substantially more diverse population (than much of the rest of the country)," he said. These demographics suggest that Texas’ education troubles arise from causes other than the governor’s office. But education analysts say Perry had some responsibility for the low graduation rate. Perry’s website credits him with increasing education funding by nearly $7 billion in the last six years. But this year alone, the governor and state lawmakers passed a budget that cut as much as $4 billion from state education funding. This cut is only the latest in a series of reductions from Perry’s office, which has had an impact on students throughout his tenure, according to Julian Vasquez Heilig, an assistant professor of education policy at the University of Texas-Austin. Since 2000, when Perry took office, Texas has fallen from 35th in per-pupil spending to 43rd in 2009. The state has actually increased the average per student costs during that time, moving from $6,560 per student to $8,540, according to census data provided by Vasquez Heilig. But, other states have increased their spending more dramatically, resulting in the rankings drop. "Texas wants education on the cheap, and that’s what it’s got," said Vasquez Heilig, who also serves as associate director of the national University Council for Educational Administration, a national coalition of universities seeking to better prepare school leaders. Other education analysts said Perry has some responsibility for the record of Texas schools but the state’s education troubles pre-date his time as governor. Texas has a decades-long history of uneven and inadequate education funding that has left many poor and minority students struggling, according to Linda McSpadden McNeil, director of the Center for Education at Rice University. "Certainly poverty is one part of it," McNeil said, but the problems are also caused by inadequate funding and language difficulties. "We have a system now that actually stacks the deck against the poorest kids and the (teachers) who are devoted to teaching them." Our ruling The Democrats say Texas's ranking for high school graduates fell four spots under Perry. They are largely right about the drop, though their numbers are slightly off. The Democrats also exaggerate by blaming Perry. Although experts say he shares some responsibility, it is largely a factor of the state's demographics and history of education funding .

pomt-05473	Says Dwight Holton has never set foot in an Oregon courtroom.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/20/ellen-rosenblum/has-dwight-holton-never-set-foot-oregon-courtroom/	There are two narratives in the race between two Democrats for Oregon attorney general. Dwight Holton paints himself as an exciting advocate and opponent Ellen Rosenblum as a boring government lawyer. Rosenblum describes herself as the home-grown -- double Duck! -- candidate and Holton as not from around here. "When you’ve joined the Oregon State Bar in 2009 and you've never set foot in an Oregon courtroom, I'm not sure that qualifies you to be Attorney General," Rosenblum said of Holton in a news story published in The Oregonian. The average person is likely to think that Rosenblum means Holton has never been in a courtroom physically located in the state of Oregon. That, on its face, is a ludicrous claim. Holton started work in the U.S. attorney’s office in Portland in 2004 before resigning in January to run for attorney general. However, we understand Rosenblum is making the case that the attorney general is a state position, and Holton has spent his career in Oregon working in federal court. Rosenblum’s spokeswoman, Cynara Lilly, said as much in defense of the statement. "Federal Court is referred to as 'U.S. Court,' state courts as 'Oregon Court.' It has nothing to do with the physical state the court is in, it is the type of court. So yes, our campaign stands by the statement that Dwight has never set foot in an Oregon State Courtroom," Lilly writes. "If you search the Oregon Courts online under his name and/or his bar number you will find no record of him trying any cases in Oregon Court." Jillian Schoene, a spokeswoman for Holton, confirms the candidate has not tried a case in a state courtroom. But she raises a number of points we think add important context to the claim. Holton has lived in Oregon since 2002, when he moved here with his wife. During his time in the U.S. attorney’s office, he worked with local law enforcement to address prescription painkiller abuse and to keep illegal guns away from domestic abusers. He reached out to Muslims living in Oregon. It’s not as if Holton was sitting in his nice federal office keeping away from public safety issues important to this state. As interim U.S. attorney, he supervised the lawyers who represented the federal government in state courts in Oregon. And we’re not inclined to repeat endorsement sound bites, but it means something that most of the state’s 36 district attorneys -- all in the state system, last time we checked -- have endorsed him. Certainly Rosenblum has deeper experience with state courts. She was a state judge for 22 years. We gave Holton a Half True for saying that Rosenblum said 80 percent of the attorney general’s job is being the state’s lawyer. She said it -- and even denied saying it -- but she said other things about the job, as well. Here we find that her attempt to paint Holton as an Oregon outsider, just because he personally hasn’t argued in state court, is misleading. The statement contains a bit of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rule Rosenblum’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11679	The new tax law is "kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/03/donald-trump/white-house-misleading-citing-only-cuts-not-hikes-/	In its "1600 Daily" email to supporters and members of the public, the White House touted the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed in late December as a highlight of 2017. The email said that the new law would be "kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, 1.7 million new jobs, and more than 60 record highs for the Dow Jones index." Here’s a screenshot: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That $5.5 trillion figure caught the eye of a reader, who wrote PolitiFact to note that the figure most frequently applied to the bill in news accounts is $1.5 trillion. So what’s going on? When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger. The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.) However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion. So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure "is misleading if it’s the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion." He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bill’s provisions. On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill "provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts" but that it will also "raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts." Our ruling Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes "$5.5 trillion in tax cuts." Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00976	"Obama has chosen to deny the vicious anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/12/rick-perry/obama-calls-kosher-deli-attack-random-rick-perry-s/	President Barack Obama took heat this week for seeming to imply that a recent attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris was "random" -- rather than anti-Semitic. Obama made his ire-arousing comment in a Feb. 9 interview with Vox’s Matthew Yglesias. Yglesias asked if Obama thought the media tended to overstate the threat of Islamic terrorism, compared with issues like climate change. As part of his response, Obama said this: "It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you've got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris. We devote enormous resources to that, and it is right and appropriate for us to be vigilant and aggressive in trying to deal with that — the same way a big city mayor's got to cut the crime rate down if he wants that city to thrive. But we also have to attend to a lot of other issues, and we've got to make sure we're right-sizing our approach so that what we do isn't counterproductive." That was his only mention of the Paris attack in the interview, but it caught the eye of his critics. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential 2016 Republican contender, said the comments meant Obama was denying that the attacks were anti-Semitic. "I am appalled that President Obama has chosen to deny the vicious anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris on Jan. 9," Perry said in a statement. "What he called a ‘random’ attack was obviously meant to kill Jews -- which is precisely what happened. The individual victims may have been those unlucky enough to be in the grocery that day, but it was far from random." But has Obama really denied that this attack was anti-Semitic? When we looked at the other things he’s said about the attacks, we found that’s not the case. The attacks and their aftermath On Jan. 7, two brothers carried out a terrorist attack on the Paris offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper, killing 12. A branch of al-Qaida in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack. Two days later, 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly -- who had declared allegiance to the Islamic State -- held several patrons hostage in HyperCacher, a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris. Coulibaly said he would kill his hostages unless police released the the Charlie Hebdo attackers. French special forces moved in, killed Coulibaly and found that he had killed four hostages. Coulibaly said he coordinated with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, according to Reuters, and he specifically targeted Jews. All four victims were Jewish and were buried in Israel. Despite describing the attack as "random" in the Vox interview, Obama has made other statements that show that he is aware Coulibaly targeted Jews. In a Jan. 22 statement to the United Nations General Assembly, regarding anti-Semitism, Obama said, "Anti-Semitic attacks like the recent terrorist attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris pose a threat that extends beyond the Jewish community." And on Jan. 27 -- International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- Obama said, "The recent terrorist attacks in Paris serve as a painful reminder of our obligation to condemn and combat rising anti-Semitism in all its forms." The day after the Vox interview appeared, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama meant that Coulibaly did not target specific individuals by name, so that the victims were people who just happened to be in the store that day. In that sense, the attack was random. "The point that the president was trying to make is that these individuals were not specifically targeted. These were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli and were shot while they were there," Earnest said. Earnest also noted that not everyone in the deli was Jewish. This is true. At the very least, a Muslim man helped some shoppers hide in a storage freezer to protect them from Coulibaly. According to the BBC, it’s not certain why Coulibaly killed these four particular individuals, when there were others in the market. Two of the victims allegedly tried to take a gun that belonged to Coulibaly, but it was empty. Coulibaly killed another victim when the man tried to enter the store soon after the hostage situation began. So we know Coulibaly chose the HyperCacher store in order to target Jews. And we know he didn’t go into the store with particular victims in mind. But we can’t be certain that Coulibaly "randomly" chose who to kill once he was inside the store -- which makes Obama’s comments a poor choice of words. Our ruling Perry said, "Obama has chosen to deny the vicious anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris." In one interview, Obama described the attackers as "randomly" shooting people, but he seems to have been answering a question about how the public perceives acts of violence by terrorists. On several prior occasions, Obama called the attack on the grocery an act of anti-Semitism. Obama’s press team said Obama only meant that the killer did not target particular individuals as long as they were Jewish. In the Vox interview, Obama may have used a poor choice of words to describe the way that people going about their normal, everyday business sometimes end up in terrorists’ line of fire. But Perry goes too far when he says Obama "has chosen to deny" anti-Semitic motivation. Obama has specifically cited such a motivation in several other instances. Because Perry’s claim is not accurate, we rate his statement False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2015-02-12T17:31:35	2015-02-11	['Paris', 'Jews', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-11702	In April, "the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/21/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-wrong-april-vast-majority-will-be-fil/	During an interview on Fox & Friends in which she touted the recently passed tax bill, Ivanka Trump said voters would benefit more quickly than they might have imagined. "I'm really looking forward to doing a lot of traveling in April when people realize the effect that this has, both on the process of filling out their taxes -- the vast majority will be doing so on a single postcard -- but also having experienced the relief that will be starting as early as February," she said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is it really true that in April, "the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard"? No. There are two problems with what Trump said. We’ll take them in order. The bill’s provisions won’t be taking effect in time for the April 2018 filing season There isn’t anything in the tax bill that would take effect soon enough to change taxpayers’ filing choices in any significant way by April 2018. The bill’s provisions only address tax year 2018 and beyond. So in April, taxpayers will be filing their paperwork for tax year 2017 to the IRS -- that is, under existing tax law, not the new law. "Most people will still be filing something that looks familiar to them from past years," said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. There is no ‘postcard’ filing plan for individual taxpayers There isn’t a postcard filing option today, and there’s nothing in the bill that would create one. The idea didn’t come from nowhere. In November, House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House. "It's going to make life very simple," he said on Nov. 2, 2017. The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled." But in the end, the bill didn't do much to make this idea a reality. The possibility of creating a postcard option "is most likely one of many things the IRS will have to figure out and issue new regulations on," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But that’s not happening immediately, he said. Newton said that there is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns -- the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com "While it’s not postcard-sized, it’s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does," Newton said. The 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That’s about one of every six filers. Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase due to the tax bill’s passage (albeit in 2019)? Rosenberg said the number might increase on the margins due to the raising of the standard deduction, which would save some taxpayers from itemizing -- something they would have to do on the full 1040 form. Still, he added, "there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation" to shift to the 1040EZ. Trump’s walk-back When we contacted the White House, they referred us to a tweet sent by Ivanka Trump a few hours after her Fox & Friends interview.. Trump replied to a tweet by Miranda Yaver, a self-described Democratic political scientist, that said, "Actually, @IvankaTrump, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump replied, "Correct! All across America people will be thinking about how cumbersome the old tax code is & energized about upcoming simplification!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com That may happen, but it doesn’t make her original remark correct. Our ruling Ivanka Trump tweeted that in April, "the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard." That’s not the case. The recently passed bill takes effect for the 2018 tax year, which people will be filing returns on in April 2019 -- not this coming April. And there is no plan for a postcard filing option. Simple filing options already exist and are widely used, but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019. We rate her statement False.

pomt-14520	"Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/18/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-barack-obama-will-add-more-debt-all-/	Compared to immigration and terrorism, the growth of the federal debt may not be quite as big a subject for Republicans running for president this year. But it never went away entirely. In a Feb. 5, 2016, Medium post about his approach to Social Security, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush reiterated a talking point that many Republicans have used before. "Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together," Bush wrote. It’s been awhile since we last checked a claim of this sort, so we decided to take a closer look. Bush phrased his claim carefully, and it largely holds up by the numbers. It’s also important to note, though, that Obama isn’t the only one responsible for the growth of the federal debt. Running the numbers We first turned to the U.S. Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator, which allows you to track the federal debt on a daily basis. The website lists two kinds of debt -- publicly held debt and gross federal debt. The difference is that federal debt is calculated by taking the amount of publicly held debt and adding to it the debt that is held by the government. These are typically IOUs between one governmental entity and another, such as the money owed by the general treasury to the Social Security trust fund. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was inaugurated, the public debt stood at about $6.31 trillion. By the day Bush’s column ran, it stood at about $13.67 trillion. That’s an increase of $7.36 trillion, which is short of the $8 trillion Bush mentioned. But remember that Bush said Obama will add that much on his watch, which can be reasonably interpreted to mean the amount by the end of Obama’s second term. If the debt continues to rise at the same pace it has increased over the past seven-plus years, it will end up at nearly $8.4 trillion when Obama leaves office. Using this measurement, then, Bush is right that Obama will see the debt increase by north of $8 trillion on his watch, and that this amount will exceed the amount accumulated by the previous 43 presidents ($6.31 trillion). Bush isn’t correct, however, using gross federal debt. Using the same method of estimating, Obama should see an increase of $9.51 trillion in gross federal debt by the end of his second term. That’s less than the $10.63 trillion he inherited from his 43 predecessors. Experts say that either publicly held debt or gross federal debt could be used to define the term "national debt" that Bush uses. Still, economists told us that publicly held debt is often the most popular measurement among specialists, so we won’t quibble with Bush’s decision to focus on publicly held debt. The size of debt production under Obama is reinforced by looking at debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. At the end of fiscal year 2008, publicly held debt accounted for 39 percent of gross domestic product. By the end of fiscal year 2016, it’s expected to be almost 77 percent. Even if bad timing has exaggerated this increase -- fiscal 2008 ended four months before Obama took office, right as the economy was collapsing -- it’s certainly a big percentage jump over eight years. All this said, we’ll note a few things that are important to keep in mind. • How much blame does Obama deserve? Bush makes it sound as if Obama simply flipped a switch and debt started pouring out. Obviously, it’s a lot more complicated than that. "It isn’t as if we were projecting balanced budgets and Barack Obama came into office and signed legislation increasing spending and cutting taxes," said Marc Goldwein, a budget analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In fact, Goldwein said, the January 2009 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the debt would be around $9 trillion today. So Obama could -- at most -- be assigned the blame for adding an additional $4.5 trillion to the debt, and that’s only if you absolve Congress (which has been controlled by Republicans for most of his tenure) of any responsibility, and if you blame Obama for all of the long-lasting effects of the recession that he inherited. Also, a lot of the debt comes from entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, which are increasing largely on autopilot due to demographic trends that are out of any president’s control. So while Obama does bear some responsibility for the debt accumulation on his watch, he certainly doesn’t deserve sole responsibility. Bush’s own party played a role, too, as did the inevitable grind of demographic trends. • Any president today would be in much the same situation. Another type of inevitable grind -- inflation -- is worth factoring in as well. Every year, inflation puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Inflation "erodes the numbers and makes them a bit meaningless," Goldwein said. For a comparison, let’s take a look at Obama’s predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush -- a Republican, and Jeb Bush’s brother. The Debt to the Penny calculator doesn’t offer daily tallies for publicly held debt around the time of Bush’s inauguration, but it does offer daily data for gross federal debt, so we’ll use that. When Bush came into office on Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt stood at $5.73 trillion. At the end of Bush’s term eight years later, the debt had risen to $10.63 trillion -- an increase on Bush’s watch of $4.9 trillion. That’s not quite equal to what his 42 presidential predecessors accumulated, but it’s 86 percent of the way there. That increase under Bush is a little smaller than the expected increase during Obama’s full tenure -- 89 percent -- but it’s not off by much. Our ruling Bush said that Obama "will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together." On the numbers, Bush is right, as long as you measure the nation’s publicly held debt, the most commonly cited statistic, and as long as you project forward to the end of Obama’s tenure. But Bush leaves out some important context when he focuses the blame solely on Obama, and when he ignores that the percentage increase in the debt under George W. Bush was similar. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-02-18T10:54:07	2016-02-05	['None']
pomt-14131	"California has added twice as many jobs as Florida" over the past year.	half-true	/california/statements/2016/may/06/jerry-brown/jerry-browns-mostly-true-claim-about-california-do/	Stoking a cross-country feud between the Sunshine and Golden states, Florida Gov. Rick Scott traveled to California for the second time in as many years to urge businesses to move to his state. In his visit this week, Scott said the sun shines more on businesses in Florida, with its lower taxes and less-stringent regulation. The Florida governor also warned California firms of the harm he said would result from the Golden State’s future minimum wage hike to $15 per hour. PolitiFact recently examined a claim by Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm, which said California would lose 700,000 jobs due to the wage hike. The national website rated the misleading claim Mostly False. FROM TWITTER On my way to tell CA businesses why FL has the best business climate. #FLvsCA — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) May 1, 2016 California Gov. Jerry Brown, perhaps tired of the job-poaching efforts of governors in Texas and Florida, shot back at Gov. Scott with claims that the Golden State’s job picture is, well, very sunny. "As one of the millions of tourists flocking to the Golden State this time of year, we’d like to extend a warm welcome to (Florida Gov. Rick Scott). We can understand why he’s coming back -- there’s lots to do and plenty to learn," Brown said in a statement on April 26. His office issue a similar press release a few days later. "In fact, since his last 2,000 mile cross-country jaunt, California has added twice as many jobs as Florida, while paying down debt, building a robust rainy day fund and taking bold action on issues Governor Scott continues to ignore, like climate change and poverty," Brown said in the statement. FROM TWITTER .@JerryBrownGov to @FLGovScott: Time to stop the silly political stunts & start doing something about #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/nuWwhEBu9I — Gov. Brown Press Ofc (@GovPressOffice) May 2, 2016 There’s a lot to unpack there. So we focused just on Brown’s statement about California adding twice as many jobs as Florida, and whether there was any context missing. It turns out California’s job picture is not really brighter than Florida’s, at least not during the period Brown described. Florida Gov. Rick Scott speaks in 2015 / AP photo Our research We looked at data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the two states, from May 2015 to March 2016. Scott’s first visit was in April 2015. Last month’s data was not yet available. During this span, California added 354,100 jobs while Florida added 190,500 jobs. That’s 1.86 times as many jobs as the Sunshine State -- not quite twice as many but pretty close. Brown’s office also pointed to a slightly different time period, January through December 2015, when California added 1.97 times as many jobs as Florida. Of course, California is a much larger state with 39.1 million people -- almost double Florida’s population of 20.3 million. One would expect California to add more jobs than Florida, to keep up with the millions more people who live here. For some context, we checked the states’ job growth rates during this period. Florida had a slightly faster job growth rate at nearly 2.4 percent compared with California’s 2.2 percent. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said California has added twice as many jobs as Florida since that state’s governor visited in April 2015 on a job recruiting tour. Brown's claim is close on the raw numbers. But it leaves out the important context that California is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed. The federal jobs data show California added 1.86 times as many jobs as Florida during this period, a bit less than twice as many. California often leads the nation in overall job gains due to its sheer size. But the pace of that job growth tells a different story.

pomt-01066	"Factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/obama-more-factories-opening-today-two-decades-ago/	President Barack Obama celebrated some signals that American manufacturing is strengthening while on a recent multi-state tour. "We invested in clean energy, saved the auto industry, and today, factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades," he said in Clinton, Tenn. Jan. 9. Manufacturing was already facing challenges in terms of jobs, output and factory closings when the recession hit in the late 2000s. So we wondered about their recovery and Obama’s claim that factories are opening up faster than they have in years. The White House told us that they were counting since 1997, about 17 years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts the number of factories in its "Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages." We used the agency’s online database to look at the change in the number of factories (manufacturing establishments) since then. At the peak -- early on, in 1998, there were 412,453 private manufacturing establishments. That dropped steadily each year, to a low point of 333,565 in 2013. That’s a 19 percent drop and a loss of nearly 80,000 establishments. But in the second quarter of 2014 -- the latest data available -- it’s up to 338,304. That’s growth of 1.5 percent from the trough, but far below the peak back in 1998. Any growth would constitute factories "opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades" because -- except for a couple of short-lived blips -- this is the first time the number of factories has grown at all since the 1990s. Here’s a graph showing the overall trend, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics data: "Bottom line, the president's statement is accurate, but positive growth in 2014 would make it the first calendar year to add facilities since the president took office," said Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for nonprofit advocacy group Alliance for American Manufacturing. A January 2015 paper out of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation looks at recent trends in manufacturing, including the number of establishments -- using the same Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While the authors noted the modest growth, they said this particular data set has limited usefulness in terms of identifying future trends. The count can include factories that have had a change in their production situation -- like relocating or re-opening after a period of closure -- instead of just capturing the number of brand-new factories. A revival? The foundation’s report says American manufacturing peaked in the late 1970s. Losses in the industry through the 1990s led to more dramatic losses in the 2000s, coinciding with the rise of globalization and China’s economic prowess. And the recession accelerated the process. But Obama and others see the growing number of factories and other positive economic figures about the manufacturing industry as a flicker of hope for a manufacturing revival. In his recent speeches, Obama has also said, "Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy." Over the four quarters of most recently available data -- from mid 2013 to mid 2014 -- the United States’ overall GDP grew 2.7 percent. Manufacturing grew faster, at 4.6 percent. Some economists, however, are skeptical that the uptick signifies a larger trend. The report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation says these positive indicators might just be cyclical. International investment bank Goldman Sachs came to a similar conclusion. "Conditions for U.S. manufacturing are certainly better than they were a decade ago, as employment and output are both growing, albeit slowly," the report says. "Despite this improvement, there is not yet evidence to support the notion of a U.S. manufacturing renaissance." Our ruling Obama said, "Factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades." The latest figures line up with Obama’s claim. The number of factories steadily decreased from 1998 to 2013. In the first two quarters of 2014, things started to pick up, though they are still nowhere near the 1998 peak. We should note that economists are far from certain that this is a significant trend, or if it will continue. This is just one figure of many that could clue us into whether or not manufacturing is making a resurgence, but it’s not enough by itself to make any broad claims about a recovery.

pomt-00493	"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos owes Ohio $5.3 million for campaign finance violations and Mike DeWine's office refuses to collect the fine."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/07/richard-cordray/unpaid-fine-betsy-devos-pac-subject-misleading-att/	Democrat Richard Cordray says that his Republican opponent in the Ohio governor’s race, Attorney General Mike DeWine, has been remiss at collecting a fine from a member of President Donald Trump’s administration. "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos owes Ohio $5.3 million for campaign finance violations and Mike DeWine's office refuses to collect the fine," Cordray said in a July Facebook ad. That record breaking fine by the Ohio Elections Commission did happen, but Cordray isn’t telling the full story about the challenges in collecting it. The DeVos-affiliated political action committees were fined by the state of Ohio in 2008, and the fine was upheld in court. But Cordray omits that DeWine has made an effort by filing a lawsuit and winning a judgment. The fines were a subject of litigation for years, including when Cordray was attorney general before DeWine ousted him in the 2010 election. Fine for DeVos PAC In 2003, DeVos and her husband, billionaire Amway heir Richard DeVos, formed All Children Matter to help candidates who support school vouchers, including in Virginia and Ohio. In 2008, the bipartisan Ohio Elections Commission found that the Virginia PAC sent $870,000 to the Ohio PAC, ignoring a warning in an advisory opinion that such a transfer would be illegal under Ohio’s campaign finance laws. The commission voted unanimously to fine the Virginia and Ohio PACs $2.6 million each. The PACs challenged the commission’s ruling in court, but the court dismissed the case because the PACs failed to sue the proper entity. The litigation continued, though. In February 2010 while Cordray was attorney general, the Ohio Courts of Appeal upheld the lower court ruling, and the Ohio Supreme Court refused to take it up a few months later. We asked Cordray’s campaign spokesman why he didn’t collect the fine when he was attorney general. "It was being litigated for almost the entirety of his tenure as attorney general," Mike Gwin said. In November 2010, DeWine beat Cordray to take over as attorney general. In 2013, DeWine ultimately got a court judgment to enforce the fine. But by then, the PACs had wound down and had minimal assets, leaving nothing to collect. When Trump nominated DeVos as his education secretary, a group of Democratic senators including Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, said she should pay the fine. In a letter to senators, DeVos disputed that she was personally liable. "I was an unpaid volunteer director for ACM Inc. and I did not have day-to-day management responsibilities," she wrote. "I was never a party to the legal proceedings." (She was, however, listed as a director on tax filings.) She also wrote that All Children Matter no longer existed and didn’t have the funds to pay the fines. Greg McNeilly, a political adviser to DeVos, made many of the same arguments to PolitiFact in an email. Our ruling Cordray said, "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos owes Ohio $5.3 million for campaign finance violations, and Mike DeWine's office refuses to collect the fine." The All Children Matter PACs were fined in 2008, and that was upheld by the courts. The PACs ultimately closed, and they never paid the fines. But Cordray makes it sound like DeWine ignored the whole matter, and that’s not the case. He got a court judgment that upheld the fines against the PACs. But by then, there was nothing for DeWine to go after. The fines were ultimately the responsibility of the PACs, not DeVos personally. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-07242	"Obesity kills 34 children per hour."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/may/31/rob-eissler/state-rep-rob-eissler-says-34-children-die-obesity/	Honoring Dallas physician Kenneth Cooper, who has spent much of his career promoting aerobics, state Rep. Rob Eissler warned against the dangers of obesity. It "kills 34 children per hour," The Woodlands Republican said on the House floor May 23. Obesity — an accumulation of body fat above the range generally considered healthy for one’s height — increases the likelihood of certain disease and health problems, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, the agency says, obesity can foster high blood pressure and heightened cholesterol, breathing and joint difficulties and fatty liver disease. But does it kill a kid every couple seconds? Eissler told us he based the claim on a documentary about obesity that premiered at Austin’s Long Center the previous evening: "Health Needs a Hero." Both Cooper and Eissler appear in the film, which focuses on childhood obesity. "People die as a result of disease resulting from obesity," Eissler told us. Jen Ohlson, the founder of PE3, an Austin-based nonprofit that works to curb obesity in schools, wrote, directed and produced the film. She sent us the statement from the documentary that Eissler was referring to: "Our national cemeteries pay visual homage to American heroes on the battlefields of war. But there’s another battle on the home front: obesity-related diseases. They kill one person every 90 seconds, 34 people every hour, 822 people every single day and 330,000 people" annually. Ohlson cited a Wikipedia page and a WikiAnswers page as her source for the declared rates of death-by-obesity. The Wikipedia page links to a 1999 study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study, based in part on 1991 national statistics on body mass index distributions, population size and deaths, concluded that 280,000 to 325,000 U.S. adults annually die due to obesity. We noticed a similar statistic posted online by the CDC. Based on mortality data from the 1970s, the agency said that 365,000 U.S. deaths a year could be attributed to obesity. That’s about 41 deaths an hour. However, CDC spokeswoman Karen Hunter told us the agency lately estimates that obesity accounts for less than one-third that number: 112,000 deaths a year, or about 13 deaths an hour. According to an undated CDC sheet of frequently asked questions about calculating obesity-related risk, the estimate has dropped in recent years because CDC scientists started using newer data and different methods of analysis. The 2005 study used different statistical methods to estimate the proportion of deaths related to obesity, taking the decline in obesity-related deaths among older adults into account, according to the sheet. The sheet says the latest estimate, made public in 2005, is based on mortality data through 2000 from a "nationally representative sample of U.S. adults," and "appear to reflect a real decline in the risks of dying from obesity-related diseases like heart disease." According to the sheet, the decline may be related to "big improvements in the control of risk factors for heart disease" and advances in "life-saving interventions for obesity-related diseases," such as catheterization. Note: All these estimated death rates, from the outdated to the most recent, are for adults, not children. Hunter said the CDC does not know how many U.S. children annually die from obesity. The chronic obesity-related diseases that kill most Americans, including heart disease and diabetes, "typically take decades to develop." That is, they show up mostly in adults. For more expertise, we reached Stephen Pont, medical director of the Texas Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Obesity, affiliated with the Dell Children’s Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin. He told us that while he was unaware of any data showing that 34 children die every hour from obesity, the spirit of the claim reflected the magnitude of the problem. Childhood obesity likely contributes to the number of adults who are estimated to die every hour as as a result of obesity-related diseases, he said. Even so, the mortality numbers are hard to pin down. Hunter told us that "obesity, while often a contributing factor, is not typically listed as the ‘cause of death’ on a death certificate." It’s difficult for doctors to cite that cause on death certificates, according to the CDC’s sheet of frequently asked questions, "because obesity has so many different effects on so many diseases." Obesity isn’t among the leading causes of death for 1-14 year olds, according to 2006 child mortality data on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. What does kill kids most frequently: Unintentional injuries, cancer, congenital abnormalities and homicide. "Diseases of the heart" is the fifth greatest cause of death in among 1 to 4 year olds (1 death per 100,000 children) and 5 to 14 year olds (0.6 deaths per 100,000). That doesn’t mean obesity isn’t a growing health problem for kids. Since 1980, according to the CDC, instances of obesity among children and adolescents in the United States has almost tripled. According to the 2007-08 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 17.5 percent of children who are 2-19 years old — 12.5 million — are obese. According to the Texas Health Institute, an Austin-based nonprofit that works to improve the health in Texas communities, 35 percent of Texas children and more than half of Texas adults are overweight or obese, the Austin American-Statesman reported on May 14. Time to weigh in. No doubt, obesity has health consequences across age groups. But Eissler’s claim that 34 children die every hour because of it misstates an outdated statistic solely referring to adult deaths. And, according to the latest data, about 13 adults die every hour due to obesity-related disease — not 34. The statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03590	The Georgia Lottery paid out $2.3 billion in prizes during the last fiscal year.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/14/georgia-lottery/numbers-back-lottery-payouts-mega-millions-powerba/	The lottery is a hot topic around these parts. Many Georgians are daily players of the various high-odds games. For the state, the Georgia Lottery also funds the HOPE college scholarship program and Georgia’s pre-kindergarten program. The lottery’s high-energy radio and television advertisements fill airtime on several local stations, touting its games and payouts. One such ad caught the attention of Politifact Georgia reader Greg Queen, who asked us in an email to check out the numbers. The ad says that the Georgia Lottery Corp. paid out $2.3 billion in prizes during the last fiscal year. "I find (the figure of $2.3 billion in prizes paid) hard to believe," Queen emailed us. Queen also questioned whether the Georgia Lottery was including money paid out as part of multistate games such as Mega Millions and Powerball. PolitiFact Georgia has previously checked a couple of state lottery claims. We researched the experience of its director in relation to that of other state lottery leaders. We also checked another reader’s request about whether the lottery was overstating its odds by claiming prizes of another ticket or the face value of a ticket as "wins." We wondered whether the lottery’s $2.3 billion figure was accurate and exactly what was included in that amount. Our reader, Queen, saw the ad first on Atlanta’s ABC affiliate, WSB-TV; he later heard it on the station’s radio partner, AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB. PolitiFact Georgia happened to be up late one night consulting our psychic for winning Powerball numbers when we also saw the ad on TV. In addition to the $2.3 billion statement, the ad also includes information about payouts and winnings for some of its games. We checked with lottery representatives for more information. Spokeswoman Tandi Reddick told us that the $2.3 billion paid out in prizes for the last fiscal year (July 1, 2011-June 30, 2012) includes prizes paid to Georgia winners of games played in multiple states, such as Mega Millions and Powerball. For Mega Millions, the prizes won in Georgia reached $79.5 million; the total was $55.5 million for Powerball. The jackpot prizes for those multistate games are funded proportionately by all member states based on that state’s games sales for the particular drawing, Reddick said. All other prizes for Mega Millions (played in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands) and Powerball (played in 43 states, D.C. and the Virgin Islands) are also shared by participating states. Those games are administered by the nonprofit Multi-State Lottery Association, made up of member state lotteries that offer one or more of the multistate games. Also of note, the $2.3 billion figure quoted in the ad does not include tickets paid as prizes, Reddick said. So how does the lottery pay for all those prizes? On the income side, the Georgia Lottery recorded total ticket sales for fiscal 2012 of $3.835 billion, according to the lottery’s 2012 financial statements. So does the Georgia Lottery’s claim hit the jackpot? In TV and radio ads, the Georgia Lottery Corp. claims that it paid out $2.3 billion in prizes during the last fiscal year. The figure appears to be true but is padded to include amounts paid out for Georgia winners of the multistate games, Powerball and Mega Millions. We rated the Georgia Lottery’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04369	"Women who have miscarriages could be investigated by police" under legislation supported by Republican state Senate candidate Rick Gudex.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/22/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/women-who-miscarry-could-face-investigation-under-/	A television ad in the 18th state Senate district race jars viewers with a chilling scene: A police officer knocks at a door and confronts a distraught couple sitting on a sofa. "Women who have miscarriages could be investigated by police," the narrator says, and the words "Miscarriages investigated" appear on the screen. The ad is from the liberal Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and targets Republican state Senate candidate Rick Gudex of Fond du Lac who is challenging incumbent Democrat Jessica King of Oshkosh, who was elected in 2011 in a recall election. The seat is important for both parties and for control of the state Senate. The ad focuses on what it calls Gudex’s extreme views on abortion. But miscarriages investigated by police? That caught our attention. When asked for backup, Michelle McGrorty, executive director of the Greater Wisconsin fund, cited Gudex’s endorsement by Pro-Life Wisconsin and a questionnaire candidates must answer before getting it. The questionnaire includes this statement: "Would you vote in favor of a state constitutional amendment that extends the inalienable right to life already found in the Wisconsin Constitution to all preborn children from conception?" That refers to what is called a "personhood amendment." And Pro-Life Wisconsin says it endorses only candidates who answer "yes" to all questions on the survey. Such an amendment was introduced in the state Assembly a year ago, but it was not acted on. Here’s what Pro-Life says about that amendment: "Put simply, a ‘person’ is a human being who is fully protected under the law; and we use the legal term ‘personhood’ to describe this condition. Once a human being is declared a person that individual is guaranteed certain legal rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, to be a person is to be fully protected by a series of God­ given and constitutionally protected rights." McGrorty argues such an amendment could lead to investigations of women who suffered a miscarriage. "It basically extends the rights of a human being to a fertilized egg," she said. "If someone had a miscarriage and if someone believed someone did something wrong, they could be investigated." But here’s where some trouble arises. The same argument could be used the other way: The language, at least in the 2011 bill, doesn’t direct authorities to investigate miscarriages. It’s silent on them. And it doesn’t prevent authorities from enforcing other laws where pregnant women have engaged in drug abuse or other behavior that could injure or kill a fetus. We called Gudex several times, but he didn’t respond. However, since the ad started airing, he has responded in a couple of different ways. -- "I would never advocate for what King and her friends are suggesting and voters of all persuasions should be outraged at the fabricated content of this ad," he told the Fond du Lac Reporter. He didn’t say what part of the ad he considered fabricated. -- Gudex told the Journal Sentinel that he does not support the personhood amendment "in its current form." He said he does not support bans on birth control or investigations of miscarriages. Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin director of legislation, who wrote the endorsement survey, said the personhood question was not meant to tie a candidate to a specific bill. The information sheet referring to Joint Resolution 77 was meant to provide background information, Sande said. "That’s an example of what a personhood amendment is," Sande said. "It was a generic question." The group does not object to Gudex saying he would seek changes in the proposed amendment. "That’s fine with us," as long as he remains in favor of the idea of a personhood amendment, Sande said. "He’s certainly not backing off." Other states The miscarriage argument against personhood amendments has been used elsewhere. For instance, under a bill in Georgia, women who miscarried could be found guilty of a felony, according to a Feb. 23, 2011 blog item in the liberal Mother Jones magazine. PolitiFact Georgia on March 2, 2011 rated the Mother Jones statement Mostly True. In that state, the lawmaker who wrote the bill said it was not his intention to have police investigate miscarriages. PolitiFact Georgia said the blogger’s statement was correct but needed additional context, and noted that the bill’s language "is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant." The item concluded: "Women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law." A Nov. 7, 2011, Slate article about a proposed Mississippi personhood bill noted: "A woman who suffers a miscarriage would be prosecuted not because she had a miscarriage, but because police and prosecutors suspect she might have had an abortion. You would certainly be investigated if your born child disappeared and you said it had died in an accident." Sande said that common sense would ensure that women who suffered a miscarriage would not be investigated under a personhood amendment in Wisconsin. "This gross exaggeration is being brought up in all of those states" considering personhood bills, Sande said. "A miscarriage is not intentional. It’s a natural act, a natural occurrence," he said. "The idea that she would be culpable -- it just doesn’t make any sense." Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says in a television ad that legislation supported by a state Senate candidate could lead to police investigations of miscarriages. The claim stems from an endorsement from Pro-Life Wisconsin and relates to Gudex’s support of all its positions, including supporting a "personhood amendment." Gudex has said he wants changes to the personhood amendment that was introduced in the last session, but hasn’t said what alternative he would support. But that language did not mandate investigation of miscarriages, as the ad suggests. The claim is based on an extrapolation of what could happen, but even the group’s director said such an investigation would be because "someone believed someone did something wrong," not simply because a miscarriage occurred. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Greater Wisconsin Committee	None	None	None	2012-10-22T06:00:00	2012-10-01	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

The statement comes from the Oregon Transformation Project, launched in 2010 by state Republicans to talk state budget and spending. "The federal death tax rate in this country is currently 35%. There are 22 states that impose an additional tax on top of the federal rate with a state death tax, including Oregon. So, for the folks who qualify for this death tax, what is the tax penalty for dying in the state of Oregon? Nearly half of a lifetime’s savings. Oregon has the sixth highest combined death tax rate in the country." Yikes. That’s some heavy boldface italicizing. What’s this tax all about and why is it so high in Oregon? We dug in. The "death tax," for those unfamiliar with the term, is really the estate tax in IRS talk. The federal government exempts the first $5 million of a person’s estate but will take 35 percent on the rest. Nearly two dozen states assess separate estate or inheritance taxes, ranging from 1 percent to 16 percent. Oregon and Washington are among those states. The tax rate in Oregon tops out at 16 percent, with an exemption on the first $1 million. The Oregon Legislature adjusted its taxable brackets and rates earlier this year, to make it more equitable to those on the low end. For example, under current law a taxable estate of $1.1 million pays nearly $39,000 in taxes. Under the new law, the amount will be $10,000. (Our "It’s Only Money" columnist has a terrific read on what this means for most Oregonians.) We’re not weighing in on the fairness of calling this a death tax. But we do want to know whether we have the sixth highest combined tax rate in the country. In other words, are there 44 other states lower than Oregon? Oregon Transformation credits the Wall Street Journal with a chart that lists Oregon as one of a dozen states at the No. 6 spot. The Journal link goes to an opinion that links to a report by the American Family Business Institute. The institute -- located at www.nodeathtax.org/-- published a paper this year that studied the 22 states that assess a separate estate or inheritance tax. The report listed the state, exemption amount, range of tax rates, and the "top effective rate," based on the top statutory rate for each state. But American Family did not rank the states. A footnote in the report explains that the top effective rates are "highly fluid," and affected by several factors, including the state’s exemption amount, the size of the estate and estate planning. State estate taxes are deductible on federal tax returns. "It is tough to rank states on an ordinal scale because the taxing methods and exemptions differ," said Charles Chamberlayne of American Family in an email. Federal affairs director Palmer Schoening said the same over the phone: "It's not really fair to compare them." Oregon, for example, is one of six states with a $1 million threshold and a top tax rate of 16 percent. That tax rate in Washington tops out at 19 percent, but the threshold is higher at $2 million. New Jersey exempts $675,000, rather than $1 million. You get the idea. The highest possible combined rate in Oregon is 45.4 percent. If we accept the report’s numbers, Oregon shares the No. 6 spot with 11 other states. New Jersey is the highest at 54.1 percent and Ohio is the lowest at 39.6 percent. (Ohio will not have an estate tax starting in 2013.) But are we really sixth highest if we share that distinction with 11 other states, especially if that ranking only covers the high end? Lindsay Berschauer, who did the research for Oregon Transformation and wrote the post, acknowledged that the ranking system is convoluted, given the variety of tax brackets and exemptions. But she said it’s accurate to say that "at our highest state death tax bracket ($9.5 million), Oregon ranks 6th highest nationwide in tax rate for highest brackets." We want to give Oregon Transformation credit for its general argument. It’s true that Oregon has an estate tax, putting our state ahead of many states that do not. For some people with a lot of money, it’s probably more costly to die here than in, say, California. But based on the data, we can’t agree with the Oregon Transformation Project. Even the people who did the original report say there are too many variables to determine an ordinal ranking. Even if we abide by Oregon Transformation’s narrow definition, to say we’re No. 6 ignores 11 other states that also are at No. 6. Even if the "top statutory effective rate," or the highest combined possible rate, is nearly 50 percent, very few people in Oregon will ever pay that. For tax year 2009, only some 15 estates out of 1,000 had the 16 percent rate assessed on any portion of their estate, according to Mazen Malik of Oregon’s Legislative Revenue Office. Because chunks of estates are taxed at different rates, a person’s taxable estate needs to be more than $500 million for 16 percent of the estate to be due. We think those are all critical facts that would give a different impression about how our estate tax measures up to other states. Since the statement contains an element of truth we rate it Mostly False. Return to OregonLive to comment.	None	Oregon Transformation Project	None	None	None	2011-12-02T17:36:19	2011-11-15	['None']

pomt-00968	The minimum wage has risen $2.35 in the last two years. That's 31 percent.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/16/leonidas-raptakis/ri-sen-leonidas-raptakis-says-state-minimum-wage-r/	The Rhode Island minimum wage rose on Jan. 1 this year, following increases on Jan. 1 in 2013 and 2014. It's now at $9 an hour unless you're in a special category such as waiter or waitress, in which case the hourly minimum is $2.89. A proposal to raise the minimum to $10.10 per hour (but not for waiters and waitresses) was the subject of a Feb. 5 hearing before the House Committee on Labor. We heard two opponents complain that the minimum wage had already risen by 16 percent in the last two years. Then we heard testimony from Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis, D-Coventry, who wants future increases tied to inflation, not hiked randomly. "We're talking about small business here in Rhode Island," said Raptakis, referring to "increases that are unacceptable. Two dollars and thirty five cents the minimum wage has risen in the last two years. That's 31 percent. Never in Rhode Island history has the minimum wage gone up in two years (by) $2.35 or 31 percent." Sixteen percent? Thirty one percent? The discrepancy sent us scrambling for some data and our calculator. Two years ago, the minimum wage was $7.75. It's $9 an hour now. That's an increase of $1.25 or 16.1 percent. It seemed that Raptakis had doubled the actual increase. So we called him. He said he was referring to what the increase would be if the new legislation and its $10.10 minimum wage were approved. That's a jump of $2.35, but over three years, not two. That increase would be 30.3 percent, which is close to 31 percent. Raptakis also said Rhode Island's minimum wage has never risen by $2.35 or 31 percent in two years. (We'll assume he meant three years because raising the number of years is the only way his statement is accurate.) He's correct on the amount, but not on the percentage. The biggest three-year dollar increase we found was $1.60 due to hikes implemented in 2013, 2014 and 2015. If you look at percentage, the years 1979, 1980 and 1981 become important. That's when three increases totaling 80 cents were implemented. That was added to a starting base of $2.30 per hour. That's a three-year hike of 34.8 percent. Thus, the 31 percent increase over three years that Raptakis was talking about would not be unprecedented. However, unlike today, those were years when the U.S. was dealing with double-digit inflation rates. In summary, Sen. Raptakis testified that Rhode Island's minimum wage has risen $2.35 or 31 percent in the past two years. The actual increase Rhode Island businesses have been wrestling with over the past two years is significantly less, and he subsequently told us he was referring to what would happen if the $10.10 minimum wage was approved. The correct answer is 16.1 percent. We rate his statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14383	"We were able to provide $428 million worth of property tax relief."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/17/don-gaetz/legislature-provided-428-million-worth-property-ta/	The Florida Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott didn’t see eye-to-eye on much during the 2016 session, but they both acknowledged education spending should go up. Even then, however, they couldn’t agree on how to do it. Scott wanted to pay for it almost entirely by increasing a share of property taxes known as the Required Local Effort. Legislators balked at that idea, especially in the Senate, because they didn’t want homeowners to bear most of the burden by paying more in taxes. After several rounds of negotiation, the House and Senate settled on a solution of reducing the rate of property taxes and supplementing spending with more money from state coffers. They passed their compromise as part of the overall budget on March 11, 2016. "You can go home and say that under President (Andy) Gardiner, we were able to provide $428 million worth of property tax relief," Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said on the Senate floor. That’s a hefty tax break while boosting the education budget by almost half a billion dollars. We wondered whether the math added up the way Gaetz and other lawmakers said it did. It turns out the state did chip in an extra $428 million to keep property tax bills from going up, but it’s a pretty wonky process. An education in taxes We’re going to explain this in the simplest terms possible, because education funding and property taxes are complex. Just look at your property tax bill in November and you’ll see what we mean. The education budget the Legislature passes each year is based on two parts: state funding and local funding. This local funding includes a discretionary millage rate on property that counties control, and a millage rate for the so-called required local effort. (A "mill" is a levy of $1 for every $1,000 in taxable value on a property. If your house is worth $100,000, a one-mill rate equals $100.) The required local effort is paid for through a millage rate the Legislature sets annually, and local governments must assess that rate on property owners in order to kick in enough cash for schools and get their share of state funding. While lawmakers in Tallahassee set the rate each year, what they’re really doing is setting a dollar amount local governments need to contribute. We should note that the overall projection of what the required local effort would bring in doesn’t differentiate between counties or specific real estate markets. Because of the way the Department of Education revises its budget over the course of the year, different counties will be paying different amounts, based on their markets and school districts’ needs. Keep in mind, the state’s economy has rebounded from the recession fairly well. Property values are up, and so are tax collections on those properties. That’s because even if the government is charging the same millage rate on a property as the year before, the taxable value has increased, raising the tax bill. Last year, when the millage rate was 4.984 mills, the required local effort was $7.6 billion. The projected local property tax collections for the 2016-17 budget were set at more than $8 billion, if they kept the same millage rate. Scott was largely banking on this increase to pay for a bigger budget, but legislators said no. They didn’t want property owners paying more than the $7.6 billion they paid in 2015, so they used state tax money instead of more local property taxes. To use Gaetz’s term, the budget-writers "bought out" the required local effort. They moved $428 million from the general revenue fund, which includes money from practically every other tax and fee except ad valorem taxes. Then they reduced the millage rate to 4.694 mills, a 0.29-mill decrease, to counter higher taxable values and bring in the same $7.6 billion in property taxes. According to state projections, the next fiscal year’s property taxes are actually slated to be $724,000 less than last year. Whether you want to consider this "tax relief" depends on your point of view. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at watchdog group Florida TaxWatch, said only the $724,000 reduction in property taxes could be considered an actual tax cut based on current rates. That $724,000 is literally the amount people will be saving this year over last year. The $428 million, meanwhile, is preventing an increase that is projected to happen, not cutting current taxes that people are paying now. But Gaetz was careful to say "tax relief," not tax cut. There’s a lot of leeway in how you could define that. In the end, that’s $428 million homeowners will not be paying in any event. Wenner said the truest measure of whether the Legislature’s actions saved property owners any more money over last year would be to compare the new school property tax rate to the so-called "rollback rate." The state devises the rollback rate to show what the millage rate would have to be this year in order to collect the same amount as last year. If the rollback rate were higher than 4.694 mills, we could clearly define how much less property owners would be paying. But unfortunately we can’t examine it that way. The state doesn’t calculate rollback rates until July. Our ruling Gaetz said, "We were able to provide $428 million worth of property tax relief." The Legislature approved an increase to local school funding while cutting a key millage rate used to calculate the Required Local Effort. That will keep property tax collections essentially the same. The $428 million is an infusion of general revenue cash that will cover the boost in the education budget. We could quibble with Gaetz referring to this as "tax relief," because the plan is altering future collections, instead of cutting current collections. But property owners are shielded from shouldering the burden of increased education spending, so we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-04580	Says "the governor is going around the state talking about [how] we should fund an income tax cut" that benefits higher income earners and not lower income earners	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/24/john-burzichelli/ohn-burzichelli-says-chris-christie-promoting-tax-/	Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) is a member of the budget committee, which was left without a witness last week when the state treasurer did not show up to explain some numbers. Gov. Chris Christie said the Democrats were trying to put on a "political show" by calling the treasurer. Burzichelli said the hearing was not theater. Rather, he said, the governor’s projections for state revenue collections, which are lagging, matter. "Remember the governor is going around the state talking about [how] we should fund an income tax cut that will affect the higher earners in New Jersey in a higher way than it will the low earners, which will have no benefit for that," Burzichelli said in a Sept. 19 interview on NJToday. Burzichelli then said the Legislature indicated that if Christie’s revenue projections were met, the Democrats would support some sort of tax cut. "So as the numbers tell us they’re not materializing as he anticipated they would," Burzichelli said, "the ability to do a tax cut for the higher earners become[s] less and less likely and that’s why I think that we have to have these kind of hearings now." Is Christie traveling the state touting a tax cut plan that only benefits wealthy residents? The governor started a tour this summer to push for a tax cut, but Burzichelli unfairly characterizes Christie’s current plan. In January, Christie proposed a tax cut that would have largely benefited wealthy individuals, but the governor has since embraced a new plan. Christie’s original plan called for cutting income tax rates 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, residents who earn more -- and pay more in income taxes -- would have saved more, though lower income individuals would still have benefited. But that plan is off the table. This summer Christie introduced a new proposal that excludes some of the state’s wealthiest residents. The new plan, based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats, gives homeowners an income tax credit based on the first $10,000 of their property tax bill. Only homeowners with $400,000 or less in taxable income could qualify for the 10 percent credit, which would be phased in over four years and reach a maximum of $1,000. This summer, Christie, through his conditional veto power, took a bill that would have raised the top tax rate on millionaires and amended the language to turn it into his new tax cut plan. Christie then urged the state Legislature to pass that amended legislation in a special session on July 2. They refused, saying it was prudent to wait to see whether the governor’s optimistic revenue projections were met before they committed to any tax cut. Burzichelli acknowledged that Christie backed off the across-the-board income tax cut plan in his conditional veto, "if you take that snapshot," but he said, "I think he’s drifted back and forth a couple times." We found no evidence to support that. Both of Christie’s plans also would restore a cut he made in 2010 to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program that benefits lower income individuals. The plans would have increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent. Our ruling Burzichelli said, "the governor is going around the state talking about [how] we should fund an income tax cut" that benefits higher income earners and not lower income earners. Christie originally proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited wealthy individuals more than those with lower-incomes, but he has since backed off that plan. His new proposal is based on the property tax burden of homeowners and excludes residents with incomes more than $400,000. We rate Burzichelli’s statement False.

pomt-12634	"Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/30/sean-spicer/spicer-mostly-accurate-global-food-demand-projecti/	White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed global food demand to commemorate National Agriculture Day on March 21. "Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050," Spicer said, using the claim to support President Trump’s desire to reduce regulations affecting American farmers and ranchers. We wondered how such an estimate would be created and if Spicer’s data was based on evidence. Projections on food increases Both the data the White House showed us and research we found supports the claim that food demand will increase in the coming decades. Yet estimates vary surrounding the level to which it will increase. One study from 2014 in the academic journal Agricultural Economics stated food demand might increase by 59 percent to 98 percent between 2005 and 2050. Another study contributed to the National Academy of Sciences in 2011 said crop demand might rise by 100 to 110 percent between 2005 and 2050. Those estimates are close to the increase of 50 percent to 97 percent Spicer mentioned, though Spicer’s claim didn’t specify a start date for his projection. (We asked for clarification but didn’t get a response.) The start date matters, because if it’s 2017 -- as a casual listener would probably assume -- then Spicer’s estimate is likely too high. Harry Kaiser, a Cornell University professor and an expert in food demand, said about a 39 percent increase in global food demand seemed more accurate (though he said other factors, like global changes in diet, might contribute to a higher estimate). He calculated that figure based on projected increases in population multiplied by projected increases in per-capita food demand using 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Bottom line: This is way lower than Spicer’s claim of between 50 to 90 percent growth in world food demand by 2050," he said. Richard Waite, an associate from from the World Resources Institute’s Food Program also told us that Spicer’s estimate was too high. He explained that forecasts of this nature "can be a little misleading" because the base year for frequently used data is often in the past. Waite estimated a roughly 45 percent increase in food demand from 2017, but noted that it was a fairly common "mistake" to use projected figures from 2006 in the way Spicer did. The World Resources Institute estimated about a 70 percent increase in global food demand between 2006 and 2050. Reasons for increasing global food demand Several factors impact rates of global food demand: growth in population and income are two of the most important ones. Estimates show the projected world population will be around 9.6 billion by 2050, up from roughly 7.5 billion currently, and per-capita income is expected to rise to 1.8 times what it was in 2012. Population increases the number of mouths to feed, while income growth tends to increase the amount of calories the people eat. Income increases can also create a shift in diet as lower-income individuals may have better access to protein-heavy foods like livestock and fish as their incomes rise. For example, the World Resources Institute expects a 23 percent global increase in consumption of livestock and cattle between 2006 to 2050. Our ruling Spicer said that global food demand would increase by 50 to 98 percent by 2050. Recent projections agree with general thrust of his forecast, but it seems likely that Spicer’s claim is a little too high to be completely on target.

pomt-04047	"Since last year’s address, more than 10,000 jobs created -- many on the high end of the employment scale."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-says-more-high-paying-jobs-have-come-georgia/	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has spent much of his first term promoting Georgia as the premier state to start a business or to expand. In his speech, the governor claimed his efforts are working. "Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale," Deal said. "More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home." A Deal spokesman did not respond to a request for specifics to back up this claim. We began our research by reading each news release on Deal’s website since his 2012 State of the State address. More than two dozen of the releases include announcements of new jobs that would be created in Georgia. By our count, the total was slightly more than 9,000. The releases do not say whether all the positions are full-time jobs. We interpreted Deal’s comments that many of the jobs were "on the high end of the employment scale" to mean that they will command high salaries. There is some support for the governor’s claim on that point: General Motors announced earlier this month that it was going to employ about 1,000 Georgians at an information technology plant in Roswell. The positions include software developers, database managers and other positions that are typically high-paying jobs. Officials with Caterpillar, which is building a manufacturing plant in the Athens area that will employ 1,400 people, said the average wages were competitive or greater than the current local averages, according to one news report at the time of the announcement. Baxter, which is building a manufacturing plant in Covington that company officials say will create 1,500 jobs, tends to pay on the higher end of the wage scale, some industry insiders said. The governor’s numbers were slightly off on the number of jobs, from what we found. It seems reasonable to believe that many of these positions will be on the high end of the employment scale.

"Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people?" Sanders tweeted May 25. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to fact-check whether the Trump budget indeed bestows a $100 billion tax break on three of the wealthiest families in the United States. The accusation runs into trouble by running away with a flawed analysis of Trump’s tax plan. Sanders’ source is a report prepared by Democrats on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. The report shows the maximum estate tax liability for a group of wealthy Americans, including billionaires and some members of the Trump administration, and how much they would stand to gain if the estate tax were repealed. The three billionaire families listed on the chart are the Walton family of Wal-Mart, Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. According to the report, these families stand to gain $52 billion, $38 billion and $12 billion respectively in tax breaks under Trump’s proposal, or $102 billion all together. How? The rules for the estate tax allow a person to inherit almost $5.5 million tax free. Above that, Washington collects 40 percent. Senate Democrats took the total net worth of those three households, reduced it by the tax-exempt amount, and assumed the remainder would be taxed at the 40 percent rate. The problem is, experts said, Sanders miscast Trump’s tax plan, and the Democratic calculations are overly simple. Trump’s actual tax plan Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center, said Sanders is not fully capturing Trump's proposal for the estate tax. "Trump has proposed replacing the estate tax with a requirement that estates pay income tax on all of an estate's unrealized capital gains," Williams said. Unrealized capital gains are the profits made when an investment, such as a building or shares of stock, is sold. "If a high-value estate had unrealized gains, it would pay income tax on those gains at the top rate of 20 percent rather than an estate tax at a 40 percent rate," he said. He gave an example: An estate worth $50 billion with $25 billion of unrealized gains would pay income tax of $5 billion under Trump’s plan -- a lot less than the $20 billion that would be owed in today’s tax system, but "not zero." Sanders assumed those wealthy family members would pay nothing, and that’s not certain. It should be noted that Trump has not said anything about unrealized capital gains in his budget, although he makes a mention of doing away with most special interest tax breaks without clarifying what those tax breaks are. But even in the absence of any tax on unrealized capital gains, the three wealthy families still wouldn’t net $100 billion under the estate tax abolition plan. Here’s why. Estates rarely pay the 40 percent estate tax Although the estate tax is 40 percent, a slew of deductions bring down the taxable value of the estate reduce the effective tax rate. Those deductions include charitable bequests, among other loopholes. There’s a big gap between the size of the estates the Democrats relied on and the size in the eyes of the IRS, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The Democrats relied on estimates from Forbes magazine, and Pomerleau said by one estimate, the actual number is about half that. "And then according to the IRS, taxable estate is about 30 percent of gross estate," he said. "Taking these together, taxable estate -- what the IRS applies the 40 percent rate to -- is about 15 percent of what is publicly reported on average." Pomerleau said by his estimate, the total value of the estate tax bill for those three families would be closer to $16 billion. Williams at the Tax Policy Center agreed. Any person with a very large estate would bring on an estate tax lawyer to structure his or her estate in ways that would reduce estate tax. "It is hard to imagine that those families would ever be taxed on the full value of their wealth, given the many ways available to reduce estate valuations, pass wealth to subsequent generations at reduced value, and use other techniques to delay or cut estate tax liabilities," he said. This means it is highly unlikely that wealthy families would ever pay 40 percent tax on their wealth under the current estate tax law. Eliminating the estate tax thus would not save them 40 percent of their wealth relative to current law. Other tax changes Trump’s budget also proposes other tax measures, including doing away with the alternate minimum tax, lowering the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and repealing taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Affordable Care Act. While Sanders’ office only pointed to the estate tax, his tweet was more expansive, so we asked our experts to assess the impact. They said while these factors would indeed help the wealthy save money it would be difficult to estimate it in dollars in the absence of tax returns. We raised this issue with Sanders’ office and did not hear back. Our ruling Sanders said Trump’s budget gives a $100 billion tax break to three of the wealthiest families. His office pointed to a Democratic analysis that assumed the total elimination of the estate tax. But Trump’s proposal would retain a measure to tax some portion of inherited wealth. On top of that, the experts we reached told us that careful tax planning reduces the government’s take under current law. They said the Democrats greatly exaggerated the potential tax bills these families face, and the real cost would be considerably less than $100 billion. Trump’s tax plan has other features that would cut taxes on the super wealthy, but it isn’t possible to quantify the impact with any accuracy. The three wealthy families Sanders had in mind would benefit handsomely under Trump’s plan, but his office did not provide evidence that held up, and experts said the total would likely be less than the $100 billion he said. We rate this claim Mostly False. Update, June 2, 2017: We added information after our initial publication to clarify what Trump's budget said about estate taxes and unrealized capital gains.

pomt-08756	Republicans "don't think it's a good idea" to make the child care tax credit "stronger."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/27/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-oppose-strengthening-child-/	Democrats want to make it easier for working parents to pay for child care, but congressional Republicans don't think that's a good idea, President Barack Obama told his audience in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 18, 2010. Asked whether the government has done anything to reduce child care costs, Obama said, "We have a child care credit in place. We’d like to make it stronger. This is one of those back-and-forths we’ve been having with the Republicans, because we actually think it is a good idea and they don’t. But I think that giving families support who have to work each and every day is absolutely critical." Are Republican lawmakers really opposed to increasing the child care credit? We decided to look into it. First, a little background. The Child and Dependent Care Credit allows parents who work or go to school to deduct between 20 and 35 percent of child care expenses for children under age 13. The credit, for expenses that total up to $3,000, can help reduce one's income tax liability to zero, but it is non-refundable. As a result, low-income families who owe little or no income tax to begin with get little benefit from the credit, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Congress enacted the credit in 1976 and in 1981 implemented a sliding scale that made the credit more progressive. More changes came in 1988 and 2001, when Congress increased the maximum allowable expenses. The latest extension, however, is scheduled to expire at the end of this year and unless Congress takes action, the maximum allowable expenses will drop to $2,400 for one child and $4,800 for two. President Obama was right when he said that Democrats have been working to make the credit "stronger." He called for doubling the credit in his January State of the Union address and later made a proposal to make permanent the maximum 35 percent rate and the $3,000 maximum for expenses. His proposal would also permanently increase to $85,000 the income level when the credit begins to phase out, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Democrats in Congress have seemed receptive. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Penn., introduced a bill in May that would make the 35 percent rate permanent. The bill has 11 co-sponsors, all Democrats. But as for the Republicans, we found very limited evidence to substantiate Obama's claim that they are against it. On Jan. 25, 2010, the White House Middle Class Task Force released a set of policy proposals designed to help middle-class families. The first proposal on the list called for doubling the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit for families making under $85,000 a year. The proposals prompted general criticism from Republicans, who claimed the proposals would not provide much of a boost to the economy. Rep. John Boehner, the House Republican leader, said in a press release that none of the proposals "outlined by the White House today would, in fact, create jobs. And they do nothing to protect Americans from the president’s job-killing agenda." Striking a similar tone, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich. told Bloomberg News that "what will help middle-class families most is creating jobs and reducing the unemployment rate, but these proposals won’t do either." Clearly those Republicans are not supporting the proposal that includes the child-care tax credit, but they are not singling it out for opposition, either. We found a report issued by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, which argued that "increasing this credit would do nothing to encourage growth." The credit as it stands discriminates against families who choose alternative child care arrangements, and Congress should focus on cutting marginal tax rates, the report states. Still, we weren't able to find any Republican lawmakers who cited the report in their speeches or statements, and we find it's a stretch for Democrats such as Obama to claim that the Republican criticism means they specifically oppose child care tax credits. In fact, Republicans have often supported the credits in the past. GOP members in both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly backed previous bills that included the child care credit. Three Republicans have co-sponsored a tax bill by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that would make the tax credit permanent. And a 2009 amendment that would improve the child care credit authored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., passed by unanimous consent, which means no Republican objected. Likewise, Sen. Charles Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has called for changes to ensure that small companies can take advantage of the child care credit. Obama said that Republicans "don't think it's a good idea" to make the child care tax credit "stronger." It is true that the top Republican in the House dismissed the report of the White House Middle Class task force that proposed to double the credit, but the Obama administration has not produced any evidence of specific GOP opposition and we find plenty of other examples where Republicans have supported beefing up the credits. We find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04313	Says Connie Mack initially said he would have voted "yes" for the Paul Ryan budget plan, and then, "you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/29/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-kept-changing-his-min/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, has had a tough time deciding how he felt about the Republican budget plan, says Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. During a Senate debate on Oct. 17, Nelson attacked Mack for missing votes, specifically this year’s vote on a budget plan put forward by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that seeks to dramatically reduce future government spending. "Now one of the votes you missed was the Paul Ryan plan," Nelson said during the debate. "That was the second Paul Ryan plan. You were asked would you support it, since you missed it. You said yes. And then in a later interview, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes." We wanted to check to see if Nelson accurately summarized Mack’s changing responses to the Ryan plan after missing the vote on March 29, 2012. Ryan is now the Republicans' nominee for vice president. Nelson’s campaign sent us a couple of news clips about Mack’s comments, and we found several other examples of Mack’s statements in news reports in Nexis and speeches on YouTube. Background on Ryan’s plan Ryan’s plan would bring about a major restructuring of several areas of government, include Medicare and Medicaid, in order to reduce future spending. It would also overhaul the tax code by setting two tax brackets. (Read more details in our previous fact-check.) Ryan is chairman of the House Budget Committee. In August, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney selected Ryan to be his running mate. We will briefly note that in 2011, Mack voted on an earlier version of Ryan’s plan, and he voted yes. Back then, Mack praised Ryan’s budget proposal and called it a "good first step." "The Ryan proposal also lays out a blueprint to save Medicare, save Social Security, reform the job-stifling tax code, repair the welfare safety net, cut wasteful spending, and get the debt under control over the coming decades, but needs to go further to bring our national debt to a zero balance more quickly," Mack stated in an April 5, 2011, press release. The 2012 Ryan plan Now we fast-forward to 2012 -- Mack was busy campaigning in the GOP Senate primary, and the House was preparing to vote on a new version of Ryan’s plan. On March 22, The Hill, a Washington-based newspaper that covers Congress, mentioned Mack’s name among those planning to vote in favor. But on March 29, Mack missed the vote. Mack spokesman David James told the Tampa Bay Times that Mack supported the Ryan budget but had other obligations. On the same day he missed the vote, Mack spoke via Skype to a West Orlando tea party group and said his own Penny Plan would balance the budget faster than Ryan’s plan. But Mack didn’t say how he would have voted on the Ryan proposal. "The Ryan budget, that doesn’t balance for 20 to 24 years. We can’t afford to wait that long. We have to be serious about you know balancing this budget. We can’t continue to raise the debt ceiling. ..." Mack said, according to video posted by the American Bridge 21st Century Democratic PAC, a group that supports Nelson. Mack calls the plan a "joke" but campaign says he would have voted for it On April 4, the Miami Herald reported that Mack called the plan a "joke" during a March 31 Orlando tea party forum. But a Mack spokesman said later that Mack didn’t mean to criticize the plan itself and would have voted for it. "The vote was the 'joke,' as in the process being a joke, not the Ryan plan itself. And Connie said the vote was a joke," James said in an email to the Miami Herald at the time. "He supports the Ryan plan but the process is a joke when the GOP House continues to do the right things and the liberal Senate under (Majority Leader Harry) Reid and (Florida Sen. Bill) Nelson continue to kill fiscally responsible measures." But the Herald wrote that Mack clearly criticized the plan itself. "I was here in Florida campaigning," Mack said during the tea party forum, according to the conservative Florida Political Press. "You know that budget was a joke, doesn’t balance the budget for years." POLITICO wrote on April 17 about Mack’s missed votes; their article stated that a Mack spokesman refused to say how Mack would have voted on the Ryan plan but said it "has some brave proposals." Mack said he probably would have voted against it On April 23, this fact-checker who also writes for the Naked Politics blog went to listen to Mack speak to the Broward Republican Executive Committee in Fort Lauderdale. "Congressman Ryan had a plan," Mack said. "There are a lot of good things in Congressman Ryan’s plan. The changes and reforms in the entitlement programs are necessary and way overdue. The only problem I have is that the budget still doesn't balance for 28 years. ... We can do better. We must do better." Mack called for combining Ryan’s ideas with his own Penny Plan to balance the budget faster. In interviews with reporters after his speech, Mack said if he had been present for the vote he probably would have voted against Ryan's plan because of how long it takes to balance the budget. On April 24, Mack was asked about the Ryan plan on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown. "There are a lot of reforms that I think make sense," he said. "But the fact that it won't balance for 28 years is bothersome to me." A May 13 Washington Post article quoted Mack as saying about the Ryan plan: "I go back and forth. I probably would have voted no. There are a lot of reforms that I like. But I have a problem with the idea that this budget is not going to balance for 28 years." After Mack won the Republican Senate primary in August, the Daily Caller wrote that Mack told reporters: "I haven’t always supported Paul Ryan’s budget. Frankly I think that we need to balance the budget a lot quicker than 28 years." But Mack said that he appreciated Ryan’s effort: "The Democrats have no plans. They want to stick their heads in the sand when it comes to Medicare," he said, adding that Democrats "want to simply lie to the people of Florida" by saying that Republicans want to "change Medicare as we know it." On Aug. 28, Chuck Todd on The Daily Rundown asked Mack about his comments about the Ryan budget and how he would have voted. "What I said is that I would have, if I was there, I would have voted against it." Todd asked why, and Mack replied: "I think a lot of the reforms Ryan has put out are good reforms. But we need to balance our budget. And we need to do it not in 28 years but under 10 years. We can do it ... " Nelson said Mack called the Ryan plan "stupid," but we didn’t find any example of Mack calling the plan "stupid." Let’s recap Mack’s comments about the Ryan plan starting just before the missed March 29, 2012 vote: March 22: The Hill lists Mack as planning to vote in favor of the Ryan plan. March 29: Mack missed the vote but his spokesman said he would have voted for it. Mack criticizes the plan while speaking to a tea party group. March 31: Mack called the Ryan plan a "joke." April 4 Miami Herald article: Mack’s campaign said Mack meant the process was a joke and would have voted for it. April 23: Mack said he probably would have voted against it. May: Mack is quoted in the Washington Post saying, "I go back and forth. I probably would have voted no." Aug. 28: Mack said on The Daily Rundown "I would have voted against it." We asked the Mack campaign if his comments in August reflected his current position and if Mack disagreed with Nelson’s claim and did not get a response to that question. Our ruling Nelson said of the second Ryan plan, "You were asked would you support it, since you missed it. You said yes. And then in a later interview, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes." If we start the timeline of Mack’s statements after he missed the vote March 29, we found Mack’s campaign said he would have voted yes, then he said it was a "joke", then his campaign said he meant the process was a joke and he would have voted yes. Then we find from late April through August Mack said a few times that he probably would have voted against it. But there was some consistency in Mack’s message: He criticized the Ryan plan for taking too long to balance the budget and promoted his faster-acting Penny Plan instead. Nelson omitted this part of Mack’s message. We didn’t find any time that Mack called the Ryan plan "stupid," but he did call it a "joke," which is similar. We also found that Mack landed on the conclusion that he would have voted no, while Nelson’s claim ends with Mack deciding that he would have voted yes. Nelson is right that Mack kept changing his message about how he would have voted. But he omitted that Mack was consistent in arguing that the Ryan plan moves too slowly to balance the budget.

pomt-08794	"Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/19/afscme/afscme-accuses-republican-jim-renacci-supporting-2/	Rep. John Boccieri, a freshman Democrat from Alliance, is in the cross hairs. The Republican Party wants to recapture the 16th Congressional District seat moderate Republican Ralph Regula held from 1973 until he retired in 2008. That’s when Boccieri, a Ohio legislator and Iraq War veteran, won the seat an open election. Republicans and allied groups are buoyed by the anti-incumbent mood of the electorate and by Boccieri’s vote for health care reform, which they hope to exploit with voters. On top of that, Boccieri faces a well-financed Republican in Jim Renacci, a former Wadsworth mayor and CPA who co-owns a nursing home as well as car and motorcycle dealerships. But a powerful union -- the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) -- has come to Boccieri’s defense, attacking Renacci in a television advertisement that hit the airwaves August 9. Recognizing the anti-tax mood benefiting Republicans, AFSCME wants a piece of the action, accusing Renacci of backing a massive tax hike. "Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent," says the union ad, which includes comments from outraged citizens condemning the proposal. The AFSCME ad cites a March 9 primary debate in the 16th District sponsored by Tea Party groups. Though not explained in the ad, the figure of 23 percent is a reference to what some Republicans call a Fair Tax, says Ricky Feller, deputy political director for AFSCME, which oversees the union’s independent political arm that is running ads in Ohio. The Fair Tax proposal is federal sales tax on goods and services that – and this is crucial to the debate -- would replace a slew of other taxes, including federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, estate and gift taxes, business taxes and capital gains taxes. Legislation to create such a tax is introduced each year in Congress but goes nowhere. The latest version of the legislation, introduced in 2009 by Rep John Linder, a Georgia Republican, would impose a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services. It sets the sales tax rate at 23 percent in 2011. Boiled down, critics say that Fair Tax proposal is not enforceable, won’t cover the revenue generated by the taxes it eliminates and the Fair Tax is regressive, that is, people earning lower incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes because they spend a larger portion of their paychecks than wealthy individuals. Proponents argue the Fair Tax plan would spur economic growth because people will have more money to spend and that will generate tax revenue. They say, lower income people would receive a "rebate" for taxes paid on basic necessities to help keep the system from becoming regressive. The economics behind the Fair Tax proposal are complicated and the subject of books, on-line debates, and fact check articles. For those who want to wade into the weeds, check out FactCheck.org’s take, "Unspinning the Fair Tax," published in May 31, 2007, or PolitiFact.com’s article, "Adding up the Fair Tax," published in January 23, 2008. What’s at issue in the AFSCME ad isn’t the economics of the Fair Tax proposal, rather: Did Renacci really say he favors a national sales tax increase of 23 percent. AFSCME did not fulfill its promise to provide PolitiFact a transcript of Renacci’s comments or a link to the video of the debate on which the union based its ad, but cited Renacci’s campaign website to support its charge. A video of the debate produced by the Tea Party organizers and available on YouTube shows Renacci at the May event responding to the question: "What is the most effective tax system, flat tax, fair tax or the current tax system? Renacci called the Fair Tax a consumption tax and used the two interchangeably. He said the Fair Tax "is a good model. I think it is a fair model. The biggest problem with the consumption tax is implementing it. ... I am a firm believer in the fair tax, consumption tax. ... I would like to see a way to have that implemented in a simple fashion." But while the video shows Renacci likes a 23 percent national sales tax, that’s not enough to make AFSCME’s ad completely accurate. It leaves out important information about Renacci’s record of rhetoric on the matter and how he couched his support during the debate. As a supporter of the Fair Tax proposal, Renacci likes even more the idea of eliminating all other taxes. He’s been consistent in endorsing the Fair Tax plan with caveats: The plan must address the potential negative consequences of implementing it and the plan has to produce a net tax decrease, a point he’s made on his Web site from the beginning of his campaign. "While I believe that a form of "consumption tax" or "fair tax" in lieu of a federal income tax is an idea worthy of further examination, I could only potentially support such a concept if the tax would serve as a replacement to the income tax, not an addition to it," he states. We thought those details were important context for the issue. That’s why we rated AFSCME’s statement Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-02498	"Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-congressional-budget-office-predicts-oba/	Here’s a claim we expect to hear often from Republicans in the 2014 midterm races: Obamacare is a jobs killer. The National Republican Congressional Committee gave us a sneak peek at how the attack will be framed with a new ad critical of Alex Sink, the Democrat vying for the former seat of U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., in a special election. "Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs," the ad says. "Yet Alex Sink still supports it." It’s amazing how quickly an economic report can turn into an attack ad. The claims stems from new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper, that came out just last week. We’ve already rated similar statements a couple of times already. We said they’re Mostly False. Here’s the problem with the ad’s claim: The CBO estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. The CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. The ad misinterprets the difference between "workers" and "jobs." And the word "costs" makes it seem like these are positions that employers are eliminating as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Instead, the CBO report says that with Obamacare in place providing greater access to insurance on the individual market and subsidies to help pay for it, some Americans will decide on their own to work less. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would "reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive." This would equal a "decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," the report continued. "By providing subsidies that decline with rising income and by making some people financially better off, the ACA will create an incentive for some people to work less," the report said. An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely. This would not increase unemployment. Instead, it may actually create new opportunities for those who have been looking for work. It could also invite people who have given up on looking for work (who aren’t counted in unemployment statistics) back into the labor market, the report said. That doesn’t mean the outlook is entirely rosy. As more people choose to work less, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. Also, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to," Sinclair told PolitiFact last week. "In a macroeconomic sense, this still means fewer people working, even if that is their choice," she said. "It also probably means relatively higher wages and better bargaining power for those who are looking for a job. This is very different than the short-run effects of employers cutting positions, where we would see unemployment rates go up, less bargaining power for workers, and potentially relatively lower wages. So, the description of the source of the cut -- whether it’s from supply or demand -- does matter, but not for the count of ‘jobs.’" In an email to PolitiFact, the NRCC pointed to stories about the new CBO numbers on Obamacare. But those stories distinguished that this was a decrease in workers, not jobs cut by employers, and that’s important. Our ruling The NRCC said "nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs." It’s misleading to suggeset the report indicated cuts in jobs. Instead, workers who can now receive subsidized insurance will cut back on hours equivalent to about 2.5 million workers by 2024. The distinction is critical to understanding the law’s impact on the labor market. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction: Though our ruling statement accurately quoted the ad as saying, "Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs," a later line in our story inaccurately quoted the ad as saying "cuts" instead of "costs."

If the wage gap was eliminated, a working woman in Oregon would have enough money for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family or nearly 12 more months of rent."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/apr/10/national-partnership-women-families/would-eliminating-pay-gap-oregon-let-women-buy-287/	The economic equity issues that proved pivotal in the 2012 presidential campaign are again shaping up as big factors this year. Both major parties are pushing to make sure their talking points prevail. Democrats cite statistics showing a yawning pay gap between men and women, with Republicans countering that young women are out earning men in some urban areas. The Claim The National Partnership For Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, released a new analysis April 8, 2014, to coincide with Equal Pay Day. It cited U.S. Census data showing that women who work full time in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men -- a claim PolitiFact Oregon has investigated previously and found solid. But it went further. If the wage gap were eliminated, it said, "a working woman in Oregon would have enough money per year for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family or nearly 12 more months of rent. We wondered if the specific pieces of the claim were on the money. The Analysis The basis of the group’s claim comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. It lists, state by state, median annual earnings for year-round, full-time workers and draws on statistics from 2012, the most recent year available. Men in Oregon earned $47,402, compared with $37,381 for women, according to the data. That’s 79 cents on the dollar and adds up to a gap of $10,021 a year. The gap persists for a variety of reasons, said Mary King, a Portland State University economics professor, including a gender division of labor under which "women’s jobs" are paid less, lack of strong family-leave policies, and women disproportionately ending up in low-paying retail and service work. Satisfied that women do earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by men -- the gap would be 21 cents -- we emailed Sadie Kliner, the National Partnership for Women & Families’ communications director. She directed us to a separate fact sheet. Gasoline prices, according to the sheet, were provided by Oil Price Information Service in cooperation with Wex, Inc. A gallon of regular gas in Oregon currently costs $3.697, it read. We checked that against AAA Oregon/Idaho’s website, which shows regular gas in Oregon right now averaging $3.69 per gallon. Then we did the math, dividing the wage gap of $10,021 by $3.69. The group claimed a woman could buy 2,877 gallons, but we found closing the gap would enable a woman to buy only 2,715 gallons. We contacted Kliner again, who noted that Oregon’s gas prices were $3.48 when the fact sheet was prepared in early March. A check of AAA’s gas-price information confirmed Kliner’s point. We moved on to the 12 months worth of rent piece of the claim. The group, citing data from the Census’s 2012 American Community Survey, put the median cost for rental housing in Oregon at $862 a month. It showed a margin of error of plus or minus 8 percent. Independently verifying that number wasn’t easy, since no county or or state organization tracks it. We called Multifamily NW, whose members manage more than 150,000 rental units from southern Washington to Medford. Jonathan Clay, the association’s research and communications analyst, pointed us to a semi-annual survey released in October. Two-bedroom, one-bath units averaged $818 per month across the metro area, according to the survey, putting it within range of the margin of error in the Census data. We calculated that $10,021 would pay for 11.5 months of rent, just over half a month shy of the group’s original claim of 12 months. Again contacting Kliner about the discrepancy, she noted that the group rounded the figure up, using the word "nearly" to account for the difference. Finally, in assessing food costs, we noted that the original claim said "72 more weeks of food for her family." While the claim didn’t specify the number of children, we settled on two. We then checked the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, which publishes monthly food plans representing a well-rounded diet at four different cost levels. Drawing from the low-cost plan, two children could be fed on $97.50 per week. Food costs for an adult female would bring the family’s weekly total to $144.90. That compares with the $139.10 per week for the 72 weeks in the group’s pay-gap claim. Our Ruling A national advocacy group, in spotlighting Equal Pay Day, claimed that a pay gap between men and women exists in Oregon. PolitiFact Oregon has looked at the gap before and found that it’s real, but we took the next step by fact-checking the group’s claim that the gap is big enough to pay for 2,877 gallons of gasoline, 72 months of food or nearly 12 months of rent. All three elements of the claim checked out -- or were very close -- according to independent sources. We rate the claim True.

pomt-01546	Says "John Barrow voted with Obama 85 percent of the time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/15/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-john-barrow-d-ga-voted-barack-obama-/	One of the biggest obstacles to a strong Democratic showing in the 2014 midterm elections is that approval ratings for President Barack Obama are mired in the 40 percent range -- and even lower in many red states. Because of this, it’s no surprise that the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- is creating ads that emphasize the degree to which vulnerable Democratic incumbents have voted with Obama. We recently found two NRCC ads using virtually identical language on this point. Here, we’ll fact-check an ad attacking Democratic Rep. John Barrow of Georgia. In a separate item, we’ll fact-check an ad that targets Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia. Barrow represents a district that voted for Republican Mitt Romney by a 12-point margin in the 2012 presidential race, making him one of the few House Democratic incumbents representing a district won by Romney. In fact, only three Democratic House members represent more heavily Republican districts than Barrow. (Rahall represents one of those three districts; the other two are two retiring lawmakers, Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina.) This makes Barrow, first elected in 2004, a key target for House Republicans. He faces a strong GOP challenger in construction company owner Rick Allen, and independent handicappers rate it as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year. The NRCC’s ad features Richard Fender, a business owner from Augusta, Ga. In it, Fender says, "Whatever Obama wants, he's voted with him," a comment that’s accompanied by text on the screen that says, "John Barrow voted with Obama 85 percent of the time." In much smaller type, the ad footnotes this claim to "Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis." Since data from 2009 would now be five years old, we had a hunch that the NRCC might have ignored a couple of years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right. In 2010, according to the same CQ study, Barrow voted with Obama 83 percent of the time. But that dropped to 59 percent in 2011, and fell even further to 28 percent in 2012 and 35 percent in 2013. (Data for 2014 has not yet been posted.) Clearly, the 85 percent figure for voting with Obama was a more attractive one for the NRCC to highlight. But it amounts to cherry-picking. Democrats could easily run an ad saying Barrow voted with Obama 28 percent of the time and be just as correct (if not more so, since the data backing up the Democratic assertion is more recent). NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill attributed the drop in Barrow’s percentage of voting with Obama to increasing discomfort with the president’s agenda. "When Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the House under President Obama and John Barrow was in the majority, he voted with his party at every turn," Prill said. Another likely factor worth noting: Between the 2010 Census and the 2012 election, Georgia’s Republican-dominated state Legislature drew a new map for the state’s congressional delegation. The new arrangement removed Savannah and other moderate-to-liberal areas from Barrow’s district, turning what had been a slightly Democratic-leaning district into a modestly Republican one. So at least part of Barrow’s increasing independence from Obama can be chalked to a change in the policy preferences of the voters he represents. Our ruling The NRCC’s ad said, "John Barrow voted with Obama 85 percent of the time." Barrow did indeed vote with Obama 85 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact that is footnoted in the ad, albeit in small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Barrow’s voting record was much less closely aligned with Obama, bottoming out at 28 percent and 35 percent in the most recent years for which data is available. House Democratic leaders might consider scores like that to be short of "team behavior." The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06244	Says signers of recall petitions against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are at risk because of newly "discovered" provisions in state law.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/01/media-trackers/conservative-group-media-trackers-says-wisconsin-r/	Two days after the launch of a campaign to recall Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from office, a conservative group claimed it uncovered dangers in the signature gathering process. The warning was made in a Nov. 17, 2011 online article by Media Trackers, a suburban Milwaukee nonprofit that calls itself a conservative "watchdog dedicated to promoting accountability in the media and government across Wisconsin." The group is funded by American Majority, a Virginia-based organization founded by a tea party leader. Due to "a flaw in the security of the system (that) has been discovered," Media Trackers said in the article, "there are no privacy protections for those who sign a recall petition." The group also stated that people who circulate petitions don’t have to be credentialed, saying "someone could use the guise of the recall to gather information from complete strangers and then, with no intention of actually turning the petitions in, use that data to stalk individuals with the intent of carrying out a crime." So, Media Trackers is making two claims it says are newly discovered and pose a threat to recall petition signers: 1. People circulating recall petitions don’t have to be certified by a government agency and don’t have to register with the state. 2. People signing the petitions have "no privacy protections." There has been considerable confusion about the recall petition process. We recently rated a statement from Republican state Treasurer Kurt Schuller that recall petitions must be signed in the presence of another person as False. (State law says you can act as both the witness and the signer.) And there are other process-related statements we’re working on. What about the Media Trackers claims? Petition circulation Media Trackers communications director Brian Sikma, who wrote the article, acknowledged it has always been the case that people who gather signatures on recall petitions -- like those who circulate nomination papers for candidates -- don’t need certification and don’t need to register with the state. Sikma argued the non-credentialing is a newly discovered phenomenon because recalls are rare and this provision came to light only after recall elections were held for nine Wisconsin state senators in summer 2011. But that amounts to spin on Media Trackers’ part; the fact is, nothing in the law regarding people who circulate recall petitions has changed. Sikma said no credentialing makes it easy for people with motives other than recalling the governor -- such as committing a crime -- to circulate petitions. He argued that citizens don’t face the same risk when they are approached by people who are doing voter registration because they must be certified by local government officials. Similarly, he said, signers of a candidate’s nomination papers can generally be assured that people gathering those signatures are monitored by the candidate’s campaign. Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections and the recall process, said the fact that a person need only be qualified to vote in Wisconsin to circulate recall petitions is crucial. The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to redress government for grievances and the Wisconsin constitution grants them the right to bring a recall election, Magney said. "We don’t make people get certified to write letters to the editor. We don’t make them register with someone before they make and carry a sign," he said. "This is basic public involvement." So, despite Media Trackers’ claim, it’s not new that state law does not require credentialing of people who circulate recall petitions. And while it’s possible recall petition signers could be targeted for crime, Media Trackers provided nothing more than conjecture to back up that statement. Petition signers Media Trackers points out that the information signers put on the recall petitions -- their name, signature and the date they signed -- is open to the public with "no privacy protections." Again, Sikma acknowledged this is not a new provision, other than in the sense that until 2011 recalls had been rare in the state. (Prior to the 2011 Senate recalls, in which two incumbents were removed from office, only four Wisconsin state lawmakers had ever been recalled, two successfully. In the U.S., only two governors have been successfully recalled.) Sikma argued that passions run high in recall elections and signers are more vulnerable in that, by signing a recall petition, they are indicating a "political preference." That means recall opponents could target recall petition signers for mailings or perhaps harassment, Sikma said. During the run-up to the 2011 Senate recalls, we rated as True a claim by Republican Kim Simac that people who signed petitions to recall state Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, received phone calls they considered harassing from out-of-state telemarketers insinuating foul play by circulators. But passions can run high in regular elections, too, and a person who signs a candidate’s nomination papers is also indicating a political preference. Magney said that making the petition signer’s name, signature and address a public record is vital to an open process -- all citizens have the opportunity to review the signatures to determine whether enough valid signatures have been collected to hold a recall election. In the 2011 Senate recalls, the Government Accountability Board scanned all recall petitions and posted them on its website. The board plans to do the same if recall petitions are filed against Walker. So, the group is also misleading when it says it is newly discovered that there are "no privacy protections" for the limited information recall signers provide. There never have been. Our conclusion Media Trackers said recall petition signers are vulnerable to crime or harassment because of two newly discovered provisions in Wisconsin’s recall process. Neither provision is new, so it’s misleading to call them newly discovered. As for the risk to petition signers, Media Trackers provided no evidence that they have been victims of crime, although some have received phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers in the past. We rate Media Trackers’ statement Mostly False.	None	Media Trackers	None	None	None	2011-12-01T09:00:00	2011-11-17	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-05743	"Under President Obama, U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/02/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-under-president-obama-us-security-fund/	To defend President Barack Obama against Republican charges that he’s been a shaky ally of Israel -- and to lay the groundwork for a presidential speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in early March -- the Democratic National Committee released a Web advertisement on Feb. 29, 2012. Among the claims in the ad is this one: "Under President Obama, U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high." As we do with claims like this, we are splitting our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to credit Obama? First, the numbers. In its budget request for fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration requested $3.1 billion (the same amount cited in the ad) for foreign military financing for Israel. That’s higher than the $3.08 billion spent in fiscal 2012 and the $2.99 billion in fiscal 2011. It’s also higher than most -- though not all -- prior years, according to the Congressional Research Service. In 2000, military funding to Israel was slightly higher, at $3.12 billion. Meanwhile, if you take inflation into account, two years would surpass 2013. In 2000, the inflation-adjusted amount would be $4.11 billion, and in 2003, the inflation-adjusted amount would be $3.80 billion. What about Obama’s right to crow about it? The amount of military funding for Israel was set in August 2007 when the Bush administration signed a memorandum of understanding that created a funding framework for the next 10 years. This agreement was negotiated and signed by the administration of George W. Bush. It’s true that the Obama administration didn’t renege on the agreement, which it theoretically could have done, perhaps by citing severe constraints in the federal budget. And more broadly, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates testified to the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee on March 2, 2011, that "in terms of concrete steps to improve the security relationship between (the U.S. and Israel), more has been done in the last two years than in any comparable period in my entire career." Gates has served in several administrations, both Republican and Democratic. Still, it’s an overreach for the DNC to give Obama credit for a number that was essentially set a year and a half before he took the oath of office. Our ruling The ad says "U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high." Actually, it was higher in one or two years, depending whether you use inflation-adjusted dollars. In addition, the ad oversells the credit Obama can take for this year’s number. The amount was outlined by a memorandum signed in 2007 under President George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2012-03-02T15:57:56	2012-02-29	['United_States', 'Israel', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-00237	"2.4 million people in Wisconsin have pre-existing conditions" and Leah Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/08/tammy-baldwin/does-leah-vukmir-support-letting-insurers-deny-cov/	Ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin has been hitting Republican challenger Leah Vukmir for months on a key issue: Insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. One attack comes in a TV ad released Sept. 20, 2018. Using a nurse who had breast cancer as the speaker, Baldwin makes a two-part claim: 2.4 million Wisconsin residents have a pre-existing condition Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions" Vukmir took the unusual step of rebutting the ad by posting a letter to the nurse on Twitter. All of this is tied to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions — something that is threatened by Republican efforts, which are supported by Vukmir, to repeal the law. So, let’s check both parts of Baldwin’s claim. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. 1. 2.4 million The higher the number it is that Baldwin chooses is significant, because it would mean that many more people are potentially vulnerable if the second part of her claim is true. One of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act is its requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions. That is, if you don’t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can’t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition. Before Obamacare, insurers typically used medical underwriting — evaluating the health status, health history and other risk factors of an applicant — to determine whether to deny a person coverage. Even for people they did accept, insurers could carve out coverage of any specific pre-existing conditions, as well as charge people with health problems higher premiums. To back Baldwin’s 2.4 million people figure, her campaign pointed us to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. But this is a broad count. It includes not only people who could be denied insurance coverage — which is what Baldwin highlights in the TV ad — but also people who could buy coverage but be charged more because of a pre-existing condition. In contrast, the latest estimate by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the gold-standard sources on health care, is based on the number of people in Wisconsin who had health conditions that likely would have left them uninsurable before the Affordable Care Act. That estimate is much smaller: 852,000. So, there is a basis for Baldwin’s 2.4 million figure. But it’s misleadingly high in the context of the second part of her statement. 2. Vukmir’s position It is worth noting, that if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, it’s possible premiums for some people with pre-existing conditions could be so high as to make insurance virtually unaffordable. Vukmir has not specifically said that insurers should be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said people with pre-existing conditions should be covered. But she has been vague on how that would happen. She has proposed "allowing insurers to offer a wider variety of plans" and enabling people to buy insurance across state lines. When Baldwin’s ad says Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions," a footnote on the screen refers to three news stories, but only one that mentions Vukmir. That story, by the Wisconsin State Journal, reported how Vukmir wants to fully repeal Obamacare — which would mean also eliminating its guarantee against insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The story also notes that Vukmir has supported GOP repeal bills in Congress that would weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For example, she praised the GOP’s American Health Care Act. It would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance -- but it would have dropped Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged. And the story reports that Vukmir supports returning to what Wisconsin offered before Obamacare — a publicly-subsidized high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions who couldn’t get insurance. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place — and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. In responding to Baldwin’s TV ad, Vukmir’s campaign pointed to a news release it issued in which Vukmir alludes to the high-risk pools, saying Wisconsin "had solutions for those with pre-existing conditions before it was cool to take care of people with pre-existing conditions." But the release didn’t offer more specifics on how they would be covered. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool existed specifically because insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Moreover, the pool, unlike Obamacare, did not provide coverage for everyone who couldn’t get coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Our rating Baldwin said "2.4 million people in Wisconsin have pre-existing conditions" and Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions." There is some basis for the first part of Baldwin’s statement. One estimate puts the number of at 2.4 million — but those that could be denied health insurance coverage because of a condition is estimated to be much smaller, 852,000. On the second part of Baldwin’s statement, Vukmir has indicated that high-risk pools are a solution for covering people with pre-existing conditions. But those were in place because -- before the Affordable Care Act, which Vukmir wants to repeal -- insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. And Wisconsin’s high-risk pool covered only a fraction of people with pre-existing conditions. That being said, Vukmir has not specifically said she supports allowing insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said those should be covered — even if she has been vague about how that would happen. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Baldwin a Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-10-08T16:47:06	2018-09-20	['Wisconsin']

pomt-07825	A proposed immigration bill will "bankrupt Georgia" if passed.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/16/libertarian-party-georgia/libertarians-claim-get-tough-immigration-bill-will/	The war of words on immigration has grown high-pitched, and a recent warning from Georgia Libertarians is no exception. "The Libertarian Party of Georgia Says Immigration Bill Will Bankrupt Georgia," began a news release condemning the "Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011," or House Bill 87, which broadens the role state and local government play policing illegal immigration. The cost to enforce it would be "huge," the release said. Its economic effects "catastrophic." Would it? State Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Republican from Peachtree City, is lead sponsor of the wide-ranging legislation. It would allow legal residents to sue if they think an agency is not adequately enforcing state immigration law; ban transporting, harboring or enticing an illegal immigrant to enter the state; authorize an officer to check a suspect’s legal status if there is "reasonable suspicion" that he is here illegally; and require businesses with more than five employees to use the federal E-Verify system to ensure their workers are legal residents. Some portions resemble Arizona’s HB 1070, which critics say encourages racial profiling and infringes on federal authority. The U.S. Department of Justice and civil rights groups are suing Arizona over the 2010 legislation, and major cities and organizations boycotted the state. We asked Brett Bittner, executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia, for evidence to back his claim about Georgia’s legislation. He did not have specific costs but said Ramsey’s bill "grows the size of government." Lawsuits challenging its constitutionality could be costly, Bittner said. Plus, the provision that would allow individuals to sue agencies over enforcement could spawn frivolous suits. "We’re not sure of the costs, and Representative Ramsey hasn’t provided any of the costs," Bittner said. Indeed, Ramsey didn’t have an estimate. So PolitiFact Georgia dug up cost estimates for Arizona and states considering similar legislation and looked at an existing program for guidance. We found that estimates are extremely limited. Arizona’s costs for certain HB 1070 provisions are unknown because a federal judge temporarily blocked their implementation. We also found that the impact is so complex that it is difficult to predict. For instance, if illegal immigrants and their families leave Georgia because of the legislation, state government would no longer have to subsidize their children’s health care or education, advocates for lower immigration levels noted. But illegal immigrants would no longer buy goods or services or work here, which could lower tax revenue and weaken the economy, critics of the legislation told PolitiFact. Most research, though limited, concludes tax revenue generated by all immigrants exceeds the cost of the services they use, the Congressional Budget Office said in 2007. HB 87 could save money. Gwinnett County is part of the federal 287(g) program, which allows state or local law enforcement agencies to enforce certain immigration laws. Its sheriff said this program lowered its foreign-born jail population in its first year, saving between $386,010 and $2.1 million. Program staffing cost $1.2 million. A January study on 287(g) said those local costs shift to the federal government. If one cost is almost certain, it’s legal bills. Arizona’s total is $1.5 million as of early this month, and its governor is using donations to pay them. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia plans to sue if HB 87 passes as written. Another potential cost is from lost convention business from boycotts. Roughly three months after HB 1070’s passage, Arizona’s Hotel and Lodging Association said at least 40 group meetings were canceled, costing $12 million in revenue, excluding restaurant, retailer or rental car company losses. The progressive Center for American Progress estimated a total loss of about $141 million. This translates to $9.4 million in lost tax revenue. Estimates by other states for their own Arizona-style legislation also hint at potential Georgia costs. The Kentucky Legislature is considering a bill that could cost $40 million a year despite savings on services for illegal immigrants who leave. A Utah bill could cost local governments between $5.3 million and $11.3 million yearly. Ramsey argued that those bills are so different their estimates may not apply to HB 87. Indeed, Kentucky’s bill, unlike HB 87, makes crossing state lines as an illegal immigrant a crime. Arrests, and therefore costs, could be higher. Still, Georgia’s bill contains provisions that on their face appear pricey. The provision that would allow local law enforcement agencies to check immigration status would likely cost money to transport illegal immigrants to federal facilities and train officers. The bill would let residents sue state and local agencies for inadequate enforcement, which could result in big legal bills. Ramsey said he is revising the bill to address this. To sum up: While there’s no evidence to show the legislation would have "huge" and "catastrophic" effects, there is enough to be concerned that HB 87 could have significant costs. Whether the bill would save money down the road is unclear. Regardless, Georgia’s budget is about $18 billion. And while the potential costs could strain the state’s already tight budget, it’s extremely unlikely they would bankrupt the state. Georgia Libertarians’ alarmist statement that the bill "will bankrupt Georgia" is therefore False.	None	Libertarian Party of Georgia	None	None	None	2011-02-16T06:00:00	2011-01-31	['None']

pomt-12725	"I’ve given the religious schools in my budget more money than ever before in history."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/06/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-budget-includes-more-money-private-schools-/	The money religious elementary and high schools receive from New York state is at an all-time high, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says. Cuomo made the claim at a student rally for the Orthodox Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of the Orthodox Jewish community. The group brought hundreds of students to the state capital to call for more state investment in private schools. "My opinion is I aggressively support the religious schools," Cuomo said. "My budget reflects that. I’ve given the religious schools in my budget more money than ever before in history. We did that last year, and we’ll do it again this year." Cuomo sounded a different note in February at a rally in Buffalo. "We don’t subsidize private high schools," Cuomo said. "We have public high schools. If you want to go to a private high school, you go to a private high school." So, which is it? Is the state giving more money to religious schools than ever before? Aid for private schools State lawmakers approved close to $192 million for non-public school in last year’s budget. The largest aid category reimburses schools for the costs of state mandates, like administering state tests and reporting data. That cost the state $104 million last year. The second largest program reimburses the schools for the cost of taking attendance throughout the school day as students change classes. Last year’s budget gave private schools close to $70 million for this cost. The state also provided significant aid for school safety equipment at non-public schools in recent years, starting in 2013. Non-public schools received $15 million last year, triple the amount given in 2013. The state provides $922,000 annually for additional academic support services for struggling students in non-public schools. That amount has remained steady since 2010. Private schools were also given $2 million last year to support the state Office of Religious and Independent Schools in the state Education Department. Budget numbers The most money the state gave to private schools before Cuomo took office totaled $128.4 million in the 2007-2008 budget under then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, according to the state Division of Budget. That aid dropped to about $110 million in 2010, the year Cuomo was elected. The aid fell to $101.3 million in Cuomo's first budget. Since then, state aid to private schools has almost doubled. Cuomo this year proposes another increase to $197.7 million in base aid for private schools. He proposes an extra $30 million in back payments for the cost of taking attendance, bringing his requested total aid to about $228 million. The state said it would start reimbursing private schools for attendance costs in 2004 but didn’t set aside funding for the program until the 2007-2008 budget. Cuomo’s plan gives these schools $30 million in this year’s budget, with a plan for $30 million more next year to correct the lag. Cuomo recently announced a proposal to give an additional $10 million to non-public schools for security costs, over the $15 million already included in his proposed budget. That addition would raise state spending to $238 million for private schools. The state spending per non-public student has also increased since Cuomo took office. The state spent about $218 per non-public student in Cuomo’s first budget. The per-student figure was $374 in the past school year. The state spends $9,330 per public school student on average. Non-religious private schools Most private schools in New York are affiliated with a religion, but some are not. In the 2015-2016 school year, about 459,000 students attended 1,752 private schools in New York according to data from the state Education Department. Close to 89,000, or about 19 percent of those students attended 495 schools not affiliated with a religion. The state Division of Budget does not track separate data on aid given to religious versus independent non-public schools. Our ruling "I’ve given the religious schools in my budget more money than ever before in history," Cuomo says. Numbers from the state Division of Budget agree with Cuomo’s claim. He proposes more money for non-public schools in his budget this year than the state has ever before. Granted, not all private schools are religious. About one out of every five private students attend an independent non-public school. But we found no indication the state is treating religious schools differently than the non-religious private schools, so we rate his claim True.

pomt-15267	"Forty percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/29/marco-rubio/rubio-says-40-percent-illegal-immigrants-are-overs/	Sen. Marco Rubio said that while people sneaking into the United States is a legitimate problem, the immigration system is so broken that almost half of all illegal immigrants came into the country through legal channels. "We have a porous border, meaning not just the border with Mexico, but 40 percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas," he said on Fox & Friends on July 22, 2015. If that’s a stat that sounds familiar, it’s because Rubio has said it before -- including during his 2010 Senate campaign. Former Gov. Jeb Bush has cited the number, too. But is it true that 40 percent of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas? It turns out that we hear the figure so often because it’s the most commonly accepted estimate, although it’s getting a little long in the tooth. An old problem We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s office when we tried to contact them, but in all likelihood he was referring to a calculation done by the Pew Research Center, an independent "fact tank" that doesn’t take policy positions. In a 2006 report, Pew estimated that "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." While the source data gave an estimate that ranged from 33 percent to 50 percent, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. That report relied on a 1997 study from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. While trying to ascertain how many immigrants arrived and departed, INS concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 report, told PolitiFact that immigration trends had changed over the years. Since 2008, there are more immigrants overstaying their visas than crossing the border illegally, but there are fewer illegal immigrants in the country overall. The generally agreed upon total of illegal immigrants in the United States now is about 11 million, down from a high of 12 million in 2007. But Warren, currently a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, said the percentage of all overstays "had been consistent over the past 30 years." Most people crossing the border illegally come from about a half-dozen countries, especially Mexico, he said. Unauthorized immigrants from all other countries are almost all overstays. There have been other estimates of overstays: In January 2003, INS released an updated report that said 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, gave estimates on visa overstays ranging from 27 percent to 31 percent to 57 percent. But no one has truly updated those estimates since then, mostly because there is no data available from which to draw new conclusions, the Migration Policy Institute’s Marc Rosenblum said. He said Homeland Security developed a methodology for estimating visa overstayers among people traveling by air and sea, but doesn’t have an official way to count people entering by land. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman confirmed to us that they have not recently released statistics on the number of overstays. Rosenblum said for now the old estimates are the best ones available. Homeland Security has promised Congress it would compile new data, he said, but no results have been made public. Until then, there’s no research that would truly dispute Rubio’s claim. "The short answer is that no reliable estimate has been published since the Pew study," Rosenblum said. Our ruling Rubio said "40 percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas." This widely cited statistic is an estimate based on research that has roots going back to the 1990s. But because federal agencies haven’t provided new data, there’s little for analysts to use to provide an updated figure. Experts (including the demographer who created the initial estimate) told us that while illegal immigration trends have changed over the years, 40 percent can still be considered an acceptable estimate.

pomt-04664	Says the Republican Party platform says "pull back even more of the rules on campaign finance reform, get rid of McCain-Feingold" while the Democratic Party platform says "we want to find a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/09/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-views-campaign-finance-reform-hig/	The nation’s two prominent political parties rolled out their priorities in separate conventions during the past two weeks. The day after delivering his party’s vision for the country at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Newark Mayor Cory Booker again tried to distinguish the differences between Democrats and Republicans. "To me no side has a monopoly on good ideas, but when I look at this platform in many ways it's gotten a lot more extreme than even past Republican platforms and that's very disturbing to me. But more importantly I want to bring light to that and I want the nation to see, look at the actual policies that each of these parties stand for and decide which you want," Booker said in a Sept. 5 interview with #waywire, a news and video aggregation site that the mayor co-founded. "Take campaign finance reform for crying out loud, I mean this is incredible. This platform says pull back even more of the rules on campaign finance reform, get rid of McCain-Feingold," Booker, a co-chair on the Democratic platform committee, said. "This platform says well, wait a minute, we're out of control right now with all this super PAC money, we want to find a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform so that money doesn't speak louder than people. And so that to me is very dramatic." Do the two parties’ stances on campaign finance diverge as far as Booker claimed? A spokeswoman for Booker did not respond to an e-mail, but the documents show the Democratic mayor was on target. When Booker mentions McCain-Feingold, he is referring to a campaign finance law -- formally called the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act -- that was sponsored by Sens. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. The law, which passed in 2002, made a number of changes to campaign finance, including banning corporations and unions from funding ads that mention a specific candidate during the 30 days before a primary or the 60 days before a general election. Two years ago the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that provision of the law in its Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision. The Supreme Court also went a step further in that decision, saying political spending is free speech protected by the First Amendment and that the federal government may not limit expenditures by corporations or unions during campaigns. Still other parts of the McCain-Feingold law -- such as a prohibition on national political parties from accepting unlimited amounts of contributions known as "soft money" -- remain intact. But Booker said the Republican party platform calls for dismantling what is left of the law. That’s true. The document outlining the priorities of the Republican party specifically states, "we support repeal of the remaining sections of McCain-Feingold." The GOP platform also calls for raising or repealing contribution limits and opposes any legislation designed to curtail the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case. On the other hand, Booker said his party’s platform calls for "a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform" and the document outlining Democratic priorities explicitly calls for more regulation. "We support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary. We support legislation to close loopholes and require greater disclosure of campaign spending," the Democratic platform says. Our ruling Booker said that the Republican party platform says "pull back even more of the rules on campaign finance reform, get rid of McCain-Feingold" while the Democratic party platform says "we want to find a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform." Booker is right about the gulf between Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance. The GOP platform states: "we support repeal of the remaining sections of McCain- Feingold." The Democratic platform says: "we support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary." That’s straightforward enough for us. We rate this statement True.

pomt-08942	"Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges" against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/23/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-blames-obama-administration-not-pursu/	For several weeks, Fox News pundits have been hammering the Obama administration for its handling of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case. The gist of the argument is that the Obama administration backed off a slam-dunk case because it has no stomach for going after minorities for civil rights violations. At issue is an incident on Nov. 4, 2008 -- the day of the presidential election -- when New Black Pather Party members Jerry Jackson and King Samir Shabazz stood outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in black military-style uniforms. Shabazz held a nightstick, and the two men were accused of making intimidating remarks to both white and black voters. Be one of the 1.5 million people to view the video on YouTube by clicking here. In the video, the men are asking a camera man why he is taping them. On January 7, 2009, a couple weeks before Obama took office, the Department of Justice filed a civil action in federal court accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, of engaging in voter intimidation. Although none of the defendants responded to the complaint, the Department decided last year to drop its case against all but King Samir Shabazz, the one with the nightstick. The department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Many Fox News pundits decried the government's position as outrageously lenient, and evidence of an Obama administration double standard on race issues. On July 6, 2010, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly asked Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl whether the Justice Department should have prosecuted the Panthers. "Of course," Wiehl said. "I mean, there's absolutely no reason. Just take a look at the video that they didn't prosecute. And it's interesting you use the word prosecute, because all that the department did was file a civil complaint, which they won by default judgment. They dropped that afterwards, because, oh, one of the Black Panthers has said, oh, I'm not going to show up for three years at that particular polling area with a night stick. And that's all they wanted. They never pursued criminal charges, Bill. And they could have done that." "Okay, but you say they should have done that?" O'Reilly asked. "Oh, absolutely," Wiehl said. Later, OReilly asked Fox News legal analyst Kimberly Guilfoyle if the matter should have been prosecuted. "You've got a video," Guilfoyle said. "Yes, they absolutely should have proceeded full on this case...I have to tell you, this bothers me because I believe that they are not being race neutral in their enforcement of the Voting Rights Act." O'Reilly expanded on this point very clearly in a July 19, 2010, column. "If it were just about the Panthers, the story would be meaningless," O'Reilly wrote. "But because Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges, the situation takes on some importance." We're fact-checking the claim that the Obama administration made the call not to pursue a criminal civil rights case against the New Black Panther Party, because we think the answer puts the entire issue into a clearer context. Let's take a walk through the timeline to see who decided what and when. The 2008 election day incident was reported in the media immediately, and the Department of Justice decided to investigate. Officials weighed a number of prosecution options -- both criminal and civil. On Jan. 7, 2009, the Bush Administration Justice Department announced that it filed a civil lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members. Specifically, they were alleged to have violated Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits intimidation, coercion or threats against "any person for voting or attempting to vote." The aims of the lawsuit were fairly limited: "The Department seeks an injunction preventing any future deployment of, or display of weapons by, New Black Panther Party members at the entrance to polling locations." In other words, the aim was to make sure they didn't do something similar again in the future. This section of the law does not subject violators to criminal penalties (fines or jail time, for example). The Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, which handles all racially motivated voter intimidation offenses, determined that "the facts did not constitute a prosecutable violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes," according to testimony provided by Thomas E. Perez , Assistant Attorney General, on May 14, 2010. Justice spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler confirmed to PolitiFact that that determination not to file criminal charges was made prior to the filing of the civil case. In other words, the decision not to pursue criminal charges was made by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division prior to the Obama administration. Perez also noted, "In July 2009, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declined prosecution in the matter. Our understanding is that local law enforcement officials also declined to pursue state criminal charges." Again, none of the defendants responded to the civil complaint, so it's fair to say this was a slam-dunk case for the prosecution. But according to Perez, "that did not absolve the Department of its legal and ethical obligations to ensure that any relief sought was consistent with the law and supported by the evidence." And upon deeper review, the Justice Department decided to dismiss the cases against the New Black Panther Party, its leader Malik Shabazz, and Jackson (the guy without the nightstick at the polling place that day). In order to have violated the statute in question, the New Black Panther Party (which is not affiliated with the original Black Panther Party) would have had to "direct a campaign of intimidation," and Perez noted that while the organization had posted a notice that 300 members of the party would be deployed at polling places on election day, the Philadelphia location where King Samir Shabazz was stationed was the only one where an incident occurred. Perez further noted that the group posted a message on its website -- prior to the civil action being filed -- which stated, "Specifically, in the case of Philadelphia, the New Black Panther Party wishes to express that the actions of people purported to be members do not represent the official views of the New Black Panther Party and are not connected nor in keeping with our official position as a party." The Justice Department, did, however, follow through with its case against King Samir Shabazz, concluding that his display of a nightstick at the polling place "supported the allegation of voter intimidation." The Department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Some may say the government was too lenient, that the case should not have been dropped against the three other defendants, or that the injunction against Shabazz should have extended nationwide -- not just in Philadelphia -- and for a much longer time (not just until 2012). Those decisions were made during the Obama administration. But the pundits have often blurred the distinction between the civil and criminal cases. O'Reilly and other Fox commentators have confused the issue by suggesting Holder and the Obama administration made the call not to pursue more serious charges against the New Black Panther Party members. Perez stated that the Civil Rights Division decided pre-Obama not to pursue more serious, criminal charges. So when O'Reilly brings on legal analysts who paint it as an outrage that the Justice Department did not pursue a criminal case, and the only person condemned by O'Reilly is Holder for not "representing the United States in a fair and balanced way," that's misleading and misplaced. We think it's fair to hold Holder accountable for the decision to limit the civil case, but not the criminal one. We rate O'Reilly's statement False.

pomt-05461	"One out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/23/tavis-smiley/tavis-smiley-says-one-out-two-americans-are-living/	On the April 22, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley appeared alongside Cornel West, a professor at Princeton University and Union Theological Seminary, to discuss the book they co-wrote, The Rich And The Rest Of Us: A Poverty Manifesto. Host Bob Schieffer kicked off the conversation about poverty in America by asking, "How bad is it, Tavis?" Smiley responded, "It's horrible when one out of two Americans, Bob, are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us, are wrestling with this issue." A reader asked us if this was accurate, so we took a look. We first turned to the official poverty statistics, which are collected by the Census Bureau. According to the most recent figures -- for 2010 -- 15.1 percent of Americans, or about 46 million people, are officially in poverty. That’s far below both the percentage and the raw number Smiley offered on television. However, Smiley did say "in or near poverty," so we checked that, too. The Census Bureau found that 104 million people are living at at twice the poverty level, or 33.9 percent of the population. That’s still short of the levels Smiley cited. In fact, the national median household income for 2010 was $49,445. By comparison, a non-elderly household with two adults and one child would be at the poverty level if it had income of $15,030. To be "in or near poverty" according to Smiley's formulation would mean being about 3.3 times the official poverty level. Calling those who are up to 300 percent of the poverty level near-poor "is a stretch," said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Michael Wiseman, a George Washington University economist, agreed, saying that "‘near poverty" is generally interpreted as having an income less than twice the poverty standard. … I know of no country in which all persons with incomes less than the median are considered poor or near-poor. Would this mean that all persons with incomes above the median should be considered rich or near-rich?" There is one Census Bureau measure that supports Smiley’s claim -- an unofficial one. Currently, poverty is measured by establishing a set of multiple income thresholds for families of different sizes and compositions, then comparing family incomes to those levels. Being in poverty means that you that have an income below the threshold for your family type. But for years, scholars have debated whether there is a better way to measure poverty than the official statistic. One of the efforts to test an alternative measurement is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, or SPM. The SPM doesn’t just consider cash earned but also in-kind transfers such as food stamps, net taxes paid, and medical and work-related expenses, such as child care and commuting costs, wrote University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Nancy Folbre in a New York Times blog post. It also employs a "new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend," she wrote. In 2010, a federal interagency working group gave a green light to calculating the statistic, but only as long as the long-standing poverty calculation retained its official status. The SPM "will be an additional macroeconomic statistic providing further understanding of economic conditions and trends," the Census Bureau wrote. In November 2011, the Census Bureau released an official report with SPM data for 2010. The poverty rate reported by the SPM was only a percentage point higher than the official rate, though different sub-groups fared differently. (Because of how the SPM is calculated, it showed lower poverty rates among children and higher rates among senior citizens.) The important point for Smiley’s claim is that the SPM report found that just under 48 percent of the population had incomes at twice the poverty level or below -- a number in tune with Smiley’s claim that "one out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty." When we reached Smiley, he said that his claim on Face the Nation stemmed from the very first footnote of his and West’s book -- a CBS News report headlined "Census data: Half of U.S. poor or low income." A look at the CBS report confirmed that the number being cited was from the SPM, not the traditional poverty measure. So Smiley has support for his number from Census Bureau statistics. However, in the context of a fast-paced television interview, some nuance got lost. The statistic has not been received neutrally, said Douglas Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland who specializes in children and poverty. He said that "liberals like" the SPM while "conservatives dislike" it. Given the nature of the statistic as new and unofficial, economists we interviewed agreed that it would have been more appropriate if Smiley had specified that he was using an alternative measure. Otherwise, viewers would think he’s talking about official poverty statistics. "It strikes me as a very, very good idea to make clear to listeners when one is citing this new measure," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute agreed. "If someone wants to use the alternate measure, I think they should be clear that it’s not the official poverty line they’re using," he said. Our ruling The Census Bureau has produced a number that supports Smiley’s claim that "one out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us."

pomt-12032	San Francisco and Takoma Park, Md., are "allowing illegals to vote."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/sep/15/adam-putnam/san-francisco-takoma-park-noncitizens-elections/	Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam asked his Twitter followers if voting practices in San Francisco and Takoma Park, Md., are fair to American citizens since they allow noncitizens to participate. "San Fran & Takoma Park have been overrun by liberals. They’re allowing illegals to vote. Is this fair to Americans?" Putnam, a Republican who is running for governor, tweeted Aug. 30. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Putnam’s tweet caught our attention given the broader false claims from President Donald Trump and others that millions of immigrants in the country illegally fraudulently voted in the 2016 presidential election. Was Putnam correct about San Francisco and Takoma Park "allowing illegals to vote"? Starting in the 2018 November elections, noncitizens in San Francisco will be allowed to vote for board of education members. Takoma Park in 1992 adopted a measure permitting noncitizens to vote in city elections. But noncitizens in those cities cannot vote in other elections, a notable distinction not clear in Putnam’s tweet. San Francisco’s Proposition N and Takoma Park’s 1992 charter amendment In the November 2016 election, San Francisco voted in favor of Proposition N, which asked if the city should allow noncitizen residents of San Francisco who are of legal voting age, not in prison or on parole for a felony conviction, and the parent, legal guardian or legally recognized caregiver of a child living in the San Francisco Unified School District to vote for Board of Education members. The approved measure is set to apply to the elections in 2018, 2020 and 2022. It’s slated to expire after the 2022 election unless it’s extended by ordinance, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections. The San Francisco elections department did not provide comment in reaction to Putnam’s tweet, but Takoma Park told us his message was a "mischaracterization" of its voting policy. "It's clear that Mr. Putnam's social media posts were sent to cause a knee-jerk reaction and fails to accurately describe what our City Charter does," said Jeremy Dickey, Takoma Park city spokesman. "He chose not to attack the fact that Takoma Park also allows 16-year-olds to vote, because that would not have fit his narrative." A charter amendment resolution adopted in 1992 removed the citizenship requirement for voting in Takoma Park for the election of the city’s mayor and six council members, Dickey said. "Takoma Park strives to be a welcoming community for all, and that means allowing people who live in our City to have their voices heard, regardless of citizenship status," Dickey added. But the right doesn’t extend to federal office. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 states it’s unlawful for noncitizens to vote for candidates seeking federal offices, such as the presidency or a seat in Congress. But it’s not illegal for noncitizens to vote for local offices if it’s allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance. Experts say Putnam’s tweet is misleading We asked voting and elections experts for feedback on Putnam’s claim. They said his message left the impression that noncitizens are allowed to vote in all types of elections. Voting rights granted to noncitizens in Takoma Park and San Francisco "are limited to local office, not a blanket right to vote for all governmental offices," said Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud. "These cities are allowing noncitizens to vote in elections, but the lack of clarity about which elections is misleading and in context with Trump's unsubstantiated claims of millions of illegal votes in the presidential election, Putnam's overly broad claim creates confusion and detracts from the ability for the public to assess whether noncitizens should be given limited voting access," said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. The replies to Putnam’s post show the confusion among some people who saw it. "Per Constitution only citizens can vote," one person responded. "Illegal Voting? If allowed, we lose all form of control in this country. Let's let taxpayers vote. Become Legal & Vote," wrote another. Even though some localities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, noncitizen voting in the United States is rare, said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. And the actual number of noncitizens who vote in local elections is relatively small, said Joshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law and voting rights. Douglas wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post noting that noncitizen voting has a storied history in America and used to be more commonplace than it is now. "The intent of these new laws is not to allow illegal aliens to vote but to give legal noncitizens, also called legal permanent residents, a say in local affairs," Douglas said. "In fact, even if the text of the law technically allows illegal aliens to vote, it seems highly unlikely that they would register with the city (thereby giving government officials precise info on their citizenship status) so as to vote." It's worth noting that a noncitizen isn't just someone who is in the country illegally. That classification also extends to individuals who are in the country on visas or who are lawful permanent residents. Putnam’s response Putnam’s tweet was expanded on in an op-ed published by multiple Florida publications, his website also posted the op-ed and a link to it was posted on Facebook and Twitter before the tweet about San Francisco and Takoma Park, his office said. The tweet about San Francisco and Takoma Park did not include a link to the editorial, but to a form and poll on Putnam’s website that required individuals to submit their email address along with a "No" or "Yes" answer to the question "Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed To Vote?" Politicians use polls like these to collect personal information about voters to target with advertising, or to raise funds. Putnam’s op-ed said voting is an American right that must be protected and "not minimize the value of it by allowing noncitizens the same right." It criticizes so-called sanctuary cities and adds that some cities "have taken it a step further." "Not only are they allowing violent illegal aliens to remain within their boundaries without the threat of getting caught, but some cities are going so far as to grant illegal aliens the right to vote in America," said the Aug. 29 op-ed. Cities like San Francisco and College Park, Md., "have lost their American values, and have been overrun by liberals. They have forgotten the principles our nation was founded on – the right for American citizens to choose our leaders – in granting foreigners who violated our laws to come to our country the right to shape our country’s future through voting," Putnam wrote. College Park was still considering the issue when Putnam's editorial published. (College Park officials initially said the measure passed, but they later clarified that it actually failed. They said it did not receive the necessary number of affirmative votes as required by state law.) National media outlets have reported on a "growing trend of liberal cities, including Takoma Park and San Francisco, allowing illegal immigrants to vote," said Amanda Bevis, spokeswoman for Putnam. "Adam Putnam will not let that happen in Florida. Illegal immigrants violated our laws to come to America, and these cities are granting those very people the right to vote," Bevis added. "The actions by these cities completely undermine the value of voting in America that so many others work so hard to earn." Our ruling Putnam said, San Francisco and Takoma Park are "allowing illegals to vote." In the November 2016 elections, San Francisco voted to allow noncitizens to vote for board of education members starting in the 2018 election. Takoma Park adopted a measure in 1992 to allow noncitizens to vote for mayor and city council members. Neither of the measures allow noncitizens to vote for candidates seeking other offices. Federal law allows noncitizens to vote in local elections if their municipalities allow it. Putnam's tweet leaves the impression that the cities give noncitizens broader voting power and that’s not the case. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00651	State legislators "quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building" in 2013.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/may/18/alex-mcmurtrie-jr/alex-mcmurtrie-says-va-lawmakers-shifted-2-billion/	Alex McMurtrie Jr. is billing himself as the "education candidate" in his bid to win a three-way Democratic primary June 9 for the state Senate seat that’s been long held by John Watkins, R-Powhatan. On his campaign website, McMurtrie laments, "Too many Democratic and GOP legislators along with lobbyists quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building." He calls that decision "wrong," saying, "Education trumps developers and special interests. We must put our children first." McMurtrie made a similar claim in a campaign flier he mailed earlier this month. It contains pictures of former Democratic governors Chuck Robb, Doug Wilder and Tim Kaine. "They would NEVER shift potentially BILLIONS from education to road building," the flier states underneath the photos. "But in 2013 too many Democrats and Republicans did." At the request of a reader, we looked into McMurtrie’s claim about the multi-billion dollar transfer from schools to roads. McMurtrie’s campaign notified us on Twitter that the candidate’s source was a Feb. 23, 2013, article in The Washington Post about a sweeping transportation bill the General Assembly had just approved. The measure was signed six weeks later by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell. It was projected to raise $3.4 billion for state transportation during the next five years through a series of tax increases and budgeting steps. Lawmakers replaced a 17.5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax -- which had not changed since 1987 -- with a 3.5 percent wholesale levy on gas that would keep pace with inflation. They also increased taxes on motor vehicle sales and for obtaining a driver’s licenses. But the key to McMurtrie’s claim lies in changes that were made to the state’s general sales tax. Since 1987, the levy had been 5 cents on the dollar. Of that nickel, 3.5 cents went to the state’s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs. One penny went to local governments and a half-cent was earmarked for transportation. The legislation raised the sales tax to 5.3 percent and gave all of the increase to transportation. In addition, the bill provisionally took a small share of the existing sales tax revenues that went to the general fund and redirected it to highway maintenance. At most, 0.175 cents on the dollar would be diverted to transportation, phased in over five years. That switch, when completed in 2018, would generate $198 million a year for transportation. The general fund’s share of the sales tax would fall from 3.5 cents on a dollar to 3.325 cents. The Post, in its article, accurately wrote that the bill devoted "a fatter slice of existing revenues to transportation instead of schools, public safety and other services." McMurtrie, however, takes liberty with the Post article. He assumes that all of the general funds being moved to transportation will be stripped from education when, in fact, public schools traditionally receive about one-third of the fund. Then he takes the full $198 million general transfer in 2018 and multiplies it by 10 to reach a conclusion that, over a decade, the loss of education money will total $2 billion. There’s another fundamental problem. The Post article, on which McMutrie bases his claims, is more than two years old. The provisions of the sales tax transfer have changed, making all of McMurtrie’s numbers outdated and even more inflated. Here’s why: The 2013 bill assumed that Congress would pass legislation to help states collect taxes on goods bought through the Internet. Virginia’s new proceeds -- about $180 million a year -- would be earmarked for transportation. Congress demurred, however, and a backup plan in the state transportation bill went into effect at the start of this year that reduced the potential loss for public schools. Under Plan B, only 0.1 cent of the sales tax that once went to the general fund is being shifted to transportation -- now and in the future. That comes to about $113 million a year, according to the Department of Planning and Budget. What’s the likely impact on education? Let’s do the math: Public schools, as we noted, receive about one-third of general fund revenues. Assuming that trend holds up, about $38 million a year that would have gone to schools will be sent to transportation. Over 10 years, as McMurtrie likes to calculate, it would come to $380 million. For perspective, schools are slated to receive nearly $6.5 billion in state funding during the budget year that will start on July 1. A $38 million transfer would come 0.6 percent of the funding. There’s one last point to address: McMurtrie’s contention that lawmakers and lobbyists "quietly shifted" the money from education. The General Assembly publicly debated the transportation bill. Newspapers, including the Richmond Times-Dispatch, reported extensively on it in 2013, often on the front page. Our ruling McMurtrie says legislators "quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building" in 2013. He backs his statement with hyper-inflated numbers multiplied over a 10-year period and a contorted interpretation of a newspaper article. An outdated provision in the bill McMurtrie refers to would have transferred $198 million a from the general fund to transportation. McMurtrie assumes all of that money would have been stripped from public schools when, in fact, the general fund also supports public safety and health programs. About one-third of the fund pays for education, so the hit to schools likely would have been around $66 million a year, or $660 million over a decade. The updated provision in the bill, ignored by McMurtrie, will shift $113 million from the general fund to transportation. If budgeting practices hold up, that should mean about a $38 million annual hit to education, or $380 million over 10 years. Either way, McMurtrie’s claim of a $2 billion raid on education doesn’t hold up. Nor does his subsequent claim that the bill "potentially" took billions from schools. And the legislature’s public debate on the bill, amplified by extensive media coverage, dissolves McMurtrie’s claim that lawmakers "quietly" shifted education dollars.

pomt-11777	Says Alabama Senate candidate Doug Jones "wants to raise taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-doug-jones-wants-raise/	President Donald Trump waded into Alabama’s Senate race to blast Democratic challenger Doug Jones as a tax-happy puppet of the liberal establishment. Rather than fully embrace the controversial Republican nominee Roy Moore, who's embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl and several other teenagers, Trump has supported Moore by bashing his opponent ahead of the Dec. 12 special election. "The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!" Trump tweeted Nov. 26. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet is chock-full of potential claims. Given Republican lawmakers’ urgent push to pass a tax bill, we decided to focus on his claim that Jones wants to raise taxes. Jones supports tax cuts for corporations, middle class No, Jones has not campaigned on a platform of raising taxes. We did not find examples of Jones calling for tax hikes, and the White House did not respond to our request for supporting evidence. Jones has embraced some elements of the Republican tax plan while appearing to oppose it overall. Jones told Alabama voters that unlike some Democrats, he favors lowering corporate taxes and believes it would make American business more competitive, according to the Washington Post’s coverage of a Nov. 21 candidate forum in Huntsville. "I generally try to support cutting corporate taxes to try to get reinvestment back into this country," Jones told reporters Nov. 16, the day the House passed its version of the tax plan. (We’ve previously reported that around $2.8 trillion in untaxed corporate earnings is parked overseas.) Despite his support for a corporate tax cut, Jones has criticized the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, and skewing too heavily in favor of the rich while either ignoring or hurting the middle class. "What I have said all along is that I am troubled by tax breaks for the wealthy, which seem to be, in this bill, overloaded," Jones told reporters Nov. 16. "I'm troubled by what appears to be, ultimately, tax increases or no tax cuts for the middle class." Needless to say, Jones’ support for cutting the corporate tax rate, and his concern for giving tax breaks to the middle class — or at least not raising their taxes — is at odds with Trump’s claim. Would Jones support a tax hike on wealthy Americans? At the same time, Jones’ campaign literature, which bemoans tax breaks and loopholes for wealthy Americans, raises the question of whether Jones wants to end these benefits, effectively hiking taxes on the rich. "All Americans should have a place in this economy," reads Jones’ campaign website, "and tax breaks or loopholes for the wealthiest among us hurt our ability to invest in education and other needs for lower to moderate income families." Jones' website also calls for government spending on education and job training, and defends the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, which was financed through tax hikes. Jones’ campaign declined to answer our questions about whether Jones would support raising taxes and how he would pay for the programs he champions. Our ruling Trump said Jones wants to "raise taxes." While Jones has criticized tax breaks for the rich, we found no examples of him calling to raise taxes. On the contrary, we found several instances of Jones supporting tax cuts for corporations and the middle class. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02585	"Last month, more Americans stopped looking for a job than found one."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers/rep-mcmorris-rodgers-says-more-people-stopped-look/	After President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address, which focused largely on his plans to boost the economic well-being of struggling Americans, Republicans responded with their own approach. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said her party’s mission was to close the gap "between where you are and where you want to be." McMorris Rodgers blamed the president and his policies for that gap and noted that "last month, more Americans stopped looking for a job than found one." In this fact-check, we examine that claim. The congresswoman’s staff pointed us to numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December, the nation added about 74,000 jobs. But in that same month, the labor force shrunk by 347,000. There are several problems with this comparison. The biggest is that a large portion of those people who left the workforce simply retired. We don’t know exactly how many, but it is a demographic reality that an ever growing number of Americans are getting older. Based on federal data, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, has calculated that the percentage of the adult population over 55 has risen from 27 percent in 1999-2000 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Burtless has estimated that half to two-thirds of the recent decline in the labor participation rate has been due to the aging of the population, depending on the time period you look at. Economists say that a tough job market has led thousands of people to retire earlier than they might have. But the raw numbers don’t give us a clear picture. The Bureau of Labor Statistics asks questions that give us some clues but not a definitive answer. The data on "discouraged workers" counts people who looked for a job in the past year but did not during the last month. And the reason they didn’t look, according to the bureau, might have been that there was no work available, that employers thought they were too young or too old, or that the people didn’t have the skills needed to compete for the openings they found. By using December numbers, McMorris Rodgers has cherry-picked a more dire statistic. In that month, the number of discouraged workers rose by 155,000. That is higher than the 74,000 jobs the economy gained. But looking back at the other months throughout the year, a different picture emerges. During 2013, there were only two months, June and December, when the number of discouraged workers grew by more than the number of new jobs added. The monthly numbers are not fully comparable because the discouraged worker count is not seasonally adjusted and the number of jobs is. But with that caveat, the overall trend for the year is more positive because the number of new jobs exceeded discouraged workers. Our ruling McMorris Rodgers said more people stopped looking for a job than found one in December. The congresswoman relied on figures that included a large fraction of people who retired from the workforce and she cherry-picked one of only two months in 2013 that supported her claim. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Cathy McMorris Rodgers	None	None	None	2014-01-28T23:18:35	2014-01-28	['United_States']
pomt-05981	"And by the way, when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/23/richard-codey/richard-codey-claims-he-made-pension-payment-when-/	New Jersey governors have skipped or underfunded state payments into the pension system, but during his roughly 15-month tenure as the chief executive, state Sen. Richard Codey claims he paid the bill. Codey addressed his record of making pension payments during a Jan. 16 interview on WOR-AM with former New York Gov. David Paterson. A caller from New Jersey noted how the "pension funds have not been funded from both sides" over the last 11 years. Codey (D-Essex) explained how state regulations now require the governor to make significant payments, and then added: "And by the way, when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Codey made a pension payment -- but it was far from the total amount recommended at the time. Codey, who served as governor between November 2004 and January 2006, was only responsible for putting together the fiscal year 2006 budget. In that fiscal year, the state made a total of about $164 million worth of payments to six pension funds, according to data provided by Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury. But in fiscal year 2006, the total combined payment recommended by actuaries to be made to those six funds was roughly $1.45 billion, according to Quinn. So, the state only covered about 11.3 percent of the recommended payments. Those payments were authorized by Codey through the fiscal year 2006 budget, but they were technically made under Codey’s successor, Jon Corzine. In a phone interview, Codey acknowledged he made a partial payment and argued he never said he made a full payment. When we told him his statement referred to making "the payment," the former governor suggested we were nitpicking. "I said I made a payment into the pension fund," Codey told us. "I did make a payment and that’s true. What I said was true." Asked why he didn’t make the full payment, Codey pointed to the $4 billion budget cap he had to grapple with. "It is what it is. There’s demands all over the place. You’ve got to make those kind of decisions." Our ruling In a radio interview, Codey claimed, "when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund." It’s true that the state made a partial payment during fiscal year 2006, whose budget Codey had developed. But the state didn’t make "the payment" in total that was recommended at the time.

pomt-01981	Says a picture he posted on Facebook of a man posing in front of five decapitated human heads is "one of the subhuman mongrels our president set free."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/16/ted-nugent/nugent-ties-gory-photo-bergdahl-prisoner-swap/	Ted Nugent, the one-time rock guitarist turned Second Amendment rights activist, could probably stand to brush up on his Web surfing skills. A few days ago, Nugent posted a horrific photo on Facebook of a bearded man, bloody knife in hand, squatting behind five gory heads. "One of the subhuman mongrels our president set free," Nugent wrote in the caption. "Feel safer yet?" (Nugent created a controversy earlier this year when he called President Barack Obama a "subhuman mongrel.") A reader alerted us that Nugent's post was spreading fast (users have shared it more than 100,000 times) so we wanted to check whether the man in the photo is one of the five Taliban leaders released from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. He is not and there is no way that he could be. The image reportedly was tweeted by the man in the photo on March 15 and not one of the five Taliban prisoners. We say reportedly because the original tweet has since been removed. However, we can use news accounts to piece together what happened -- and why this image is not of the Taliban prisoners. For starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released. Tha man who originally tweeted the image goes by the name Abdurahman. Abdurahman came from Iraq and lived in Holland for 10 years before returning to fight in Syria and Iraq. The image was the source of an article in de Volkskrant, a major Dutch newspaper, on March 17. The article identifies the man in the image as Khalid K. from Almere, Netherlands. Although the photo itself is no longer available on the Web, the description in the Volkskrant article matches the image in Nugent’s post. An American blog post from March 23 leaves no doubt the images are the same. The site D.C. Clothesline links back to the Volkskrant and includes the photo. On April 17, Live Leak, a British-based image and video sharing website, carried an entry with the photo. The headline was, "Dutch-Iraqi ISIS terrorist cannibal butcher and behead five Al Qaeda terrorists beheader (sic)." How'd things get mixed up? The image returned recently with people claiming it was Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl. The urban myth website Snopes reviewed the revival of the disturbing photo on June 10. It noted that the image had appeared many times on Facebook with the claim that the man was "Mohammad Fazi (sic), just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter. He seems like a really proud terrorist in this photo. I sure hope everyone feels safer knowing this guy is now free." Without using Mohammed Fazl’s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts. Fazl is a former Taliban deputy defense minister, one of the five men released from Guantanamo. Mohammed Fazl (left) and Abdurahman (right). We contacted Nugent’s office for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Nugent said a man squatting behind five heads had been set free by President Barack Obama to secure the freedom of an American soldier. The photo first appeared in mid March, two months before the prisoner swap. Nugent had plenty of opportunity to learn that the photo was not of one of the five released prisoners. He posted it two days after the connection to the Guantanamo detainees had been debunked. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Ted Nugent	None	None	None	2014-06-16T16:44:59	2014-06-12	['None']

pomt-01697	"Kids coming from an affluent background" are "taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants" while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/13/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-affluent-taking-advantage-student-loan/	Roughly 40 million students have taken out loans to pay for college, contributing to about $1.2 trillion in outstanding loan balances nationwide, according to the Federal Reserve. Those students graduate with $30,000 in loan debt on average and about half of them worry about paying that debt back, a 2013 Urban Institute study found. And according to Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the federal government is to blame for a system that is out of whack. "I’ve got a problem where you’ve got kids coming from an affluent background, taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants for higher education and who’s paying for that?" Johnson asked at a May 28th, 2014 town hall meeting in Bristol. "I mean, in many cases, working class families – the middle class who aren't going to college, who aren’t sending their kids or they didn’t go to college themselves, and yet their tax money’s being used to fund the college educations of more affluent individuals." Is this really the case? Johnson’s claim has two main parts so let’s take a look at both. ‘Affluent’ backgrounds The first part of Johnson’s claim is that some college students who come from an "affluent background" take advantage of federal student loans and grants so they can afford higher education. When we asked Johnson for backup, his policy advisor, Patrick McIlheran, said Johnson didn’t have a "precise numerical definition" in mind for affluent when he made the claim. Instead, Johnson meant the dictionary definition of affluent, which is "having a generously sufficient and typically increasing supply of material possessions." Meanwhile, federal student aid has no formal income limits. Rather, the U.S. Department of Education defines financial need as the difference between the cost of attending college and a family’s expected contribution to the education. This, of course, varies by university and family. Federal student loans fall into two major categories -- subsidized and unsubsidized. For subsidized loans, a borrower needs to prove financial need to qualify. In these loans, the Department of Education pays interest on them while the student is in college and up until six months after the borrower leaves college, according to the department’s student aid website. In contrast, unsubsidized loans are available to all students with no financial need requirement. But unsubsidized loans accrue interest while the borrower is still in school and during the six-month grace period. In any case, the structure means the affluent students Johnson described, by and large would not be using the need-based subsidized loans. Even if those families borrow do direct unsubsidized loans, this comes at no cost to the federal government because these loans generate revenue, according to Jon Fansmith, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, which represents presidents of accredited universities and colleges. A 2008 College Board study that analyzed debt level for student loans by income and labeled "$120,000 or higher" as its highest income bracket. That group accumulated the lowest amount of debt at $14,500 on average at public four-year universities and $18,000 at private, nonprofit universities. But there is no breakdown of whether that debt involved federal student loans, or whether any such loans were subsidized or unsubsidized. In any case, that income bracket is also the fastest growing category of student loan debt, according to an August 2012 Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Reserve data. Johnson’s claim also included grants being used by affluent students. But the Department of Education restricts Pell Grants to those who meet income-eligibility standards, which targets them for the neediest financial aid recipients. Students whose families earn below $20,000 annually often qualify for Pell Grants but, in some cases, those from families earning up to $50,000 can receive them. Again, this rules out the "affluent" students mentioned in Johnson’s claim. Who "funds" student aid? In the second part of the claim, Johnson said middle class taxpayers who didn’t attend college, or have any connection to college, fund "federal loan programs and grants." Here it’s important to understand how the student loan programs work. The system is structured to be self-sufficient and even generate revenue. That is, the costs of administering the program are covered by loan repayments, so it’s not part of the general fund budget that is picked up by average taxpayers. The Department of Education budget draws on funds from the Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants, and the repayment of some loans. This money from the Treasury is indirectly funded by taxpayers, Fansmith said. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury so student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government, Fansmith said. This actually reduces the deficit, he said, rather than costs general taxpayers anything. But loan repayment and forgiveness programs that rely on "general appropriations" do affect the nation’s roughly 143 million taxpayers. So that tab is shared by those who have college degrees and those who don’t. There are more than 50 repayment programs. In most cases, they are aimed at helping individuals who take jobs in specific areas, such as teaching in low-income school districts or working in particular government agencies. Newer programs, aimed at alleviating the student debt crisis, are open to more people. For instance, the "Pay As You Earn" plan took effect July 1, 2014. It allows borrowers to repay their debt for up to 20 years -- twice as long as most standard repayment cycles -- and then the federal government repays their remaining debt. As its name suggests, the PAYE plan offers lower monthly payment rates that depend on 10 percent of a borrower’s income. So borrowers with higher incomes -- the more affluent -- would still pay more than others. The Department of Education estimated the program would cost more than $2.1 billion between 2012 and 2021 but its final cost has not been determined, according to the Congressional Research Service. In any case, the costs won’t won’t really kick in until 2017, when the U.S. Dept. of Education starts paying off the first round of borrowers’ remaining debt. The Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, released a study in April 2014 that estimates existing repayment programs could cost the federal government four times more than the Department of Education anticipated, totaling roughly $3,400 overall per borrower. Of course, any such costs would affect the general budget and all taxpayers. Our rating Johnson said those "coming from an affluent background" are "taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants" while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the general fund. But then it’s picked by all taxpayers not simply the group Johnson mentioned -- middle class taxpayers with no ties to college. In short, he vastly overstates the problem on both ends and makes a link that he cannot clearly establish based on available data. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13238	Says Sen. John McCain "has taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/oct/19/ann-kirkpatrick/has-john-mccain-taken-most-wall-street-money-any-s/	The first and only U.S. Senate debate between Sen. John McCain and his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, featured plenty of partisan finger-pointing. McCain accused Kirkpatrick of standing with Hillary Clinton while Kirkpatrick lobbied the same attacks, wondering why it took the senior senator so long to renounce Donald Trump. "You know, there was a day John McCain was a maverick and would stand up to his party," Kirkpatrick said during the Oct. 10 debate. "Now, he has taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator." This claim against the 2008 Republican presidential nominee jumped out at us. We have heard similar Wall Street-related attacks this presidential cycle. Just last month, Trump claimed Clinton has received "$100 million from Wall Street and hedge funds." We rated it False, because the number is closer to $64 million. And in March, Clinton said President Barack Obama took more money from Wall Street during his 2008 campaign "than anybody ever had." We rated it Mostly True -- Mitt Romney eventually broke the record in 2012. We wondered, has McCain been in the pockets of Wall Street? The contributions Kirkpatrick campaign spokesman D.B. Mitchell pointed us to their analysis of campaign contributions from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. As we’ve noted previously, the center considers the "securities and investment" category as the most Wall Street-centric. Kirkpatrick’s camp also included contributions from the "commercial banks" and "miscellaneous finance" categories. We should also note that these contributions do not come from the firms themselves, but individuals. Here is how the numbers stack up: SECURITIES & INVESTMENT MISC FINANCE COMMERCIAL BANKS TOTAL JOHN MCCAIN $12,665,118 $6,495,872 $2,844,073 $22,005,063 CHARLES SCHUMER $12,616,062 $1,832,371 $1,609,677 $16,058,110 MITCH MCCONNELL $4,119,160 $1,204,439 $1,269,839 $6,593,438 McCain, who was elected to the Senate in 1987, does appear to have taken the most contributions -- more than $22 million -- from Wall Street. But, there are some caveats. Presidential fundraising McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said the numbers are skewed because they include contributions made during the senator’s 2008 presidential run. She noted that he is the only current member of Congress to win his party’s nomination. "That’s a different level of campaigning and fundraising," Romero said. That’s fair because, overall, Obama and Clinton have taken the most money from Wall Street, former senators with presidential runs in their own right. According to Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman with the Center for Responsive Politics, McCain received more than $19 million from Wall Street during his presidential run. "For his presidential campaign, he received $10,804,533 from Securities & Investment, $5,902,217 from Misc Finance and $2,372,700 from Commercial Banks," she said. Michael Traugott, a research professor at the University of Michigan, said Kirkpatrick’s claim is misleading. "Taking into account contributions across a career would be a misleading comparison with other U.S. senators who have not served for the same length of time or been a presidential candidate," Traugott said. "I think those qualifiers should be taken into account." Our ruling Kirkpatrick said, "(McCain) has taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator. The numbers are on the mark, but need clarification. McCain ran for president in 2008, which does involve a higher level of fundraising. Excluding his presidential run, the senior senator has taken significantly less money from Wall Street. On balance, we rate her claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee15a938-4d9b-4ebc-b7b9-b765887d7b60	None	Ann Kirkpatrick	None	None	None	2016-10-19T13:45:00	2016-10-10	['John_McCain']
pomt-09443	"If we just froze spending at 2007 levels ... by 2013 we would balance the budget ... and by 2020 we would cut the national debt in half."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/10/george-lemieux/lemieuxs-plan-would-eliminate-deficit/	Republican U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, appointed to his job by Gov. Charlie Crist last year to replace retiring Sen. Mel Martinez, says he is sounding the alarm about the federal debt. In a March 8, 2010, interview with the Miami Herald editorial board, he discussed his proposal to balance the budget. "If we just froze spending at 2007 levels...by 2013 we would balance the budget ... and by 2020 we would cut the national debt in half," he said. For now, LeMieux's proposal is little more than simple math on an Excel spreadsheet, to back up his assertion that a freeze at the 2007 levels would have a profound impact on the budget. He plans to introduce legislation about it this year, said spokesman Ken Lundberg. The proposal has been praised by the Weekly Standard, a conservative journal. "LeMieux's ideas on curbing spending haven't gotten much attention,'' wrote Fred Barnes, the Standard's editor, in a Feb. 15, 2010, column. "That's because of who he is, a 40-year-old appointed rather than elected senator filling out the final 16 months of the term of Mel Martinez, who resigned. He's not running for election this November. In fact, he's never been elected to any office." Another reason it may not have sparked much interest: It's vague and pie-in-the-sky. Two experts on the federal budget told us that LeMieux's budget proposal is unrealistic and lacking details about how he would achieve such a freeze. First, we'll examine the math. LeMieux's office sent us a two-page spreadsheet showing budget projections through 2020 and two options outlined by LeMieux. The spreadsheet lists revenues and outlays and the resulting deficit or surplus. Under President Barack Obama's current budget, LeMieux's chart shows the deficit growing from $161 billion in 2007 to an estimated $1.6 trillion this year. Current projections call for the deficit to average about $900 billion a year through 2020. LeMieux's math shows two options: freezing spending at 2007 or 2008 levels starting in 2011. Under both scenarios, LeMieux concludes that the federal budget would start to see a surplus in 2013 or 2014. By 2020, the cumulative surplus would be nearly $6 trillion. According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, the debt as of March 8, 2010, was about $12 trillion. "You use the $6 trillion surplus to pay that debt,'' Lundberg said. (A note on LeMieux's methodology: He uses different revenue numbers than the White House because he assumes the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts would be extended and LeMieux assumes that the alternative minimum tax -- a tax designed to prevent wealthy people from using loopholes to avoid taxes -- would be adjusted for inflation.) We sent LeMieux's spreadsheet to Jim Horney, the director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, and Josh Gordon, the policy director at the Concord Coalition, an independent group that advocates responsible fiscal policy. Both agreed that freezing spending at the 2007 level would ultimately lead to erasing the deficit, although Gordon said it appeared that LeMieux's analysis omitted a few factors including calculating the debt service from extending the tax cuts, provisions in the tax code that usually get extended every year and whether the tax cuts in the stimulus package that are set to expire would continue. Gordon wasn't certain how much that would change the year LeMieux would achieve his goal but said "I think he would still get to a balanced budget at some time in the 10 years.'' LeMieux's office said the plan does factor in debt service and does not assume that temporary tax cuts in the stimulus package would continue. What's the magical benefit of a freeze at 2007 budget levels? Horney said it's a combination of avoiding inflation and sidestepping the expense of the costly economic stimulus package. So the math is solid. But both Horney and Gordon said it's not as simple as it looks and that LeMieux should explain which programs he would cut and by how much to achieve those savings. "It is certainly the case that over time if you don't spend any more dollars than you spent in 2007, even under current policy, revenues will go up in nominal terms, spending will not go up in nominal terms and you will balance the budget,'' Horney said. "That is ignoring that it takes more dollars in nominal terms to provide the same services and benefits in 2007." That's a function of demographics and inflation, Horney said. "In 2020 it is going to cost more to pay teachers, keep people in prison, it's going to cost more for each individual Medicare beneficary. There will be more Medicare beneficies in 2020," he said. "Simply saying, 'Let's don't spend anymore in nominal terms' -- it's a huge policy change. You would have to have real cuts across the board. As a math exercise it works, but you should be aware that means very draconian cuts ... that would not be able to provide the same level of services and benefits we provided in 2007." To illustrate that difficulty, Horney used an analogy: If a family in 2020 was told it could not spend one dollar more than it spent in 2007, the family would be pinched because the cost of food, clothing and rent would have increased over that time. Like Horney, Gordon wanted more details about how LeMieux would cut. "Is he taking money out of defense? The Department of Education? These are dramatic cuts, some major things are going to have to be sliced. I think there needs to be an explanation exactly which line items to stop increase spending on. ... This would be almost impossible to enact because it involves freezing total outlays -- not just the spending that Congress controls annually. You would have to freeze Social Security spending, Medicare spending....Those programs are on autopilot -- Congress does not consider them on an annual basis." LeMieux's plan could also affect the economy. "Such dramatic spending cuts during a recession might prolong the recession which would lead to lower economic growth than the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) proposes, which would affect all the estimates for revenues and budget deficits,'' Gordon said. We asked LeMieux's office how the plan they call the "2007 Solution" would achieve the savings. "The effect would be to force lawmakers to reprioritize spending decisions,'' Lundberg wrote in an e-mail. "There are a number of programs greatly in need of reform but until tough choices are made, spending will continue to run out of control. The 2007 Solution would force those tough choices to be made. For instance, waste, fraud and abuse of Medicare dollars is estimated in the billions each year. Capturing those dollars would be a start. In addition, there are hundreds of redundant federal programs that could be eliminated or made more efficient." Lundberg also sent us a copy of an unsuccessful Jan. 22, 2010, amendment by LeMieux and several other senators called "Elimination of Duplicative and Wasteful Spending." That amendment would have reduced overhead in several departments and called for investigations to identify duplicative programs. So, to recap: LeMieux's math is correct: If we lowered federal spending to 2007 levels and kept it there, we could balance the budget and soon have a surplus that we could use to pay down the debt. The omissions in LeMieux's analysis would not have a substantial effect, Gordon told us. But it's important to note that beyond the simple addition and subtraction, LeMieux's proposal is quite unrealistic because of inflation and demographics. LeMieux saying we could balance the budget by 2013 is like someone saying they could lose 20 pounds in a month by just eating lettuce. It might be accurate, but it's probably not going to happen. Still, he gets an A for his math. We find his claim True.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2010-03-10T17:32:22	2010-03-08	['None']

pomt-15303	Says "Scott Walker’s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/21/wisconsin-state-afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-scott-walker-budget-means-n/	Gov. Scott Walker may have vetoed 104 items from the 2015-’17 budget, but he left in one that has Democrats and union leaders upset. The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO posted a meme to its Facebook page July 8, 2015 that in bold letters proclaims: "Scott Walker’s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers." The meme goes on to say the change could "lead to intimidation in the workplace and to an environment where bosses can pressure workers into working every single day of every single month without needed rest." It’s not the first time unions have slammed the governor.The most notable outcry came after Walker and Republicans passed Act 10, which sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. More recently, Walker signed a "right-to-work" measure in March 2015 that prohibits requiring private sector workers to pay union fees. The no-weekend claim had come up before. An opinion piece published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel written by Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO declared, "they took away the weekend." And a Gawker article, shared widely on social media sites, was titled, "Wisconsin is trying to take away your right to a weekend." So, now that it’s summer, it begs this important question: Will you have to work this Saturday and Sunday? Background on the law Since the 1970s, a law has required employers operating factories or retail stores to give workers at least 24 hours off every seven days. That law does not apply to janitors, security personnel or those who care for live animals. People who are employed in the manufacture of butter, cheese or other dairy products, or in bakeries, flour and feed mills, hotels and restaurants are also exempt. Passage of the law came on the coattails of federal legislation -- the Occupational Safety and Health Act -- aimed at assuring safe and healthy working conditions. Wisconsin, and most other states, passed additional legislation in 1971 to improve employment standards. In 2014, Republican lawmakers pushed a bill that would have allowed workers to voluntarily forgo that day of rest. The bill, which the state AFL-CIO lobbied against, passed committee, but did not get a vote in the full Senate. At that time, supporters said the bill would give workers a way to earn some extra money, while allowing companies to increase production. For instance, if a company needed to run extra hours to fulfill an order, all workers would be eligible to get a piece of the extra cash. Sponsors said the idea came from the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce and the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce also lobbied in support of the bill. Backers of the change noted the federal government does not impose limits on consecutive work days. How it changes The provision inserted into the state budget permits employees in certain industries to voluntarily work seven days in a row. It was added in committee July 7, 2015, a day before the GOP-controlled Senate passed the budget. So who can volunteer to work seven days without rest? The same workers protected under the old law. So really just a fraction of workers in the state are affected by the budget provision -- though the union offers it as so sweeping that everyone might be affected. "There will be a chilling effect for everyone," Bloomingdale said in an interview. "It sends the message that it’s acceptable to go without a day of rest." John Witte, professor emeritus of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the union’s statement is "clearly overstating the case." Witte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to "volunteer." "If, however, employers tried to make that an overt requirement of employment, the workers could use that as a legal argument against the employer because that would clearly violate the voluntary nature of the action," Witte said. Our rating The state AFL-CIO said, "Scott Walker’s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers." But the provision does not apply to all workers, as the claim suggests. What’s more, it is a voluntary thing -- workers could agree to the extra day to, for instance, earn extra overtime. We rate the claim False.

pomt-09701	The Republicans' alternative health care plan "will still let insurers raise premiums four times faster than wages."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/05/americans-united-change/americans-united-change-ad-claims-gop-health-plan-/	The liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change has an ad running in the Washington, D.C., market that attacks the GOP's recently released alternative to the Democrats' health care plan. The ad adopts a faux broadcast news format, beginning with this jab: "This just in: Republicans in Congress have introduced the Health Insurance Industry Profits Protection Act." The announcer says the GOP plan would let insurance companies continue denying care for pre-existing conditions, a claim we looked at more closely when U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the same thing. The ad then makes this claim: "Republicans will still let insurers raise premiums four times faster than wages." In its backup material for the ad, Americans United for Change cites a report from the liberal group Health Care for America Now! (guess where they are in the health care debate) that states, "Commercial health insurance premiums have risen four times faster than wages and have more than doubled in the last nine years." That report, in turn, credits the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's "Employer Health Benefits -- 2008 Annual Survey," which backs up the statistic. So it's fair to say that insurance premiums have risen four times faster than wages over the last nine years. But is it fair to say that trend would continue under the Republican plan? "They (Republicans) do nothing to control the cost of premiums," said Lauren Weiner, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Change. "It's a tacit approval of the current trend." Weiner said that's because the Republican plan does little to expand the insurance pool, which she argues would lower costs for everyone. A report from the Congressional Budget Office concluded the GOP plan would only reduce the number of uninsured people by 3 million by 2019, while 52 million nonelderly people would remain uninsured (by contrast the Democrats' plan would reduce the uninsured by 36 million, leaving 18 million without coverage). The Republican plan also does not include a public option, Weiner said, so it would not create the necessary competition to drive down health insurance costs. Republicans say their plan would reduce premiums because it would let people buy health insurance across state lines; allow small businesses to pool together and offer health insurance to their employees at much lower costs; and institute medical malpractice reforms. For an objective assessment, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the GOP plan. The CBO is a nonpartisan budget agency that creates calculations for how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Contrary to the Americans United claim, the CBO concluded the GOP plan would lower premiums. Specifically: • For the small group market (generally businesses with 2 to 50 employees — about 15 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce average premiums in 2016 by 7 to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law. • For the individual market (just over 5 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 5 to 8 percent. • And for the large group market (which represents 80 percent of private premiums), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. The CBO cautioned that those estimates are "very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty" because of the difficulty in trying to disentangle how various proposals in the plan might affect premiums. Still, the CBO has done the most thorough and objective analysis of the bill, while the liberal groups have merely assumed that past trends will continue. Given the CBO's role as a nonpartisan, well-respected authority, we find its estimates more persuasive. We find the Americans United claim to be False.

pomt-07310	"Very, very, very few people get a pat-down" when they go through airport security.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/may/17/janet-napolitano/homeland-security-chief-stresses-very-very-very-fe/	As luck would have it, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had heaps of ornery subjects to tackle during a recent talk before the Atlanta Press Club. Attendees at the May 7 luncheon peppered her with questions about Osama bin Laden’s death, which took place just five days earlier. They asked about Georgia’s new immigration legislation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to recent, historic tornadoes that devastated towns across the Southeast. One raised the touchiest -- literally -- of all of topics: getting patted down at the airport. "Will we go past the grope-and-grab phase?" a luncheon attendee asked Napolitano. "The machines that scan the bodies and so forth? Are there better ways of doing it?" "Well, actually, very, very, very few people get a pat-down," Napolitano replied. "It’s only under very limited circumstances. They do, however, get -- those who are patted down -- tend to get on YouTube." she quipped. "And look, look, no one wants to see a 6-year-old patted down. Even if it’s done according to procedural protocol," she said. In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com of a 6-year-old girl being patted down at the New Orleans airport. Just this week, images of a baby getting frisked at Kansas City International Airport made headlines as well. "Very, very, very" few people? we wondered. That’s a lot of "very"s. Given the public outcry, Napolitano’s estimate sent PolitiFact Georgia scribes scrambling. We asked the Transportation Security Administration for more details. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security and protects the nation’s transportation systems. Last fall, the TSA began to use special scanners that showed images of passengers including what was underneath their clothing. Critics called it a "virtual strip search" and said it was too invasive. The TSA offered pat-downs as an alternative, but these also frustrated critics. In October, the agency announced that officers would implement "enhanced" pat-down procedures. Previously, screeners used the backs of their hands to inspect sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and conduct a more thorough search. Adults can also receive pat-downs on a random basis. Children receive "modified" pat-downs if they require extra screening. As the busy Thanksgiving travel week approached, passengers complained about having their genitals and breasts touched. A video appeared on YouTube.com of a toddler crying during the pat-down and shouting for a screener to stop. Parents were outraged. Travelers threatened they would stop flying, and some predicted long airport security lines. The expected chaos never materialized. For the most part, passengers went through the screening process without a fuss. "All in all, people wanted to get to their destinations," said Christopher Bidwell, a security expert with the industry group Airports Council International. We asked the TSA how many pat-downs it conducts at the nation’s airports. Atlanta TSA spokesman Jon Allen told us that during March, 3 percent of air passengers were subject to a pat-down. The TSA collects this data by monitoring "data from select airports throughout the year," he wrote in an email. That number is "consistent with that of previous time periods." PolitiFact Georgia looked for other pat-down data to see whether other groups have verified TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not. Neither did industry groups we contacted. We did find a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 19-21 that said 15 percent of adults who have flown two or more times in the past year received a full-body pat-down. The survey’s margin of error was 4 percentage points. The 15 percent figure does not contradict the TSA figures. The more often you pass through a security checkpoint, the more chance you’ll receive a pat-down. PolitiFact Georgia therefore took the TSA figures and did some math. The TSA’s Allen told us that "on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints." Three percent of 2 million is 60,000 people. That means that over the course of a month, roughly 1.8 million people receive a pat-down. That’s more than four times the population of Atlanta. That doesn’t sound like "very, very, very" few people to us. If Napolitano said that "a small percentage of passengers" get patted down each month, she would have been correct. But she talked about "people." In addition, she used the superlative "very" three times, even though the TSA’s own figures show that the numbers of passengers who receive a pat-down can top 1 million in a single month.

pomt-08183	The payday loan industry "does not exist in a state like Minnesota."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/28/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-state-sen-glenn-grothman-says-payday-loa/	Here at PolitiFact Wisconsin, we rarely see terms as provocative and pungent as "usurious vipers." When we do, we want to know more. In this case, it was Wisconsin state Sen. Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) who referred to snakes charging exorbitant interest rates in recent comments about payday lenders. Payday loan operations -- such as Check ’n Go, Payday Loan Store and Check-Cash Advance -- make short-term loans. You sign a loan agreement, write a post-dated check and get your money. The lender holds off on cashing your check until your next payday, typically two weeks. Interest rates can run high. Wisconsin has 482 payday lenders; West Bend, according to Grothman, has eight of them. Grothman, who opposes such operations, made his snakes remark in response to news that payday lenders are planning a push to roll back regulations on their business set to take effect in Wisconsin on Jan. 1, 2011. "This industry does not exist in a state like Minnesota, and I don't see any downside in keeping these usurious vipers out of our state," said Grothman, the Senate’s new assistant majority leader, in a Nov. 13, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. "There are so many legitimate businesses in this state that need regulatory help. I sure hope that these guys are not on the list." Grothman made a similar comment about the lack of payday lenders in Minnesota in April 2010 during a discussion among Wisconsin lawmakers about the bill that eventually became law. So, is it true that Minnesota has driven all payday lenders out of the state? When asked about the source for his comment, Grothman acknowledged he didn’t know for sure if his statement was true, but said he had heard from a couple of people that Minnesota doesn’t have payday lenders. Not wanting to appear like a snake in the grass, we told Grothman we’d do some, ahem, checking. It didn’t take long. It turns out Minnesota does allow payday lenders, some 75 of them, according to the state Department of Commerce. The state’s attorney general warns consumers about "hefty" finance charges that can apply to their loans and spells out some of the restrictions that are in place. For loans of up to $350, a sliding scale applies that limits the interest rate to 10 percent plus a $5 fee. For loans between $350 and $1,000, the lender cannot charge more than 33 percent interest plus a $25 fee. Wisconsin also warns its citizens about them. The state Department of Financial Institutions says interest on payday loans can reach 500 percent per year or more. Borrowing $200 at 500 percent interest for two weeks costs $38.36 and; if the loan remains outstanding for 10 weeks, the cost -- $191.78 -- is nearly as much as the loan itself, according to the state. The Wisconsin law that takes effect in January makes a number of changes, including limiting payday loans to $1,500. In an effort to keep consumers from accumulating too much debt, the law also limits the loans to being renewed one time. The Wisconsin Deferred Deposit Association, which represents payday lenders, has said it will push to soften Wisconsin’s new regulations, although it has not been specific about what changes it will seek. According to the association, the average payday loan in Wisconsin is for $300, with a fee of $45. There actually are many states, nearly a third of them -- including Ohio and most of the East Coast -- that don’t have payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. But as we’ve pointed out, Minnesota isn’t one of them. That means it’s time for the Truth-O-Meter. State Sen. Glenn Grothman said Wisconsin’s neighbor to the west doesn’t have any payday lenders. He apparently thought it was true and was trying to make a point that Wisconsin shouldn’t make it any easier for those businesses to operate. We wouldn’t say Grothman was being snaky. But his statement is False.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2010-11-28T09:00:00	2010-11-13	['Minnesota']

pomt-14333	Congressman Jeff Denham "has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/mar/28/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/mostly-false-claim-distorts-congressman-jeff-denha/	In an effort to tie Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) to Donald Trump’s extremist views on immigration, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently claimed: Denham "has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported." The statement by the DCCC, the political campaign arm of House Democrats, caught our attention because Denham is considered a moderate on immigration reform within the GOP. He’s rejected hard-line views and even co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform package introduced by Democrats. House Democrats have long coveted Denham’s seat, a potential swing district in California’s diverse Central Valley, and they’re targeting him once again this year. We decided to check whether Denham, a three-term incumbent, truly has agreed with this hard-line immigration stance — either recently or somewhere in his past. We also wondered whether the DCCC distorted Denham’s stance, in an effort to weaken his re-election chances. Our research The DCCC made its claim in a March 17 press release titled "The Denham and The Donald Line Up Again Against Immigrant Families." It includes a photo of the two Republicans standing next to each other. The DCCC has labeled Denham "vulnerable" to a Democratic challenger. The committee is backing Democrat Michael Eggman, a Central Valley beekeeper. Denham and Eggman will face each other in the June primary election and likely again in November. They squared off in 2014, with Denham defeating Eggman and retaining his heavily Latino district that includes Manteca, Modesto and Turlock. We asked the DCCC for evidence proving Denham has agreed unauthorized immigrants should be rounded up. A spokeswoman pointed to audio from a 2010 Republican primary debate between Denham and other candidates for Congress. She did not provide any more recent evidence. In the audio above from the 2010 debate, the immigration question is asked at the 11:55 minute mark. Denham's response is at the 16:15 minute mark. Denham’s campaign spokesman did not respond to interview requests. During the 2010 debate, the candidates are asked: "Do you believe that anyone who is here (in the United States) right now as an illegal immigrant should be detained, arrested and deported?" Denham, who was serving in the California Legislature at the time, responded: "The simple answer is: Yes, we’ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation. But as a state senator, one of the calls that I get frequently are those families that came here legally, that are working here legally and somehow lost their immigration status to no fault of their own." From that both-sides-of-the-fence response, it’s a stretch to call Denham an extremist on immigration, said UC San Diego Political Science Professor Gary Jacobson. "It’s not clear what (Denham’s) opinion is from that, really," added Jacobson, who studies Congress. He surmised the DCCC "may have cherry picked" the statement. ‘As far as rounding people up’ A response from Denham to a question later in that same 2010 debate adds some clarity. He’s asked how the nation should pay for increased immigration enforcement. His answer stops well short of agreeing that "all illegal immigrants" should be deported, as the DCCC attributes to him. "First, absolutely, we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a secure border. But as far as rounding people up, again, you’ve got to look at how they came here in the first place," Denham said. "Did they come here illegally? Or did they come here legally and just have their citizenship expire?" Jack Pitney, an expert on Republicans in Congress, said the DCCC claim doesn’t sound like something Denham has or would agree with. "Nobody’s ever going to mistake Jeff Denham for Donald Trump," added Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College. Our ruling The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed GOP Rep. Jeff Denham "has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported." It pointed to a response by Denham in a 2010 Republican primary debate, in which the congressman said: "The simple answer is: Yes, we’ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation." In this response, Denham makes no effort to explicitly disagree with the moderator’s statement. But it’s a far stretch to say his answer shows Denham wanted to detain, arrest and deport all unauthorized immigrants. A later response from Denham in the same debate shows the congressman believed immigration enforcement should be judicious. He stopped well short of the idea of rounding up all unauthorized immigrants, saying some may be undocumented to no fault of their own. The claim by the DCCC — which is backing Denham’s opponent in the June primary — contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03767	Says carbon monoxide is still employed to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters.	true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/03/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-29-texas-cities-use-carbon-monoxi/	A lawmaker seeking to ban the killing of dogs and cats by carbon monoxide says the method is used in 29 animal shelters around Texas, according to a March 19, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article. We wondered. The claim by Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, was aired as a Senate committee sent Watson’s proposal, Senate Bill 360, to the Senate, which advanced the measure to the House about a week later. The proposal, like companion legislation by Rep. Eddie Lucio III, D-Brownsville, would remove a provision from state law permitting a person to euthanize a dog or cat in an animal shelter using compressed carbon monoxide. Other animals, including birds and reptiles, could still be killed by the method, but dogs and cats in shelters could only be killed by injection with sodium pentobarbital, which is considered more humane and less costly. The story said the list of shelters using carbon monoxide--none of them in Central Texas--was compiled by the Texas Humane Legislative Network, a nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of animal welfare, which Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal described as Watson’s source for statistics related to the proposal. In a "fact sheet" posted online, the network says it contacted the state’s 1,200-plus cities and found that 32 Texas animal shelters, including one in Greenville, "continue to utilize the outdated and inhumane carbon monoxide method of euthanasia." Separately, in a February 2013 blog post, the network’s vice president, Shelby Bobosky, said more than 30 Texas cities, including Sherman and Terrell, stopped using carbon monoxide euthanasia within the last five years. By email, one of the network’s lobbyists, Jack Erskine, sent us a chart, dated March 18, 2013, listing 31 cities as using carbon monoxide to euthanize animals: Beeville; Bovina; Bracketville; Cuero; Devine; Eagle Pass; El Campo; Freer; Ganado; George West; Grand Saline; Greenville; Hondo; Kenedy; Kermit; Kingsville; Lyford; Mathis; Odessa; Plainview; Portland; Raymondville; Refugio; Sabinal; Seminole; Sinton; Stinnett; Taft; Van Horn; Victoria; and Yoakum. The chart says that all but two of these results were confirmed by the group from Dec. 17, 2012, through March 4, 2013. Practices vary, according to footnotes to the chart quoting email responses from cities. Cuero responded that in 2011, 12 juvenile animals were euthanized by injection while 513 others were subjected to carbon monoxide. Bobosky pointed out that a state rule already bars carbon monoxide from being used to euthanize any animal "reasonably presumed to be less than 16 weeks of age" or for "any animal that could be anticipated to have decreased respiratory function, such as the elderly, sick, injured or pregnant." The rule continues: "Such animals may be resistant to the effects of carbon monoxide and the time required to achieve death in these animals may be significantly increased. In animals with decreased respiratory function, carbon monoxide levels rise slowly, making it more likely that these animals will experience elevated levels of stress." According to another footnote to the network’s chart, El Campo said it would start using injection on a trial basis in 2013. Meantime, Freer reported that its shelter had been demolished and no one was currently trained to euthanize animals, while Ganado said its shelter had been shut down and gave no indication if gas would be used in a shelter under construction, according to a footnote. Bobosky said by email that the number of shelters using carbon monoxide has dropped to 29 because Ganado and Freer no longer do so. More broadly, Bobosky said by phone, she and other network volunteers established the list by making public information requests of more than 1,100 Texas cities and towns, starting in November 2011, and asking if jurisdictions had animal shelters using gas to kill dogs and cats. If so, she said, they asked how many animals had been killed by the method in 2011. Bobosky said around 150 cities failed to respond; follow-up interviews indicated none of these cities had shelters. Bobosky said the number of shelters saying they use gas to euthanize has gone down since the network initially inquired in 2011, when the tally was 38 to 40. (She emailed us a network list of cities that do not use gas, among them San Marcos, Seguin and Taylor.) For instance, she said, Sherman ordered its last gas cylinder, which ultimately went unused, in March 2012. "There is a trend in the last two years to simply stop using gas," she said. "It’s outdated." Finally, we spot-checked whether three bigger cities on the list referenced by Watson use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. By phone, Sgt. Sherrie Carruth of the Odessa Police Department and Hector Chavez, an Eagle Pass official, separately said their local animal shelters use "compressed carbon monoxide." Joe Lopez, Victoria’s chief animal control officer, told us its shelter uses carbon monoxide to euthanize some dogs and cats, but depends on injections of a sodium pentobarbital solution for puppies, kittens and especially old or sickly cats and dogs. A twist: While not on the network’s list of carbon monoxide users, Maverick County offered a departure from the common practices. Apolonio Rodriguez, the county's road and bridges supervisor, said that about a year ago, the county stopped taking county-collected dogs and cats to the Eagle Pass city shelter to be euthanized, instead "using the rifle" to kill such animals. Bobosky, informed of our spot-checks, said the law that Watson seeks to amend already limits residents from euthanizing cats or dogs except by using commercially compressed carbon monoxide or sodium pentobarbital, meaning rifles should not be used. Our ruling Watson said 29 cities use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. That’s supported by an advocacy group’s survey research, it appears, though the total also has gone down by more than 10 cities since 2011, according to the group. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-02441	Says Tom Cotton’s vote in Congress to change Medicare "will increase out-of-pocket expenses for every senior in Arkansas."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/28/mark-pryor/pryor-ad-warns-every-senior-arkansas-will-see-incr/	The main takeaway from a recent campaign ad from Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., aside from a prominently featured Apple logo, is that Republican challenger Rep. Tom Cotton is changing Medicare as we know it. A Feb. 5 Arkansas television ad features Courtney, a young woman who’s "never been really political." "It says here Cotton voted in Congress to change Medicare into a voucher system that will increase out-of-pocket expenses for every senior in Arkansas," Courtney said, pointing to her laptop. "Thousands of dollars every year. My grandma and grandpa can’t afford that, and neither can my parents." Since Courtney is a self-professed politics noob, PolitiFact figured we’d jump in and see if she has her facts straight. We wanted to look at what changes to Medicare Cotton supported and how those changes would affect seniors. Cotton’s folks didn’t respond to our request for comment. What Cotton voted for We’ve previously fact-checked the Pryor campaign on whether or not Cotton voted to turn Medicare into a "voucher system." We rated that Mostly True. Republicans typically prefer the term "premium support" to "voucher system," but the concept is the same. Cotton voted for the budget proposal, authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in March 2013. The plan, which didn’t become law, called for issuing flat payments to seniors. Seniors would then have the choice to either purchase traditional Medicare coverage or private insurance. The value of the payment would be either equal to the second-cheapest private plan available in a given area, or the cost of traditional Medicare -- whichever is cheaper. The reform wouldn’t affect anyone currently 55 or older. Over years, though, under Ryan’s plan, the age for Medicare eligibility would’ve increased from 65 to 67. Pryor’s campaign spokesman also pointed out that Cotton voted for an alternate House budget proposal from the Republican Study Committee. That proposal’s Medicare plan was similar to Ryan’s, but would affect all individuals under age 60, as opposed to 55. The change would’ve taken effect in 2019, five years sooner than Ryan’s. It’s up for debate among experts whether or not current seniors would ultimately see cost increases years down the road as vouchers roll out to future seniors. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report in 2012 about the economic impact of a potential Ryan voucher system, but didn’t offer a specific prediction about how costs would change, as our colleagues at FactCheck.org also noted. We should note that by supporting the Republican Study Committee’s budget, Cotton voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So had that proposal become law, seniors would lose benefits they get under Obamacare, like free preventative cancer screenings. But Pryor’s ad implies that the voucher system alone would affect costs like this for all seniors, rather than the Affordable Care Act. We also know repealing the health care law would re-open something called the "doughnut hole" that Obamacare is closing. Essentially, that would increase the cost of prescription drugs for seniors who qualify for Medicare Part D. Not all seniors are eligible for that program, though, so this change alone wouldn’t affect "every senior." Under either proposal, instituting a voucher system wouldn’t have directly changed coverage for current seniors on Medicare, who are age 65 and older. That’s a far cry from the ad’s claim that a voucher system would increase costs for "every senior." Our ruling Pryor’s campaign ad said, "Cotton voted in Congress to change Medicare into a voucher system that will increase out-of-pocket expenses for every senior in Arkansas." Cotton did vote for a voucher-like system under two different budget proposals. But it’s misleading to suggest that the plan would definitely increase expenses for every senior. The research isn’t conclusive, and we can’t predict the future. But even the voucher proposals go out of their way to leave current Medicare beneficiaries alone. It's not at all clear that every senior in Arkansas would see increases in out-of-pocket expenses, including people like Courtney’s grandparents. So we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07720	Gov. Bob McDonnell in 2010 "did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth" in Virginia.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/03/brian-moran/virginia-democratic-chairman-brian-moran-says-gov-/	In a sluggish economy where the spotlight has been on elected officials’ efforts to boost employment, the state Democratic Party is saying Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s job creation efforts are disappointing. A Feb. 25 news release from the Democratic Party of Virginia cited statistics from a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released that same day showing Virginia’s monthly unemployment rates during 2010 averaged out at 6.9 percent. That’s a slight increase from the 2009 average of 6.8 percent. The Democrats also noted the BLS reported a drop in the state’s percentage of working age people with jobs. It fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. Brian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, fired out a news release charging the numbers demonstrate "the governor and his team did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth." We dove into the BLS numbers to see if Moran is right. We started with his claim that in 2010 - the first year of McDonnell’s term - Virginia’s average monthly unemployment rate rose .1 percent to 6.9 percent. That’s true, but it provides an skewed picture. That’s because when McDonnell was inaugurated in January 2010, the state unemployment rate was 7.2 percent -- its highest point of the year. The rate slowly declined the rest of the year and ended at 6.6 percent by December, ranking Virginia 9th lowest in the nation. In other words, the unemployment rate improved during McDonnell’s first year as governor. And one could make an argument that, when it comes to computing the monthly average for 2010, McDonnell was hurt by a relatively high unemployment rate he inherited from his predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine. Moran doesn’t go there. Nor does he mention that Virginia’s monthly unemployment rate in 2009 -- Kaine’s last full year in office -- increased from 5.7 percent in January to 7.2 percent in December. We’re not pointing this out to say one governor performed better that the other. Economists have repeatedly told us that governors have a limited impact on employment in their states. We’re merely pointing out that there’s a variety of ways to interpret these statistics. Virginia’s 6.9 percent unemployment rate for 2010 was far better than the national rate of 9.6 percent. Let’s turn to Moran’s second assertion, that percentage of working-age Virginians with jobs fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. His numbers are correct. We were curious whether the percentage of the state’s population with jobs continued to improve throughout 2010 just like the unemployment rate did. To the contrary, the numbers got worse. The percentage of employed working-age Virginians declined from 64.3 percent in January to 63.9 percent in December. So, as Moran says the population growth did indeed outpace job growth in 2010. But is that McDonnell’s fault? Howard Wial, an economist and fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, is dismissive of Moran’s use of the BLS statistics to to fault McDonnell. "I’m not saying the governor is right that he’s been a wonderful job creator or that the Democrats are right in saying he hasn’t been," Wial said. "I’m just saying that these numbers don’t prove anything either way … They don’t show you any connection between public policy and results." Virginia, with 64.1 percent of its working age population employed last year, out-performed the national average of 58.5 percent. Just like Virginia, the national percentage of working age people who were employed declined by .8 percent from 2009 to 2010. At the end of Kaine’s term, the percentage of employed working-age Virginians fell by 1.8 percent -- from 66.7 percent in 2008 to 64.9 percent in 2009. So the same argument Moran uses to disparage McDonnell’s performance could also be hurled at Kaine. Let’s review. Moran uses two sets of data to prove his point that job growth lagged a rise in population during McDonnell’s first year as governor. He says Virginia’s the average of Virginia’s monthly unemployment rates rose in 2010.While technically correct, a month-to-month review shows the unemployment rate was at a high point when McDonnell took office in January and fell throughout the year. Moran’s use of the annual unemployment rates is misleading and cloaks that improvement. Moran also cites a drop in the percentage of working-age Virginians who were employed last year. The numbers certainly confirm his claim that state job growth did not keep pace with population growth. So he’s right on the trend, but it’s questionable whether the sluggish job environment can be laid at the feet of a governor who has been in office for a year. While there is some truth in Moran’s statement, he also uses a misleading figure to paint an inaccurate picture of the jobs situation under McDonnell. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-14690	Every "one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been" in "gun-free zones."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/13/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-two-mass-shootings-1950-occurred-/	Dan Patrick of Texas hinted he’d like to ease access to guns, then lofted a historical claim making us wonder. The Republican lieutenant governor appeared on NBC’s Jan. 3, 2016 edition of Meet the Press as the Texas law permitting licensed individuals to openly carry holstered handguns took effect. Patrick told host Chuck Todd he wants to see a day "when every American citizen can simply have a gun, does not have to go through a long ordeal or pay a high price. We're going to address that in Texas, as well. Because it's the right of every individual under the Second Amendment." Then came the historical note: "Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing," Patrick said. "In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been" in "gun-free zones," his implication being that wrongdoers don’t open fire in places where permitted citizens may have loaded handguns. That’s at least a disputed analysis. In April 2013, Mother Jones magazine said its review of more than five dozen U.S. "mass shootings" since 1982 hadn’t identified a single case of a killer choosing a target because it barred guns nor had it found an instance of an armed civilian saving the day. "To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings," the magazine said. "Or consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck," the story said. Moreover, the magazine said, the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides, arguably not involving perpetrators "whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack." So, how did Patrick determine that only two mass shootings since 1950 occurred in places that weren’t gun-free zones? A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, declined comment on that, but web searches and interviews identified the likely originator of the two-since-1950 claim as economist John Lott Jr., whose books include "More Guns, Less Crime" and "The Bias Against Guns." Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, also is a Fox News columnist. In a January 2013 blog post, Lott said: "Since at least 1950, with two exceptions, all the multiple victim public shootings in the US in which more than three people have been killed have taken place where guns are banned." In a 2014 web post, the center said: "There are only two mass public shootings since at least 1950 that have not been part of some other crime where at least four people have been killed in an area where civilians are generally allowed to have guns. These are the International House of Pancakes restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, on September 6, 2011 and the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011." Defining "mass shooting" Generally we take a gun-free zone to mean a place where civilians can’t legally carry handguns. That’s in the spirit of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, revised by Congress in 1996, which states it’s unlawful for an individual to knowingly carry a firearm that’s been part of interstate or foreign commerce in a school zone or within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But "mass shooting" has had a range of definitions. In a 1996 paper, Lott and a fellow researcher presented a multi-part definition ruling out incidents connected to other crimes and applying other limits. The paper defined "a multiple public shooting as one in which two or more people are killed or wounded in a church, business, bar, street, government buildings, schools, public transit, place of employment, park, health care facility, mall or restaurant. We excluded multiple shootings that were byproducts of other crimes (e.g., a robbery or drug deal) or that involved gang activity (e.g., drive-by shootings), professional hits or organized crime. We also did not count as a multiple shooting serial killings or killings that took place over the span of more than one day," the authors wrote. There are less restrictive definitions. A 2008 FBI report said that over the previous 30 years, a mass murder was described as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders. A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service said there’s no agreed-upon definition of "mass shooting," so it would define public mass shootings as "incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately." Meantime, an FBI spokesman, Stephen Fischer, advised us by email that a 2012 law set the threshold for a "mass killing" as three or more people killed. Mother Jones magazine, in research last updated in December 2015, employed a four-or-more killed definition to conclude that since 1982, there had been at least 73 U.S. mass shootings--meaning public incidents in which four or more people died and the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing. Still, in an August 2012 story, Mother Jones suggested that classifying a mass murder based on a death count or lack of ties to other crimes could seem arbitrary. "Dropping the number of fatalities by just one, or including motives of armed robbery, gang violence, or domestic violence, would add many, many more cases," the magazine said. Lott summarizes research We reached out to Lott, who estimated by phone there had been about 200 mass shootings since 1950. By email, he sent spreadsheets that he said show how he and other researchers catalogued incidents from 1977 to the present. A result, Lott said, is the conclusion that just the two mass shootings occurred where civilians could legally carry handguns. No signs barred people from bringing handguns into the Nevada restaurant or the Tucson parking lot, Lott said, and both states permitted licensed citizens to carry handguns. We asked Lott about the Aug. 1, 1966, incident when Charles Whitman shot and killed people from atop the University of Texas tower as residents with rifles fired from below; Whitman died after a police officer subdued him from close range. Civilians wielded weapons that day, no? Lott said he classified UT as a gun-free zone because under Texas law until 1996, residents couldn’t legally carry handguns in public except under limited circumstances. Lott, asked how he delved into incidents from 1950 to 1977, pointed out an April 2000 New York Times news story on 100 U.S. "rampage killings" from 1949 to 1999. The 100 cases included 20 shootings at schools, 11 at restaurants or shopping malls and 32 at the killer's workplace, the newspaper reported. There were 102 killers, it said, with 425 people killed and 510 injured. We couldn’t tell if the Times determined whether citizens could carry handguns at the shooting sites. Lott told us his research determined, in each Times-listed instance, if laws allowed civilians in a city or state to get gun permits and to carry handguns. He emailed us a map indicating that as of 1986, 29 states allowed civilians to carry handguns and 21 states (including Texas) did not; by 2003, 44 states allowed civilians to carry handguns. An alternate analysis We spotted a short-term breakdown countering Lott’s all-but-two conclusion, though the center headed by Lott maintains it’s wrong. In a 2014 report, Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group, said that from 2009 to July 2014, 18 multiple-victim U.S. shootings--meaning any incident where at least four people were killed with a gun--occurred in places where civilian handguns were allowed. Of 33 incidents in public spaces, the report said, 18 took place wholly or in part where concealed guns could be lawfully carried. Conversely, no more than 15 incidents "took place entirely in public spaces that were so-called ‘gun-free zones,’" the report said. Jack Warner, an Everytown spokesman, told us by email that a 2010 shooting incident in a Hialeah, Florida, restaurant later was removed from its count; the establishment was a gun-free zone. Seventeen is far more than two, of course, and the Everytown report covered less than six years, far fewer than the 65 years referenced by Lott. Might it be that far more shootings have taken place in locations where a licensed citizen could legally hoist a handgun? Questioning the report, the Lott-led center charged in a September 2014 web post that nearly half the incidents described as occurring where civilians could carry handguns took place either as parts of other crimes or in non-public locations and so shouldn’t have been deemed mass shootings--or the shootings actually took place in gun-free zones such as a Wisconsin temple where guns weren’t allowed, according to a Fox News report authored by John Lott’s son, Maxim, though Mother Jones in 2013 reported that guns were allowed in the temple. The center’s critique gives a taste of Lott’s investigatory approach. According to the post, Lott followed up the March 2009 shooting deaths of eight people in a North Carolina nursing home by calling the home and hearing that neither the home’s residents or staff had been allowed to bring in guns. In another case, after the 2012 shooting deaths of four people at a Georgia spa, Lott "spoke with someone at the spa after the attack and was told that the killer knew ‘nobody there had a gun.’ ...While the official policy at the spa isn’t clear because the conversation was very short," the center wrote, "the important thing was that the killer knew that there were no guns for people to defend themselves there." There’s room for quibbling with the center’s critique perhaps in that one of the center’s declared gun-free zones was the Washington Navy Yard, which is fronted by armed guards. We noticed this note in a Lott spreadsheet summarizing that attack: "There were armed guards at the Washington Navy Yard, and the shooter was familiar with the premises, so he did not select it as a target on the presumption he would not face armed resistance. In fact, the shooter reportedly used a gun that he took from a guard after killing him." Regardless, Lott told us by email, the shooter knew that past the guard station, he wouldn’t encounter armed individuals. Lott’s note in his spreadsheet summarizing an August 2010 incident in Buffalo lays out his contention that even if civilians legally may have handguns, that’s often unlikely to occur; the note quotes a police inspector saying local authorities virtually never give out gun permits other than for sportsmen to carry weapons for hunting. In the same vein, the center’s 2014 critique said several shootings tallied by the Everytown group occurred in places -- such as Boston, East Oakland and Los Angeles -- where authorities rarely if ever grant handgun permits. By email, Warner gave no ground, saying state and local laws made it legally possible in each of the cited shootings for a civilian to have been present with a handgun. Also, "narrowing the definition of ‘gun-free zone’ to exclude locations where armed police were stationed does not make sense," Warner wrote. An FBI study A 2013 FBI review of "active shooter incidents" since 2000 identified five instances when shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement exchanged gunfire with the shooters; three shooters were killed, one was wounded, one committed suicide. "The individuals involved in these shootings included a citizen with a valid firearms permit and armed security guards at a church, an airline counter, a federally managed museum, and a school board meeting," the report said. The report gave more detail about a civilian’s intervention in a Nevada incident. In May 2008, the report said, Ernesto Villagomez, 30, armed with a handgun, began firing inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. Two people were killed; two were wounded (leaving the results short of the three or four deaths needed to be a mass shooting by most definitions). "The shooter was killed by a citizen with a valid firearm permit before police arrived," the report said. Our ruling Patrick said every "one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been" in "gun-free zones." The Lott-steered research delivers a basis for this statement. But this all-but-two assessment also rests on how you define a mass shooting or gun-free zone. Change the definitions to take in more events and you end up with more shootings in places that weren’t otherwise free of guns. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01556	More people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week "than are born in Texas each week."	true	/texas/statements/2014/sep/12/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-border-patrol-apprehends-more-imm/	State Sen. Dan Patrick put a numerical twist on the U.S.-Mexico border situation, saying that more border crossers are being apprehended than babies are being born in Texas. In a July 21, 2014, appearance on Laura Ingraham’s radio program, Patrick, the 2014 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, said: "Just two weeks ago, we apprehended almost 10,000 people crossing the border--in one week, Laura." After explanation about those numbers, Patrick continued, "If we apprehend eight or nine thousand a week, that’s more people than are born in Texas each week." Ingraham drew in her breath--and we wondered about Patrick’s border apprehensions and Texas births comparison. To our inquiry, Patrick campaign spokesman Alejandro Garcia said by phone Patrick picked up on the comparison from a briefing by state officials when he was in the Rio Grande Valley in June 2014. The comparison, Garcia said, illustrates the seriousness of border apprehensions. By email, Garcia pointed us to a U.S. Border Patrol chart showing annual apprehensions in the Southwest Border sector, meaning the southern border running from Brownsville to San Diego. In the federal fiscal year that ran through September 2013, there were 414,397 apprehensions in the sector, counting 243,550 along the Texas portion of the border, according to the chart. (As we’ve noted before, an "apprehension" is an arrest for being in the United States without authorization, but it’s worth noting the number of people detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once.) Garcia also noted a Texas Department of State Health Services web page indicating that in 2010, 385,746 babies were born in the state So, U.S-Mexico border apprehensions in 2012-13 outnumbered Texas births in 2010. Up-to-date data Recognizing this information didn’t enable an apples-to-apples comparison -- the births occurred three years before the apprehensions -- we looked for the latest available information on apprehensions and births. By email, Christine Mann of the Texas Department of State of Health Services gave us "provisional" monthly birth tallies for 2013 and 2014. Separately, Doug Mosier, an El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman, provided a chart indicating monthly apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2012 through early September 2014. This enabled us to compare apprehensions and births by month for all of 2013 and the first six months of 2014. Result: Apprehensions outnumbered births in 11 of the 18 months including the latest months, February through June 2014. Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in January 2013; July through September 2013; and November 2013 through January 2014. For the sake of gauging Patrick’s claim over the latest full year of data available when he spoke, we looked at totals covering July 2013 through June 2014. In those months, there were about 393,299 births in Texas, according to the state. Meantime, the Border Patrol tallied 480,404 apprehensions. But monthly apprehensions fluctuated considerably, ranging from a low of 28,671 in January 2014 to a high of 60,689 in May 2014 (when 17,888 apprehended immigrants were 17 years old or younger). Of note, Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in the border region in half the months, most recently January 2014 when the 33,089 births compared to 28,671 apprehensions. So, apprehensions outnumbered births in the 12 months by 87,105, or 22 percent. By our calculation, that is, there were an average of 9,213 weekly apprehensions and 7,543 Texas weekly births. Footnote: Apprehensions outnumbering Texas births looks like a new development. For instance in the federal fiscal year of 2012, 380,140 babies were born in Texas while the Border Patrol had 356,873 apprehensions near the southwestern border. The same was so in fiscal 2011, when 380,481 children were born in Texas and the Border Patrol apprehended 327,577. Divide that down into a weekly rate, and in both years, births in Texas outnumbered apprehensions along the Mexico border. Our ruling Patrick said each week, more people are apprehended after entering the U.S. by illegally crossing the Mexico/U.S. border than are born in Texas. According to state and federal figures, that was so in each of the five months preceding Patrick’s radio interview. It’s worth noting that when apprehensions sufficiently decrease -- as in six of the previous seven months -- this claim wouldn’t hold. This claim was solid when Patrick spoke. We rate it True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01264	"I’ll be the only economist in the (U.S.) House."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/09/dave-brat/brat/	In case you haven’t heard, newly elected U.S. Rep. Dave Brat is an economist. And that background, the Republican said repeatedly in campaign speeches and ads, puts him in a unique position to lead in Washington. "If you do send me up there, and I’d be honored if you do, I’ll be the only economist in the House," Brat, R-7th, told voters at an Ashland rally on Oct. 15. Well, 7th District voters are sending him up there. So we decided to check whether Brat truly will be one of a kind. Let’s start by examining what economists do. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "economists study the production and distribution of resources, goods and services by collecting and analyzing data, researching trends and evaluating economic issues." They forecast market trends and advise businesses and governments on economic issues. What qualifies one as an economist? "There is no formal definition for ‘economist,’ although the usual distinction is that one has earned a Ph.D. in economics," John Siegfried, the secretary-treasurer emeritus of the American Economic Association, said in an email. "But anyone can call themselves ‘an economist.’" The BLS says generally most economist jobs require a master’s degree or Ph.D., although some are available to people with bachelor’s degrees in the field. Brat holds a Ph.D. in economics from American University, has been a professor at Randolph-Macon College since 1996 and chairman of its Department of Economics and Business since 2005. He’s served two Virginia governors on the Joint Advisory Board of Economists and advised a number of other organizations. Brat is an avowed believer in free markets who says his hero is Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics who maintained that government should wield a feather hand on the marketplace. Brat, according to The New York Times, is not known for groundbreaking research of his own. How did Brat conclude he’ll be the only economist in the House? Brian Gottstein, spokesman for Brat’s campaign, said the information came from Congressional Quarterly, which compiles profiles for each member of Congress. "We did not count those House members that have undergraduate economics degrees but aren’t career economists," Gottstein e-mailed. We found a January 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service that breaks down House members’ occupations into 20 categories which, unfortunately, did not include economists. Almost half of the members had careers either in law, business or banking. Another CRS report from August, although not exhaustive, drilled down a little further on the occupations of members of Congress. It lists, among other things, five former Peace Corps volunteers, four radio talk show hosts, three psychologists, two almond orchard owners, one rodeo announcer and zero economists. The House clerk’s office lists 21 Ph.D. holders in the chamber. But none of their doctorates, we found, are in economics. Twenty-seven members have undergraduate degrees in economics, according to a CQ database of the various educational degrees and occupations each congressmen lists on his resume. Only two members have "economist" listed as a former job: Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., who also has done stints as a congressional aide and a public relations manager at a publishing firm. Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif, says he was an economist for the Environmental Protection Agency during 1980-81. He subsequently became a lawyer. Our ruling Brat said he would be the only economist in the House. We only found two members who list economist among the jobs they’ve held before entering Congress. Both went on to other professions. Brat has been an economics professor since 1996 and would be the only congressman with a Ph.D. in the field. We’ll leave it to you decide whether Brat’s distinct background will better enable Congress to resolve economic issues. But as for his claim of uniqueness, we rate it True.

pomt-02139	Under his leadership, more people in Wisconsin "have access to health care."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/07/scott-walker/despite-gov-scott-walkers-opposition-obamacare-do-/	On the day he officially launched his re-election campaign, Gov. Scott Walker unveiled a folksy sort of TV ad contending that many things in Wisconsin have improved since he took office. One claim about health care caused a number of readers to contact us. The ad, released April 15, 2014, begins with the narrator saying: "It had gotten pretty bad four years ago. Over 130,000 jobs lost. A deficit over 3 billion. And taxes going up. Wisconsin's future looked dark." Then come the claims. "But it's different now. Wisconsin has turned around. The deficit is gone. Taxes are lower. And more people have gone back to work. "Kids are going to college. Families are planning vacations and more are going to sleep knowing they have access to health care." Walker has famously opposed Obamacare. On the other hand, he expanded Medicaid eligibility in Wisconsin. So, just how much credit does he deserve for more Wisconsinites having access to health care? The lay of the land We’ll start by acknowledging there isn’t a universally accepted definition of "access to health care," although the phrase carries a presumption that the care is affordable -- another vague term. To take it to an extreme, people could technically have access to health care even if all they could afford is private insurance with premiums that ate up half of their paychecks. But that would be nothing to brag about. At the same time, there is little debate that access has increased since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, some 10 months before Walker took office. Among other things, under Obamacare: No one can be turned down for health insurance coverage because of a medical condition; children can be covered under a parent’s policy until age 26; subsidies are available for low- and middle-income people who don’t get insurance from an employer; lifetime caps on health insurance benefits are eliminated; and, quite simply, the law carries a mandate that nearly all Americans carry at least a basic level of coverage. In Wisconsin, according to an actuarial firm that did a report in 2011 for the state, the Obamacare premium subsidies and mandate are expected to increase the number of residents with health insurance by 340,000 by 2016. So, where does that leave Walker? The Republican governor fought Obamacare in court. And he refused what was termed a full expansion of Medicaid under the law that would have been paid for 100 percent initially, eventually declining to 90 percent, by the federal government. Walker's evidence To back Walker’s claim, his campaign cited a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected national authority on health care, and an October 2013 news release from the state Department of Health Services about the report. The news release said that -- even though Wisconsin would not expand Medicaid eligibility as provided under Obamacare -- all Wisconsin residents nevertheless "will have access to affordable health care" as a result of the way Walker "reformed" Medicaid. So, what was the reform? Walker expanded Medicaid (known as BadgerCare Plus in Wisconsin) to cover adults who previously were not eligible for the program – basically those below the poverty threshold and without dependent children. (The federal government will pay about 60 percent of the cost, just as it does for other adults covered by the state’s Medicaid programs.) But adults with incomes above the poverty threshold previously covered by BadgerCare Plus are now required to buy subsidized private insurance on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act. Even after the federal subsidies, they will have higher premiums and cost-sharing – arguably, less access to health care – than they had with BadgerCare Plus. In other words, Walker is financing his Medicaid expansion with the money the state will save by moving the less-poor adults from Medicaid to the subsidized private plans sold in the Obamacare marketplace. The catch is, Wisconsin could have opted to expand the Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act at a lower cost to the state – roughly $100 million lower in the first two years – and a lower cost to many of the people who are losing their coverage under BadgerCare Plus. The upshot of Walker’s move? We don’t know yet. But an estimated 83,000 more people became eligible for Medicaid, while 77,000 were removed from Medicaid -- a net gain, of sorts, of 6,000 people, according to the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, a group that is a frequent Walker critic and which advocated for the full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Our rating Walker said that under his leadership as governor, more people in Wisconsin "have access to health care." He can take some of the credit, given that everyone living under the federal poverty line is now eligible for Medicaid. But far more people are getting access to health care, whether from the government or private carriers, as a result of Obamacare. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15133	The nuclear agreement with Iran "never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/03/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-iran-nuclear-agreement-never-sunse/	President Barack Obama achieved a significant victory on Sept. 2, 2015, when enough Democratic senators announced that they would support the Iran nuclear agreement to effectively secure its passage despite the opposition of most, if not all, congressional Republicans. Earlier that day, Secretary of State John Kerry -- a key player in negotiating the agreement -- appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe as part of a back-to-back appearance with two foes of the agreement, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney, a foreign policy veteran in her own right. At one point, Kerry responded to Liz Cheney’s claim that the agreement "sunsets," thus allowing Iran the relatively unfettered ability to proceed with a nuclear weapon. "No, it never sunsets," Kerry said. "There's no sunset in this agreement. There is a 10-year, extra-strong restraint on what they can do. There's a 15-year restraint on what they can do. There is a 20-year restraint. There's a 25-year restraint, which requires all their uranium to be tracked from the mine to the grave. But the Additional Protocol and the requirement to live under access and inspection is for the lifetime of this agreement. So Iran is never free to go move towards a weapon. That is just a misstatement that is repeated again and again and again by the opponents." We thought we’d take a closer look at Kerry’s claim that nuclear agreement with Iran "never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement." What a denial of 'sunsets' overlooks Generally speaking, we found that Kerry’s description includes elements of both truth and spin -- as do the arguments made by the deal’s opponents that prompted Kerry to make this claim. On the one hand, Kerry’s vigorous denial that any sunsets exist "in this agreement" is not entirely accurate. As Kerry himself subsequently points out, a number of provisions of the agreement expire over time. Several provisions last for 10 years, including a limit of 5,060 operating centrifuges and curbs on research and development on advanced centrifuges. Other provisions last for 15 years, including a variety of caps on uranium enrichment, international inspector access in no more than 24 days, and prohibitions on new heavy-water reactors and reprocessing. Meanwhile, continuous surveillance of centrifuge production areas would last for 20 years, while continuous surveillance of uranium mines and mills would last for 25 years. Each of these time-limited provisions -- which collectively form important bulwarks of the agreement -- would seem to qualify as "sunsets" by any reasonable definition. In a statement to PolitiFact, State Department spokesperson John Kirby argued that it’s more important to focus on the entirety of the agreement and its goal of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands. He pointed to paragraph 2 of the main text of the agreement, which says, "The full implementation of this (agreement) will ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme." "Note that there is no time limit on that," Kirby said. "And in the very next paragraph, the agreement states, ‘Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.’ While some of the specific measures within the deal are time-limited, the entirety of the deal is what keeps Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon." Where Kerry has a point Meanwhile, critics of the agreement have also gone too far by implying, and sometimes outright stating, that the deal’s leverage will almost entirely dissipate once certain elements of the agreement expire. After the expirations occur, "the mullahs can crank up their nuclear program at will and produce as much enriched uranium as they want," wrote columnist Charles Krauthammer when key details from the eventual deal were released last February. "Sanctions lifted. Restrictions gone. Nuclear development legitimized. … A few years — probably around 10 — of good behavior and Iran would be home free. The agreement thus would provide a predictable path to an Iranian bomb." Experts, however, say this argument against the agreement is an exaggeration. Scrutiny and limits on Iran don’t simply drop to zero after 10, 15, 20 or 25 years. While a number of the particularly intrusive provisions will lapse, Iran will still be bound -- permanently -- by other curbs on its ability to produce a nuclear weapon. For starters, Iran must comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974. This commits Iran to not pursuing nuclear weapons. It must also ratify the stricter curbs contained in the "Additional Protocol," which expanded the types of sites inspectors could visit on short notice. Iran signed the protocol in 2003 but quit adhering to it three years later and has never ratified it. Under the nuclear deal, Iran must ratify the Additional Protocol within eight years, or else the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany would be able to take punitive action, said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. The agreement also demands that Iran implement "modified Code 3.1," which requires the country to notify the International Atomic Energy Agency when it decides to build a nuclear facility, rather than six months before introducing nuclear material, and to keep the agency informed on changes to designs of existing nuclear sites. "Iran would have the obligation to cooperate with the IAEA in this way in perpetuity," Richard Nephew, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, wrote earlier this year. Iran, he wrote, "would be expected to fulfill the normal requirements of any IAEA-inspected country, whatever those may be, at the time a deal formally concludes. … Nowhere has the United States agreed that Iran would be immunized forever more from international scrutiny after a deal eventually ends." If Iran acted contrary to its obligations, Nephew wrote, "this would permit the United States and its partners to respond with a range of options, up to and including the use of military force." Such ongoing and unending scrutiny provides Kerry with support for his claim that the agreement itself "never sunsets," even if individual elements of the agreement do. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear-policy expert at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, said Kerry’s claim "seems within the bounds of normal optimism by a political figure about the position he’s arguing." Still, Kerry’s claim could lead listeners to believe there’s more permanence in the deal than there actually is. "Kerry’s statement that ‘there’s no sunset in this agreement’ could be interpreted to mean every aspect of the deal lasts in perpetuity," said Angela Canterbury, executive director of the Council for a Livable World Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. "Had he said, ‘this deal does not sunset,’ his statement would have been more accurate." Added Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation: "One can make the case, as Secretary Kerry does, that the agreement never sunsets. On the other hand, its key provisions expire." Our ruling Kerry said the nuclear agreement with Iran "never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement." He’s right that the agreement as a whole does live on, and scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear ambitions will continue indefinitely under both earlier agreements and certain provisions within the nuclear deal. But his statement glosses over the fact that a number of key elements of the agreement do expire in 10, 15, 20 or 25 years. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00672	"Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/11/katrina-shankland/democrat-says-republicans-cut-three-school-budgets/	When new tax revenue failed to materialize during budget deliberations, Democrats in the state Legislature reminded voters that majority Republicans had pledged to backfill some of Gov. Scott Walker’s cuts to public education. "Now Republican legislators must answer to the people of Wisconsin: Where is the money they promised and why are our public schools last in line?" asked state Rep. Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point, who is assistant Democratic leader. "Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row," Shankland said in a news release on May 6, 2015. "They’ve perpetrated the largest cut to public education in our state’s history while funneling millions of public dollars into unaccountable private schools." That’s a lot to chew on. In 2012 we rated True a claim by Democrat Kathleen Falk that in his first two-year budget, Scott Walker enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history." That claim covered both kindergarten-12th grade schools and the public university system. But experts said Walker’s K-12 cuts were the biggest ever. Now we’ll rate Shankland’s claim that "Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row." It’s clear she meant Walker’s first two budgets, plus the proposed 2015-’17 budget that legislators are still working on: Republicans have controlled the Legislature and governor’s office since Walker’s election in 2010. Asked to back up the claim, Shankland aide Annika Petty explained that according to the office’s calculations, Walker and fellow Republicans have cut general state aid to local schools by $1.4 billion under the 2011-’13 and 2013-’15 enacted budgets plus the governor’s proposed 2015-’17 plan. She gets that number by comparing the funding level before Walker’s arrival to that in each of the six years since, and adding up the difference. The funding, in each of those six years, is lower than the amount from the last pre-Walker budget year, 2010-'11. So in that sense, Republicans have come up short of the Doyle mark in each of the last three budgets (though the outcome of the current budget is pending). But there’s another much more common way to view this: Looking at how each budget compares to the final year of the previous budget. That’s typically the framework legislators use during budget deliberations. Each new budget uses the expiring budget as a starting point. Walker’s first enacted budget cut general aids by 8 percent compared to the pre-Walker base year. But the second budget enacted under Walker actually added back some of the cuts. Funding went up 2 percent over the first Republican budget. In the third, pending budget, there’s a 2.6 percent increase over the previous budget. So by the typical way of looking at budgets in Madison, Republicans have cut once and added back twice. (Two notes: Doyle cut general school funding in his last budget, breaking with decades of increases. And general-aid trends vary by school district. In the last four years, between 56 percent and 97 percent of school districts saw aid reductions from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, that trend flipped; a bare majority saw increases). Budget watchers with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research organization, said Shankland’s method overstate the cuts because of the way it takes a base year and compares it to six subsequent years. Todd Berry, president of the group, also noted that some of Walker’s Act 10 law resulted in significant savings for many school districts, helping to offset some or all of the cuts. But Berry said the aid money Republicans added back might not have mattered in many cases because the state placed tight limits on what school districts could raise in total from property taxes and state aid. Finally, we note that Shankland focused on general state aid, but school officials say that Walker’s pending budget would cut a more crucial form of special-purpose aid (categorical aids, in Madison parlance) over the two years from 2015-'17. Our rating Shankland claimed that "Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row." There’s an element of truth in her claim in that general school aid is lower in Walker’s proposed third budget than it was before he took office. But it’s misleading to say three budgets "in a row" made cuts, when two of them actually restored some of the general aid lost in Walker’s first budget. We rate Shankland’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-00578	"We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years."	true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-cut-13000-state-workforce-jobs-go/	Before announcing that he was going to announce his presidential candidacy, former Gov. Jeb Bush told a crowd at an Orlando event that he was dedicated to conservative principles like reducing the size of government. "We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years," he said on June 2, 2015, at Gov. Rick Scott’s Economic Growth Summit at Walt Disney World. He also touted high job-creation numbers during his term. Bush is expected to officially announce his candidacy on June 15. Meanwhile, we wondered whether his claim about shrinking the state government workforce passed muster. Working through the cuts Bush served two terms between 1999 and the start of 2007, and proposed cutting 25 percent of state employees early in his term. He didn’t cut that many, but he did oversee a reduction in state workers. His Right to Rise PAC sent us state payroll numbers from Bush’s tenure that backed the claim. A Bush spokesman said the data came from the Legislature’s General Appropriations Act (i.e., the approved state budget) each year, minus workers for the State University System and temporary employees for which the governor’s office isn’t responsible. These are legitimate numbers, but can be hard to parse. To find them in the annual budget, which usually clocks in at more than 400 pages, you’d have to add them up from the positions listed for each state agency. You can sift through each budget if you’d like, but we decided to look at it a slightly different way to make it a little simpler for you to gauge, using the state’s Department of Management Services Annual Workforce Report. That’s a general snapshot of state personnel, how much they make and what jobs they do. Part of that count is the State Personnel System, which includes about two-thirds of state employees in more than 30 different agencies and departments. It also excludes university and temporary jobs, and a few others. The numbers aren’t exactly the same as what Bush’s PAC provided, but the State Personnel System shows who is employed by state agencies at any given time. Year General Appropriations Act State Personnel System employees 1998-99 127,363 124,838 1999-2000 126,723 124,160 2000-01 125,007 123,505 2001-02 120,091 120,581 2002-03 117,869 117,561 2003-04 116,797 115,504 2004-05 116,317 113,030 2005-06 116,463 108,706 2006-07 113,633 108,866 Total change -13,730 -15,972 Percent change -10.8 percent -12.8 percent Either way you slice it, Bush can claim the state workforce he had a say over did shrink during his tenure, generally in the terms he noted. The Annual Workforce Report has the added bonus of keeping track of how many employees an agency gains or loses each year. That shows that departments like Children and Families, Health, and Corrections all lost plenty of positions under Bush, who focused on privatizing state services. That privatization of government work has been controversial. For example, contractors working for the Department of Children and Families have been criticized for cost overruns and running an ineffective, or even dangerous, privatized foster care program. Similar problems have been debated for contracts with payroll services and privately run prisons, among others. Florida International University public administration professors Howard Frank and David Guo said that instead of focusing on how many state jobs were eliminated, it’s better to consider whether the moves really saved the state money. The Department of Management Services doesn’t dissect the differences between jobs that were cut and the contracts that replaced them. That makes it difficult to untangle exactly how much the state may have saved by privatizing, automating or consolidating government positions. The state now has the lowest number of government workers per capita in the United States. But Bush’s workforce cuts between 1999 and 2007 came as the state’s population ballooned by about 3.5 million and the budget jumped from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion. Our ruling Bush said, "We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years." He was referring to a specific count of workers in state agencies cut between 1999 and 2007, and in context we can consider his numbers pretty accurate. Experts told us it’s important to keep in mind that privatizing state jobs or cutting positions doesn’t mean it’s necessarily cheaper or better for taxpayers. The statement, however, is accurate, and we rate it True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-09T09:51:36	2015-06-02	['None']
pomt-12641	Says Florida officials amended a contract from Lockheed Martin from 305 promised jobs to six.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/27/richard-corcoran/fact-checking-florida-house-speakers-claim-about-l/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran sharpened his ax against economic incentives by calling out companies with state deals by name. Corcoran singled out aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin during a speech at the Panhandle Tiger Bay Club on March 17. Corcoran told a story about the company as an example of how easy it is to walk back ambitious job goals prescribed in state incentive contracts. "I say, I promise you 305 jobs, and then I come back to you and say, ‘Hey, I'm not close on the jobs. Can you help me out?’ You know what they do? ‘No problem, we'll amend your contract. How many jobs can you deliver?’ Six. ‘Fine. Now, the contract says you will deliver six jobs.’ And then we go out and tout it community to community as a success." Corcoran continued: "That’s a true story, Lockheed Martin." We wondered if there is evidence that a Lockheed Martin contract was amended to reduce the number of new jobs that needed to be created from 305 to just six. Corcoran’s story has some truth but oversimplifies what happened. What the state recommended at first Lockheed Martin has multiple facilities throughout the state, including in Orlando and Ocala, and is involved in more than one job incentive project on job deals, according to state data. Corcoran was referring to a $4 million incentive deal for a facility in Oldsmar, located in northern Pinellas County. In September 2012, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, an agency created in 2011 to oversee incentive programs, informed the Legislature about a proposed deal between Enterprise Florida and Lockheed Martin to bring jobs to Pinellas County. (The DEO has to notify the Legislature when an incentive deal of this kind worth more than $2 million is being considered.) DEO provided the Legislature the first outline of the deal for Lockheed Martin's Pinellas facility, which was signed by Gov. Rick Scott. Part of the plan hinged on whether Lockheed Martin would win the bid for a contract to develop and build the U.S. Navy’s new Air and Missile Defense Radar, or AMDR. Lockheed Martin officials had said its other facilities in the Northeast were also in competition with Oldsmar for the gig. The outline said: "If Lockheed Martin wins the AMDR contract and chooses to complete the work in Pinellas County, the company will create 305 new and retain 554 full time jobs over the life of this project." Based on the document, Lockheed Martin and the DEO wanted to use the extra cash to renovate the Oldsmar facility and invest more in manufacturing equipment. This would make the facility more competitive with the other companies bidding for the defense contract. "Anything that Lockheed Martin can do to help make the project more economically feasible helps to create a more competitive bid," reads the 2012 document. The recommendation was for the state to award the company $4 million in one chunk once the facility held 726 jobs, showed a $14 million capital investment, and maintained an average wage of $59,000. Corcoran’s team said the draft of the project was presented to the Legislature as a done deal. But that’s not how the DEO sees it. 305 jobs taken out before final contract DEO press secretary Morgan McCord said the agency informed the Legislature during the negotiation period that the recommended job metrics were being changed. Those revisions came about a month before the contract was signed and executed. McCord sent over a copy of an email sent to legislative leadership and budget staff on April 16, 2013, that went over the changes. That email shows DEO and Lockheed Martin agreed to revise a projected job creation and payment schedule. The result was a new goal: the retention of 560 jobs — just six more than the earlier draft — for an average of 700 jobs by 2022. Why the change? DEO officials still believed Lockheed Martin was in the running for the defense contract, but the company would not need to ramp up its new jobs as high as originally thought. It would be hard to "precisely estimate" job levels every year over the term of the agreement, the contract said. "As a result, the company has requested that it set a job target number (560) to be reached at a minimum each performance year to qualify for the closing fund award," reads the emailed explanation for the changes in payment conditions. Here's more detail: Here's what Corcoran was calling out: the new minimum target is 560 jobs a year instead of 554. That's six more jobs. Lockheed Martin doesn’t necessarily have to meet the 700-job average every year in order to get state dollars; it just needs to hit the 560-job minimum. The DEO document said the overall goal of the project "remains the same: the retention and expansion of the company's manufacturing operations in the City of Oldsmar." Scott approved the revisions. The contract was finalized on May 30, 2013. Lockheed Martin didn’t find out until late October 2013 that it wasn’t awarded the AMDR contract. (It went to Raytheon.) An amended contract was approved May 26, 2015 to reflect the fact that Lockheed Martin did not win the defense contract. This change did not alter job creation requirements, wage requirements, capital investment or return on investment under the final terms of the contract. Those stipulate that in order to get the first seven $500,000 payments from the state between 2016 to 2022, Lockheed Martin must retain 560 jobs every year. In order to get the final $500,000 payment, it has to have at least 700 jobs in year eight and average at least 700 jobs in the previous seven years. Despite losing the missile defense bid, Lockheed Martin told the DEO that it was still committed to growing its Oldsmar facility and said it would stay committed to the key terms of the project that were agreed upon in 2013. Lockheed Martin has not received any money yet for 2016. The DEO and a third-party auditor are reviewing the company's performance for 2016. If the the company met its performance requirements, it will receive the first $500,000 payment. Our ruling Corcoran said the state reworked an incentive contract with Lockheed Martin after the company asked to lower its job creation from 305 jobs to six. Corcoran is onto something, but there's additional information readers need to know. State officials recommended Lockheed Martin receive incentive dollars as the company pursued a hefty missile defense contract from the federal government. If awarded, the state incentives contract said Lockheed Martin would create 305 new jobs in Pinellas County. Before the state contract was finalized, state officials agreed to amend the language about 305 jobs so that Lockheed Martin could receive $500,000 a year for seven years as long as it retained at least 560 jobs (six more jobs in addition to 554 already in place). Corcoran left out that the jobs were contingent on a federal grant. With that caveat, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00359	On considering U.S. Supreme Court nominees.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/13/tammy-baldwin/half-flip-tammy-baldwin-partially-shifts-position-/	In her effort to unseat U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Republican Leah Vukmir has repeatedly criticized Baldwin for her quick opposition to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and for not meeting with him. That raises a question over whether Baldwin, a first-term Wisconsin Democrat, has been consistent on her consideration of Supreme Court nominees. During her tenure, one nomination was made by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and two were by Republican President Donald Trump. With the Senate expected to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination before the end of September 2018, let’s go to the Flip-O-Meter to review how Baldwin has considered the three nominees. 1. Merrick Garland March 2016: Obama nominated Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The same day, Baldwin praised Garland, saying he had "strong federal judicial experience." She said: "I now plan to do my job by reviewing Judge Garland’s experience and qualifications for our highest court. I also look forward to meeting with Judge Garland. I hope my Republican colleagues will do the same thing" and give him "fair consideration." April 2016: Baldwin met with Garland, saying it "strengthened my conviction that this is a very well qualified and experienced judge who deserves a hearing and a vote." January 2017: Garland’s nomination expired with the Republican-led Senate refusing to hold a confirmation hearing or vote -- leaving the seat open for Trump to fill. So, Baldwin didn’t state a position on Garland’s nomination and she met with him, prior to any possibility of confirmation hearings being held. And she made a point of saying those not of the same party as the president -- in this case, Republican senators -- should consider Garland’s full record, give it "fair consideration" and meet with him. That would change with the next two nominees. 2. Neil Gorsuch January 2017: Trump announced Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Colorado, as his nominee. The same day, Baldwin criticized the choice, saying Gorsuch had a "deeply troubling record. But she also said she would "fully review" the record, meet with Gorsuch and give his nomination "fair consideration." Two days later, however, Baldwin said she not only would vote against Gorsuch, she would filibuster the pick by forcing Republicans to meet a 60-vote threshold to confirm him. Baldwin said Gorsuch did not have a "mainstream record" and cited judicial rulings of his on cases involving disabled students, workers and women’s reproductive health. February 2017: Baldwin met with Gorsuch and reiterated her plans to vote against him and to support a filibuster against his nomination. The Senate held its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch the next month and he was confirmed by the Senate the following month. To overcome the filibuster, Republicans deployed the so-called nuclear option, voting to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. So, as she did with Garland, Baldwin met with Gorsuch before his confirmation hearing — but it’s hard to argue that the meeting was part of Baldwin giving "fair consideration" to Gorsuch, since she had already come out against him. 3. Brett Kavanaugh July 2018: Trump nominated Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C. He would replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. The same day, Baldwin said she would review his nomination with an eye toward women’s health and other issues. Three days later, Baldwin announced she would not support Kavanaugh, saying he was backed by "powerful special interests." Her statement did not make mention of whether she would meet with him. August 2018: Baldwin reiterated her plans to vote against Kavanaugh, but said she plans to meet with him. She had not done so, however, before his confirmation hearing, which was held in early September 2018. Her campaign told us that Baldwin’s Senate office has reached out to the White House about a meeting but hasn’t received a response. However, other Democratic senators have met with Kavanaugh. Our rating Baldwin met with Garland, who was nominated by Obama, and urged GOP senators to consider his record and to meet with him. She didn’t announce a position on the nomination of Garland, who ultimately was denied a vote by the GOP-controlled Senate. But with Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump, Baldwin announced her opposition almost immediately -- lessening the value of meeting with him, in terms of giving his nomination consideration, though she did meet with him, prior to his confirmation hearing. With Trump nominee Kavanaugh, Baldwin also announced her opposition almost immediately. She says she plans to meet with him, but no meeting occurred before his confirmation hearing. Baldwin’s approach to how she considers Supreme Court nominees has varied in each of the three cases -- with a notable shift for those nominated by a Republican. For a partial change in position, we give her a Half Flip. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-09-13T06:00:00	2018-08-05	['None']
pomt-08623	Loranne Ausley "voted six times to tax your savings."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/20/republican-party-florida/costly-ausley-website-takes-cfo-candidate-task-su/	The Republican Party of Florida launched a website that it says highlights the liberal tax record of Democratic Chief Financial Officer candidate Loranne Ausley. "Get to know tax-and-spend liberal Loranne Ausley, and her costly record," the site www.costlyausley.com starts. On Sept. 16, 2010, the GOP used the website to detail six Ausley votes they say taxed the savings of Floridians. "How Costly is Ausley?" the RPOF asked. "Ausley VOTED SIX TIMES to tax your savings. As a liberal state legislator Loranne Ausley has a costly record of supporting higher taxes, bigger government and more wasteful spending. Ausley even voted SIX TIMES to tax your savings. Just like her liberal friends in Washington, Ausley can't get enough of our money. "Ausley's vote for tax on savings applies to retirement nest eggs -- money you already pay income tax on! So, Ausley is wanting to tax you twice, first on your paycheck and then again on the portion you set aside for retirement. More job-killing policies that hurt our economy and plunge us deeper in debt." The claims come tacked to a computerized image of a manila folder that includes six specific votes -- three in 2001, one in 2004 and two in 2006. The launch of the web attack came with a complimentary press release from the RPOF and a quote from party executive director Ronnie Whitaker. "With a long record of raising taxes, increasing the size of government and stifling Florida's economy, there is much more to reveal about Loranne Ausley," Whitaker said. "Today is just the latest disturbing example of Ausley's job-killing tax hikes for Floridians to know about." Let's see about those tax hikes Whitaker is talking about. The RPOF website references three specific bills -- HB 21 in 2001, HB 791 in 2004 and HB 209 in 2006 -- and lists the corresponding votes for each bill to back up its claim. The bills match with the years Ausley, a lawyer from Tallahassee, served in the Florida House (2001-2008). The legislation in each case deals with Florida's Annual Intangible Personal Property Tax. The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s are not subject to the tax. The tax is paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments. The tax rate was capped at 2 mills ($2 per $1,000 of value) by the state constitution, but the actual rate fluctuated over time. The tax rate increased from 1 mill to 1.5 mills in 1990 and to 2 mills in 1992. Gov. Jeb Bush began a program to phase out the tax upon taking office in January 1999. Before Ausley took office, the tax rate was lowered from 2 mills to 1.5 mills in 1999, and from 1.5 mills to 1 mill in 2000. 2001 votes In 2001 -- during Ausley's first year in the House -- Bush and the Republican-led House proposed lowering the tax rate to .5 mills. The cut in the rate was expected to save Floridians, or cut state revenues, $229.2 million in the first year. The House approved a more modest reduction, to .75 mills, but the Senate failed to go along. In the end, both chambers agreed to raise the amount of holdings exempted from the tax to the first $250,000 in holdings for single filers and $500,000 for married couples (up from $20,000 and $40,000). It also raised the exemption for businesses to $250,000. Democrats opposed both a rate reduction and an increase to the amount of holdings exempt from the tax because the cuts "broke a commitment to needier Floridians who depend on state programs," the Associated Press reported. Democrats also said it was people with heavy stock portfolios -- likely middle- to upper-class Floridians -- who were the only ones getting the help. Ausley voted against the original House plan to cut the rate to .75 mills, and she also voted against raising the exemption thresholds to $250,000 and $500,000. Those are the three votes the RPOF is counting from 2001. She actually cast two votes against the same rate reduction -- the RPOF is counting both votes in its six-vote total. Ausley, we should note, did vote in favor of a Democratic proposal that would have raised the exemption thresholds to $100,000 and $200,000. But the measure was defeated by the Republican majority. To summarize: Ausley voted three times to keep the intangible tax rate and thresholds unchanged and voted once to increase the amount of holdings exempt for taxpayers. The three votes all came out of the same bill, HB 21. (Cuts to the intangible tax had to be delayed to help make up for a $1 billion budget shortfall). 2004 vote In 2004, Republicans proposed repealing the intangible tax entirely over three years. HB 791 would reduce the tax rate to .66 mills in 2005, .33 mills in 2006, and eliminate it entirely starting in 2007. That would translate to lost state revenues -- or taxpayer savings -- of $87.9 million in 2005 and $188.8 million in 2006, according to the state. The bill never came to a vote in the full House. But it did come before the House Appropriations Committee. Ausley, who was a member of the committee, voted against the measure. Summarizing again: Ausley voted, in committee, against a bill that would have phased out the intangible tax over three years. The bill never made it to the full floor of the House. 2006 votes The move to repeal the intangible tax resurfaced in 2006 through HB 209. This time, the measure passed -- 100-20 in the House and 30-9 in the Senate. The tax was eliminated starting Jan. 1, 2007. The state estimated that the repeal saved people who paid the tax (or cost the state) $130.6 million in 2007. Ausley voted against the measure both when it came before the House Fiscal Council and then again when it came to a full floor vote. To recap: The 2006 bill repealed the intangible tax. Ausley voted twice against the bill, once in committee and once on the House floor. Our ruling The statement we're checking in this item is that Ausley "voted six times to tax your savings." Ronnie Whitaker, party executive director, called them "job-killing tax hikes." First, saying "savings" is a bit broad. The tax didn't touch pensions, CDs, savings accounts and 401(k) plans; it applied to investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Second, the votes in question weren't for tax hikes. They were against cutting the state's intangible tax. And there weren't really six of them. The RPOF actually is talking about three bills, and really, four votes -- a vote to lower the intangible tax rate from 1 mill to .75 mill, a vote to raise the exemption amounts, and then two votes to repeal the tax entirely. In each of those cases, Ausley voted "No." Maybe we're sticklers for words -- no maybe about it, we are -- but if we use the RPOF logic that Ausley "voted six times to tax your savings," we could say quite convincingly that Republican U.S. Senate nominee Marco Rubio voted four times to tax your savings -- in one year. Yep, back in 2001, Rubio voted against an amendment offered by Democrats that would have increased the amount that could be exempted from the tax (but not as much as Republicans wanted). That same year he cast three other votes in favor of proposals that would have cut the intangible tax in some form or another, but not eliminate it altogether. By the RPOF logic, because the tax remained in place, Rubio cast four votes to tax your savings. Would we criticize Democrats or independent Charlie Crist if they tried to make that claim? Absolutely. Are we criticizing the Republicans in this case? You betcha. We rate their claim False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-09-20T09:30:55	2010-09-16	['None']

pomt-05237	Rob Portman won the fewest votes of all Ohio U. S. Senate victors since 2000.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/05/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-sen-rob-portman-got-few/	No one outside of Mitt Romney’s campaign may really know if Ohio’s Rob Portman is likely to become the running mate on this year’s Republican presidential ticket. But in case the freshman U.S. senator is picked, Democrats are preparing a dossier. On June 3, the Ohio Democratic Party used it to take several shots at Portman, his experience and his popularity, including a claim that he’s really not a tremendous vote-getter in his home state. "In four Ohio Senate elections held between 2000 to 2010, Robert Portman garnered the least votes out of all the winners," the Democrats said in a news release. If that’s the case, the party suggested, Portman would "not significantly help Romney carry the Buckeye state." This larger claim is prospective, although there is polling to support it. The polling could turn out to be right, or wrong, as it came out six months before the election. But what about hard data from Portman’s last election? Did he really get fewer votes than the previous three victors in Ohio’s U.S. Senate races, Mike DeWine, George Voinovich and Sherrod Brown? The raw numbers tell part of the story. From the Ohio secretary of state’s office: Portman won in 2010 by getting 2,168,742 votes. In the previous Senate election in Ohio in 2006, Brown won with 2,257,485 votes. In the Senate election before that, in 2004, Voinovich won with 3,464,651votes. And in 2000, Mike DeWine (defeated by Brown in 2006) won with 2,666,736 votes. So there you have it, if you use the raw numbers. Portman got the fewest votes among the victors in these last four Senate elections. But wait. The number of votes a candidate gets not only reflects his popularity but also the dynamics of each election. Not all elections are equal. DeWine and Voinovich, for instance, won in elections in which voters chose a president as well as a senator. Political Science 101: Turnout in presidential years is always higher than in mid-term term elections. This has long been the case. It follows that if more people come to the polls because presidential candidates are on the ballot, the number of votes cast in the Senate race will rise too. Think of it like religion. More people attend church on Easter Sunday than on a snowy late January. Is it fair, then, to criticize a particular church for its low attendance by using Easter as the yardstick? A more telling comparison is a candidates’ margin of victory over his challenger. Of all the votes cast in any of these elections, who won by the highest percentage? DeWine, a Republican, beat Democratic challenger Ted Celeste in 2000 by a margin of 24 percentage points (he got 60 percent of the vote, to Celeste’s 35.9 percent). Voinovich, a Republican, beat Eric Fingerhut in 2004 by a 27.7 point margin. Brown, a Democrat, defeated DeWine by a 12.3 percentage margin. And Portman, running for an open seat after Voinovich decided to retire, beat Lee Fisher, then Ohio’s lieutenant governor, by a 17.5 percent margin. So what’s this tell us? It says that if you ignore the context, the Democrats are right about Portman’s election performance: "In four Ohio Senate elections held between 2000 to 2010, Robert Portman garnered the least votes out of all the winners." But two of those four elections were of a different nature, with presidential candidates pushing up the totals all around. Take away those two and simply compare 2006 and 2010, or use all four elections but consider the margins of victory rather than each winner’s raw vote total. Using the latter measure, Portman would rank third out of four in margin of victory. Brown garnered more votes in 2006 than did Portman in 2010, but Portman won his lower-turnout election by a wider margin. These matters -- presidential-versus-non-presidential elections, and margins of victory -- must be mentioned to fully understand the Democrats’ claim. That’s why despite its narrow accuracy, we reduce it a notch to Mostly True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-06-05T06:00:00	2012-06-03	['None']

pomt-02289	"Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/04/charlie-crist/rick-scott-opposes-health-care-law-so-he-wants-go-/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist is a very rare breed of a candidate running in a competitive statewide race: He’s in love with Obamacare, and he’s not afraid to say it. In fact, it’s terrible that Gov. Rick Scott is against the law, Crist says, in a new online video responding to Scott. "The truth is Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, where women are charged more than men, and lifetime caps limit care, even for kids with cancer." Several opponents of the law say they want to scrap it but keep elements they support -- for example, banning insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, one of the most popular elements of the law. We wanted to check what Scott has said in the past about pre-existing conditions. We asked Crist’s campaign for documentation that Scott is in favor of denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Former Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, cited newspaper reports that stated Scott had failed to propose an alternative to the health care law. We asked Scott’s campaign for his position on pre-existing conditions. Spokesman Greg Blair pointed to a July 2012 interview Scott gave to Newsmax, a conservative news outlet: "If you’re worried about pre-existing conditions, give the individual the same tax breaks as an employer so when you change jobs, you don’t lose your health insurance, just like you don’t lose your life insurance if you have your own policy," Scott said. Scott made similar remarks in July 2012: "Give individuals the same tax breaks as employers so they can buy their own insurance so they won't have to deal with the pre-existing conditions." We weren’t sure how tax breaks would end exclusions for pre-existing conditions, and Blair declined to elaborate on Scott’s proposal. Health care experts We sent Scott’s quote about tax breaks to health care experts and asked if that would be a solution to pre-existing conditions. They told us that if the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame. That means if you lose coverage but get new coverage within the 63-day window, you don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. And insurers can only look back 18 months for coverage gaps. But if you go without insurance for longer than 63 days, then the experts told us that Scott’s tax breaks don’t help you. Mark Pauly, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said a tax break has no direct connection to covering pre-existing conditions. "Giving Gov. Scott the benefit of the doubt for lack of artfulness, I think he was referring to proposals that would give ‘portability’ to people who had obtained group coverage so they could continue that coverage (and its tax break) even if they went to self employment or a job in a company not offering coverage. ... The general idea (is) that you can continue your coverage without being singled out for ‘re-underwriting’ if you had continuous coverage." Insured people in poor health are more likely to lose their coverage from one year to the next if it is employment-based coverage rather than individual coverage, he said. Policy experts disagree on just how helpful Scott’s proposal would be. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Scott’s suggestion "is part of a long-term solution that I think would do a very good job of dealing with the problem. In the end some people would probably still fall through cracks, but for most people with pre-existing conditions, this solves the problem." On the other hand, Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina said that by themselves, tax credits do little to help people with pre-existing conditions. "A limited tax credit will not help someone with cancer get coverage unless there are protections in place that compel insurance companies to take all customers regardless of their medical condition and that prevent insurers from charging exorbitant premiums to persons with pre-existing conditions," he said. Crist’s campaign told us that Scott is suggesting changes to federal tax law that governors don’t have a say in anyway. Despite Scott’s opposition to the health care law, it is still being implemented in Florida. As of February 440,000 Floridians signed up for plans, the most of any state using the federal exchange. Our ruling Crist said in a video, "Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions." There is no dispute that Scott has been a persistent critic of the health care law which banned insurance companies from refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions. We could not find many comments from Scott about pre-existing conditions, and the two brief remarks we found didn’t explain his ideas in detail. Overall, Scott supports tax breaks that allow people to buy their own insurance, and if they keep themselves insured, they don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. But that would leave those who end up uninsured for more than a few months in danger of being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09607	The Obama administration "raised discretionary spending by 24 percent from President George W. Bush's last full-year budget and will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/15/karl-rove/rove-claims-obama-has-already-run-more-debt-bush-d/	You gotta love a good war of words between past and present presidential advisers. The first volley in this latest "he-said, he-said" dust-up came from Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, who was one of the political experts asked by the Washington Post for their opinions about how the Democratic Party should handle the midterm elections. Rove's two cents was more criticism than advice. The Obama administration "raised discretionary spending by 24 percent from President George W. Bush's last full-year budget and will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years." President Barack Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod, fired back with a op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he called Rove's comments shameless in light of the fact that, "the day the Bush administration took over from President Bill Clinton in 2001, America enjoyed a $236 billion budget surplus -- with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. When the Bush administration left office, it handed President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit -- and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion for the next decade." We broke that claim down here. In this item, we'll focus on Rove's claim. The first part of his claim is that Obama raised discretionary spending -- federal money that Congress can adjust every year -- by 24 percent from Bush's last full-year budget. According to the White House Office of Management and Budget's historical tables, discretionary spending will go from roughly $1.13 trillion in the 2008 fiscal year (Bush's last full year budget) to $1.41 trillion in 2010. That's a roughly 24 percent increase, so Rove has the number right. End of story? Not quite. Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that number can be misleading because emergency and war spending can inflate the number. He prefers to judge discretionary spending based on the budget resolutions that pass each year. By that measure, he said, discretionary spending would increase by 14 percent during the period Rove is using. Now let's take a look at the second part of Rove's equation, the claim that Obama will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years. First, a quick reminder about deficits and debt: deficits refer to how much money the government spends against revenues in a year; the national debt is the cumulative amount the government owes over time. Rove talked about the national debt. During Bush's term, from the end of 2001 until the end of 2008, the debt held by the public rose $2.5 trillion (to $5.8 trillion). According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office in August last year, the public debt rose to $7.6 trillion in 2009 and is expected to rise to nearly $8.8 trillion by the end of the 2010 fiscal year. So debt rose by $2.5 trillion during the Bush years from 2001 through 2008; and it is expected to rise $3 trillion in the two years under Obama. But Rove's equation assumes Obama is responsible for all of the debt accumulated in 2009 and 2010. And that's where things get messy. Obama took office in January 2009. But the federal budget works on a fiscal year from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 of each year. So a third of the 2009 fiscal year had passed before Obama even took office. So the spending for 2009 was largely determined by a Congress controlled by Democrats and a Republican president. The omnibus spending bill was held over and signed by Obama, who added $20 billion in discretionary spending. But that's hardly a blip in the scheme of things. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Obama administration inherited a deficit of more than $1.2 trillion the day it walked in the door. So the debate then becomes how much of 2009 spending ought to be credited to Bush and how much to Obama. For example, who takes the $133 billion hit for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent in 2009? It was signed by Bush, but Reidl thinks Obama ought to shoulder some of that. Much of TARP's losses are due to auto company bailouts and the home loan program initiated by Obama. And who gets credit for funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the $400 billion in reduced tax revenue because individual income and corporate profits have dropped due to the economic downturn? Yes, the Obama administration tacked on an additional $115 billion in stimulus spending in 2009. And much more will be spent on the stimulus in 2010. "It's true they've provided more money under this administration, but it's hard to say it's a Democratic policy," said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal economic think tank. "Increasing the debt is overwhelmingly the result of the recession and responding to it. To Bush's credit, they actually did what needed to be done. Debt went up a lot, but most of the reason for that is the recession and dealing with it." Axelrod argues that Obama also inherited Bush tax cuts and Medicare prescription drug expenses, which add about $200 billion a year to annual deficits (Axelrod called them "unwelcome gifts that keep on giving"). Riedl argues that kind of complaint may be valid in a president's first year, but by a president's second year, he needs to take ownership of programs he has inherited. If, for example, Obama thinks the prescription drug benefits in Medicare are unaffordable, he should try to repeal them, Riedl said. If he thinks the Bush tax cuts were wrong, try to roll them back. Any way you slice the numbers, spending is on the rise. Our biggest problem with Rove's statement is that he credits all of the debt accumulated in 2009 and 2010 to Obama, and even conservative budget analysts agree that it's fair to assign at least some of the 2009 increase to Bush. And so we rate Rove's comment Half True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2010-01-15T18:21:34	2010-01-10	['George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-08705	"It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/07/michael-j-gardiner/gardiner-says-war-costs-afghanistan-are-triple-any/	All three Republican candidates in the 2nd Congressional District were at the Aug. 30 debate produced by Channel 6 and carried on Cox Cable Channel 5, also known as the Rhode Island News Channel. Early on, the three men were asked for specifics regarding how they would cut the federal budget. Candidate Michael Gardiner singled out the high cost of fighting in Afghanistan. "It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place. Really," he said. "So we really need to lower our expectations there and save the lives and save the war costs and bring that money home to rebuild America." Thirty seconds later, he repeated that assertion. We did a quick Google search, hoping to find the source of that number, and drew a blank. So we called Gardiner. He said he came across it while surfing the Internet. "I'm looking for information constantly." But he didn't remember where he saw it. "Because of the location, I guess it's landlocked in central Asia, it cost three times more to fight there than it does in Iraq. I said anywhere else. I was being a little bit loose. Specifically it's three times more to fight there than in Iraq. It's probably because you have to fly everything in." He subsequently sent us a USA Today article from May 13 noting that in February, the Pentagon was spending $6.7 billion per month in Afghanistan compared with $5.5 billion in Iraq. "As recently as fiscal year 2008, Iraq was three times as expensive; in 2009 it was twice as costly," according to the article. The article also noted that the "costs per service member in Afghanistan have been roughly double what they were in Iraq since 2005," because of its landlocked location, less-reliable security, high cost of fuel and its lack of infrastructure. We found another source: a July 16, 2010 report on "The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11" from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. It contained a breakdown of how much has been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan since Sept. 11, 2001, along with a monthly count of how many military personnel (described as "boots on the ground") in each country each month. We took the September spending numbers for each year and each war and calculated the approximate cost per service member. Over the life of the Afghanistan war, the cost through September comes out to roughly $1.26 million per person. The average is $758,000 per person in Iraq. So it has cost, on a per-service member basis, about two thirds more to fight in Afghanistan than in Iraq. We rate Gardiner's statement False.	None	Michael J.

pomt-15199	The number of people who "believe in socialism ... is increasing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-number-americans-who-believe-socia/	A recent Fox News poll shows a late-summer surge for anti-establishment candidates on both sides of the aisle. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson made significant gains since the first GOP primary debate, finishing with a net gain of eight points (bested only by Carly Fiorina’s 12 point gain) in the Fox poll. During the same time, Democratic contender and self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders closed some of the gap on frontrunner Hillary Clinton, moving up to 30 percent. In an interview with Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace, Carson gave the far-left side of the political spectrum a shoutout as he defended his 10 percent flat-rate tax plan, which is based on the biblical practice of tithing. "You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion. Now, I know a lot of people say that’s a problem because that guy’s still got $9 billion left, we need to take his money. But you see Chris, that’s called socialism," Carson said Aug. 16. "And I recognize a lot of people here who believe in socialism. That number is increasing." We were curious about Carson’s claim that socialism is gaining ground in America. We found that the polling evidence is lacking, but experts said there is a noticeable shift particularly younger Americans. We contacted Carson's campaign but did not hear back. What Carson misses There’s simply very little data on on the topic, said Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. And given how infrequently the questions about socialism are asked, she cautioned against extrapolating any trends from existing polls. Charles Franklin, a professor of public policy and law at Marquette University, searched the University of Connecticut’s Roper Center archive on public opinion and got 70 hits for "socialism" out of more than 500,000 questions dating back to the 1930s. The issue pops up from time to time — for example, during the 1960s and President Barack Obama’s first bid for the White House — but there’s no long-running debate over the ideology. "We haven’t had a serious socialist movement or competitive party in the country, so the issue hasn’t been a constant focus of public opinion," Franklin said. Here’s a sampling of what some historical polls show: In 1949, 15 percent said they’d like to see the United States go in the direction of socialism. (Gallup) In 1982, 20 percent said the United States would be better off if it moved toward socialism. (Continental Group) In 2008, 44 percent said they were not concerned that Obama’s policies may lead to socialism. (Princeton/Newsweek) In 2011, 31 percent viewed socialism positively. (Pew) In 2015, 47 percent said they would vote for a socialist for president. (Gallup) It’s important to note that all these questions ask different things — and none asks whether someone "believes" in socialism, as Carson said. Also, the questions come from different research centers that have different margins of error and use different polling methodologies. Given all the caveats, we’ll take the experts’ advice and refrain from connecting the disparate dots. What Carson gets right However, Carson does have a point that attitudes towards socialism have changed. Recent polling suggests that socialism is viewed more favorably, particularly among younger generations, though overall the numbers are still low. A Pew Center poll conducted during the Occupy Wall Street protests shows the number of people who had a positive reaction to the word "socialism" rose from 29 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2011. Similarly, 13 percent said they viewed a socialist in the presidential race positively in May 2015, according to a survey by Rasmussen Reports, up from 8 percent in the 2008 cycle. Both polls report margins of error around 3 percentage points, so the numbers may not actually be statistically significant. Numerous polls point to a generational shift, says Joseph Schwartz, a political theorist at Temple University. Compared to older Americans, people from 18 to 34 have more favorable attitudes towards socialism. Add in a working class and/or minority background, the attitude becomes much more favorable. "Folks under 45 did not come of political age during the Cold War," Schwartz explained. "Millennials, I think, vaguely associate socialism more with Nordic social democracy than with authoritarian Communism, so they see these countries as less unequal than more ‘neoliberal’ U.S.-style capitalism." Beyond the polls, Schwartz pointed to the surge of Sanders, the Occupy Wall Street movement and Black Lives Matter as indicative of "the revolt of the baristas" — mostly white, college-educated younger adults who’ve grown wary of capitalism, high college debt, weakened unions, corporate tax cuts and bailouts. Overall, the country is leaning left, and liberalism has seen great momentum in social issues like gay marriage and marijuana legalization, according to Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute. In other words, to millennials and Gen-Xers, supporting socialism is more about Scandinavian-style living than Soviet governing structure. "Does that mean that millennials are for social/worker/state ownership of the means of production? Probably only a small minority," Schwartz said. Our ruling Carson said the number of people who "believe in socialism ... is increasing." There has been sparse polling over the years about what the public thinks of socialism, so experts told us to be cautious about the numbers that do exist. However, there are suggestions in the polling data that younger Americans are more open to the idea of socialism, which they equate with European social programs and Nordic-style social democracies.

pomt-01901	"As Alaska’s attorney general, (U.S. Senate candidate Dan) Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground.’ "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/02/dan-sullivan/senate-candidate-dan-sullivan-says-he-passed-stand/	In his campaign for Senate, Republican front-runner Dan Sullivan touts his history of protecting Second Amendment rights in the hunting-loving state of Alaska. But a recent pro-Sullivan ad might have stretched the rifle and pistol expert’s record a little too far. "As Alaska’s attorney general, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground,’ " said a recent radio ad out of the Sullivan campaign. In 2013, the Alaska Legislature passed a "stand your ground" law, which typically allows a person to use deadly force if they believe they face an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death. More than 20 states have such laws. "Stand your ground" became a hot topic following George Zimmerman’s acquittal, after he claimed self-defense in his 2013 trial for killing Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. But Sullivan’s opponents -- Democrat and Republican -- have challenged his record, saying "stand your ground" legislation in Alaska wasn’t his doing. He’s running against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and, on the Republican side, tea partier Joe Miller and Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. We decided to sort this out. "Stand your ground" was first introduced in the Alaska Legislature in 2010. At the time, Sullivan served as the state’s attorney general, heading an office that reviews every law moving through the Legislature. The original "stand your ground" bill failed to pass. A second iteration of the bill appeared and failed in 2011. Sullivan left the attorney general’s office to become the commissioner of natural resources at the end of 2010 -- long before a final version of the bill passed in 2013. So even though "stand your ground" first appeared in the Alaska Legislature when Sullivan was in a position to put his support behind it, it wasn’t successful until he had moved on to other positions. We came across one indication of Sullivan and the attorney general office’s position on "stand your ground," but it doesn’t help his case. His office sent a letter in March 2010 that attacks the heart of "stand your ground" law. The letter uses strong language and primarily takes issue with the fact that the law would remove the then-existing "duty to retreat." "Duty to retreat" means that if a person believes that they are in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm, but there is a safe way for them to get away, they are expected to retreat without assaulting or killing the person threatening them. "Whatever source one thinks our laws should be drawn from -- the 10 commandments which say 'thou shalt not kill,' simple morality, utilitarianism principles of the greater good or simply the concept that life is sacred -- this bill would encourage the needless taking of human life," the letter reads. Although the letter seems to make Sullivan’s position fairly clear, he now has a twofold defense: First, his campaign says the letter took issue with the bill’s complexity, rather than "stand your ground" laws in general. That doesn’t seem to be the case. When we read the letter, we found that nearly half of it criticized the bill for nearly eliminating the duty to retreat -- contradicting the core of "stand your ground," according to some experts. "Duty to retreat" and "stand your ground" laws cannot coexist, as the names suggest. "Someone who opposes a self-defense statute that provides that there’s no ‘duty to retreat’ is also against a typical ‘stand your ground’ statute," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. To be fair, we also found that the letter brings up problems with specific language and lack of clarity, and it never says outright that the Legislature should abandon its efforts to pass "stand your ground." But it does say that the bill "would promote violence and be a bad idea for (Alaska)." Second, Sullivan says he did not pen or approve of the letter even though his name is included in the signature. (A then-assistant attorney general John Skidmore wrote it.) Sullivan’s name was included on any piece of paper that left his office -- even if he didn’t see it first. There are nearly 200 assistant attorneys general, and a lot of legislation passes through that office, so it is conceivable that he wasn’t aware that the letter was going out, said Cori Mills, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law. However, Skidmore wasn’t the only assistant attorney general who had problems with the bill. About two weeks later -- after some tweaks had been made in response to the letter -- three other assistant attorney generals (all from different divisions) gave similar complaints on behalf of the Department of Law at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. The updated version made "a bad bill better," said then-Assistant Attorney General Anne Carpeneti. We asked Sullivan’s campaign to point to any public statement showing his support for the law. They could only provide this letter from state Rep. Mark Neuman, R-Big Lake. The undated letter briefly mentions the attorney general’s office as supportive of the 2010 bill -- despite the obvious lingering complaints expressed at the hearing. The language in the final bill hasn’t changed since 2010, and the final bill still eliminated the duty to retreat in most circumstances. Our ruling A recent radio ad said, "As Alaska’s Attorney General, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground.’ " We found that evidence of Sullivan’s support for "stand your ground" is dubious at best. We couldn’t find any public proof of his support, and multiple attorneys under him spoke out against the law. Even if he had publicly shown support for "stand your ground," he wasn’t in a position to push the legislation forward when the law finally passed in 2013. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12904	Wisconsin’s middle class is the "most diminished" in the United States.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/20/peter-barca/citing-old-data-wisconsin-lawmaker-says-states-mid/	The drumbeat has been steady for months: State Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) and other Democrats in the Legislature have repeatedly said that Wisconsin has the "most diminished middle class" in the United States. As recently as Jan. 10, Barca recited the claim in a news release and said it three times in less than a minute while talking with reporters. "We have the most diminished middle class in the entire country," Barca said at a Capitol news conference in response to Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s 2017 "state of the state" speech. "Let me say that again: We have the most diminished middle class in the entire country." Barca later added: "We believe we should be focused on the most diminished middle class in the country." Other Assembly members have echoed the line. State Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) said in a December radio address that Wisconsin "is still home to the most diminished middle class in the country." The same month, state Rep. Leon Young (D-Milwaukee) wrote that Wisconsin "has the dubious distinction of having the most diminished middle class in the country." That repeated assertion piqued our interest. So we investigated: Does Wisconsin really have the "most diminished middle class" in the United States? New data, different outcome We asked Barca for evidence to support his claim that Wisconsin has the "most diminished middle class" in the country. A spokeswoman pointed to a 2015 analysis by the Pew Research Center — a nonpartisan research organization — that showed middle class households in Wisconsin shrank the most of any state between 2000 and 2013. The analysis found that in 2000, an estimated 54.6 percent of households in Wisconsin were considered middle class. By 2013, that figure fell to 48.9 percent, a 5.7 percentage point drop and the largest decline of any state, according to Pew. To conduct that analysis, Pew used data from the American Community Survey, a national survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau as well as IPUMS-USA data compiled by the University of Minnesota. Pew defined "middle class" as those households earning between 67 percent and 200 percent of the state’s median income. But here’s the problem: Pew’s analysis only went through 2013, and more recent numbers are available. So we performed the same analysis as Pew but included data for the latest year available, 2015. We found that in 2015, an estimated 50.1 percent of households in Wisconsin were considered middle class by Pew’s standards. That’s 4.5 percentage points smaller compared to 2000, when an estimated 54.6 percent of households in the state were considered middle class. It was the 10th steepest decline in percentage of middle class households between 2000 and 2015 of any state, with Nevada’s drop the most significant at 5.6 percentage points. So, by the latest numbers, Barca is not correct. What’s behind the numbers? Wisconsin was one of 18 states where the share of middle-class households grew slightly from 2010 to 2015. In that time period, the percentage of households in Wisconsin considered middle class increased to 50.1 percent — a 0.7 point gain. Overall in 2015, Wisconsin ranked fifth in the nation in percentage of households that were middle class. Thus, while Wisconsin had the biggest decline of middle class households between 2000 and 2013, its performance in recent years shifts the outcome. Our rating Barca said Wisconsin has "the most diminished middle class" in the United States. An analysis by a respected, nonpartisan research organization found the percentage of middle class households in Wisconsin declined the most of any state between 2000 and 2013. But in the latest version of that analysis — comparing the years 2000 and 2015 — middle class households in Wisconsin did not shrink the most of any state. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11352	Says Chuck Schumer said "it’s racist to only allow citizens to vote."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/05/blog-posting/no-chuck-schumer-didnt-say-it-racist-only-allow-ci/	A blog took U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer’s op-ed about voting rights and twisted it to state that he supported allowing non-citizens to vote. "Chuck Schumer slams President Trump: ‘it’s racist to only allow citizens to vote," said an April 3 headline on Federer Now, a right-wing blog. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the story, which appeared to be lifted from other websites, distorted what Schumer actually said about voting rights. While readers of the blog could assume that the statements by Schumer were recent, they actually came from his Aug. 24, 2017, Medium post in which he called on Trump to disband his Election Integrity Commission. Trump formed the commission in 2017 in an effort to ferret out voter fraud which Trump portrayed as "large scale," even though national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare. Trump disbanded the commission in January 2018 after pushback from many states, infighting on the commission and multiple lawsuits. The Federer Now blog plucked some actual quotes by Schumer from his Medium post including this one: "If the president wants to truly show that he rejects the discrimination agenda of the white supremacist movement, he will rescind the Executive Order that created this commission." But then the blog made some declarations about Schumer’s opinions, which were not rooted in fact. For example it said that Schumer "has declared restricting voting to only Americans as an exercise in racism. " Schumer’s Medium post made no mention of restricting voting to citizens. The point of Schumer’s op-ed was to argue that voting rights are "under assault" by Trump and many states and that such laws are racist and an effort to disenfranchise minority voters. Schumer described Trump’s Election Integrity Commission as an "effort to intimidate voters and purge them from the rolls." Schumer spokesman Matt House told PolitiFact that Schumer hasn’t called for allowing non-citizens to vote. Only citizens can generally vote in elections, although a few local governments have allowed non-citizens to vote in local elections. We rate this headline False.

pomt-02050	"400,000 Oregonians have gained access to health care" through the Affordable Care Act.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/may/30/jeff-merkley/did-400000-oregonians-gain-access-health-care-unde/	Cover Oregon, Oregon’s answer to the Affordable Care Act, has had a rocky rollout. Cost overruns, myriad software bugs and, now, an FBI investigation, added up to a public relations disaster. Despite that, however, thousands of people have enrolled for health coverage. The claim: Jeff Merkley, Oregon’s first-term Democratic senator, is running for re-election and will face Republican challenger and political newcomer Monica Wehby in November. In his first post-primary interview, Merkley conceded the inadequacies of Cover Oregon’s launch but said Obamacare, on the whole, has provided net benefits for the state. In particular, he disputed Wehby’s characterization of the new law as an "unmitigated disaster." "Is it an unmitigated disaster," he said, "that 400,000 Oregonians have gained access to health care" through the new law? We decided to check Merkley’s figures. The analysis: We emailed Merkley’s campaign staff, which responded with a memo containing three sets of figures, each tied to a news story or government-provided statistic. The first showed that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion increased Oregon Health Plan enrollment by "more than 300,000." That total was broken into two pieces: The 201,726 Oregonians who used Cover Oregon to enroll for coverage under the Medicaid expansion that is considered critical to the ACA’s success and an additional 130,000 enrolled in the Medicaid "fast-track" program that contacted residents who were already receiving state and federal assistance through other programs. (Potentially, all of them qualified under expansion, so the distinction is did they use Cover Oregon or the Oregon Health Authority fast track?) Oregon Health Plan officials confirmed that there are roughly 320,000 more people officially enrolled in the plan and eligible for coverage now than there were before ACA coverage began Jan. 1, 2014. They acknowledged, however, that they have no way of tracking how many of those individuals had some other type of insurance before enrolling in the state plan. If significant numbers of people did have other insurance before joining the state rolls, that would cut into Merkley’s claim about the new plan’s effect on access to health care. The campaign memo’s next bullet point said "more than 83,000 individuals have enrolled in private health insurance plans through Cover Oregon." The actual figure of 83,852 people who bought private plans through the exchange, usually receiving tax credits to do so, came from a Cover Oregon release dated May 27, 2014. In checking that figure, we found a Cover Oregon document labeling those as "gross enrollment" figures. As of May 27, 2014, according to the document, at least 5,378 people have had their coverage either canceled or terminated, leaving a net private-enrollment figure of 78,474. The number will likely fall further because policies aren’t considered in effect until the first month’s premium has been paid. Earlier this week, insurers said only about 80 percent of first-month premiums have been paid, meaning the figure could end up closer to 60,000 than the originally cited 83,852. "In a lot of cases, people still have more time to pay their first premium," Cover Oregon spokesman Michael Cox said. "These numbers, to some extent, are still in flux." Finally, Merkley’s campaign memo cited a U.S. Health and Human Services document, dated June 19, 2012, which said that 43,000 "young adults in Oregon" had gained or kept access to health insurance through their parents’ policies. Those three categories -- Medicaid expansion enrollees, private-coverage users and "young adults" -- totals roughly 426,000. That figure matches statistics cited by Cover Oregon. But, as noted above, there are problems with it. Most significantly, officials from two state health agencies say no one is tracking how many of the people enrolled for coverage under Cover Oregon or the Oregon Health Plan already had insurance. It may be fair to assume that many of those who tapped Cover Oregon subsidies, as well as people living near the federal poverty level -- and thus qualifying for the new coverage -- did not have the resources to pay for health insurance. There are two groups here: the private plan people who enrolled using Cover Oregon -- 80 percent of whom used subsidies, and the Medicaid-eligible Oregon Health Plan folks. The ruling: Sen. Jeff Merkley, following his primary victory, turned his sights to his November showdown with GOP nominee Monica Wehby. In disputing Wehby’s statement that Oregon’s health care launch was an "unmitigated disaster," Merkley said "400,000 Oregonians have gained access to health care" under the federal Affordable Care Act. To some extent, the numbers are a moving target because they are collected by different groups and may represent totals from varying points in time. They will also change on an ongoing basis as, say, someone makes enough at a new job to lose qualifying status under Medicaid, even as someone else becomes newly eligible after losing work. It is true that the Oregon Health Plan now has about 300,000 more qualifying members than it did before coverage under the ACA began in January. In addition, a 2-year-old federal report adds 43,000 young adults to the mix who were able to remain on their parents’ plan. And anywhere from 60,000 to 83,000 Oregonians who didn’t qualify for Medicaid have purchased private health insurance plans, many with the help of tax credits. So those totals may well make Merkley’s 400,000 claim true. But neither he nor anyone else can say how many of them already had access to health care before the ACA went into effect. Merkley’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00355	Says Aftab Pureval is "lying" about his office’s "$400,000 projected deficit."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/13/steve-chabot/despite-steve-chabots-claim-aftab-pureval-didnt-ha/	When you want a job promotion, it helps to demonstrate success in your current position. Aftab Pureval wants voters to promote him to Congress. To get that job, he’d have to oust an incumbent in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of Cincinnati. Does he deserve the job? Not at all, says the incumbent, Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot. As proof, Chabot cites a "projected $400,000 deficit" in Pureval’s current office as the Hamilton County, Ohio, clerk of courts. It was the first deficit projection in years, Chabot’s campaign says, showing that the challenger can’t even handle his current job. Pureval disputes the claim. But his denial prompted a counterclaim in a Chabot ad that started airing Sept. 6. In the ad, an announcer says, "Aftab’s lying about his office’s $400,000 projected deficit." Was there a projected deficit? If it was projected, did the numbers come in as expected? Was the clerk of courts responsible for this gap? And did Chabot characterize the budget accurately? The answers offer a look into the budget complexities of Ohio county government, and the perils of shoehorning an attack into a 30-second TV ad. Pureval’s clerk budget The clerk of court manages a lot of the administrative functions of local courts, including collection of fines and fees. That’s the revenue side, and frankly, it’s largely dependent on the people who owe fines and not the business acumen of the clerk. The clerk has a staff to pay and administrative office expenses that require money. That’s the expense side. The clerk’s office has historically taken in more money than needed to cover its expenses, so it has turned over the surplus to help the county take care of other needs. But a set of Hamilton County general fund budget projections for 2018 showed a recorded shortfall of more than $500,000: $12.023 million in projected revenue but $12.532 million in expenses. That was according to Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Alluotto’s budget recommendation to county commissioners presented on Oct. 16, 2017. Those projections were the basis for Chabot’s claim. Considering previous surpluses in the clerk’s office and Pureval’s time in the office so far, two years, "I think it’s mismanagement of the office," Cody Rizzuto, Chabot’s campaign spokesman, told PolitiFact. In two years, he said, Pureval has "turned it into a deficit operation." No deficit, clerk’s office says Pureval’s campaign say there will be no deficit. It forwarded a memo from Rene Cheatham, the chief financial officer in the clerk’s office, to Pureval saying as much. The Sept. 6 memo said, "After discussions with Hamilton County’s budget and finance departments, we have revised projections" for the general fund. Now the clerk’s projected revenue for the fund is $12.67 million. The projected expenditures are now $12.47 million, the memo says. Viewed this way, the numbers show a surplus. "As confirmed by Hamilton County, there is no projected deficit for the Clerk’s office," Cheatham, who works for Puerval, wrote in a memo. Pureval campaign manager Sarah Topy added in an email to PolitiFact: "Let me be absolutely clear that there is no deficit at the Clerk's office -- there never was and there never has been. The Cincinnati Enquirer even wrote a correction that made that point and that also pointed out (correctly) that Aftab Pureval has nothing to do with the revenue generation from the courts." The newspaper’s correction was a result of a July 7 guest column that said Pureval "inherited a clerk's office that had been operating with multi-million dollar surpluses for at least 10 years. In just over a year, he has turned those surpluses into a roughly half-million dollar deficit." The correction, an unusual five paragraphs, said Pureval is projected to be under budget in 2018, "which is a savings to taxpayers." Start making sense How can these figures and interpretations differ so dramatically? Cheatham and other county officials walked us through it, but we also found it in quarterly county budget documents and other records. Two reasons explain the difference. First, money coming into Pureval’s office has little to do with how he operates, because it "is all driven by fees and fines," Budget Director John P. Bruggen told us. "It’s stuff that has nothing to do with the day-to-day operation of the clerk’s office." Second, the general fund -- the one that Chabot said shows Pureval had a projected deficit and was "lying" about it -- is not the entirety of the clerk’s budget. It is the major part, and it is called the "general fund" because it is integrated into the county’s overall budget or general fund, available for transfers in and out of other departments as county budget officials deem necessary if it shows a surplus. But the clerk also has a so-called restricted fund, with money coming from auto-title transfer fees. The clerk operates title offices to collect these fees. Under Ohio law, this money need not be transferred to the general fund, although typically money not needed for operating the title operations is. In 2017, for example, the clerk's office transferred $1.7 million from this restricted fund to the general fund, therefore boosting the clerk’s overall general-fund balance and helping pay for other county needs. This year was going to be different, and that’s why it looked like the clerk’s general fund was going into the red. Pureval wanted to use more of the auto title fund in the short term to "drive more revenue" for the long term by boosting auto titling and other business, especially for customers outside of the downtown area, Cheatham said. A number of auto dealers have showrooms in exurban areas bordering other counties, and if those dealerships find it more convenient to transfer titles in those other counties, Hamilton County doesn’t get the fee, Cheatham said. So for 2018, the clerk’s office planned to transfer only $700,000 from this restricted fund to the general fund, and to spend more of the restricted fund on such things as expanded hours, Saturday operations and passport processing. The office has been talking about adding new locations. In the long run, the thinking was, the expansion would more than pay for itself. That’s a big reason the clerk’s general fund showed a gap. This was confirmed in county budget documents. The documents for 2018 said the clerk’s auto title fund was "anticipating an increase in total balance by year end." This would mean, the county documents said, "a decrease in the General Fund transfer by $1 million." Those plans changed, however. How these tie together Instead of planning to transfer $700,000 from the restricted fund to the general fund this year, Pureval’s office this summer decided to transfer an additional $700,000, for a total of $1.4 million. The expansion of hours, new services and title offices is ongoing, Cheatham said, but it is occuring in a way that allows for a bigger transfer to the county this year. Doing so makes strategic sense, he said. But it also changed projections for the general fund, removing what Chabot called a "deficit." This decision was discussed internally in July and formally made in August. It is true that in earlier Hamilton County budget updates, issued in April and July, the clerk's general fund still showed a projected gap. And Chabot’s campaign noticed that a public announcement and memo from Pureval's office -- an announcement with updated general fund figures and the statement that there is no deficit -- was only issued on Sept. 6, right as Chabot was making his campaign claim. Pureval’s timing was suspicious, Chabot’s campaign said. "He’s just fiddling with numbers to protect against a political attack," said Rizzuto. Rizzuto called it "absolute corruption" for a county official running for Congress to make a decision involving county funds when attacked, considering "he could have done this six months ago." Furthermore, Rizzuto said, the county commissioners will have to approve any such transfer at the end of the year, and there’s no guarantee they will. But there's something Chabot's campaign apparently missed: The decision to make the transfer from the auto title fund, as well as the necesessary legal approval from Hamiton County commissioners, all had been made earlier. PolitiFact had to do some digging and request internal records in order to confirm this, but those records show that the clerk's office sent a transmittal form to the county auditor's office in order to initiate the transfer on Aug. 2. The county commissioners, a board on which Chabot once served, then approved the transfer at their public meeting on Aug. 29. Jacqueline Panioto, the clerk for the board of county commissioners, confirmed this and pointed us to the board meeting's minutes where it was recorded. Each of these actions -- the discussions to make the transfer and the approval for the transfer -- occurred before Chabot made his claim. Our ruling Steve Chabot says Aftab Pureval’s is "lying" about his office’s "$400,000 projected deficit." If you’ve read this far, you no doubt understand this is a tricky claim. Some budget documents showed the Hamilton County clerk of courts office with a projected shortfall of actually more than $500,000, but the county’s budget director said the deficit was really only on paper. It was also a temporary projection. As explained above, Pureval's office -- in agreement with other offices including the county commissioners' -- had wiped out the projected general fund gap well before Chabot made his ad. It’s complex stuff. But Chabot is a congressman and a former Hamilton County commissioner. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10097	"Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.'"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/28/john-mccain/tiny-ad-makes-large-error/	In the final week before the election, the McCain campaign is airing a rerun. The campaign announced on Oct. 28, 2008, that it was launching an ad called "Tiny" that alleges that Barack Obama described Iran as a "tiny" country that is not a serious threat to the United States. The ad, which was initially released in August, repeats a claim McCain made in a speech in May. The ad opens with scary music, a photograph of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the words "Don't forget to say Death to America" painted on a wall. "Iran. Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism," the announcer says in a somber tone. "Developing nuclear capabilities to 'generate power' but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.' Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't 'serious threats'? Obama – dangerously unprepared to be president." Back in May, McCain made the claim in an address to the National Restaurant Association in Chicago. We rated that claim False. We examined it again in August when the ad first aired and again found the statement to be False . But the ad will be new to many viewers this week, so we are revisiting it here. McCain is distorting Obama's original comments. Here’s the full context of Obama’s remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008: “Strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries,” Obama said. “That’s what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That’s what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That’s what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don’t pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we’re going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take. “You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn’t stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn’t mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world.” McCain twisted Obama's words when he claimed that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that. Obama was speaking about whether to negotiate with Iran, which the Bush administration resisted. Obama noted that previous presidents had met with adversaries from the Soviet Union and China that were willing to destroy the United States, but that President Bush refused to meet directly with leaders of smaller global players such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. Rather than dismiss those countries as insignificant, Obama was urging direct talks to engage them. And Obama elaborated on his comments back in May when he issued a retort to McCain: “So John McCain, he said, ‘Oh, Obama doesn’t understand the threat of Iran.’ I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I’ve made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I’ve said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that’s what diplomacy is all about. “So let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel’s existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily – and this is the irony – the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran.” This isn’t the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. He has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign. Obama never said the threat from Iran was “tiny” or “insignificant,” only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. And if the McCain campaign was unclear on that point, it should have been clear after Obama's comment in May that "Iran is a grave threat." To continue to twist Obama's words, especially after that clarification, earns another False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-28T00:00:00	2008-10-28	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-03523	"Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2 billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/02/chris-christie/chris-christie-tv-ad-links-big-budgets-cost-hikes-/	Barbara Buono is a one-woman, out-of-control spending machine, to hear the latest TV ad from Republican Chris Christie. The ad released online May 22 links Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, with Corzine, Christie’s Democratic predecessor. Buono is Christie’s likely challenger in the November gubernatorial contest. As pictures of Corzine and Buono flash on screen during the ad, a narrator intones, "Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2 billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled." This ad is like others from the governor’s re-election campaign that try linking Buono with Corzine: strong on bluster, weak on context. While the ad doesn’t come right out and blame Buono for these increases, the implication is there. Let’s go back to the start of Corzine’s tenure. The Democrat became governor in 2005 and served one term before being defeated by Christie. We’re not sure how Corzine "teamed up" with Buono since she was already on her third term as a state senator when he was first elected to state government. Further, the chairmanship of legislative committees is determined by the president in the Senate and the speaker in the Assembly – not the governor. Also, Buono was neither Corzine’s Senate president nor his lieutenant governor, which would have made them more of a ‘team.’ Next, let’s review the increases mentioned in the ad. In 2006, Corzine proposed increasing New Jersey’s sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, claiming the hike would generate more than $1 billion in revenue and help close a $4.5 billion budget gap. Buono was one of 22 senators to approve the increase, which went into effect that July. Then came creation of the fiscal year 2007-2008 budget, which was proposed at $33.4 billion -- the largest state budget in history to date. Each of Christie’s budgets since he’s been in office has been below that total. Buono became chair of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in January 2008 and served through 2009, meaning she led that panel in reviewing and editing a budget before submitting it to Corzine for approval. Buono voted in favor of the budget. Corzine had final approval over it. And the situation is similar for the ad claim about 23 increases in taxes and fees during the two years that Buono chaired the Senate budget panel. Among the votes that Buono supported: increasing the cigarette tax, increasing the vehicle registration fee by $7, and increasing the income tax rate in various brackets. So Buono has responsibility for these increases since she voted in favor of them, but she’s not the only legislator to do so. The ad also is correct that state debt increased more than $13 billion during the two years of Buono’s chairmanship. But Christie calling her out for that is disingenuous since state debt has climbed an additional $13 billion from 2010 -- Christie’s first year in office -- to 2012, according to the State Debt Report for Fiscal Year 2012. Finally, let’s look at unemployment figures for the period cited by the ad: January 2008 to January 2010. Looking strictly at raw numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed in New Jersey more than doubled from 208,729 in January 2008 to 442,441 two years later. But Christie’s team forgot something: New Jersey was deep in the recession, which the U.S. Bureau of Economic Research has defined as beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009. Employment losses continued mounting in the months after the recession ended. Consequently, one New Jersey senator can’t bare the full blame for an economic collapse that gripped the state and nation for several years. "As the architect of Jon Corzine’s budgets, Barbara Buono was central to those disastrous policies that brough New Jersey to the brink of catastrophe," Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts said in a press release that he referred us to about the ad. Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner blasted the ad’s claims. "Governor Christie's blatantly misleading claims are laughable," Turner said in an e-mail. "Senator Buono voted for commonsense measures to hold lawbreakers accountable, including fees to reduce the cost of collecting child support, tougher fines against polluters and increased penalties for improperly storing explosives. With more than 400,000 people unemployed and property taxes up nearly 20 percent, it's no surprise that he has resorted to purposely distorting Senator Buono's record." Our ruling A Christie TV ad claims, "Jon Corzine, elected governor. Teams up with Barbara Buono. $1.2 billion sales tax increase? Passed. Most spending in state history? Passed. After Buono named budget chair, taxes and fees increase 23 times in just two years. State debt? Up $13.4 billion. Unemployment? Doubled." Most of the ad’s claims are correct but imply that Buono is to blame for things such as a sales tax increase, billions in debt and skyrocketing unemployment in two years – during a recession, to boot. All of these resulted from the collective actions of a legislative body – not one person. Also, sharing a political affiliation and chairing a committee didn’t necessarily make Buono and Corzine a ‘team.’ Therefore, we rate the ad Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06550	"Last year, Korea sold nearly half a million cars in our country. ... The United States, you know how much we sell to them? Six thousand. What kind of deal is that?"	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/04/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-says-us-imported-500000-cars-south-ko/	At least one facet of the job creation plan that President Obama outlined in a September 8 address to a joint session of Congress did not sit well with Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Ohio’s longest serving member of Congress. During the speech, Obama called for Congress to approve pending trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea, contending their passage would make it easier for American companies to sell their products abroad. "If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers," said Obama. "I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words: ‘Made in America.’ That’s what we need to get done." A few days later, Kaptur took to the House floor to deliver her own take on those trade agreements. She argued they’d actually whittle away U.S. manufacturing and escalate a jobs drain to other countries. She focused part of her ire on the automotive provisions in the pending US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, complaining the United States would still end up importing far more cars from Korea than it sends there, even with its adoption. "Last year, Korea sold nearly half a million cars in our country," Kaptur said. "The United States, you know how much we sell to them? Six thousand. What kind of deal is that? And we’ll be lucky if, under this agreement, where there’s a hope that we might sell perhaps, 75,000 cars to Korea, so they get a half a million, we get a handful? How’s that a credible plan to create jobs in our country?" We were intrigued by Kaptur’s assertions so we decided to check out her statistics. According to a March 2011 report compiled by the United States International Trade Commission, 561,626 Korean passenger vehicles were imported into the United States during 2010, representing 4.9 percent of the U.S. auto market. Korean auto makers sold Americans another 381,505 vehicles they made in the United States, another 3.3 percent market slice. Hyundai and Kia have car plants in Montgomery, Ala., and West Point, Ga. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler exported 7,450 vehicles to Korea that year, representing a mere 0.62 percent of that country’s passenger vehicle market, which is the world’s 12th largest, the ITC report says. If vehicles made in the United States by foreign-based producers were included in that export figure to Korea, the statistic would rise to 13,044 vehicles, representing 1.09 percent of Korea’s market. Those statistics exclude the 125,730 vehicles that GM’s Daewoo Auto & Technology Division produced and sold in Korea. In January 2011, GM eliminated the Daewoo brand name and began calling those cars Chevrolets. Those vehicles wouldn’t be affected by the pending trade deal because they’re not exported, according to an August 2011 Congressional Research Service report on the deal. The trade agreement’s current draft contains provisions aimed at boosting U.S. exports to Korea, including reductions in tariffs on U.S. made vehicles and an easing of fuel economy standards. But the Congressional Research Service report casts doubt, given differences in the the U.S. and South Korean motor vehicle markets, "whether the Detroit Three (GM, Ford and Chrysler) ... would ever gain more than a fractional position in the South Korean market." Kaptur was correct that there is a wide disparity between the number of South Korean vehicles imported to the United States vs. the number exported to Korea. Her claim of "nearly half a million" imports is slightly understated. Her office said that’s because she cited 2009 numbers from a Congressional Research Service report, instead of the 2010 statistics we found. Her number for domestic vehicles is understated, too. She said 6,000, as compared to a tally of 7,450 for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler that the ITC provided. But that also only considers vehicles made by the Big 3 U.S. automakers. Nearly 5,600 more vehicles made by foreign-based automakers at plants in the United States also went to South Korea. That’s a point of additional information. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates Mostly True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2011-10-04T09:45:00	2011-09-14	['United_States']
pomt-01683	Congress is "on a five-week vacation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/aug/15/rick-perry/rick-perry-incorrect-congress-five-week-vacation-i/	Gov. Rick Perry roused a national conservative confab in Fort Worth this month by touting his decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border and ladling in a jab at Congress. According to a news story placed online by the Dallas Morning News Aug. 8, 2014, the Republican governor that day reminded the Red State Gathering he’s proud of how Texas has fared on his watch. The story said he got a standing ovation after saying: "If Washington won’t act to secure the border with Mexico, then as governor of Texas, I will." In bringing up his executive action, the story said, Perry "took the opportunity to contrast it to a federal government — including senators — that he said literally has vacated its responsibilities. ‘Congress shouldn’t be on a five-week vacation,’ Perry said. ‘I can assure you that drug cartels and gangs are not on vacation.’" Is Congress on a 35-day vacation? Perry's office didn't immediately engage on this claim. A 1970 law mandates annual recess What we know, though, is Congress started a five-week summer recess late on Aug. 1, 2014, according to a Time magazine news story. The annual August break is required by law, according to an Aug. 6, 2014, Wall Street Journal blog post by Linda Killian, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center, a think tank. Killian said the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 directs the House and Senate to recess for the month of August, until after Labor Day. The act says that unless Congress provides otherwise, the House and Senate shall adjourn no later than July 31 of each year or so and, it looks to us, remain adjourned to the second day after Labor Day, though it also says the mandate shall not be applicable in any year there’s a state of war on July 31 as declared by Congress. A post on the U.S. Senate website references the 1970 law and says: "Today, the August recess continues to be a regular feature of the Senate schedule, a chance for senators to spend time with family" and "meet with constituents in their home states." A web link there led us to a Senate article providing perspective. According to the article, as Congress stayed in session for more of each year into the 1960s, Sen. Gale McGee, D-Wyo., began calling for a summer recess. Each time, according to the article, the idea split the Senate along generational lines: "Older senators preferred the traditional system of doing business--come to Washington in January, complete business by summer, and go home. No need for weekend trips or state work periods. Senators had plenty of time to deal with home-state business and reelection campaigns. "But younger senators, facing the realities of the modern Senate, wanted a designated six-week summer recess to allow them to plan family vacations and reconnect with their constituency," the article said. "By 1969, McGee had gained enough support for a test run. The Senate recessed from Aug. 13 to Sept. 3." On Aug. 6, 1971, as mandated by the new law, the Senate began its first mandated August recess, the article said. Is the recess a vacation? It’s one thing not to be in session, but is that the same as taking a vacation? First, there’s the Merriam-Webster dictionary defininition of vacation: a "period of time that a person spends away from home, school, or business usually in order to relax or travel." The Time story said that just because it’s called a recess doesn’t mean congressional leaders are taking a break. "Business still goes on," the story quoted Senate Historian Don Ritchie as saying. "There’s just no action on the floor." Scant business goes on, we suspect, though an official House calendar listed a few hearings scheduled during the 2014 recess — an Aug. 6 hearing of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs on health care access in rural America, hosted by panel Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla.; an Aug. 7 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations about combating the Ebola threat; and an Aug. 14 hearing, also by the veterans affairs panel, on rural health care and infrastructure needs. Time’s story said: "Especially because this is an election year, many members will be campaigning, visiting offices and town halls in their home states and holding town meetings. Offices will stay open to receive mail and calls from constituents. Members who aren’t up for reelection might enjoy family time or a vacation," the story said. Texans during the recess Spokespeople for Central Texas House members did not respond to our email inquiries about whether their elected boss was taking the month off, nor did we draw responses about Perry’s vacation claim from Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Neither senator vanished from view after the recess began. Cruz (like Perry) appeared at the Aug. 8 Red State Gathering, according the News’ story. Each Texan also spoke at the Saturday Aug. 9 Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, the state that’s home to first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses next year. Cornyn, stopping in Midland, talked up his immigration legislation in West Texas on Aug. 6, 2014, according to a news story published the next day by the Midland Reporter-Telegram. Another tack: By scrolling a Twitter list created by journalist Rick Dunham, we looked at what members of the Texas delegation volunteered about their activities in the first week of the 2014 recess, encompassing the period preceding Perry’s "vacation" statement. Not every member specified personal activities. Some excerpts: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, said she hosted constituents at a Houston gathering Aug. 2; Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, participated in an Aug. 3 NBC-TV "Meet the Press" roundtable; the same day, Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, spoke at a youth recognition luncheon and Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, addressed a pro-Israel gathering also attended by Lee and Rep. Ted Poe, R-Houston, per tweets. The same week, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Denton, urged followers not to forget his Aug. 4 town hall in Little Elm and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, announced six district town halls through Aug. 14. On Aug. 4, Cornyn was named Mr. South Texas in Laredo; Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-El Paso, invited constituents to his Aug. 6 town hall and Rep. Mark Veasey, D-Dallas, promoted a town hall scheduled Aug. 20. On Aug. 7, the day before Perry spoke of Congress on vacation, Neugebauer tweeted about visiting the editorial board of the Abilene Reporter-News and Burgess did the same about the board for the Denton Record-Chronicle. That day, O’Rourke said he’d joined Miller, the Florida member, at a medical center in Beaumont, Texas. The same day, Castro posted a photo of his visit with residents to thank them for signing up people for insurance in accord with the Obamacare law; Rep. Bill Flores noted that he’d appeared on a local TV news show; and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, shared a photo showing he fielded a community health advocate award. Analyses by Ornstein, Perry Next, we asked the American Enterprise Institute’s Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer, for his analysis. Ornstein replied by email that during the recess, most senators and House members "use this time to travel to trouble spots or to go back and campaign or do meetings in their home districts or states. They are not laying back in the sun, but working. I would prefer more time in Washington legislating, and less time back in the district. But calling this a five-week vacation is a distortion." We circled back to Perry’s office where gubernatorial spokesman Travis Considine noted by email that while the annual recess may be stipulated by law, nothing in law keeps Congress from coming back early if the House and Senate agree to do so. Citing an Aug. 5, 2014, news story in The Hill, a Capitol newspaper, Considine also pointed out the Senate managed to recess by July 31 only 11 times in the past 40 years. Our ruling Perry said Congress is taking a five-week vacation. Actually, Congress is a couple weeks into its annual August recess, in keeping with the 1970 law, though Perry has a point in that members aren’t debating matters on the floor of the House or Senate. Our sense is that even if members take some dog days off, the recess isn’t a no-work vacation. Members continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings; many also campaign. We rate Perry’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03272	"Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/07/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-men-paid-more-8000-more-women-sam/	In a July 29, 2013, email blast, state Sen. Wendy Davis wrote, "Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job." The Fort Worth Democrat concluded her note by calling out Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s June 2013 veto of legislation that would have changed state law to mimic the 2009 federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to sue their employers over pay discrimination. Proponents said the Texas law was needed so women had recourse to state courts, not just federal ones. Pay gaps persist, PolitiFact colleagues have noted, though two claims like the one aired by Davis drew Mostly False ratings. Former President Jimmy Carter said in June 2013 that U.S. women are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. President Barack Obama said in a 2012 campaign ad that U.S. women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men. Both statements relied on data that did not speak to individuals doing the same or similar jobs, also overlooking variations in hours worked and lengths of tenure. Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, forwarded Davis’ email blast and asked us to investigate her pay-gap statement. By email, Smith wrote, "Does the management at the (Austin) American-Statesman pay you less than your male counterparts? Seems like something from the 1950s." Senator draws on 2010 data By email, Sonya Grogg, Davis’ chief of staff, told us that the $8,355 figure came from an April 2012 report from the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The report drew on 2010 data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicating the median pay for a woman working full-time, year round in Texas was $33,689 annually that year, while the median pay for a man was $42,044. The report said these numbers amount to a "yearly gap of $8,355 between full-time working men and women in the state." According to the report, that means Texas women made 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. By this measure, too, Texas ranked better than 37 states, the partnership said. In Vermont, which had the smallest difference in pay, women were paid 84 cents for every dollar paid to men. Wyoming had the widest wage gap, with women making 64 cents for every dollar paid to men. More recent numbers suggest a narrower difference. Census Bureau data from 2012 found a wage gap of $7,859 between Texas men and women working full time, year round, according to an April 2013 report by the partnership. Cited information did not compare the same jobs Another salient wrinkle is that Davis referred to a gap between Texas men and women doing the same jobs, which the partnership’s reports did not do. By phone, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us the figure aired by Davis is a comparison between all men and women, regardless of the type of work they do. In reality, for instance, more men hold higher-paying jobs. In Texas in 2011, men accounted for nearly 78 percent of workers in the higher-paid computer, engineering and science fields, according to Census Bureau data. Meanwhile, the data show that women account for nearly three in four workers in the lower-paid fields of education, training and library jobs. Studies have shown that, when occupational differences are accounted for, more than half of the gender wage gap is explained, Abbot said. She pointed us to Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, who wrote a February 2007 paper titled, "The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?" The paper says that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders. Grogg acknowledged in her email on the senator’s behalf that applying the figure Davis cited to any specific job "doesn’t work," though she also pointed out that a lawsuit filed in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that women in two state agencies made up to $23,157 less than men who had the same job as them, and said that "partially verifies our statement." In late 2012, the state agreed to pay $175,000 to settle the suit regarding the Texas Department of Agriculture and General Land Office. Relevant research Next, we looked for on-point research on pay gaps between Texas men and women doing the same jobs. An expert on Texas demographics, Steve Murdock, who directs Rice University’s Hobby Center for the Study of Texas, directed us to a center associate director, Mike Cline, who by email sent us 2011 Census Bureau data specific to Texas. In more than half of 36 listed occupations, the pay gap that year exceeded the $8,355 cited by Davis. The largest gap -- $31,628 -- was between Texas men and women in health diagnosing and treating professions. The smallest difference, $71, was for men and women employed in installation, maintenance and repair. (See our chart based on what Cline provided here.) Even though the pay gap was more than $8,355 in most of the jobs listed, that doesn’t mean Davis is right, Cline said by telephone. There might be a smaller number of women employed in the jobs with the largest difference in earnings, and a larger number of women employed in the jobs with the smallest difference in earnings. If that’s the case, then more women could be working jobs with a wage gap less than $8,355. But, it could also be the other way around, Cline said. The lead economist at PayScale, a Seattle company that compiles salary information enabling clients to evaluate wages, counseled against reaching pay-gap conclusions based solely on such census data. Katie Bardaro said by telephone that the census figures do not control for differences in years of work experience, educational attainment or companies. For instance, Bardaro said, women may have fewer years in the work force; the median job tenure for men 25 years and older is about one month longer than for women, according to the labor bureau. We had reached out to the company after spotting its 2013 national study of the median pay for men and women in each of about 150 jobs, controlling for "years of experience, education, company size, management responsibilities, skills and more," according to its website. The study also controlled for job-specific factors, for instance considering the types of offices where nurses worked. After controlling for numerous factors, "the wage gap all but disappeared," Bardaro told us. Using information from 13,500 survey respondents, PayScale found, for example, that among civil engineers, registered nurses and human resource administrators, there was virtually no difference between what men and women earned. But there were noticeable differences for some upper-level management and executive positions. Male CEOs made $23,000 more than their female counterparts, according to PayScale. Bardaro said she attributes that to qualities that are hard to measure, such as relationships with co-workers. Estimated Texas gap In Texas, which scored better than 24 states, PayScale saw a $2,000 gap between median pay for men and women in similar jobs, according to numbers Bardaro sent us by email. (See our chart of this information here.) There’s another reason why the $8,355 figure has weaknesses. Men might work longer hours, Bardaro said. Davis’ statistic comes from the earnings of full-time, year-round workers, which the Census Bureau defines as those who "usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks." There’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the labor bureau. Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap. Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. Even when looking at salaries job by job, men still make more than women in almost every single field. Our ruling Davis declared an average $8,355 earnings gap between Texas men and women working "the very same job." In 2010, that was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal figures, while the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less. More significantly, the research that Davis tapped did not drill down to salaries for workers doing the same jobs. We found 2013 survey results indicating that among Texas workers with comparable professional experiences, there was a $2,000 gap between the median pay for men and women in the same or similar jobs. This statement, based on an outdated figure that also didn’t speak to people with the same jobs, still has an element of truth; sizable pay gaps exist. We rate the claim as Mostly False.

pomt-02112	Congress' decision to "spend less around the world" on embassy security contributed to "tragedies" like Benghazi.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/13/ronan-farrow/ronan-farrow-says-inadequate-security-funding-cong/	Partisan narratives that emerged after the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks usually take a few forms. Republicans decry the initial characterization of events from U.N. ambassador Susan Rice as deliberately misleading. Democrats argue the attack against the vulnerable Benghazi complex should not be a surprise after GOP-driven cuts in embassy security funding. Ronan Farrow, who worked as director of global youth issues under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and is the son of actress and activist Mia Farrow, highlighted embassy security issues in a 2013 story for The Atlantic, mentioning Clinton’s warnings in 2011 that a lack of funding would hurt national security. Farrow reiterated these concerns in a May 5, 2014, segment on his MSNBC show, Ronan Farrow Daily, amid news of another House-driven Benghazi investigation spurred by a recently revealed White House adviser’s email with talking points for Rice. On his show, Farrow asked Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., if House Republicans "erred" in 2011 when they "cut $128 million from the administration’s request for embassy security funding, that really laid the foundation." Later, Farrow said both parties are at fault because "in 2010, Democrats cut $142 million from those security requests." "So this is really a back and forth, and it actually seems like, in my view, if you look at the history, both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of this, passing the buck," he said. "It’s easy to gain political plaudits by saying ‘spend less around the world,’ and then it leads up to these tragedies." The connection Farrow's drawing is clear enough: Congressional budget cuts, made by Democrats and Republicans, contributed to the security failures at the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. But as we'll show you, security funding has been increased in recent years and State Department officials say budget requests did not factor into the violent attack on Sept. 11, 2012. (Some of this ground was covered by the Washington Post Fact-Checker.) The "cuts" aren't cuts The first thing to know is the cuts over recent years aren’t really cuts (i.e. taking money away from embassy security funding). Instead, Congress declined to provide the full amount requested by President Barack Obama. Really, this practice goes farther back. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says the department’s base requests have not been fully funded since 2008 (in 2009, the department’s base request was not met but it got more money in supplemental funds). So what’s the deal? We struggled to verify some of Farrow’s numbers, as there are many money pots that support embassy facility security and officer positions. Straight-up budget numbers are a little hard to figure out because of Congress’ affinity for budget strategies like "continuing resolutions" and sequestration. We got the following figures from the Congressional Research Service (page 23 of this 2013 PDF) and chose to look at total security spending, which includes supplemental and overseas contingency funds primarily for missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. State Department Funds for Embassy and Diplomatic Security (total security spending, plus supplemental and overseas contingency operations funds) Request (in millions) Enacted Difference FY 2008 $2,138.7 $2,127.7 -$11.6 FY 2009 $3,404 $3,519.5 $115.5 FY 2010 $3,562.6 $3,420.8 -$141.8 FY 2011 $2,761.3 $2,576.6 -$184.7 FY 2012 $4,395.5 $4,076.2 -$319.3 Whichever numbers you use, they tell a similar story: Congress did not fully fund the administration’s diplomatic security requests for several years. That's not unusual, said John Norris, director of the Sustainable Security and Peacebuilding Initiative at the liberal Center for American Progress. The difference between what the president wanted and what Congress appropriated is not akin to a budget cut as much as it is part of the push-and-pull of the budget process. "It’s rare for Congress to fully appropriate what’s requested, or what is most often the case is some areas will be fully funded, some will be dramatically underfunded," Norris said. "Some will send back more money than what they requested reflecting whatever priorities are in Congress." What's even more important for this fact-check is embassy security spending grew tremendously post 9/11. From 1998 to 2012, the embassy security budget rose by more than 1,000 percent from $200 million to $2.6 billion, Norris said, and the infusion of money means that there are four security personnel for every diplomat. Base security funds, which represent a chunk of the total spending represented in the chart above, increased by 32 percent from fiscal year 2008 to 2012, according to CRS. "If you look at the numbers in what we’re spending, it’s really hard to make the case that (budget constraints) is kind of the root cause of it," Norris said. Money ties to the Benghazi facility As for Benghazi, funding decisions by Congress don't appear to be a major factor in the 2012 attack. Investigations have faulted State Department management decisions for security breakdowns more than insufficient funding. The State Department made some upgrades to the facility, such as increasing the height of perimeter walls, but the outpost in Benghazi was designated as a temporary facility. It did not have to meet State Department security standards of other full-time offices, and it was ineligible for some security upgrade money. The facility did receive financial and other support for security repairs from diplomatic outposts in the Libyan capital of Tripoli and Egypt, But officials on the ground in Benghazi struggled to get additional security upgrades because they didn’t have cash reserves and had to rely on the embassy in Tripoli to pass along requests. There have been many inquiries into the situation in Benghazi, some of which we will touch on in this fact-check. One by the Senate Homeland Security Committee points out neither the State Department nor Congress sought extra money for Libya or Benghazi in a supplemental request, even as officials in Libya asked for a more sizable officer presence. Farrow quoted a portion of the 2012 report by the Accountability Review Board, a group led by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering to examine the security picture at the special mission. The security was "inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place," the report states. But was that Congress' fault? The report said Congress "must do its part" to address security risks and meet mission imperatives and suggested the State Department get more flexibility for building money so temporary facilities in dangerous situations can get more advanced security upgrades. But it primarily faulted "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies," and not unfulfilled budget requests. Another finding: The embassy in Tripoli was not an effective advocate in pressing Washington to provide more security for the Benghazi compound, which included a CIA annex. Senate committee investigations also cite unanswered cables for more temporary officers from Libyan Ambassador Christopher Stevens to the State Department. State Department officials, meanwhile have said publicly that budgets were not a factor. During a House hearing into the attack on Oct. 10, 2012, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher asked deputy assistant secretary of state Charlene Lamb: "Was there any budget consideration and lack of budget which led you not to increase the number of people in the security force there?" "No, sir," Lamb said. Later, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, asked, "So there’s not a budget problem. It’s not you all don’t have the money to do this?" "Sir, it’s a volatile situation. We will move assets to cover that," Lamb said. More of the same on May 8, 2013. Responding to a Democratic member who pointed to embassy security spending in recent GOP House budgets, committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., prodded Eric Nordstrom, former regional security officer in Libya, about Lamb’s previous testimony. Issa said, "Mr. Nordstrom, you were on that panel. Do you remember what she (Lamb) said?" "Yes, she said that resources was not an issue," Nordstrom said. "And I think I would also point to the (Accountability Review Board) report, if I'm not mistaken, that they talked to our chief financial officer with (Diplomatic Security), who also said that resources were not an issue." Farrow's executive producer Kathy O’Hearn defended his characterization of the situation. "In every segment, we have been diligent in making mention ... that this is not simply a question of resources, but one of how existing resources can be used," O'Hearn said. "We feel strongly that our reporting has been judicious and thorough." Yet Farrow's interview with Schiff certainly lingers on the question of whether there were enough resources and the role of Congress. He first says that some Republicans are "strident" that resources were not an issue, then pivoted to Clinton’s 2011 warnings that not agreeing to the White House's proposed budget would hurt national security. After that, Farrow brought up specific budget decisions by members of Congress. Only after that did he note that some standard building funds available to the State Department were not able to be used in Benghazi. Our ruling Farrow pointed to "cuts" by Democrats and Republicans in Congress in recent years from what the Obama administration requested in embassy security funding and tied it to Benghazi, saying, "It’s easy to gain political plaudits by saying ‘spend less around the world,’ and then it leads up to these tragedies." It's true that Congress did not fully fund embassy security requests from the Obama administration in recent years, which is what Farrow argues amounts to a "cut." But funding for embassy security is up from 2008, and up dramatically since before 9/11. How does this tie into the Benghazi attack? State Department officials and government experts lay more blame on decisions by upper management not to provide the temporary Benghazi facility with more officers and better protections than the availability of money. Farrow made that very point in his segment, which makes it odd that he led his segment by tying the attack with insufficient congressional funding. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08871	House Democrats "have a two-to-one advantage money-wise" against House Republicans.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/03/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-house-democrats-have-2-1-lead-ca/	On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the show's host asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., how she felt when President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, suggested a few weeks earlier that the Democrats could lose their House majority in the fall elections. Pelosi exuded confidence. "You know what, I'm speaker of the House," Pelosi said. "I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not." We thought the part of Pelosi's comment worth checking was that House Democrats "have a two-to-one advantage money-wise" against House Republicans. Because Pelosi mentioned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just two sentences earlier, we began by looking at the money statistics for the DCCC and the parallel GOP organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both groups work to elect members of their party to House seats. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics, the DCCC had $33,783,724 in the bank through Aug. 3, 2010, compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, and neither committee had any debt. That works out almost exactly to a ratio of two-to-one -- just as Pelosi said. But while the DCCC/NRCC ratio for cash on hand is probably the best statistic to use, it isn't the only one. So we decided to look at a handful of others for comparison. -- The ratio of money raised for the DCCC and NRCC -- not just what's left in the bank. The DCCC has raised $93,706,323 during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, compared to $75,531,984 for the NRCC. That's a 1.24 to 1 ratio -- a much more even split than cash on hand. -- Money totals raised and held by House candidates themselves, rather than by the DCCC or the NRCC. When you look at money raised by the candidates themselves, the Republicans have actually raised slightly more than the Democrats as of Aug. 3, 2010 -- $355,067,654 to $351,238,367. Meanwhile, Democrats running for the House have $245,223,757 in the bank, compared to $173,422,985 for Republican candidates. That's a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. Since the Republicans have more candidates running for the House, we also decided to adjust these numbers to reflect amounts raised and held per candidate. The Democrats lead in total money raised per House candidate, $589,326 to $323,670 -- a 1.82 to 1 ratio. They lead by an even larger ratio in cash on hand per House candidate -- $411,000 to $158,000, or 2.6 to 1. -- Independent expenditures. Independent expenditures are dollars spent on campaigning by sources other than the candidates' own campaign treasuries. Through July 11, 2010, $19,017,868 was spent independently either for Democratic candidates or against Republican candidates, compared to $7,776,690 spent in support of Republicans or against Democrats. That's a ratio of about 2.4 to 1 favoring Democratic candidates. So let's sum up. When comparing the DCCC and the NRCC in cash on hand, Pelosi is on target when she says that there's a two-to-one Democratic advantage. But using four other measures, the Democrats have a smaller lead, including one case in which the Republicans narrowly lead. Using two other measures, the Democrats have a lead of greater than two to one. Of course, these statistics can change before Election Day, and it's not especially surprising that the Democrats lead the Republicans in fundraising -- being the incumbent party in power. Either way, we think the single best statistic to use is the one Pelosi cited correctly, so we'll rate her comment Mostly True.

pomt-14581	"Right now we’re the highest taxed country in the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/06/donald-trump/trump-calls-us-highest-taxed-country-world/	Donald Trump blamed high taxes for stunting job growth in the United States during a GOP primary debate in New Hampshire. When ABC moderators pressed the real estate mogul for specifics about how he would boost the economy, Trump said he wanted to cut taxes for the middle class and businesses. "Right now we’re the highest taxed country in the world," Trump said on Feb. 6, 2016. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to us, but his claim could be accurate if he had been more specific. We’ve previously rated a statement that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate Mostly True, because the statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world's highest. We should note, however, that deductions and exclusions usually lower the effective rate, placing the United States lower than other countries’ comparable levels. But Trump did not specifically say the corporate rate at the debate, so we wanted to know how high U.S. taxes stacked up to the rest of the world. Tax tables Tax experts have told us that there are usually two ways to compare different countries: Tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, and tax revenue per capita. We checked both through the Organization for Economic Cooperation, a group of 34 industrialized nations we could consider economic peers. In OECD data from 2014, the most recent year available, the United States was far from the most highly taxed among this group. Taxation accounted for 26 percent of GDP, which ranks America 27th out of 30 countries (the OECD average was more than 34 percent).The top five highest-taxed countries as a percentage of GDP were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Italy, all topping 43 percent. Korea, Chile and Mexico were the only nations ranked lower than the United States. As for tax revenue per capita, we move up a bit. America is 17th out of 29 countries by this measure on the OECD list, with taxes totaling $14,994 per person. The top five were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which ranged from a high of almost $50,000 to to more than $23,000. Twelve nations were lower than the United States. The bottom two, Turkey and Chile, had tax revenues per capita of less than $3,000. Industrialized economies are the best yardstick, but U.S. taxation as a percentage of GDP ranks 12th from the bottom if you compare it with a larger roster of 115 countries. The World Bank’s data for 2012 — the last year for which it has complete figures — showed that the nations with lower percentages than the United States were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). Point being, Trump is on the wrong side of the ledger with this claim. Our ruling Trump said, "Right now we’re the highest taxed country in the world." We used a couple of different measurements suggested by experts to determine that no matter how you slice it, the United States is far from the most taxed nation in the world, whether it’s an advanced industrialized economy or not.

pomt-07675	Says Sen. Sherrod Brown admitted "that his $787 billion stimulus law failed" and "after specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes, (he) now claims that his stimulus bill 'didn't do enough' to lower taxes."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-raps-sen-sherrod-brown-admitting-stimulus-law/	Republicans don't yet have a declared candidate to challenge incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2012, but that hasn't stopped them from opening the campaign. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which assists election efforts, made that clear by issuing a series of news releases after Brown spoke at a January luncheon of the Akron Roundtable. One release, citing coverage in the Akron Beacon Journal, went after the senator "in light of Brown’s admission that his $787 billion stimulus law failed, and his sudden election-cycle flip-flop to demand more tax cuts." "After specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes, Brown now claims that his stimulus bill 'didn't do enough' to lower taxes," the NRSC’s Chris Bond said. Listening to the talk and reading the Beacon Journal story, however, we did not hear the same "admission." Here is what the story said: "Brown defended the federal government's fiscal actions during the Great Recession, saying it was necessary to borrow nearly $1.5 trillion to rescue and stimulate the economy and prevent a global collapse. The efforts also helped save major manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler, he said. "The subsequent $787 billion Recovery Act that passed in early 2009 didn't do enough, particularly with tax cuts, to get people to spend more or build public confidence in the economy, he said. "But the federal government's investments in domestic automakers helped tremendously, Brown said, with the economy now growing and adding jobs. "If the government hadn't acted, the state would have been in much worse shape, Brown said." He did not say the stimulus failed. He said it was not large enough, which he has said consistently. As for tax reductions, Brown said the tax cuts "didn’t do what they should have. They weren’t large enough, as it turned out, to get people to spend more, they weren’t public enough to help it build public confidence in our economy." In explanation, Brown’s office cited a New York Times/CBS News Poll of September 2010, which found that fewer than one in 10 respondents knew that the stimulus had lowered taxes for most Americans, giving typical families an extra $65 a month. Few people noticed the tax cut because, instead of getting rebate checks, taxpayers had less money withheld from their paychecks, Brown’s staff said. Increases in health-insurance deductions, increases in state taxes in 30 states and cutbacks in business also reduced take-home pay. But what about the claim that Brown specifically attacked Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes? Brown was a vocal opponent of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, which he said have failed to stimulate the economy. He did vote in favor of their extension last December, but said it was only because the bill extended tax reductions for the middle class and included billions of dollars in unemployment benefits. So where does the NRSC land on the Truth-O-Meter? Brown didn’t say that the stimulus package failed. The claim that the senator attacked Republicans for wanting to lower Americans’ taxes has an element of truth to it, but an important fact that is missing is that his opposition dealt with extending the Bush tax cuts for the highest wage earners and had nothing to do with the stimulus package. The claim that Brown said the stimulus bill didn't do enough to lower taxes also has an element of truth to it. Brown said tax cuts in the stimulus didn’t get people to spend more, and weren’t public enough to build public confidence in the economy. That’s why we rate the statement as Half True.

pomt-11254	"Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/01/newly-press/smallville-actress-didnt-confess-selling-children-/	A website twisted a real story about a criminal indictment against TV actress Allison Mack and made up details trying to tie her crime to the Clintons. "Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons," stated an April 29 headline by The Newly Press. The same story appeared on the clickbait website Your News Wire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Mack was indeed indicted, but the tie to the Rothschilds or Clintons is made up. On Smallville, Mack played the role of Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark Kent’s best friends, starting in 2001. Federal prosecutors in New York announced April 20 that Mack, 35, had been arrested. An unsealed indictment showed she and Keith Raniere faced charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. "The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit," stated Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization Nxivm, based in Albany. Prosecutors said that Nxivm maintained features of a pyramid scheme, as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants ("Nxians") were encouraged to recruit others. In 2015, Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called DOS, an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to "Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions," or "The Vow," according to prosecutors. DOS operated with levels of women "slaves" headed by "masters." Raniere stood at the top of the pyramid while Mack was one of the women in the first level immediately below Raniere. While The Newly Press article said that Mack confessed, court records show Mack pleaded not guilty on April 20. She was released on $5 million bail bond and is staying at her parents’ home in California under electronic monitoring. The Newly Press story provided no evidence that Mack confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons. Instead, the story tried to force a link by tying a financial backer of Raniere -- Seagram heiresses Sara and Clare Bronfman -- with business interests of the Rothschilds and the Clinton Foundation. While prosecutors wrote in a court document that Clare Bronfman has given Raniere millions of dollars over the years, the document makes no mention of Bill and Hillary Clinton or the Rothschilds, a famous wealthy family in the banking business. The press release and the indictment also make no mention of the Rothschilds or the Clintons. We searched news accounts and found none that tied the Clintons or Rothschilds to the indictment. Our ruling A headline said, "Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons." Actress Allison Mack was indicted for sex trafficking, but the allegation that she confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons is clickbait and fictional.

pomt-09161	"There's more than 100,000 people working at the Department of Agriculture. That's 1 employee for every 30 farmers."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/08/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-says-usda-employs-1-person-every-30/	U.S. Sen. George LeMieux's crusade against the national debt has become the hallmark of his short stint in Congress. The Florida Republican, appointed in August 2009 to fill Mel Martinez's seat, has been touting a plan to roll back and then cap federal spending levels. LeMieux says returning federal spending to 2007 levels could cut the now $13 trillion national debt in half by 2020. PolitiFact Florida previously rated LeMieux's claim that his plan would halve the national debt True, but we wondered loudly at the time how the government could make the massive, necessary spending cuts. In a meeting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board on June 4, 2010, LeMieux presented some ideas and gave us more numbers to crunch. LeMieux said no program could be shielded from potential cuts, whether it be an across-the-board 10 percent cut in every federal agency, or raising the Social Security retirement age, or making higher-income seniors pay more for Medicare services. When pressed further, LeMieux singled out the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "There's more than 100,000 people working at the Department of Agriculture," LeMieux said. "That's 1 employee for every 30 farmers." In his mind, that's clearly too many. "Fiscal responsibility is nothing but background music in Washington," LeMieux added. We wanted to check LeMieux's statistics about the number of USDA employees and the ratio between employees and farmers. USDA press secretary Caleb Weaver said the agency currently employs 105,000 people scattered across the country and in dozens of countries across the world. Weaver said the number varies slightly because many of the workers are seasonal, particularly those that work for the Forest Service, which is a branch of the USDA. We'll note immediately that there are lots of things the USDA does that wouldn't traditionally be considered in support of farmers. Dale Moore, who served as chief of staff to the Secretary of Agriculture during President George W. Bush's two terms, gave us the lay of the land. (Employment figures come from USDA budget documents.) The primary group that deals with farmers is called the Farm Service Agency, which employs a little over 5,000 people and has regional offices all over the country. Besides that, the USDA is made up of more than a dozen other agencies and work groups. Among them: The Forest Service, which accounts for more than a third of the overall USDA workforce (36,760 employees), manages the 193 million acre national forest system. The USDA's Rural Development office (6,100 employees) oversees economic development projects in rural communities. One of its current projects is to increase rural access to broadband technology. The Food and Nutrition Service (1,387 employees) manages the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called the Food Stamp Program) and the National School Lunch Program. The food service programs account for about two-thirds of the department's budget. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (7,888 employees), among other things, monitors and examines the plants and animals that people try to bring into the country. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (9,696 employees) monitors the nation's commercial supply of meat and poultry products. "The USDA I would say is the most diverse federal department in terms of the scope of what it does," said Moore, who now works for Policy Directions, a Washington lobbying firm. Getting back to LeMieux's claim, the number of USDA employees is one-half of his equation. The other is the number of farmers, tracked by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2008, farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers held more than 1.2 million jobs, according to the BLS. Nearly 80 percent are self-employed farmers and ranchers. LeMieux's office provided PolitiFact Florida with a different figure from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. According to them, the number of farmers is more than 2.6 million. The numbers were so different we contacted Steve Crutchfield, the assistant administrator at USDA Economic Research Service for an explanation. Crutchfield said the 2.6 million figure comes from a 2008 Department of Commerce economic analysis measuring farm employment -- which is defined as "the number of workers engaged in the direct production of agricultural commodities, either livestock or crops; whether as a sole proprietor, partner, or hired laborer." The same Department of Commerce study lists “Farm Proprietor’s Employment” as 1.9 million. That number counts "non-corporate farm operators, consisting of sole proprietors and partners." Crutchfield says there are a number of different ways to calculate the number of farmers, based on whether you're including hired laborers or hobby farmers or people who farm but have a different primary source of income. That makes creating a proper ratio of USDA employees (a number that varies depending on budget years and the seasonal workforce) to farmers (a number that varies based on how you define a farmer) difficult. Watch: Using 105,000 total USDA employees and the BLS figure of 1.2 million farmers and farm workers -- you get a ratio of 1 employee for every 11.4 farmers. If you exclude Forest Service employees (who have very little to do with farming) in the same calculation, there remains 1 USDA employee for every 17.6 farmers. But if you count just the Farm Service Agency, the main agency that works with farmers, the ratio becomes 1 Farm Service Agency employee for every 235 farmers under the BLS numbers or 1 employee for every 510 farmers under using the Department of Commerce figure LeMieux cited or 1 employee for every 373 farmers using the other Commerce figure Crutchfield provided. If you use LeMieux's 2.6 million figure and count all USDA employees, the ratio is about 1 employee for every 25 farmers. We're not sure any of these ways is a valid ratio. "The senator’s point is to highlight the growth of employment at government agencies even in light of declining areas of responsibility." LeMieux spokesman Ken Lundberg said. "According to the USDA, the number of farms in the U.S. in 1935 was 7 million. That number has since declined to estimates around 2 million (depending on how a farm is identified). Anecdotally, the senator is informed that a similar shift in employment of those in charge of agricultural-related roles at USDA has not seen a similar reduction." In pushing for cuts to federal government spending, LeMieux singled out the U.S. Department of Agriculture, noting that the agency has more than 100,000 employees and 1 employee for every 30 farmers in America. The USDA currently employees about 105,000 people but that actually translates to 1 employee for every 11 or so farmers based on one calculation, not 1 in 30. That's strike one (though we should note that the correct ratio better makes LeMieux's point). But our point is that you should give that ratio little thought, because it appears to rely on an oversimplification of the USDA's mission. The USDA does a lot more than just deal with farmers, from managing the national forest system, to overseeing the school lunch and food stamp programs, to inspecting meat and poultry products heading to the grocery store. That's enough of playing with the numbers in our mind to warrant a rating of Half True.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2010-06-08T16:48:56	2010-06-04	['None']
pomt-14414	"GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/11/donald-trump/no-gdp-growth-not-zero-trump-says/	Donald Trump held up lifeless economic growth as evidence that America isn’t great anymore during the Republican primary debate in Miami. "GDP (gross domestic product) was zero essentially for the last two quarters," he said. "If that ever happened in China, you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything." Assuming that Trump was talking about growth in GDP and not the real gross domestic product (which was more than $18 trillion in the last quarter of 2015), his statement that it’s zero is an exaggeration. In reality, GDP grew at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and 2 percent in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Percent change GDP in dollars 2015, Q4 1.0 $18.15 trillion 2015, Q3 2.0 $18.06 trillion 2015, Q2 3.9 $17.91 trillion 2015, Q1 0.6 $17.65 trillion 2014, Q4 2.1 $17.62 trillion 2014, Q3 4.3 $17.52 trillion 2014, Q2 4.6 $17.27 trillion 2014, Q1 -0.9 $16.98 trillion Compared to China’s 6.9 percent in 2015, that may seem like scant growth. But it’s not zero, nor is it historically low — a point Trump tried to make and flubbed in his June 2015 presidential announcement speech. "The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero," he said back then. We rated that claim Pants on Fire, noting that economic growth dipped below zero no less than 42 times since 1947. Trump doesn’t have the new talking point down, either. Our ruling Trump said, "GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters." Economic growth in the last two quarters of 2015 was modest: 1 percent and 2 percent. But that’s not zero. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-11T00:26:12	2016-03-10	['None']
pomt-09812	"Switzerland and the Netherlands . . . cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/matt-miller/analyst-says-netherlands-switzerland-achieve-unive/	People on both sides of the health care debate like to make comparisons with other countries. Critics of President Barack Obama's plan have warned that the United States could end up with programs similar to those in Canada and the United Kingdom, which they say have long waits and substandard care. But Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide now working as a management consultant, is citing two other countries — the Netherlands and Switzerland — as useful models for the United States because they have private insurance but still manage to provide universal coverage. In a Washington Post op-ed on Sept. 8, 2009, he wrote that those nations illustrate how the United States could achieve the goal of covering the uninsured without expanding direct government-run health care, such as offering a "public option," an approach supported by many Democrats but opposed by many Republicans. "The first fallacy of the 'public option or nothing' mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost — 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured." Let's take Miller's assertions individually. First, he's right that both countries have systems in which private companies provide the insurance. In both countries, citizens must buy health insurance from a company that must provide the customer with a basic package of services defined by the government. Subsidies are provided for people who need them. Because everyone is covered, the insurers can spread their financial risk across a large and diverse group of beneficiaries. Companies cannot compete against each other on the basic package (and in Switzerland, any profit they make on basic services must be used to reduce premiums the following year). Instead, they can make a profit by offering supplementary packages that cover certain services such as dental care, eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery. In Switzerland, many insurers also provide life insurance or homeowners insurance. The degree of government mandates and restrictions for private insurers in the Netherlands and Switzerland goes well beyond what is practiced by the U.S. government. But the insurers are indeed private, profit-seeking companies, as Miller said they are. Miller's second point is that both countries have universal coverage. Yes, both require people to have health insurance (just as the Democratic bill would). In the Netherlands, for instance, the penalty for not having insurance is having to pay 130 percent of the premium during the time one is not insured. In both countries, the government can forcibly enroll uninsured citizens in a plan if they do not do so themselves. Enforcement of the law is probably not 100 percent in either country, but it's close. Finally, Miller asserts that both nations spend less on health care than the United States does. Here, too, he is correct. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a group that analyzes statistics on wealthier, industrialized countries — the Dutch spent 9.8 percent of gross domestic product on health care in 2007, while the Swiss spent 10.8 percent and the United States spent 16 percent. So while Miller slightly overstated the percentage for Switzerland and the United States, he's close. As for the number of uninsured Americans, the most commonly cited number is 46 million. (We looked into the validity of this number here .) The recession has almost certainly bumped that number upward, so his "nearly 50 million" assertion is probably pretty close. So let's recap. Miller is correct that both the Netherlands and Switzerland achieve universal coverage through systems that use private insurers. And he's right that both countries do so more cheaply than the United States. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-01993	Our "trade with Mexico is $720 million a day; that’s our No. 1 trading partner."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/13/leticia-van-de-putte/van-de-putte-affirming-texas-mexico-trade-ties-dra/	The Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Texas questioned whether Republican nominee Dan Patrick understands the linked economies of neighboring Texas and Mexico. In a June 1, 2014, interview on MSNBC’s "Up With Steve Kornacki," state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio said she might ask voters to consider Patrick’s personal debts related to his bankruptcy in the 1980s. More than that, she said, "it’s the direction that he would bring this state. If really he’s such a great businessman, how come he doesn’t realize that our trade with Mexico is $720 million a day? That’s our No. 1 trading partner. Yet he chooses to demean and insult the people who live ... in the border areas, that are such a vibrant part of our economy." Patrick, a Houston state senator, can speak for himself on what he knows about trade and the border region. We wondered how Van de Putte reached her $720 million-a-day statement and the declaration of Mexico as the state’s No. 1 trading partner. Emmanuel Garcia, a Texas Democratic Party spokesman, responded on Van de Putte's behalf, saying by email the senator drew on a Feb. 26, 2013, news article in the Austin Business Journal and a report, last updated in May 2014, from Gov. Rick Perry’s office stating Mexico was the state's No. 1 trading partner in 2013. The article, describing a meeting of the Texas House Committee on International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs, said trade "between Texas and Mexico is worth $720 million a day, according to the governor’s office." We watched the House’s archived video of the hearing, which showed Amir Mirabi of the governor’s office telling the panel Texas accounts for $720 million a day, on average, in trade with Mexico. "We’re in a very, very sweet spot that we need to maintain," Mirabi testified. Tricia Horatio, an aide to the committee chairman, state Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, emailed us Mirabi’s presentation, which included a chart indicating Texas in 2011 accounted for $262 billion in imports from and exports to Mexico--or some $718 million in trade a day. The per-day figure becomes $720 million, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us by email, if one leaves out New Year's and Christmas Day "when most Texas and Mexico sea/inland ports are closed." Nashed said the 2013 presentation relied on "port-level import data, which was the best available to us at the time." But the governor no longer draws on port-level import data, she said, relying instead on U.S. Census Bureau breakdowns of each state’s imports and exports. Census bureau, here we come. And to our inquiry, Mala Mistry, a bureau statistician, provided a chart drawing on its import and export figures for Texas and Mexico. In 2013, according to the chart, Texas exported nearly $101 billion in goods to Mexico and imported nearly $95 billion worth. The total Texas-Mexico trade that year averaged about $539 million a day--up from $535 million in 2012 and $495 million in 2011--the year for which the governor’s office in testimony estimated $720 million a day in trade between the state and nation.

pomt-09075	"Langevin has been the most reliable vote for Speaker Pelosi."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/27/mark-zaccaria/zaccaria-says-langevin-has-been-most-reliable-vote/	Republican Mark Zaccaria, a candidate for Congress in the 2nd District, has challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s claim, made in a Providence Journal story, that he is non-partisan. Zaccaria says that Langevin votes with his party “about 98 percent of the time” and “has been the most reliable vote” for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We rated the 98 percent claim as True in a separate item. But we were also interested in the Pelosi claim. Here’s the full context from Zaccaria's news release: "Mr. Langevin is right that people are tired of partisan politics," Zaccaria said. "But I find it laughable that he would describe himself as 'non-partisan.' Langevin has been the most reliable vote for Speaker Pelosi, voting the party line about 98 percent of the time. If he doesn't see that as being partisan, then he is delusional. Rhode Island cannot afford to allow Mr. Langevin and Speaker Pelosi to continue to put people out of work and drive businesses out of this country while catering to their special interests." Most reliable? We went to the same source cited by Zaccaria’s campaign manager, Parker Lacoste -- a page on WashingtonPost.com that looks at the voting record of individual members of Congress. The same paragraph that says Langevin “voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 99.2% of the time during the current Congress” also invites people to see “a full list of party voters.” That’s where we discovered that there were eight Democrats with higher ratings, including Rep. Hilda Solis of California, who voted the party line 100 percent of the time. Langevin may be a very reliable vote for Pelosi, but it was VERY easy to discover that eight other representatives were more reliable. So we can reliably tell you that Zaccaria's "most reliable" claim is False.	None	Mark S. Zaccaria	None	None	None	2010-06-27T00:01:00	2010-06-02	['Nancy_Pelosi']

pomt-12875	"Thirty years ago we were the most college-educated country on the globe. Today we are No. 11."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/27/andrew-cuomo/us-no-longer-has-highest-proportion-college-educat/	The U.S. used to have the highest proportion of college-educated adults in the world. But that is not the case anymore, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. "Thirty years ago we were the most college-educated country on the globe. Today we are No. 11," Cuomo said during his executive budget presentation. Cuomo’s claim comes as he pushes for free public college tuition to students from families in New York state earning less than $125,000 a year. He wants to give low-income students more access to a higher education. His plan would cost taxpayers $163 million a year once fully phased in, he said. Is he right about the U.S. ranking for college graduates? Tracking the data Cuomo’s claim would be true if he was speaking exclusively about young adults. The U.S. did rank 11th for college education for citizens 25 to 34 years old in 2015. When you add in 2013 data from Russia, our ranking drops to 12th. But the U.S. ranked higher when including people of all ages. The U.S. in 1992 ranked highest in the world for the percentage of its population with a college degree, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international data-tracking partnership among more than 35 countries. Thirty percent of the American population, ages 25 to 64, had a college degree that year. In 2015, the nation ranked sixth among 43 countries for the percent of the population, ages 25 to 64, with an associate degree or higher. The U.S., at 44.6 percent, ranked behind Canada, Russia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. Canada ranked as the most college-educated country, with 55.2 percent of its population, ages 25 to 64, obtaining an education higher than a high school level. The organization included 2013 data for Russia in the overall rankings for 2015. Without the Russia included, the U.S. ranks fifth in 2015. The Cuomo administration did not respond to our request for more information to back up the governor’s claim Why? A recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the rate of people with a higher education in the U.S. continues to grow, but the rates in other countries are climbing faster. So other countries are catching up to where the U.S. was 30 years ago, said Elizabeth Berman, an associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany. In some cases, a college education is also more accessible in other countries. "The U.S. does expect students and families to bear the cost of higher education compared to comparable countries," Berman said. The cost of college in Canada, for example, is lower on average than in the U.S. Cliff Adelman from the Institute for Higher Education Policy says the organization’s data should be taken with a grain of salt. The data is based on population ratios. The U.S. population has grown, and the populations in some other countries have declined, remained flat or grown at a slower rate, so that affects the percentage of people with a college education. Our ruling Cuomo claimed the U.S. ranks "No. 11" among college-educated countries. The U.S. did rank 11th in 2015 for those 25 to 34 years old. But the U.S. ranking for those ages 25 to 64 did not fall by as much as Cuomo claims, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. The U.S. ranked sixth in the world for that age category. We could not find a similar dataset with results that matched Cuomo’s claim.

pomt-13949	"@realDonaldTrump is coming to San Antonio, which is 60% Mexican-AMERICAN."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jun/17/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-trump-san-antonio-60-percent-mexica/	Considering the polarization Donald Trump’s promised border wall has created in the presidential campaign thus far, it’s no big surprise that there was apprehension in his visit to San Antonio — the largest majority-Hispanic city in America as of the 2010 Census. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a longtime Clinton supporter, took to Twitter on June 6, 2016 with his take: "@realDonaldTrump is coming to San Antonio, which is 60% Mexican-AMERICAN & built on respect for many cultures. The last place he'd fit in." "That was my best approximation of San Antonio’s Mexican-American population," Castro said in an email we fielded via his press secretary, Erin Hatch. We wondered whether Castro’s very specific tweet accurately described San Antonio’s demographics. Is the city 60 percent Mexican-American? We started by looking at what percentage of San Antonio’s population claims Mexican heritage when describing their ancestry to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to methodology information on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website, when U.S. Census respondees check the box identifying as "Hispanic/Latino," they’re asked about their "specific origin," with four possible answers: "Mexican, Mexican Am[erican], Chicano," "Puerto Rican," "Cuban," and "another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin" (with a write-in option). According to numbers from the most recent American Community Survey in 2014, the city of San Antonio is 63.8 percent Hispanic or Latino (916,540 of 1,436,723 people are Hispanic or Latino). The 822,106 people identifying their specific origin as Mexican are by far the largest subgroup, making up 57.2 percent of the city’s overall population — not 60, but close. The margin of error given is plus or minus 0.9 percent, so it could be as high as 58.1 percent or as low as 56.3. But what about the "American" part of Castro’s claim? The bureau counts every resident, regardless of immigration status. So, how many of that 57.2 percent of San Antonians are citizens? On this front, we turned to the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter, who by email pointed us to Census Bureau numbers estimating that in 2014, roughly 11 percent of Hispanics in San Antonio (almost 90 percent of whom are Mexican or Mexican-American) were noncitizens as of 2014. The 2014 Census data doesn’t specify the citizenship status of San Antonians of Mexican origin, but since Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are such a large share of San Antonio’s Hispanic population, the citizenship numbers for Hispanics overall can help us get a rough idea of how many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are citizens in San Antonio. Estimating using the overall citizenship rate for San Antonio Hispanics of 89 percent would mean that of 822,106 Mexican Hispanics in San Antonio in 2014, 731,674 were citizens. The same year, by our calculation using the bureau’s population estimate for the city, those citizens would have comprised 50.1 percent of San Antonio’s population -- and 55.9 percent of San Antonio’s population of U.S. citizens (which totaled 1,309,676 that year). Complicating things is the existence of legal permanent residents (green card holders). These people are not naturalized citizens but could be considered "Americans," since they are authorized to live and work in the country indefinitely so long as they don’t violate certain rules -- according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, "Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States." They pay taxes, register for the draft, and have Social Security numbers. In 2013, a report from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that 1.32 million permanent residents lived in Texas, 950,000 of whom were eligible to be naturalized as citizens. Bureau records don’t show how many live in San Antonio, but it’s perhaps worth noting that some of that 11 percent of San Antonio Hispanics who are noncitizens are likely to be permanent residents. It’s also been a year and a half since the American Community Survey was conducted (in January 2014). In the period since, the Hispanic share of San Antonio’s population (which has historically grown faster than the overall population) has probably increased. By email, Potter told us "The county population projections for Bexar County produced by the Texas Demographic Center indicate the percent of the population that is Latino will continue to increase and the percent that is non-Hispanic white will decline." Our ruling Castro said San Antonio is 60 percent Mexican-American. The city of San Antonio is 63 percent Latino, or Hispanic, with the number of people of Mexican descent pegged at 57 percent of the population. But how many of those residents are American, either naturalized or holding permanent resident cards, is undetermined. Because of the unknowns, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09335	"Every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech, but no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/12/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-objecting-student-play-says-it-incl/	Last month, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst objected to a play subsequently canceled by a professor, citing security concerns, at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, 70 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Dewhurst said in a March 26 press release: "Every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech, but no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans." Reprehensible acts dramatized at a state-supported university? In support of Dewhurst’s statement that the acts presented are "morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans," Dewhurst spokesman Rich Parsons pointed to an aggregate of Gallup Polls taken in 2008 indicating that 77 percent of Americans consider themselves Christians compared with 91 percent when Gallup began tracking religious identification in 1948. When we asked what acts the lieutenant governor was referring to in the play "Corpus Christi" by Terrence McNally, Parsons didn’t specify them. Parsons said in an e-mail that Dewhurst generally supports artistic expression "but he would also never support the denigration of any American’s religion." So what are the play’s offensive acts? Tarleton State University declined to provide a copy of the abridged version of the play that students in a directing class planned to present. We checked out a copy from the Austin Public Library. The play depicts the life and death of a gay Jesus-like figure, Joshua, and his conversations with his homosexual disciples. The protagonist is born in a Corpus Christi hotel room. As an adult, Joshua wanders the desert, performs miracles and also officiates over a gay wedding; there's male-on-male kissing too and moments suggestive of sex such as a beach blanket scene and sounds of heterosexual coupling. Toward the end, Joshua has a last supper with followers before being betrayed by a friend named Judas. He is crucified. The play drew protests when it made its New York premiere in 1998, though Time magazine critic Richard Zoglin wrote: "Years from now, when the brouhaha is past, Corpus Christi may get its due as one of McNally's best, most moving and personal works. His updating of the Christ story is witty but not patronizing, as sober and cleansing as a dip in baptismal water." Mark Holtorf, the Tarleton State theater professor whose students had planned a single performance of the play, said he interprets the drama as a commentary on what it was like to grow up gay in Corpus Christi in the 1950's. Referring to McNally, who grew up there, Holtorf said: "In a way, it’s somewhat autobiographical. I walked away from the play having a much better understanding of what this poor guy must have gone through." Holtorf said the version that was to be performed had women filling eight of 13 roles because of the preponderance of female drama students. He said the only use of government funds would have been the cost of class time devoted to the play and utilities associated with a campus building; tuition-paying students also paid about $200 out of pocket for permission to perform the play and to receive scripts. Parsons, of Dewhurst’s office, pointed us to reports on objections to the Tarleton State production. An article posted by Catholic Online calls the play "blasphemous," quoting a leader of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property saying: "With this play Tarleton State University is offending the honor of Our Lord, the Apostles, and 68 million Catholics. What makes it even worse is the fact that it’s taking place right before Holy Week." The play was scheduled for the Saturday before Palm Sunday. Another Catholic Online article quotes Catholic League President Bill Donohue calling the play "hate speech directed at Christians and (as) far more than just a ‘gay Jesus’ play." Short of Dewhurst revealing what acts in the play he believes most Americans consider morally reprehensible, we'll assume he's referring to the provocative element that suffuses the play—depiction of a Jesus-like figure and his acolytes as gay men. We found no polling on such specifics. But the non-partisan American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a think tank with conservative roots, recently updated a compilation of national polls that suggests adults are divided in their views of homosexuality, though attitudes have relaxed over time. In 2006, 56 percent of respondents said sexual relations between two adults of the same sex are always wrong with another 5 percent saying they almost always are wrong. The institute, quoting the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, says that in 1973, 73 percent of adults said such relations were always wrong with 7 percent saying they're almost always wrong. In a May 2007 Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans said that homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal, up from 32 percent in 1986, according to the institute. In 2008, a Gallup poll found 48 percent of Americans saying homosexual relations are morally acceptable and 48 percent saying they’re morally wrong, the institute said. In May 2008, a Gallup poll found 57 percent of Americans saying they feel homosexuality should be considered an acceptable alternative lifestyle; 40 percent said not. Among adults who attend church weekly, 79 percent considered sexual relations between two adults of the same sex always wrong in 2002—compared to 46 percent of respondents who attended church once a month or less, according to the institute. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas professor of government and the polling director for UT's Texas Politics Project, cautioned against assuming that widened tolerance of gay lifestyles means Americans would be comfortable with presenting a play at a public university that depicts a Jesus-like figure as gay. In Texas, Shaw speculated, 80-plus percent of residents would object. "Close to 50 percent of Texans identify themselves as evangelical, fundamentalist, or born again," Shaw said in an email. "Furthermore, if you were to actually poll-test this item, I'd be stunned if there weren't huge majorities who think a play protraying Jesus as gay would be offensive (and probably deeply offensive)." Where does all this leave Dewhurst’s statement? Dewhurst accurately recaps the play's intended presentation at a state-supported institution, though the use of government funds would have been minimal. While he doesn't share what "morally reprehensible" acts he believes most Americans abhor, we assume he's upset at the play's gay aspect. Polls indicate that a large percentage of Texans see themselves as religious. And most frequent church-goers consider gay sex morally wrong. Yet that's not the "vast majority of Americans," as Dewhurst put it. Americans in general are split on whether gay relations are immoral; it's unmeasured how they'd rate unspecified acts in a play. We rate Dewhurst's statement as Barely True -- granting that this could change should Dewhurst identify the acts he considers reprehensible. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09062	"The first time he ever voted as a Democrat was here in Florida in 2008. He only voted four times in his life, and he's asking Floridians to come out and vote for him."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/29/kendrick-meek/meek-says-greene-only-voted-four-times/	Congressman Kendrick Meek wants voters to view him as the true Democrat in his U.S. Senate primary against billionaire Jeff Greene. In a June 22, 2010, debate between the two candidates hosted by the Palm Beach Post, Meek said of his opponent: "The first time he ever voted as a Democrat was here in Florida in 2008. He only voted four times in his life, and he's asking Floridians to come out and vote for him." Greene's run as a Republican in 1982 in a Congressional primary in California isn't in dispute. And the Truth-o-Meter previously ruled a separate claim by Meek that Greene had only lived in Florida for two years as True. But we wondered, did Meek accurately summarize Greene's voting record -- is it true that the 55-year-old Greene has voted only four times in his life? We did our homework, checking voting records to determine how many times -- and under which party affiliation -- Greene voted. First we contacted the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk to ask for a history of Greene's voter registration and record. Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982, said spokeswoman Monica Flores in an e-mail. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu and changed party affiliation to "Decline to State." Flores provided copies of his 1982 and 1992 registrations. He voted in the 1992 general election, 2000 primary and general elections and the 2004 general election, Flores wrote. That's four elections in California, and Greene campaign spokesman Paul Blank says Greene voted for Democrats -- Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry -- in those presidential races. Another Greene spokesman Luis Vizcaino said Greene also voted in the 1982 Congressional primary, which he lost, but Flores said her office's voting history information only extends back to 1992. We contacted Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections. Christina White, director of the office of governmental affairs, told us in an e-mail that Greene registered as a Democrat in Miami Beach on March 20, 2008. He voted Nov. 4, 2008. We contacted Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher to ask when Greene registered in the county where he now lives. On April 14, 2010, he changed his address to Palm Beach, Bucher said. Bucher said Greene had previously registered to vote as an NPA (No Party Affiliation) in 1977 at Century Village in West Palm Beach. The office does not have any record of him voting affiliated with that registration. Vizcaino told us that the only county that Greene registered in in California was Los Angeles County and that the only other state he registered in was Florida. We e-mailed our findings to Vizcaino who disagreed with one part regarding registration: Greene says he registered in West Palm Beach in 1973 as a Democrat -- though Bucher said he registered in 1977 as an NPA. Vizcaino asked Greene about the discrepancy. Vizcaino said Greene replied: "If that's what they have, I must have changed it at some point. I don't know why. I am certain I was a registered Democrat." The Greene campaign sent us this response to our query about his voting history and registration: "Jeff voted in some elections and missed some elections, voting in 4 out of the last 5 presidential elections. Jeff is an outsider and wasn't focused on politics, he was focused on building a successful business and creating jobs." So where does that leave us? Meek said that the first time Greene voted as a Democrat was in Florida in 2008. Based on voter history information we found in California and Florida dating back to 1992, that's true. Meek also claimed that Greene "only voted four times in his life." We found five times: 1992, twice in 2000 and 2004 in California and once in Florida in 2008. Greene's campaign said he voted in 1982 when he ran for office. We think it would be strange if he ran for Congress and didn't vote for himself, but Los Angeles did not keep such records before 1992. Greene says he first registered as a Democrat in 1973 -- but Palm Beach records show 1977 as an NPA. Based on available records, Greene voted at least five times, likely six times -- not four. Meek isn't far off though, so we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-06-29T15:24:36	2010-06-22	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Florida']
pomt-03878	"For the first time in eight years, our budget also increases funding for persons with disabilities by $36 million to help more disabled people receive community-based services."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-36-million-disability-waiting-list/	In 2011, Republican Gov. Rick Scott gave his State of the State address to a tea party rally in Eustis. He called for spending and tax cuts and bashed Washington, D.C. Flash-forward two years later, and Scott’s State of the State called for helping the poor by expanding Medicaid, boosting teacher pay and increasing funds to help people with disabilities. "For the first time in eight years, our budget also increases funding for persons with disabilities by $36 million to help more disabled people receive community-based services, and $2.5 million for job training." An image of a softer, kinder governor? Yep. But were his words accurate? We decided to research if Scott has proposed more money to help more people with disabilities receive services, and if that occurred for the first time in eight years. (Scott’s tenure started in 2011.) A wait list of 22,000 On Feb. 8, Scott held an event at the Association for the Development of the Exceptional in Miami to announce that his budget proposal included the $36 million. The money will serve people with disabilities on a waiting list for a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid waiver. The Legislature will have to agree to the money earmarked for the waitlist. The state-federal program serves people with intellectual disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy or other disabilities in their homes or community -- rather than sending them to more costly institutions. The $36 million increase includes about $15 million from the state and $21.2 million from the federal government. "That means we’ll help families by providing personal care assistance, transportation, adult day training, and other needed services to improve their quality of life and find job opportunities," Scott said in February. Currently, about 30,000 Floridians have such a waiver, but there are another 22,000 on the waiting list. How many people will be served by the additional money? About 750. That means the extra money will only help a small slice of those waiting for services. "We as providers and we as advocates say thank you, but we’d like to see the state, the governor and the agency do more because 1,000 out of 22,000 is not going to be a significant number," said Clint Bower, president of Miami-based MACTown, which serves Floridians on the waiver. And even if Florida reduces the waiting list, it will still lag behind most other states. Florida’s waiting list was the sixth-longest in the country in 2010 (Texas had the longest), according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Though a long waiting list isn’t surprising considering Florida’s large population, some states simply fund the services, without making people wait for specific waiver. Some Floridians have been on the waiting list for 10 years, said Deborah Linton, director of The Arc of Florida. "The other day a woman who was 92 years old called us and she still cares for her adult son with no assistance!" Linton told PolitiFact Florida in an email. History of waiver funding Scott talked about the amount of money budgeted for the program. In recent years, expenditures have often soared above initial appropriations (one year by as much as $166 million), resulting in massive deficits. The deficits were so big that in 2011, Scott said he would slash rates charged by group homes and caseworkers, which drew criticism from advocates. He quickly reversed that plan when legislators agreed to back fill a deficit. A chart compiled by the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities shows expenditures peaked at about $975 million in 2010-11. Data from the state’s Agency for Persons with Disabilities shows the highest amount budgeted was about $957 million in 2007-08. For 2013-14, Scott’s proposed budget for the program is about $905 million -- substantially less than the program’s budget a few years ago. But Scott’s claim was that for the first time in eight years the budget would increase funding to help more people receive services. The last significant jump in the number of clients -- about a 5,000 increase -- was between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 years. The Legislature earmarked about $27 million then to take more people off the waitlist. And the next year the deficits started. The Legislature earmarked waiting list money in 2006-07 too, but due to the deficits it didn’t truly go to easing the waitlist. That means Scott’s math is correct when he looks at his 2013-14 budget proposal and points to the last significant increase in clients served eight years ago. Advocates told PolitiFact Florida that for the most part in recent years, the only new clients added have been through lawsuits or those in crisis -- for example, their parent-caregiver dies. Scott’s additional dollars would allow other people to get off the waitlist. Meanwhile, the state Agency for Persons with Disabilities is phasing in a new program for people who receive the waiver, giving them a set budget and choices on how to spend it. The state expects that will reduce costs per client, freeing up spots on the waitlist. Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties will be next to phase in the new budget program which has resulted in about 40 percent of the clients getting a reduction in money, said Barbara Palmer, APD director. While that is good news for reducing the deficit, the funding change has met resistance from some clients. About 2,000 Floridians have appealed their new waiver amount, according to Linton. "We must be careful to still fulfill the needs of the individuals currently on the waiver to protect their health and safety while trying to serve even more," she told PolitiFact in an email. Our ruling During his State of the State speech, Scott said "For the first time in eight years, our budget also increases funding for persons with disabilities by $36 million to help more disabled people receive community-based services..." Scott has proposed $36 million that should help at least 750 people with disabilities on the waiting list for the waiver. The last time the state increased funding to allow a significant increase in clients was eight years ago. However, Scott omitted that about 21,000 would remain on the waiting list. And due to other budgetary changes, some people are getting less money to spend on services. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-03-07T14:05:25	2013-03-05	['None']
pomt-10049	On attacks by Republicans that various programs in the economic stimulus plan are not stimulative, "If you add all that stuff up, it accounts for less than 1 percent of the overall package."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/09/barack-obama/some-republican-attacks-relatively-small-others-no/	In the battle for public opinion, Republican opponents of President Obama's economic stimulus plan have repeatedly scored points by ticking off various spending programs that seem hard to defend as economic stimulus. Hundreds of millions for contraceptives. Hundreds millions more for sexually transmitted disease prevention. Two hundred million to refurbish the National Mall, including new sod. Some Republican leaders warned the plan even cleverly funnels millions, maybe even billions, to the party's favorite villain, ACORN. In one of several interviews last week to promote the plan, Obama played defense, portraying those controversial projects as relatively small in the overall scope of a massive and urgently needed plan. "People have plucked out this program or that program that doesn't look particularly stimulative, the contraceptives issue being a primary example," Obama said in an interview with the CBS Evening News on Feb. 3, 2009. "If you add all that stuff up, it accounts for less than 1 percent of the overall package. Now, that doesn't mean that the package can't improve and that's what I said to the leadership last night, 'Let's improve it. Let's make this a package that is big enough for the moment.'" Obama is right about some of the Republican sound bites that have drawn the most attention. A few examples: • "How you can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptives — how does that stimulate the economy?" — House Republican Leader John Boehner. • "I mean, there's $300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami. You know, there's $360 million for sexually transmitted disease education." — Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip. • As much as "$4.2 billion would be available to organizations like ACORN for so-called neighborhood revitalization. That's just political payoff." — Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter. • "I mean, there are so many different things that you can make fun of in this bill. Let me just mention one — millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines. ... It doesn't stimulate anything." — Sen. Jon Kyl, the Republican Whip. • "In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track." — Republican Rep. Mike Pence. PolitiFact has looked at a number of the Republican claims and found that some are accurate (such as spending for STD prevention), some are misleading (such as the claims about money for ACORN), some are outright wrong (such as the claim about money for a sculpture garden in Miami) and some have since been cut (such as money for contraceptives). We find that Obama is right that these projects are tiny in the scheme of a plan costing upwards of $800 billion. In fact, all those items listed above would come, as Obama said, to less than 1 percent of the package. Democrat Charles E. Schumer, the senior senator from New York, picked up that line of defense in an interview on Feb. 9 on MSNBC’s Morning Joe when he said, "Why quibble over $200 million?" But that argument from Schumer and Obama ignores more wholesale Republican criticisms of spending in the plan. For example, Sen. Tom Coburn and his staff put together a widely circulated list of more than 30 items in the proposed stimulus plan that he considers wasteful. That list includes a "$2 billion earmark to restart FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Deptartment of Energy defunded last year because the project was inefficient" and "$246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film" (since removed). The majority of his list comes to about 2 percent of the overall package, but jumps significantly when he includes $87.7 billion that he calls a state Medicaid bailout, a project that Democrats contend would have a good stimulative effect. John Hart, a spokesman for Coburn, said those items hardly comprise a list of the entirety of Coburn's objections to the stimulus package. "These are items that are particularly egregious," Hart said. "But there are thousands of provisions in there. These are just a few that jump out at us as particularly wasteful, the ones that didn't pass the smell or laugh test." In fact, in an opinion piece written by Coburn for the Wall Street Journal , Coburn laid out his case that the overwhelming majority of Obama's plan is not stimulative. "Less than 10 percent of the bill could be considered true stimulus, if one assumes tax credits and infrastructure spending will jolt the economy," Coburn stated. "The other 90 percent of the bill represents one of the most egregious acts of generational theft in our nation's history, with taxpayer money going to special-interest earmarks, an ill-conceived bailout to states, and permanent spending increases that expand government's reach in areas like health care and education." Coburn is hardly alone among Republicans in believing that major portions of the Obama stimulus plan aren't stimulative. Said Republican Rep. Kenny Marchant of Texas: "This bill, quite frankly, was an attempt to sneak hundreds of billions of dollars in pork into an 'emergency' bill under the guise of 'stimulus.'" Sen. Charles Grassley and other Republicans say they have less problem with the proposed tax cuts and shovel-ready projects where the money can be spent in two years. Grassley suggests, "Cut all the spending out, keep the stimulus, do almost as much stimulus as you want to do and can do in two years, and keep the tax provisions. And what that adds up to, it would add up to a lot less than $900 billion. But whatever it adds up to doesn't bother me as much as what's in the $900 billion bill that's going to obligate us for the next 50 years as opposed to the next two years." We're not going to weigh in one way or the other about whether the Republicans or Democrats are right about whether spending in the plan is stimulative — only that many Republicans have claimed large portions of it are not. Obama's point is that some perspective is in order, that legislators are quibbling over a relatively small portion of the spending. And yes, if he's talking about some of the most publicized projects, he's right. But we think that it's misleading to dismiss all of the complaints as less than 1 percent. In fact, many Republicans have said large percentages of the stimulus plan would not stimulate the economy and would waste taxpayer money. And so we rate Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-01324	Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States "with an elevated temperature."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/26/darrell-issa/did-ebola-victim-thomas-eric-duncan-enter-united-s/	How much airport Ebola screening is too much? That was the big question on the Sunday talk shows Oct. 26. Over the weekend, New York, New Jersey and Illinois upped their Ebola screening guidelines, quarantining anyone passing through John F. Kennedy, Newark and Chicago-O'Hare international airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they’re not showing symptoms. The guidelines surpass federal regulations and have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, arguing that they are unnecessary. JFK, Newark and O'Hare already have screening processes, along with three other American airports, (more on that later) and people who aren’t showing symptoms aren’t contagious, experts say. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said New York and New Jersey’s quarantine might be unnecessary. But that doesn’t change the fact that the country’s Ebola screening hasn’t been adequate so far -- it missed Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States, who died Oct. 8. "We had Mr. Duncan come in (to the United States) with an elevated temperature. We weren’t checking it, and now we’re playing catch-up," Issa said. The New York and New Jersey guidelines were put in place after a doctor in New York City tested positive for the disease Oct. 23. He arrived in New York Oct. 17 from Guinea, where he had been treating Ebola patients, and had been checking his temperature twice a day. It doesn’t appear that this patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, was showing symptoms when he first arrived in the United States. But what about Duncan -- is Issa right in saying that he came to the United States with a fever (Issa's office did not respond to our request for comment.) Duncan’s fever On Sept. 20, when Duncan arrived at Dulles International Airport in Washington from Liberia (via Belgium), American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola. But Duncan went through screening Sept. 19 in Monrovia, Liberia, where he presented a temperature of 97.3 degrees -- so he didn’t have a fever when he boarded the plane -- according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials who reviewed Duncan’s airport screening record. (According to the National Institutes of Health, the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and a fever starts at a body temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.) We (and Issa) can’t know with certainty if Duncan had acquired a fever by the time he arrived at Dulles. But he did not report falling ill until several days later, when he went to the hospital Sept. 25 with a 100.1 degree fever. It was during this first visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that Duncan wasn’t examined appropriately. The nurse documented that Duncan had a temperature of 100.1 degrees. It was only after a physician examined him that she included in his record that he had recently arrived from Africa. He was discharged early the next morning. He returned to the hospital Sept. 28 and died there about 10 days later. We should note that Liberian authorities said Duncan lied on the airport Ebola screening questionnaire by answering "no" to questions about whether he had contact with an Ebola patient or cared for one or touched the body of someone who had died of Ebola. It was found out later that Duncan helped carry 19-year-old Marthalene Williams into a taxi to go to the hospital. She was seven months pregnant and was turned away at the hospital due to lack of space in the Ebola ward. She died several hours later. It is unclear whether Duncan knew of her diagnosis. Airport screenings Airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been going on since at least August. According to the CDC, exit screening might look different in each country but the basic elements are the same. All travelers must have their temperature taken, answer a questionnaire about their health and exposure history and are visually assessed for signs of potential illness. Travelers who show symptoms or signs of exposure are separated and assessed further which ultimately determines whether they are allowed to travel. Screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada and now the United States. The first week of October -- the week Duncan died -- the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines to supplement the screening already taking place in West Africa airports. Travelers from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports now have to go through an Ebola screening process. After passport review, they will have their temperature taken and answer questions about possible exposure. If they show possible signs of Ebola or exposure, they will be passed on to a public health authority. If not, the traveler will receive information about self-monitoring for symptoms. The five international airports -- John F. Kennedy, Newark, O’Hare, Dulles and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- already handled 94 percent of arrivals from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. On Oct. 21, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that all travelers coming to America from those three countries would have to go through the five designated American airports. Our ruling Issa said Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States "with an elevated temperature." According to the CDC, Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia. At the time, American airports were not screening travelers, so there’s no way for us (or Issa) to know definitively if he had a fever when he got to the United States. But he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving, when he went to the hospital with a fever. It’s possible that even if current screening measures had been in place, Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms. We rate Issa’s statement False.

pomt-05720	"Between 1982 and 2007 the cost of a college education increased 439 percent."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/07/ron-wyden/ron-wyden-puts-number-soaring-cost-college-439-per/	Clarification appended: An earlier version of this story failed to note that one of the numbers was seasonally adjusted. The omission does not affect the ruling. A college degree is widely seen as a ticket to success. But nowadays, it’s also an express ride to something else -- debt. Deep and ever-expanding debt. Politicians talk a lot about the rising costs of college and college debt. President Barack Obama talked about it during his State of the Union address in January when he told colleges to get their costs under control or face a loss of taxpayer support. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is also talking about the costs. But in a statement Wyden made recently about college costs, he was very specific. "Between 1982 and 2007, the cost of a college education increased 439 percent," he said Feb. 9. That’s a big and not the least bit fuzzy number, the kind that always quickens the breathing here at PolitiFact Oregon. Let’s examine it. We start by asking Wyden where he got his numbers. His staff pointed us to a 2008 study by The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a respected and nonpartisan think tank that dives deeply into the funding and cost and effectiveness of colleges. Sure enough, there on page 8 is a graph that shows the cost of college tuition and fees soaring 439 percent between 1982 and 2007. That increase far outstrips the rise in cost for such things as health care and the increase in median income. Darcie Harvey, a policy analyst for center, said the results were based on government data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which complies the Consumer Price Index. That index is the federal government’s official measure for the direction of prices. If you adjust the numbers seasonally -- college isn't usually a year-round expense, the increase for tuition and fees from 1982 to 2007 is even higher - 455 percent, according to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "First, college tuition continues to outpace family income and the price of other necessities, such as medical care, food, and housing." the center’s 2008 study found. "Whatever the causes of these tuition increases, the continuation of trends of the last quarter-century would place higher education beyond the reach of most Americans and would greatly exacerbate the debt burdens of those who do enroll." We also looked at other statistics from other nonpartisan sources to see if they back up Wyden’s claim that tuition and fees are rising, and to check on whether the trend Wyden noted has continued in more recent years. The National Center for Education Statistics, which is the data-collecting arm of the U.S. Department of Education, shows an unmistakable and relentless increase in college costs. "Between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, prices for undergraduate tuition, room, and board at public institutions rose 37 percent, and prices at private institutions rose 25 percent, after adjustment for inflation," the agency reported last year. A recent report from the College Board, the same people who bring you the SAT test and closely monitor college costs and aid, found that between 2006-07 and 2011-12, average tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities increased annually an average of 5.1 percent above inflation. The College Board data, which is based on surveys sent to nearly 4,000 post-secondary institutions across the country and historical statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and National Center for Education Statistics, go even deeper. For the 1991-92 school year, annual tuition and fees at a four-year public university on average were $2,107. They climbed to $8,244 in 2011-12 -- an increase of about 291 percent. The College Board also provides data in "constant dollars," which are adjusted for inflation. Those numbers showed an increase from $3,495 to $8,244, or about 136 percent. Even though the assortment of studies and analyses measure different elements (some look only at tuition and fees while others include room and board) and survey different periods of time, taken together they leave no doubt. While we might prefer more recent statistics, the trend hasn’t changed. Wyden’s numbers -- that the cost of college increased an astounding 439 percent from 1982 through 2007 -- and his underlying point are correct. We rate this claim: True.

pomt-05241	President Obama budget request for veterans is "more than double the amount in constant dollars appropriated in 1980, when the veterans population was larger by a third."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/04/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-veteran-funding-has-risen-dramatical/	Sen. Jim Webb said funding for veterans services is much higher now than three decades ago. "The president’s budget request for FY2013 veterans spending is $140 billion -- more than double the amount in constant dollars appropriated in 1980, when the veterans population was larger by a third," Webb, D-Va., said in a May 14 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Webb, who served as secretary of the navy under President Ronald Reagan, was referring to funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care and pensions to honorably-discharged service members who have been wounded or suffered illnesses in times of war. Heather Fluit, a spokeswoman for Webb, said the senator got his data from a query to the Congressional Research Service, which provides non-partisan analysis of issues for Congress. We checked whether Webb was right about the increase in funding and whether the number of veterans is indeed lower today than three decades ago. Let’s start with the budget numbers. Webb claims the president’s 2013 spending request is more double the amount in 1980 after the figures are adjusted for inflation. President Barack Obama proposed a $140.3 billion budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the 2013 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Josephine Schuda, a spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, told us Congress appropriated $20.6 billion to the agency in fiscal 1980. We adjusted that for inflation using the Consumer Price Index calculator on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. The appropriation in 1980 comes to $57.5 billion in modern-day dollars. So Webb is right; the $140 billion request is more than double the amount appropriated in 1980, even after adjusting for inflation. Now, let’s look at how the size of the veterans population three decades ago compares to today. Schuda said that in 1980, there were 30.1 million veterans. The most recent VA numbers show there were 22.2 million veterans in September 2011. That means the number of veterans in 1980 was about one-third larger than today’s veterans population. So Webb is right on this score, too. Why were there more veterans in the 1980s than today? Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said a big contributor is that there were more surviving World War II veterans back in 1980 than today. Tim Tetz, legislative director for the American legion, said a key reason VA funding has increased is that Congress in 1996 expanded the number veterans eligible to receive health care from the agency. The VA budget has significantly expanded over the last 10 years under Obama as well as former President George W. Bush. There are 5.5 million patients in the VA health care system today. In 1980, there was only a fraction of the amount, Tetz said. Our ruling Webb said the president’s $140 billion request for veterans services is more than double what it was in 1980, when the veterans population was a third larger than today. He’s right. We point out that major increases to the VA occurred in the last decade under the Bush and Obama administrations. That said, we rate the senator’s statement True.

pomt-11762	These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns.	true	/illinois/statements/2017/dec/04/daniel-biss/biss-accurate-sarcastic-tax-hit-opponents-pritzker/	See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com After Democratic gubernatorial candidates J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only summaries of their income tax returns on Nov. 27, rival Daniel Biss wasted no time blasting them for what they didn’t make public. As Gov. Bruce Rauner has done since first becoming a candidate in 2013, Pritzker and Kennedy released their federal and state 1040 forms, which reveal only basic details of their their tax pictures. The meat of returns, especially for wealthy taxpayers like Pritzker, Kennedy and Rauner, lies in an array of schedules and attachments to those 1040s that illustrate how they made their money, managed their wealth, donated to charity and reduced their tax burdens by leveraging breaks often used by the wealthy. And neither Pritzker, Kennedy nor Rauner have been willing to share such telling information with voters. "These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns," Biss said in one of many tweets he issued on the topic that day. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In April, Biss, a Democratic state senator from Evanston, released five years’ worth of full tax returns, including Form 1040 cover sheets and attachments detailing deductions, supplemental income and credits. They showed Biss and his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, with quite modest income, averaging just under $55,000 per year over the five years covered in the returns. Biss spent more than seven months criticizing his wealthy competitors for foot-dragging before they released their returns. With nominating petitions now filed for the March 20 Democratic primary and election season in full swing, the Rauner and Romney comparisons likely will become a hammer with which Biss will repeatedly bash his far wealthier opponents. We decided to look into Biss’ Twitter claim both to check its accuracy and to examine the history of candidate tax disclosure. Standard procedure The "Bruce Rauner standard" that Biss, currently a state senator, cites refers to the tax disclosures Rauner has made annually since he first became a candidate for governor in 2013. Though Illinois law does not require candidates or officeholders to make public any income tax information, Rauner released three years’ worth of federal and state 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions in November 2013. They showed Rauner and his wife Diana had income of $27.2 million in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011 and $53.4 million in 2012. Their effective tax rates in those years were 16.9 percent, 21.5 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Rauner has continued to release the 1040 forms since then. His 2013 returns, released a month before the 2014 election, showed income of $60.15 million and a 24-percent tax rate. In 2014, the Rauners reported income of $57.5 million and a 26-percent tax rate. Rauner’s income ballooned during his first two years as governor. In 2015, he reported income of $188 million followed by $91 million in 2016, with tax rates of 26 and 25, respectively. But because Rauner has not released the schedules and attachments that detail how his income was derived, the 1040 forms lend little insight where his money comes from and how he manages it. Pritzker essentially matched Rauner’s skimpy disclosure when the Democrat filed his nominating petitions on Nov. 27, but Kennedy did even less. Pritzker released summaries of his last three years of taxes showing adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015 and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014). Kennedy confined his release of 1040 information to 2016 returns only. For that year, he reported adjusted gross income $1,242,805 and an effective tax rate of 14 percent. The financial picture for Kennedy and Pritzker, at least, is further obscured by their decisions to not release detail about trusts they also benefit from but which are kept separate from the information reported on their personal tax returns. Like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy derived their income from interest, dividends and capital gains, not from wages. Candidates in Illinois are are also required to file statements of economic interest that detail entities in which they have ownership interests or derive income, and all the Democrats as well as Rauner have complied. But the information value from such reports is quite limited, with disclosures confined to the names of business interests and not the value of individual investments or income they produce. (Click here for current statements of economic interest from Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.) Romney’s release Biss also accuses his Democratic counterparts of "falling dismally short" of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, like Rauner a longtime private equity investor whose wealth had become an issue in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat then-President Barack Obama. Romney released complete income taxes for 2010 and 2011, including hundreds of pages of schedules and explanatory material that allowed a public view into the management of his fortune. They showed Romney paid a relatively low tax rate of 14.7 percent on a total of $42.6 million in income for the two years combined, and that he held considerable assets in offshore tax havens including Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In an election in which income inequality had become a major issue, this gave Obama’s campaign ammunition to portray the former Massachusetts governor as out of touch with the vast majority of Americans. Romney was following what had become standard procedure for presidents and major presidential candidates of both parties following the scandal plagued administration of Richard Nixon, said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, which tracks presidential tax releases. Obama also routinely released full returns annually both as a presidential contender and president. Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, is the first U.S. president since Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974, to not release any information about personal taxes. Second career politicians A proliferation of wealthy political candidates coming off successful business careers in Illinois and elsewhere likely portends an era of increasing opaqueness when it comes to tax disclosure, Thorndike speculated. "I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials," Thorndike said. "I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s." Governors’ roles in administering state taxes should heighten public pressure to release full returns, Thorndike said. "These candidates if they win election are going to be in charge of collecting taxes from everyone else and it seems reasonable to me that voters want to know how they conducted themselves and whether they've been living up to their civic duty in the way that everyone else is supposed to," he said. Lawrence Noble, senior director the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said the current push in Washington for a sweeping federal overhaul, only underscores the shortcomings of the sort of limited tax disclosure practiced by Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy. All derive the bulk of their income from investments, and are likely to reap significant financial benefit from the current GOP push in Washington to overhaul the federal tax system that most analysts have concluded is tilted toward tax breaks for the wealthy. How much any of the well-to-do Illinois candidates stand to benefit is impossible to gauge without more information than is disclosed in 1040 forms. "Where they have their investments, how much they have and how various pieces of legislation will affect them is important," said Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. "And one of the ways you can tell that is by their taxes and often it's the only way you can tell unless you’re just going to take their word for it." Our ruling Biss sarcastically said his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates "are living up to" the standard for releasing tax information set by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. He also said they fell short of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Like Rauner, J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only their federal and state 1040 forms, which provide only the most basic information on income and taxes paid. And Romney did release two years’ worth of full returns, including hundreds of pages of detail, when he was running for president in 2012. There is no law in Illinois requiring gubernatorial candidates or governors to release any tax information whatsoever, and Biss is clearly engaging in some campaign hyperbole when he refers to a Rauner standard and a Romney standard. That said, we find the essence of his statements to be True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Daniel Biss	None	None	None	2017-12-04T05:00:00	2017-11-27	['None']

pomt-02810	"Only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/27/lynn-westmoreland/congressman-seeks-clean-bill-health-obamacare-cove/	For a specific segment of Georgians, the recent rollout of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces has been fraught with confusion, headaches and more confusion. We told you so, say some critics of the act, which many call Obamacare. One of those critics, U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., offered some specific numbers to outline the problems, courtesy of his Twitter account. "Only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance," said a tweet posted from his account. The tweet ended with the hashtag: "trainwreck." Some of us wondered about the accuracy of the tweet, particularly how many Georgians have lost their health insurance. Regarding the first part of the tweet, the White House announced on Nov. 13 that about 106,000 Americans had selected a health care plan through the federal government’s marketplace accounts. The number was far below federal projections. In Georgia, 1,390 people had selected a marketplace plan, but only 536 actually completed enrollment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Westmoreland’s tweet was sent the morning after the White House announced the enrollment numbers. President Barack Obama sold the health care act to Americans, in part, on the pledge that individuals who like their insurance could keep their plans. However, many Americans learned their plans did not meet the requirements of the health care law when the marketplaces premiered on October 1. Some told harrowing stories that their plans were being cancelled. Obama held a news conference on Nov. 14 in which he offered to let insurance companies sell existing plans for at least one more year, even if they do not meet the standards of the health care law. Problem solved? Not exactly. Some states said it was too late to make such an allowance and they would not let insurance companies extend their policies. Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens said the day after the president’s announcement that he lacks the authority to enforce the stop-gap measure. According to some news accounts, an estimated 11 million Americans buy their own health insurance. In Georgia, 404,669 people have health insurance through individual accounts, according to Hudgens’ office. Most of these Georgians are self-employed, work at companies that don’t provide insurance or are early retirees. Individual plans represent about 6 percent of the total insurance market in Georgia, the AJC has reported. The Associated Press recently reported that 400,000 Georgians had received health insurance policy cancellation notices. Westmoreland’s office cited that report as the basis for the congressman’s claim. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, said she wrote the tweet and sent it from the congressman’s Twitter account. So have all of these Georgians lost their health insurance? Not exactly, some say. Glenn Allen, a spokesman for Hudgens, said because the health insurance policies of those 400,000 or so Georgians does not comply with federal law, their policies could be cancelled, thus the notices to those folks in the mail. Some of those customers will still have healthcare coverage through their insurance company. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia sent letters to individual policyholders stating that their plans can no longer be offered through the health care law. The letters offer help with finding plans compliant with the law. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia has about 150,000 people who receive insurance through the individual plans, more than any healthcare provider in the state. The AJC and other news outlets -- including the Associated Press -- have reported that although a policy doesn't comply with the law doesn't mean consumers will get cancellation letters. One AP article noted that it is unclear how many individual plans are being canceled. Shedd said she probably should had mentioned "cancellations" in the tweet, as opposed to writing that 400,000 Georgians have lost their health insurance. The consequences of packaging a message into 140 characters, she said. Shedd made the argument that those customers still face the prospect of either changing their policies or losing their insurance. "I think if you are talking to people who’ve received notices, they look at it as ‘I’ve lost my health insurance,’ " she said. To sum up, Westmoreland’s tweet said "only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance." The number of Georgians signed up was correct. The number of Georgians who have lost their insurance needs some clarity. About 400,000 Georgians have received notices warning their policies could be cancelled because they are not compliant with the federal law. Not all of them will go without insurance, officials explained. Westmoreland’s claim, like many concerning the health care law, is complicated. There’s some context that’s necessary to fully understand the situation some Georgians face as a result of the controversial law. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-14181	Says Donald Trump thinks "a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/25/ted-cruz/cruz-attack-ad-trump-distorts-transgender-bathroom/	Donald Trump wants to let male predators masquerading as women in the same bathrooms as your wife and daughter, according to an ominous black-and-white ad from presidential rival Ted Cruz. The ad refers to Trump’s stance on North Carolina’s controversial HB 2 (sometimes dubbed the bathroom bill), the subject of repeated criticism and jokes by Cruz. (Here’s one: "If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can’t go to the girls’ bathroom.") "Should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use the women's restroom? The same restroom used by your daughter? Your wife? Donald Trump thinks so," reads the ad, which first aired April 22 and includes a clip of Trump suggesting people use the bathroom that "they feel is appropriate." "It's not appropriate," the ad continues. "It's not safe. It's PC nonsense that's destroying America. Donald Trump won't take on the PC police. He's one of them." Did the Cruz ad accurately describe Trump’s view? Not really. The businessman's comments on HB 2 suggest he doesn't really see allowing bathroom choice for transgender people as a problem. But by prohibiting people from using the bathroom they feel is appropriate, Trump said, North Carolina has hurt its business potential. Further, medical experts typically agree that a transgender woman is a woman who identifies differently from her assigned sex at birth, though there isn’t universal agreement on this point. So it’s not entirely accurate for Cruz to define a transgender woman as "a grown man pretending to be a woman." The ad is playing into fears of the Charlotte ordinance enabling predatory behavior on children and women, which could still happen (and still be a crime) without a transgender-friendly law. With that, let's get into Trump's comments. Trump on NBC’s Today The ad quotes Trump as saying on April 21, "People go — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate." The comment is plucked out of context from Trump's interview on Today. He was describing transgender people using the bathroom of their choice in Charlotte, N.C., before the state passed HB 2, which prevented local governments from setting anti-discrimination policies and restricted bathroom access to a person's gender on his or her birth certificate. Willie Geist: "Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT, how you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about the North Carolina bathroom law, in particular." Trump: "Oh, I had a feeling that question was going to come up, I will tell you. Well North Carolina did something. It was very strong. And they're paying a big price. And there's a lot of problems. And I heard — one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, leave it the way it is, right now. "There have been not — very few problems. Leave it the way it is. North Carolina, what they're going through with all the business that's leaving and all of the strife — and that's on both sides. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. "People go — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they're taking. So I would say that's probably the best way…" Matt Lauer: "So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and wanted to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?" Trump: "That is correct. ...There's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is … first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is." Trump essentially made an economic argument, that North Carolina was hurting financially from its bathroom bill and it should have left the Charlotte issue alone. His comments spurred outraged criticism from social conservatives and reluctant praise from his usual foes like columnist David Brooks and Vox. But they weren’t his final words on the topic. Later on Fox News’ Hannity Trump gave a different and rather vague answer on Fox News that night. On Sean Hannity’s show, Trump said he believes that bathroom access should be a matter of local control. Hannity: "I wanted to give you a chance to explain your position on that as it relates to transgenders picking which bathroom they want to go to. I can't even believe I'm asking the question, but I'm asking." Trump: "Well, it is a small number, but we have to take care of everybody, frankly. And North Carolina, which is a great place — which I won, by the way — I love North Carolina — and they have a law and it's a law that, you know, unfortunately, is causing them some problems. And I fully understand that they want to go through, but they are losing business and they are having a lot of people come out against. "With me, I look at it differently. A community, whether it's North Carolina or local communities, really — they should be involved. We have so many big issues to be thinking about, Sean. We have ISIS to worry about. We have bringing trade back. We have rebuilding our military. "But I think this. I think that local communities and states should make the decision, and I feel very strongly about that. The federal government should not be involved." Hannity: "In other words, let the states decide, let local community decides, kind of like your position on education, give it back to the states." Trump: "Yes, let them decide. Absolutely." Here, Trump says the federal government shouldn’t be involved in bathroom policies as it has bigger fish to fry. Instead, he said, it’s up to "local communities and states." In the case of North Carolina, the local community of Charlotte enacted a policy, and state lawmakers blocked it from taking effect and prevented other communities from doing the same. So Trump essentially avoided answering the question at the heart of the controversy: whether bathroom policy should be decided by the local community of Charlotte or the state. A few days later on Fox News Sunday Trump advisor Paul Manafort reiterated the billionaire’s local control stance on Fox News a few days later, but he argued that it wasn’t a new position from what Trump said on Today. Host Chris Wallace challenged Manafort’s denial of a reversal. Wallace: "Wait. Wait. Wait. But 12 hours before or eight hours before, he said leave it the way it is and that there doesn't need to be any change. It's a problem in search of a solution. Manafort: "Which it is." Wallace: "Let me rephrase, it's a solution in search of a problem, that there's not really a problem there." Manafort: "What he said, he was asked a question of his personal opinion in the afternoon and then he was asked, ‘How do you handle the issue?’ And he answered that in the evening." Wallace: "His personal opinion stands?" Manafort: "What stands is what he said when he was asked the specific question of what should happen to this issue and he said it's a state's rights issue, it should be handled by the states." Our ruling A Cruz ad said Trump thinks "a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom." There's a grain of truth in this claim, but the overall message is highly distorted to scare voters. Trump did say he'd be fine with letting Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender women, use the bathroom of her choice in Trump Tower rather than the bathroom that corresponds to the sex on Jenner's birth certificate. But Trump did not say he supports a man "pretending to be a woman" using a woman's restroom. Trump talked about how bathroom laws that allow people to use the bathroom of their choice are not a problem and bemoaned the business backlash that hit North Carolina with a state law that said people have to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender at birth. The state would have been better off leaving it alone, he argued, but as president he would not want the federal government to be involved. Doing nothing about a local government's decision is not an endorsement. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False. Editor’s note, April 27, 2016: After we published this item, we heard from readers and others who said our description of a transgender woman made it sound as if there is no public debate over transgender issues or how gender is defined. We did not mean to suggest that, and we have edited our report to more fully reflect that ongoing debate. Our rating still stands, however, because the ad distorts Trump’s views on access to public bathrooms. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b5dec59-b7ec-4ec6-a34d-87428af82a41	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-04-25T17:38:29	2016-04-22	['None']

pomt-10169	"The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/27/john-mccain/yes-south-koreans-taller/	The first presidential debate focused on the economy and foreign affairs, and Barack Obama and John McCain discussed a broad range of topics that included the economic bailout, the Iraq war and . . . whether South Koreans are taller than North Koreans. McCain called North Korea the "most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag." (That statement occurs about 1:00 into the accompanying video.) We've examined a lot of unlikely facts in this campaign, including the cooking of squirrels and the regulation of ham and cheese sandwiches , but this was a new one to us. So we did some checking and found that McCain is right. South Koreans are, indeed, taller than North Koreans. In his study Height and weight differences between North and South Korea, Daniel Schwekendiek, an economist from the University of Tuebingen in Germany, compared 2002 data that showed preschool children in North Korea were up to 5 inches shorter and up to 14 pounds lighter than children who were brought up in South Korea. A 2006 study of 1,075 North Korean defectors aged 20 to 39 put the difference for adults at 4 inches for men and 2.5 inches for women. A 2004 study said the difference was 2.3 inches for young men and 1.6 inches for young women. The studies blame malnutrition in North Korea for the height difference. So McCain is on solid ground with his claim. The studies vary, but his 3-inch claim is a reasonable approximation of the various studies and his underlying point is correct. We find his claim to the True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-27T00:00:00	2008-09-26	['South_Korea', 'North_Korea']
pomt-02102	Under David Dewhurst’s leadership, the Texas "Senate passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants."	false	/texas/statements/2014/may/15/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-misinterprets-texas-senate-votes-measu/	Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has presided over Texas Senate approval of numerous changes in law including, his Republican challenger says, proposals benefiting illegal immigrants. State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who faces Dewhurst in a primary runoff for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination, said in a TV ad posted online April 28, 2014, that under Dewhurst’s leadership, the "Senate passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants." A follow-up ad, posted online May 13, 2014, is more dramatic, saying Dewhurst "gave illegal immigrants free Obama-style health care." This claim by Patrick, who has hammered his intent to secure the Texas-Mexico border, misreads Senate actions. Let's plow the parts--on tuition, then health care--back to back. An ‘expansion of in-state tuition … to illegal immigrants’ Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post in 2003. That was two years after lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to make it possible for undocumented residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Patrick, in a backup document for his tuition claim, said he was referring to a 2005 Senate-approved measure; his campaign manager, Logan Spence, sent us emails pointing out news stories and a University of Texas at Austin web page stating the proposal "expanded" the benefits of the 2001 law permitting undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition. Best we could tell, though, Senate Bill 1528, which was signed into law by Perry in 2005, simply preserved the 2001 law while otherwise making it possible for all students to qualify for in-state tuition even if their parents have moved out of state. Wondering if we missed something, we turned to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the University of Texas. Dominic Chavez, a board staff spokesman, responded by emailing us a May 31, 2005, staff analysis of the final version of the 2005 proposal. The analysis states that international students (doubling as legal U.S. nonresidents) who had previously been accustomed to paying in-state tuition would be required to pay nonresident rates, at least temporarily, narrowing access for those students, Chavez told us. Those changes were then projected to save the state more than $2.8 million a year. More broadly, according to the analysis, the proposal defined terms such as tuition, mandatory fees and residency toward ensuring consistency in what institutions charged students. Finally, the analysis said, the measure would allow citizens and legal permanent residents to establish residency in the state on the same basis afforded students coming to Texas universities from abroad. This was described as simplifying the "residency determination of students whose parents have recently moved out of state, while the student stayed behind and completed secondary education. At present, a student who has never lived anywhere but Texas becomes a nonresident if his or her parent moves out of state prior to the student’s enrollment in a public institution of higher education," the analysis said. Chavez, asked if the proposal expanded benefits for illegal immigrants, said that possibility wasn’t explored as lawmakers finished drafting the law. He said the agency has no data to gauge if the law delivered new benefits to undocumented students. Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma responded to our inquiry by pointing out an October 2013 "overview" document of the 2005 law issued by the coordinating board stating the law focused on tuition for U.S. citizens. The 2013 summary said: "Prior to these amendments, many U.S. citizens were inadvertently prevented from attaining Texas residency status because of unanticipated circumstances. For example, students born and raised in Texas but whose parents moved out of state before they had enrolled in college were previously classified as nonresidents unless they had enrolled in college prior to their parents’ departure. Additionally," the agency wrote, "students raised by grandparents or other family members who had never gone to court to acquire legal custody were considered residents of the state in which their parents lived. Current statutes allow students in both of these cases, and other similar circumstances, to qualify for Texas resident status." The UT-Austin web page cited by Patrick as supporting his declaration about the 2005 law is vague, first describing the effect of the 2001 law enabling undocumented students to attain in-state tuition and then turning to the 2005 changes: "In 2005, the Texas Legislature approved Senate Bill 1528, which expanded the benefits of House Bill 1403," the 2001 measure, the web page says. But UT's page doesn’t say how the changes widened benefits of the 2001 law. And when we followed up with UT, admissions official Deana Williams said by phone that any interpretation of the law as expanding any tuition benefit for undocumented residents would be incorrect. She said the legislation simply made it so any student--a U.S. citizen, legal resident or unauthorized resident--could pay in-state tuition even if their parents moved out of state. An ‘expansion of… free health care to illegal immigrants’ Patrick tied his claim that Dewhurst presided over Senate approval of an expansion of free health care to illegal immigrants to the Senate’s 2003 voice-vote passage of Senate Bill 309, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as "providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status." The proposal said a city, county or public hospital "may use money from local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services." At an April 2003 committee hearing on the proposal, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general, John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. By email, spokesman Lance Lunsford of the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law "affirmatively provides for such eligibility." Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. "It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable," Stafford said.. In 2003, SB 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code "affirmatively establishes" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that "basically" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said the Dewhurst-led Senate "passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants." Block that kick. First of all, lawmakers signed off on in-state tuition for undocumented students in 2001--before Dewhurst became lieutenant governor--while the 2005 legislation cited by Patrick largely left the 2001 law intact while focusing on all students getting in-state tuition even if parents move out of state. The proposal regarding free health care for illegal immigrants didn’t launch a program for immigrants, which is what Patrick’s statement seems to suggest. Rather, local governing bodies were permitted to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action projected to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. The Senate proposal also envisioned patients sharing costs. We rate this two-pronged claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-10747	"She hasn't run a corner store. She hasn't run a state. She hasn't run a city. She has never run anything."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/02/mitt-romney/ignores-her-work-in-law-firm-white-house/	A new TV ad by Mitt Romney recites a common Republican criticism of Sen. Hillary Clinton. She "hasn't run a corner store. She hasn't run a state. She hasn't run a city. She has never run anything." Other candidates have used similar lines about the Democratic front-runner. Let's take them one at a time. Romney is correct that Clinton hasn't run a state (as he has) or run a city (as Giuliani has). (Our in-depth look at the candidates' experience can be found in our story here.) He says she hasn't run a corner store. We've found nothing on her resume to indicate she managed a retail establishment on a street corner, but he's probably speaking metaphorically that she lacks management experience in the private sector. Yet she was a law partner in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where she served some of the firm's biggest clients and was described as a "rainmaker" who found new clients. Then Romney adds: "She hasn't run anything." What about those eight years as first lady? You might disagree on whether her husband should have entrusted her with reforming health care, or whether a nonelected official with a vague job description should have had a personal staff of 20, plus all that access to White House staff. But she did. Therefore, you must count those years in the White House, said Stanley Renshon, a political science professor at the City University of New York. "As first lady, she did have executive experience," Renshon said. "She had responsibility, she did make decisions. She was a very powerful person behind the scenes. She has executive experience." To support its claim, the Romney campaign quoted U.S. World & News Report publisher Mort Zuckerman, who said Clinton didn't have "that much executive experience." That's a far cry from Romney's blanket statement. Clinton's resume is fair game for criticism, but given her work as a law partner and her managerial role as first lady, we find Romney is way off with his claim that she "hasn't run anything." We find the claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01063	"We’ve doubled the production of clean energy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/obama-claims-us-has-doubled-production-clean-energ/	America’s recovery from the Great Recession is slow but steady, President Barack Obama said in a recent speech, and the country is headed in the right direction, thanks in part to his energy initiatives. He told students at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., on Jan. 9, 2015, the United States is now the world’s No. 1 producer in oil and gas -- a statement we’ve researched in the past and rated True -- and touted a move to more renewable resources. "We’ve doubled the production of clean energy," Obama told the crowd. There was no time frame given or any indication of what he considered clean energy, but PolitiFact wondered whether that was true. And if it was, could he take credit for it? Generating interest The White House specified Obama was referring to solar, wind and geothermal (harnessing power from heat generated under the Earth’s crust), but omitted any specific time frame. We can go ahead and assume they mean since the beginning of Obama’s first term, but the definition of renewables needs some explaining. The U.S. Energy Information Administration considers renewable energy as coming from any source that is "naturally replenishing but flow-limited," meaning there are limits on how much energy can be derived from the source at once. This also includes biomass fuels, like burning wood and solid waste, and hydroelectric power. States often don’t classify hydroelectric as renewable for several reasons, including substantial infrastructure requirements and the disruption of water ecosystems. Many states also don’t count hydroelectric in order to pressure utilities to increase renewable energy resources beyond existing hydroelectric facilities. It’s important to note that promoting renewable energy was a major focus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress in February 2009 to help spur the economy in the wake of the recession. Obama signed the bill, which contained some $90 billion for energy-related investment, reimbursements for installations, a reauthorized loan guarantee program and tax credits. One of the goals was to double renewable energy generation by 2012. Since the administration mentioned those three energy sources as their definition of "clean energy," they are the ones we asked the Energy Information Administration about. Spokesperson John Cogan provided this information for the existing net summer capacity of energy production types in megawatts: Year Wind Solar, Thermal and Photovoltaic Geothermal Total 2007 16,515 502 2,214 19,231 2008 24,651 536 2,229 27,416 2009 34,296 619 2,382 37,297 2010 39,135 866 2,405 42,406 2011 45,676 1,524 2,409 49,609 2012 59,075 3,170 2,592 65,377 Now, don’t go thinking we’re all suddenly living emission-free and the specter of global warming due to greenhouse gases is a thing of the past. The country still uses fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas for most of its electricity needs, about 68 percent as of June 2014 (the EIA says wind, solar and geothermal generated less than 5 percent in that time frame, up from about 1.5 percent in 2008). Still, that’s a marked decrease in fossil fuel use, which was around 85 percent in 2008. Also, we can’t completely ignore hydroelectric and biomass sources. Those sources are considered renewable even if they weren’t named by the White House, but their use has not doubled since 2008. Both have remained basically flat in that time period. So can Obama take credit for this spike in renewable energy resource use? Joseph Aldy, former special assistant to the president for energy and environment in 2009-10 and currently an assistant public policy professor at Harvard, says yes, arguing the combination of tax credits, grants and guaranteed loans for renewable energy projects helped boost providers through tight credit and labor markets. Current production far exceeds Energy Information Administration projections from 2009, he told PolitiFact. Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the pro-renewables Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said some expansion would have happened anyway, since costs have gone down, particularly for wind and solar. But not only did the Recovery Act spur growth for renewable energy, the residual effects have continued. The 2013 National Renewable Energy Laboratory report bears out these growth trends, which have been fueled by federal incentives, she said. Our ruling Obama said, "we’ve doubled the production of clean energy." The White House said he was referring to wind, solar and geothermal, which are three types of renewable resources promoted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Energy Information Administration confirmed that capacity had basically doubled between 2009 and 2012, accomplishing Obama’s goals. Renewable resource advocates also agreed that the Recovery Act contributed to that growth. Obama didn’t mention, however, that so-called "clean energy" still accounts for a sliver of U.S. energy production, which overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels. Nor does it include other kinds of renewable energy, such as biomass and hydroelectric, which have remained relatively flat. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04847	Georgia spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other state in the South.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/13/ron-stephens/tourism-advertising-not-georgias-mind-lawmaker-say/	Metro Atlanta cities may do little to ensure government dollars to promote tourism are doing their job, but that doesn’t mean that the state should rein in spending, an elected official said recently. Georgia isn’t spending enough money in the first place, said state Rep. Ron Stephens, chairman of the House Economic Development and Tourism Committee. "We spend less dollars advertising than any other state in the South," Stephens said in an Aug. 6 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about oversight of city tourism funds. That’s exactly the kind of thing we’d expect the head of the tourism committee to say. But is it true? We asked the Savannah Republican for more information. We feel obliged to note that Georgia and its cities have a checkered history in tourism marketing. State taxpayers will be paying $1.2 million annually for the next few decades on former Gov. Sonny Perdue’s "Go Fish" tourism program. Perdue's vision for the plan was to make Georgia "a fisherman's paradise" by developing the economy, attracting high-dollar fishing tournaments, improving access to state lakes and increasing angling participation. Critics argue it was a pork project for Perdue’s hometown, Bonaire, which is near the Go Fish Education Center. And there’s Brand Atlanta, a shuttered effort to market Georgia’s capital city. It raised some $8 million between 2005 and 2006 from corporations and government, including $1 million from the convention and visitors bureau. The campaign featured a widely panned theme song. But the budget went bust during the Great Recession, its staff was laid off in 2008 and Brand Atlanta is no more. State tourism funds shrank as the economy stumbled, and Stephens thinks it’s a shame. "If we advertise the jewels we have, then more people will come here and we’ll get that money back," Stephens said. Stephens said his statement about low spending referred to the amount of money state governments spend to promote tourism, as well as the number of dollars spent per capita. It excludes spending by the city of Atlanta and other localities. Stephens referred us to data collected by the Georgia Department of Economic Development. A department spokeswoman sent us state-by-state figures compiled by the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group that researches and promotes travel to and within the country. Policymakers, other trade organizations and media use USTA’s numbers widely. We were unable to find another organization that collects similar data. We started our analysis by separating out USTA data for Southern states. This is more difficult than you might think. Government agencies disagree on what counts as the South. Born and bred Southerners do, too. Even some newcomers get the vapors when Yankees lump South Florida in with the rest of us. What’s worse, the official U.S. census definition includes Oklahoma. Really? We thought. Do they even sell sweet tea there? We struck a Great Compromise and focused on the 11 states that formally seceded from the Union during the Civil War, plus Kentucky. (What would the South be without Kentucky or its bourbon?) Then we crunched the numbers for fiscal year 2011-2012. Georgia was second only to Kentucky in the lowest amount spent on tourism. Our fiscal year 2011-2012 provisional budget stood at $2,551,516, according to USTA data. Kentucky’s was $1,888,300. The Peach State fared worse in other measures of state tourism spending. The population and budgets of Southern states vary widely, so we considered two additional pieces of data that take these differences into account: The amount of state tourism funding allocated per capita, which Stephens also said was the lowest in the South; and tourism allocations as a portion of a state’s budget. Georgia ranked last on a per capita basis at $0.26 per person. Arkansas placed first at $3.05 per person. Georgia also ranked last on tourism advertising as a portion of the state budget. During fiscal year 2012, Georgia set aside 0.014 percent of its general fund budget toward tourism advertising. Kentucky was the second-lowest on our list. Once again, Arkansas placed first. Our ruling: Stephens said that Georgia’s state government spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other in the South. He was right in the metrics that matter most: per capita spending, and spending as a percentage of state budget. In dollars, Stephens was close. Only Kentucky spends less. Stephens earns a True.

pomt-10580	Hillary Clinton agrees with John McCain "by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/01/barack-obama/clinton-voted-for-mccain-supported-iran-resolution/	Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner after winning Florida's primary. In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things. Among Obama's points: "It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who ... agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran." On the issue of Iran, Obama is referring to a vote in September 2007 on a measure known as the Kyl-Lieberman Amendment, which declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization. Clinton voted in favor of the amendment, which McCain co-sponsored. Obama advisers argued at the time that the Kyl-Lieberman amendment could be used to justify a military attack on Iran. We previously fact-checked the advisers' claim that Kyl-Lieberman was a "blank check" for the use of force in Iran. We found that expert opinions were split. Some said the legislation gave no new authority for the use of force in Iran. But others said the Bush administration would point to the legislation as a justification if it wanted to invade Iran, even if the legislation did not specifically condone it. Describing the amendment as "giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt" is similar to that argument. There are a few other problems with Obama's statement that are worth mentioning. Though McCain co-sponsored the legislation, he missed the vote itself — as did Obama, who was campaigning. Obama said he would have voted against the amendment if he had been present. So though Clinton may have "agreed" with McCain on the issue, they did not technically vote the same way on it. To say that voting for Kyl-Lieberman is "giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran" remains a contentious issue. But Obama's main point is that Clinton and McCain were on the same side, and that is correct. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-06684	"Congressman Bill Young voted to cut taxes for millionaires and end your Medicare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/sep/07/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-rep-cw-bill-young-voted-cut-taxes-mi/	National Democrats took their message to Florida gas pumps in August, in stark red and black. "Congressman Bill Young voted to CUT TAXES FOR MILLIONAIRES & END YOUR MEDICARE." More than four months since House Republicans endorsed Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan's short-lived budget plan, Democrats want to keep its memory fresh. "Millionaires Over Medicare," funded by the official campaign arm of House Democrats, targets Republicans who voted for Ryan's budget resolution with canvassing, phone banks and the gas station ads. In Florida, that includes Young, who after four decades in the House ranks as the state's senior member of Congress. His 10th Congressional District sits entirely inside Pinellas, a county where nearly a third of the population is over 60. "I have made it a top priority of mine," his website says, "to protect key programs like Social Security and Medicare so that our nation’s seniors can maintain a quality of life during their golden years." Just what did Young vote for? And did it cut taxes for millionaires and "end your Medicare"? The House budget resolution The gas station ad focuses on a single April 15, 2011, budget resolution vote, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Budget resolutions, as PolitiFact has reported in the past, don't have the force of law. They let the majority party make an annual political statement, creating nonbinding targets for tax and spending legislation. So, for example, we called out Republicans in 2008 for attacking Barack Obama's record on taxes based on his budget resolution votes. (See "The budget resolution isn't that clear," "Obama voted for budget resolution, not taxes," and "94? Not even close.") The 70-page budget resolution would have been nonbinding even if it had passed both houses of Congress. But the Ryan plan didn't even get that far, dying in the Democrat-controlled Senate. In the House, Republicans, including Young, endorsed the plan 235-4, while all 189 voting Democrats rejected it. In May, five Republican senators joined Democrats to scuttle it in the Senate, with a vote to consider the resolution failing 40-57. There weren't any Democrats among the yeas. The resolution itself makes for fairly dry reading, with pages of numerical "recommended levels and amounts" for not only fiscal year 2012, but also years 2013-21. Two other documents seek to put it in English: "The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise," from the Ryan-led House Committee on the Budget, and a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Ryan plan. What do they have to say about taxes and Medicare? 'Cut taxes for millionaires' Ryan's plan would keep Bush tax cuts otherwise slated to expire in 2012, reduce the number of tax brackets, and cut the top individual rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, according to the Path to Prosperity. But Ryan told an economics think tank shortly before the House vote, "we're not talking about cutting taxes." How's that possible? Well, the reasoning assumes a couple of things. One, that since the Bush tax cuts are in place now, keeping them wouldn't constitute new cuts. Two, that any reduction in tax rates would be offset by "getting rid of loopholes and deductions." The problem is, neither the Path to Prosperity nor the CBO analysis specify where those "loophole" savings might come from. Still, the idea is that lower tax rates wouldn't be paid for by cutting Medicare, but by other changes to tax law. The country would pull in the same amount of revenue, just a different way. Ryan called claims that his plan proposes a tradeoff between Medicare and tax cuts "scare tactics," according to the Weekly Standard: "We're talking about keeping taxes where they are and cleaning up the tax code: getting rid of loopholes and deductions, which by the way are enjoyed by the top (tax) rate filers, the people in the top two brackets, and lowering tax rates. A flatter system, a fairer system, a simpler system, one that is more internationally competitive," he said. In the absence of details in the Ryan plan, commentators on both sides waged a war of words in April over the plan's tax implications for the rich. The Democrats pointed to a New York Times editorial, a column in the Wall Street Journal, a piece by a New Republic editor and an article by liberal think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities to support their claim Ryan's plan would "cut taxes for millionaires." Meanwhile, the New Republic piece cites conservative defense of Ryan's tax changes as self-funding — once you assume the Bush tax cut extensions aren't a cut — in the Weekly Standard (twice), National Review and Washington Post. The think tank argues that "for the wealthy, Ryan’s proposals are pure gold": • A typical hedge fund manager would benefit from Ryan’s extension of the Bush tax cuts for high-income people; the average person making at least $1 million a year would get $125,000 a year in tax breaks. • Heirs to multi-million-dollar estates would benefit from Ryan’s estate tax proposal, which would let them inherit the first $10 million in estate value entirely tax-free. • High-income investors would benefit from Ryan’s elimination of Medicare taxes on their investment income. • And large numbers of high earners would benefit from Ryan’s call to cut the top rate to 25 percent, the lowest in 80 years. Of course, who knows how those rich folks would be hit by the loss of Ryan's unnamed "loopholes and deductions"? We're left with Ryan's word that Congress would agree to pay for lowered tax rates by raising the tax burden in other ways. But without knowing what those ways would be — what if they included, for example, the Earned Income Tax Credit that benefits low-income taxpayers? — we have to give Democrats credit for what we do know. And that's that Ryan's plan would provide at least some tax benefit to millionaires, even in the Ryan-friendly world where permanently extending the Bush tax cuts doesn't get credit as a cut (and there's a pretty good argument it should). 'End your Medicare' Now on to the part of the gas station ad that claims that Ryan's plan would "end your Medicare." We'll be more concise here — since April, we've examined at least a half-dozen versions of this claim, all of them False or Pants on Fire. April 11: House Republican budget abolishes Medicare in 10 years (False) April 20: Republicans voted to end Medicare and charge seniors $12,000 (Pants on Fire) May 25: Ad asks what the U.S. would be 'without Medicare' (False) June 9: Rep. Robert Hurt voted to end Medicare (False) June 10: U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan would end heath care for seniors (Pants on Fire) June 27: There is a Republican plan to end Medicare (False) The bottom line is, Ryan proposed to dramatically remake Medicare from a program that directly pays health care bills for the elderly to one that provides a fixed amount of support for premiums for private health insurance. Those premium support payments would increase only at the rate of inflation — not at the pace of health care costs — meaning that every year seniors could be on the hook for greater and greater percentages of their premiums. CBO wasn't sure such a plan would be sustainable in the long-term. But Medicare wouldn't end. Seniors would still get substantial government support for their health care. Still, their costs would rise, while government costs would stay in check. Meanwhile, there's a reason this claim — that the Ryan plan would "end your Medicare" — is particularly misleading. The Ryan plan wouldn't alter Medicare for anyone on it now, and in fact not for anyone age 55 or older. So taxpayers at the gas pump interpreting the ad as affecting "their Medicare" — benefits they receive now — are precisely the ones who wouldn't be affected. And that does look like a scare tactic, especially in a county where a third of residents are eligible for Medicare or within spitting distance. Our ruling The Democrats spread the message that "Congressman Bill Young voted to cut taxes for millionaires and end your Medicare." His vote for a House budget resolution did no such thing: Even if it had passed the Senate, it was a nonbinding blueprint, not a change in tax code or Medicare law. Still, we're willing to accept his vote as advocacy of the plan's main ideas. So did the Ryan plan propose to cut taxes for millionaires and end Medicare? We chatted with Young's spokesman, Harry Glenn, who said Young had this to say about the Democrats' claim: "In the vernacular of (PolitiFact editor) Bill Adair and PolitiFact, saying that that was a vote to end Medicare is a flat out Pants on Fire lie." It's certainly misleading, but given the Ryan plan's significant reinvention of the program, we wouldn't call it ridiculously false. On top of that, the Democrats do have a point that the Ryan plan proposed tax cuts for millionaires — even if those cuts wouldn't be at the direct expense of Medicare and even if those cuts would be offset by closing tax loopholes. Balancing the two parts to this claim, we rate the ad Mostly False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2011-09-07T13:50:29	2011-08-20	['None']
pomt-04857	"I have voted every year in Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/tommy-thompson/gop-wisconsin-senate-primary-tommy-thompson-chasti/	When the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel disclosed that political newcomer Eric Hovde had voted in only two of 11 elections between 2004 and 2011, his opponents in the Aug. 14, 2012 Republican primary for U.S. Senate pounced. "The first time he's going to vote for the U.S. Senate is for himself in Wisconsin," Tommy Thompson said of Hovde, a Wisconsin native who lived in Washington, D.C. for 24 years before returning to the state in late 2011. Thompson declared in the July 22, 2012 article: "I have voted every year in Wisconsin." Since Thompson has spent quite a bit of time in Washington himself over the past decade, including as former secretary of Health and Human Services, we wondered about his voting record. On the campaign trail, the former governor has repeatedly said he has maintained his residence in Madison since joining President George W. Bush's Cabinet in 2001 and later going to work for a Washington legal and lobbying firm. The Madison city clerk was not able to provide us a list of all elections that Thompson could have voted in. The office instead referred us to a list of elections kept by the Dane County clerk. Thompson’s voting The Madison clerk did provide us with Thompson's voting record; we also checked it against the Wisconsin Government Accountabilty Board’s searchable database. Both sets of records date back to the fall 2002 primary elections and they are identical, in terms of which elections Thompson voted in. Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out to us that the state board says its database for records from 2005 and earlier may not be complete. But board spokesman Reid Magney told us that doesn’t relate to whether a person voted at all. Rather, some earlier records simply don’t indicate whether a person who voted did so at the polls or by absentee ballot. Here are the elections Thompson did not vote in, along with some of the contested races that were on each ballot: 2003: February primary and April general -- state Supreme Court, Dane County circuit judge, Madison mayor. The April ballot also included statewide referendum on the right to hunt and fish. 2005: February primary -- state schools superintendent; April general -- schools superintendent and Dane County circuit judge. Also on the April ballot was a statewide referendum on four-year terms for certain county offices. 2006: February spring primary -- Madison Metropolitan School Board, Dane County Board of Supervisors; April spring general -- school board, Dane County circuit judge; November fall general -- governor (Democrat incumbent Jim Doyle defeated Republican Mark Green), U.S. senator (Democrat incumbent Herb Kohl defeating Republican Robert Lorge), state attorney general and others. 2010: February spring primary -- state court of appeals judge; April general -- appeals judge, county supervisor. 2012: May recall primary -- Gov. Scott Walker was opposed by protest candidate Arthur Kohl-Riggs. So, the records show that, since fall 2002, Thompson did not vote in 10 elections -- five primaries and five general elections in five different years. Asked to respond, Nemoir said in an email that Thompson "makes all efforts to vote and the results provided by the (city) clerk do not take into consideration what was actually on the ballot in terms of contested elections and seemingly fail to represent his participation in the electoral process." But he offered no evidence of any inaccuracies in Thompson’s voting record. And even if there is an error in the record -- say, for the 2006 general election for governor -- it’s clear that Thompson skipped a number of elections over a number of years. Our rating Thompson said: "I have voted every year in Wisconsin." Records show that since fall 2002, he missed voting in elections in five different years. We rate his statement False. Aug. 13, 2012 -- a footnote: Folks who heard Thompson's claim might have thought he meant he had voted in every election. The record shows he did not vote in every election. And to be clear, he missed voting entirely in 2003 and 2005 (there were two statewide elections both years).	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-08-10T15:27:25	2012-07-22	['Wisconsin']
pomt-11467	"When @ScottWalker told firefighters we didn’t need to worry about Act 10, we said hell no, we stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/07/mahlon-mitchell/first-response-was-applaud-walker-recognizing-fire/	A Madison firefighter touted his anti-Act 10 credentials on Twitter while seeking to distinguish himself among the 16 Democrats looking to take on Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election. Mahlon Mitchell, who is also president of the state firefighters union, boasted of his group’s response to Walker’s signature legislation in a Jan. 17, 2018 tweet: "When @ScottWalker told firefighters we didn’t need to worry about Act 10, we said hell no, we stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere," Mitchell wrote. "I’m not just against Act 10: I’m pro-worker. I believe that together we can rise as Wisconsin when we stand up for our working families." Act 10 limited collective bargaining for public employee unions across the state, but exempted police and firefighters unions from the changes. So, did Mitchell and the union he leads give Walker the equivalent of a "hell no," or is this revisionist history? Mitchell opposed Act 10… eventually Mitchell is part of a historically crowded Democratic field vying for a spot on the November general election ballot. It’s the second time he has pursued a statewide office, having lost the 2012 recall race against Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. This time around, he joins a group that includes -- among others -- state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire; state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout of Alma; former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew Flynn; Madison Mayor Paul Soglin; former state Rep. Kelda Roys; and political activist Mike McCabe. Mitchell — who took over as head of the state firefighters union in early 2011 — was a prominent figure in the Madison protests that accompanied the legislation, leading firefighters in and around the Capitol. When asked for backup for the claim, a Mitchell spokeswoman highlighted various YouTube videos that showed Mitchell at the protests. But that wasn’t Mitchell’s first reaction to Walker’s proposal. Mitchell was effusive in his praise of Walker in a statement he issued on Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin letterhead on Feb. 11, 2011, a week before he protested Act 10 in Madison: We are pleased that Gov. Walker recognizes the critical work that we do protecting the residents of our communities. We are there 24 hours every day, 7 days every week. We do our jobs regardless of conditions that we face. We also know that all public employees across this great state are hardworking, dedicated individuals. We all make sacrifices every day but the Governor recognizes that what we do is unique and we applaud him for recognizing that. Governor Walker from the time he was a State Representative has demonstrated that he understands what we do and why we do it and why it is so important to our communities. We know that state and local governments are facing tough economic times. We look forward to working with Gov. Walker, state legislators of both political parties, local officials, and other public sector unions in an effort to help solve the severe economic problems that our state is facing. Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Mitchell’s campaign, said in an email that the statement came before union officials "understood the full consequences of the legislation and the devastating effect that it would have on Wisconsin's workers." "As soon as the bill came out and they saw really what the effects would be, they came out against it," Smith said. "You can’t say he wasn’t one of the leaders against Act 10 when he was out there day after day after day fighting it." Eleven days after the statement, Mitchell said at a Capitol news conference that firefighters would be willing to take the same pension and health care changes as other unions if the governor would drop his push to limit collective bargaining rights. Our rating In a tweet, Mitchell said the first response of him and his union to the Walker proposals that became Act 10 was to reject them and "stand with working Wisconsinites everywhere." Mitchell did ultimately join the other union leaders in opposing the measure, leading marches and even bunking in the Capitol to protest the legislation. But his first response was to "applaud" Walker for recognizing that firefighters were "unique" among public employees. That’s a lot closer to "yes, please" than "hell no."

pomt-06135	Says Newt Gingrich aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming.	true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/23/make-us-great-again/pro-perry-super-pac-says-gingrich-teamed-pelosi-gl/	In a video ad, a super PAC promoting Gov. Rick Perry's presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives. In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor. Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., "in support of global warming." We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately. A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, Restore Our Future, which is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney. The ad attacks Gingrich over "a ton of baggage" and includes the statement that Gingrich "teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming." PolitiFact National looked into that claim for a Dec. 21, 2011, fact-check. The Restore Our Future ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of — you guessed it — more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: "Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming." It is followed by a link to the Pelosi-Gingrich spot, in which Gingrich sits on a couch next to Pelosi, who at that time was the House speaker but now is the minority leader. "We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?" Pelosi says. "No," Gingrich answers, "but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change." Pelosi: "We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast." Gingrich: "If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need." The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, "Together, we can do this." The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization that works to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. Formerly the Alliance for Climate Protection, it’s now known as the Climate Reality Project. WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org. In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore said that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi. It was part of a larger campaign featuring " 'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change," according to a 2008 news story in the San Francisco Chronicle. During the current campaign season, Gingrich has expressed regret about making that ad. In a section of his campaign website devoted to "answering the attacks," Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier in November that making the ad with Pelosi was "probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done." It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past) and that he favors increased domestic oil drilling. Our sense is the super PAC's video accurately touches on Gingrich teaming with Pelosi against global warming. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07133	Says George LeMieux "falsely attacked Marco Rubio."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/16/adam-hasner/hasner-says-lemieux-falsely-attacked-marco-rubio/	In Republican circles in Florida it's hail to Marco Rubio -- the former state legislator from Miami-Dade County who beat Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek and Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2010. In 2012, Republican candidates will likely be clamoring to share the stage with the young, charismatic Rubio -- including Adam Hasner, who is running in a Republican primary for the other U.S. Senate seat now held by Bill Nelson. Hasner will face George LeMieux, among others, in the GOP primary. LeMieux was once Crist's "maestro" -- serving as Crist's campaign manager and then his chief of staff when Crist was governor. Crist returned the favor and appointed LeMieux to serve out a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009. Hasner portrays LeMieux as the foe of Rubio in an Internet ad he released June 10, 2011. Set against a backdrop of a photo of Crist, here is the text of the ad: Defended President Obama's Stimulus As "Helpful To Florida" Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar Architect of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama Charlie Crist -- Right? Wrong. As the word "wrong" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- "Get to know the Real George LeMieux." We're checking Hasner's claim that LeMieux compared Rubio to Obama in a separate item. In this case, we will examine whether LeMieux "falsely attacked Marco Rubio." The ad doesn't state the subject of the attack but attributes it to a May 9, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article. Hasner spokesman Rick Wilson sent us the article in an e-mail, and said that the false attack was that LeMieux labeled Rubio a tax raiser. From the article: '"Marco Rubio supported the largest tax increase in Florida history when he wanted to raise the sales tax by 2 or 3 pennies," LeMieux said of Rubio's 2007 tax swap plan (the Democratic Party already is using that as an anti-Rubio talking point). We've written about Rubio's tax swap plan before. The idea surfaced during Rubio's first months as speaker in early 2007, as the Legislature and Crist were looking for ways to cut property taxes for Floridians. Rubio's proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval. A state House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year. But whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the Times ran calculations under Rubio's proposal for both homeowners and renters. The homeowners A family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100 CURRENT Property tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06 Sales taxes paid: $951 PROPOSED Property tax bill in Tampa: $0 Sales taxes paid: $1,290 Under Rubio's plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the Times found. Contrast that with renters: The renters A family of two with an annual income of $46,914 CURRENT Rent: $851 Sales taxes paid: $691 PROPOSED Rent: $851 Sales taxes paid: $937 Under Rubio's plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn't be affected. Overall, on the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less in taxes -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. As such we rated a claim by Crist that the plan was a "massive increase" in taxes False. In his web ad, Hasner said LeMieux "falsely attacked Marco Rubio." The ad cites a newspaper article in which LeMieux said Rubio's tax swap proposal was the "largest tax increase in Florida history." PolitiFact Florida previously ruled that Rubio's plan was a tax decrease so there's no doubt it is a false attack. Our only quibble is that the ad failed to explain what Hasner was talking about -- so viewers are left guessing. Our definition of Mostly True is that "The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information." That's a good fit in this case. We rate Hasner's statement Mostly True.

pomt-11417	Say Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/20/blog-posting/no-evidence-charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-raped-b/	A fake news item claims Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was sexually and physically assaulted by a prison inmate. The article — with the headline "Dylann Roof, killer of 14 Charleston church members raped and beaten by inmate" — quotes the Charleston County sheriff describing the assault in detail. "According to Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, the assault happened shortly before 8 a.m. as Roof was being escorted to the showers in Housing Unit 1B," the article states. But among the many problems with this item: Roof is no longer housed in Charleston. The Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator shows that Roof is imprisoned in a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He was transferred there in April 2017 following his federal death sentence, according to news reports. Other issues abound in this fake item. The fake post purports to link a to a video — but no such video exists on the site. The headline also misstates the number of victims. (Roof killed nine parishioners, not 14.) A similar fake news item was debunked by our friends at Snopes in 2016. Snopes reported that the phony conspiracy theory about Roof being raped in prison originated in July 2015 on the fake news website NYMeta, and has continued in various forms and outlets since then. There are a couple possible reasons why this hoax persists. For starters, the idea of retribution against Roof may appeal to readers’ desire for justice for one of the deadliest hate crimes in U.S. history. The story’s staying power may also have something to do with the fact it shares some similarities to an actual news story, albeit one with important differences. In August 2016, Roof was reportedly beaten while being held at the Charleston County jail. The assault "left Roof with minor bruises," but there is no evidence that the mass shooter was the victim of sexual assault. The fake news item also claims Roof was assaulted while being escorted to the shower unit. However, the assault against him in August 2016 occurred after an unlocked cell door allowed an inmate to approach Roof. Our ruling Bloggers said Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison. There are a number of factual errors with this story. Roof has not been housed in Charleston — where the purported assault happened — since April 2017. The item also misstates the number of parishoners Roof killed. Despite being previously debunked, this hoax continues to persist. We rate this Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-03-20T11:21:05	2018-03-19	['None']

pomt-04289	Says Connie Mack was "the only member of the Florida delegation that voted against a bill to help NASA."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/nov/01/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-voted-against-nasa-bi/	As Florida’s U.S. Senate debate came to a close, sitting Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson glanced at his notes, gestured to his opponent and lobbed a final missile. "We have a great pride in this state in our space program," Nelson began, turning toward Republican Challenger U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. "My opponent is the only member of the Florida delegation that voted against a bill to help NASA." Mack was so busy fending off other Nelson attacks during that Oct. 17 debate, he didn’t respond to the accusation about the NASA bill. That’s why we decided to launch a probe (sorry!) into this claim. Nelson was referring to the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, a sweeping compromise of a bill that authorized a drastic change of direction for the space program. Among other things, the $58 billion law, which Nelson helped pass, directs NASA to contract out low-earth orbit to private vendors so the government can work toward going to Mars and establishing a permanent human presence in space. The law also directs NASA to restart its technology development program and, when possible, work with international partners. A review of the congressional voting records show Mack voted against the bill, and he was the only Florida representative to do so. That part of Nelson’s claim is solid. But Nelson’s statement also implies that a vote against the NASA bill is a vote against the space program. And that’s where we see some nuance. S. 3729 was the subject of fierce arguments about the direction of the space program. And former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, whose husband is an astronaut, was among those who opposed it. Mack has supported several other NASA bills, but opposed this one because of concerns with spending and the direction of the program, Mack consultant Gary Maloney said. "Connie Mack joined Gabrielle Giffords and others in opposing Barack Obama's attempt to restructure NASA, essentially building a $35 billion 'rocket to nowhere,' " said Maloney, referring to the powerful "heavy-lift rocket" that sets the stage for visiting asteroids and Mars. "Bill Nelson supported Obama's plan with no defined mission or destination for NASA going forward." Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Obama put forth the original plan for the direction of NASA, which Congress rejected. But the Senate used that foundation to craft its own plan, which squeezed past both chambers. "Some House members were okay with it, some weren't for a variety of reasons," Pace said. NASA publicly supported the bill. And, after it passed, NASA administrator Charles Bolden showered it with praise in the blog for The Hill, a congressional newspaper. "The plan invests more in NASA, preserves the life of the International Space Station, launches a commercial space transportation industry, fosters the development of path-breaking technologies, and helps create thousands of new jobs," Bolden wrote. The law also helps secure a bright future for Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, which is working with private contractor company SpaceX to launch rockets, said NASA spokesman David Weaver. "This was the compromise plan for moving space exploration forward in America," he said. Our ruling Nelson claims Mack opposed a bill to help NASA. And it’s true that Mack was the only member of the Florida delegation to vote against the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. But there’s a sprinkle of nuance we just can’t ignore. While NASA supported the bill as a new and exciting path forward, many members of Congress had concerns about whether it charted the right path for the space program. Even space policy experts agree that a vote against that legislation isn’t necessarily a vote against the space program. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11973	Said there is cholera in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/02/paul-krugman/paul-krugmans-wrongly-tweets-about-cholera-puerto-/	In the span of six hours, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted then retracted the claim that cholera had been reported on Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Conservative websites came down hard on Krugman for his error, taking it as a case study of mainstream media spreading fake news. There’s no question that Krugman was wrong. Here’s how the episode played out. At about noon on Sept. 30, Krugman tweeted, "Cholera. In a US territory. Among US citizens. In the 21st century. Heckuva job, Trumpie." Cholera is spread by bacteria in dirty water and can bring on severe diarrhea, so severe, it can even be fatal. Within minutes, people peppered Krugman with tweets asking for his source and noting that that were no confirmed cases of cholera. A University of New Hampshire journalism professor wrote, "UPDATE (please share): Cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico is UNCONFIRMED at this time." About six hours after the initial tweet, Krugman retracted his claim. "OK, cholera not confirmed," he wrote. "Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com About half an hour before Krugman sent out his correction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tweeted, "CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Krugman’s original tweet was shared over 14,000 times. The correction was retweeted 567 times (as of this writing). We were curious about where this rumor came from and asked Krugman. He said he saw it in a tweet from Kurt Eichenwald and "was far too quick to assume it was validated." Kurt Eichenwald, a liberal commentator and contributing editor to Vanity Fair, tweeted on Sept. 29, "Cases of cholera now being reported in Puerto Rico. I can’t believe this is America. We're too incompetent or uncaring to get them water?" That tweet was retweeted more than 13,000 times. We found no retraction by Eichenwald on Twitter. Warnings for the potential for cholera had been bouncing around the web. A couple of days before Krugman’s tweet, the liberal information and political action website Daily KOS included and then retracted reports of the disease. The corrected headline for a Sept. 28 blog post said "SOS Puerto Rico: The suffering continues; Update: Cholera cases possible (not confirmed)." At the end of the post, was this note: "An earlier version of this diary included a Tweet saying that cases of cholera had been reported. Given the facts of the ground — including, particularly, the lack of clean drinking water — this is definitely a possibility. Importantly, though, I have been unable to find confirmation of the information in that Tweet. I should not have posted it as fact, and have updated the title." The Daily Beast had an article that underscored the potential for an eruption of cholera. Under the headline "Outbreaks begin in Puerto Rico while Trump tweets ‘amazing job’," was the warning "mayors and a top physician tell The Daily Beast the island faces deadly outbreaks of cholera and hepatitis unless the federal government surges help." The earliest tweet we found that declared that people had cholera in Puerto Rico came on Sept. 27 from a man in Boston who wrote, without any supporting evidence, that "Reports of cholera already breaking out." Conservative websites took Krugman to task. "NYT’s Paul Krugman falsely blames ‘Trumpie’ for non-existent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico," read the Daily Caller’s headline. TownHall wrote "No, Mr. Krugman, There is not a cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico." And the Blaze wrote "NYT columnist slams Trump after cholera reported in Puerto Rico — except there’s just one problem." Our ruling Krugman said that cases of cholera had been reported in Puerto Rico. By his own account, that was incorrect. He assumed someone he trusted had verified the facts and the person hadn't. Health care professionals raised the concern that massive damage to the water supply system increased the risk of cholera, but that falls well short of an actual outbreak. While references to a cholera outbreak littered the twittersphere, those accounts were being rejected two days before Krugman’s tweet. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10612	"He reformed welfare before others tried."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/rudy-giuliani/what-about-tommy-thompson/	In the TV ad Rudy Giuliani debuted in Florida this week, the announcer makes the claim, "He reformed welfare before others tried." It's unclear who "others" are — everyone, or just Giuliani's Republican opponents? So let's consider both possibilities. Giuliani can certainly lay claim to being out front on welfare reform, and his overhaul of the New York City welfare system is nothing short of astounding considering he did it "in the teeth of the most intense opposition" from nearly all of the most significant political forces in the city, said Lawrence Mead, professor of Politics at New York University. One of the cornerstones of Giuliani's controversial plan was a requirement that able-bodied people work or perform community service in order to receive welfare payments (at its peak in 1999, there were over 35,000 people in the Work Experience Program). Welfare rolls during his two terms as major dropped more than 50 percent. But Giuliani can't claim New York was the first in the country. One of the first effective welfare-to-work programs was initiated in San Diego in the early 1980s, Mead said. And Wisconsin instituted an ambitious welfare-to-work program prior to New York City (which is why some people have called former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a onetime presidential candidate, the father of welfare reform). In fact, Giuliani hired one of the architects of the Wisconsin plan to help create changes in New York City. "Giuliani was not absolutely first," said Mead, author of Government Matters: Welfare Reform in Wisconsin. "There is a long history of gradual movement to more and more radical reform," said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and author of the book Welfare Over Work. Politicians in lots of states had dabbled in welfare reform before Giuliani, Haskins said, but Giuliani's program may have been the most remarkable due to the political opposition. Both Mead and Haskins say that if the ad was comparing Giuliani just to his Republican opponents, it's right. Giuliani began making changes shortly after being elected mayor, so 1994. That predates the governorships of Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney. As for Sens. John McCain and Fred Thompson, the federal welfare reform laws passed in August 1996. But the ad doesn't narrow the field at all, so we can only deduce it means he reformed welfare before everyone else. And that is False.

pomt-09469	"Due to ... tax cuts and lower (property) values, 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/02/charlie-crist/crist-floridians-3-billion-less-taxes/	In his annual State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist said Floridians are paying far less in property taxes than they used to. "Property owners were seeing double-digit percentage increases in taxes levied prior to the beginning of my administration," Crist said on March 2, 2010. "Now, they have seen significant decreases over the past three years. Due to ... tax cuts and lower (property) values, 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes." Previously, we rated Crist's claim that he passed the largest tax cut in Florida history. In this item, we'll focus on whether the amount of property tax relief matches Crist's description. The relevant information to back up Crist's claim comes from a Senate committee hearing last month. In the meeting, James McAdams, the Department of Revenue's property tax oversight program director, gave an update on property tax collections across Florida. According to McAdams, Florida property taxes collected between 2007 and 2009 dropped by $2.28 billion, or 7.5 percent, the Associated Press reported. McAdams was unable to delineate how much of the drop was attributed to tax reforms implemented by the Legislature, and how much was a result of falling property values. "I would classify that as dropping like a rock," said Senate Finance and Taxation Committee Chairman Thad Altman, R-Viera. Altman's comment prompted a response from Crist during his televised remarks in front of a joint session of the Legislature. "Sen. Altman, we agree that does, indeed, qualify as 'dropping like a rock,' " Crist said. The Department of Revenue's 2009 annual report, meanwhile, included an even bigger reduction. The annual report said property tax collections fell from $31.04 billion in 2007, to $28.14 billion in 2009. That's a $2.9 billion decrease in three years. (See page 32 of the report). In his State of the State address, Crist said "2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes." A report prepared for a Senate committee pegs the number at about $2.28 billion and the Department of Revenue's annual report pegs the number at $2.9 billion. With the qualifier "almost," that's close enough not to distort the broader point. We rate Crist's claim True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-02T21:24:51	2010-03-02	['None']
pomt-10409	Obama's wife said her goal in life was to put the black community "first and foremost."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/30/chain-email/e-mail-takes-college-work-out-of-context/	A chain e-mail about Michelle Obama, the wife of presidential candidate Barack Obama, purports to be excerpts from a senior thesis she wrote while at Princeton University. It's true that Obama, then Michelle Robinson, attended Princeton and wrote a thesis 23 years ago titled "Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community." The e-mail takes a few actual sentences out of context, and fabricates a few quotes that don't exist in her work. The e-mail begins: "In her senior thesis at Princeton, Michele Obama, the wife of Barack Obama stated that America was a nation founded on 'crime and hatred.' Moreover, she stated that whites in America were 'ineradicably racist.' The 1985 thesis, titled 'Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community' was written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson." But nowhere in the thesis does Obama write the words "crime and hatred" or that whites are "ineradicably racist." The e-mail does get the thesis title, Obama's maiden name, and the year correct. It also uses real quotations from the thesis, though a few are taken out of context. For this fact check, we'll look at the following statement the e-mail says is from Obama's thesis: "There was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community, I am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost. " The e-mail then asks, "What is Michelle Obama planning to do with her future resources if she's first lady that will elevate black over white in America?" In Obama's thesis, she sought to quantify how the attitudes of black Princeton alumni changed after graduation in regard to race relations and social change. Obama was especially interested in the attitudes of Princeton alumni in regard to improving the lives of lower-income blacks. To document the change in attitudes, Obama devised an 18-question survey and mailed it to black alumni. Her thesis is a discussion of her methodology and an analysis of the results. It contains a limited amount of personal opinion in the introduction, including the sentence above. Here is a fuller exerpt: "Earlier in my college career, there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the Black community I was somehow obligated to this community and would utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit this community first and foremost. My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my 'Blackness' than ever before. I have found that at Princeton no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my White professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don't belong. Regardless of the circumstances under which I interact with Whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be Black first and a student second." But Obama writes a few paragraphs later that her earlier assumptions were changing, too: "At the same time, however, it is conceivable that my four years of exposure to a predominately White, Ivy League University has instilled within me certain conservative values. For example, as I enter my final year at Princeton, I find myself striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates — acceptance to a prestigious graduate or professional school or a high paying position in a successful corporation. Thus, my goals after Princeton are not as clear as before." Certainly, Obama's thesis is race-conscious. But the statement used in the e-mail doesn't include the context, that Obama's desire to help the black community "first and foremost" was leavened by later "conservative" values such as attending school or getting a well-paying job. Perhaps at this point it's best to point to some outside commentary. When the thesis became public in February 2008, it was a topic on the Fox News show Hannity & Colmes . Former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, a noted conservative and a commentator for the network, said on the show he thought her thesis work wasn't relevant to the current campaign. "First off, a spouse's personal life is out of bounds, period, end of discussion," Santorum said. "This is something that she did at an age when you write some pretty strange stuff sometimes. I hope they don't pull up my college thesis papers." The quote about Obama wanting to help the black community "first and foremost" is an actual quote from her senior thesis. But it's not given the proper context. And nowhere in her thesis does she say the black community should be elevated over the white community, as the person who wrote the e-mail claims. On these grounds, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-05-30T00:00:00	2008-05-13	['None']

pomt-13206	"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it, but under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country, they've been deported."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/21/donald-trump/trump-right-deportation-numbers-wrong-talks-about-/	At the last presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton tried to make a case on why their own immigration plans are the best for the nation. Trump, the Republican nominee, touted his vision of a wall along the southern border and plans to get undocumented criminal immigrants out of the country. He also brought attention to President Barack Obama’s deportation record. "President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported," Trump said. Deportations and what to do with millions of people in the country illegally are highly controversial topics. Trump himself has not stuck to one approach about it. There’s no doubt many people have been deported under Obama’s presidency --- but we were curious about Trump’s claim of "millions" and on lack of information about it, "nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it." Here’s what’s known about deportation numbers. The Department of Homeland Security issues yearly statistics on enforcement actions. The latest available is for fiscal year 2014, which is Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014. From fiscal years 2009 to 2014, there have been more than 2.4 million removals, according to DHS data. Fiscal year 2009 includes data for a few months in which Obama was not in office. Still, if we add just the full fiscal years in which he has been office, and for which data is available (2010-2014), there have been over 2 million removals. That corroborates Trump’s claim that "under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country." U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also issues removal data. But its removal totals equals the sum of two actions: "removals" and "returns." Removals account for people moved out of the country based on a formal order from a judge. Returns track people who were encountered by ICE, but who chose to depart the United States prior to a resolution of their immigration case. Even then, ICE data shows that more than 2 million people have been moved out of the country while Obama has been in office, supporting part of Trump’s claim. ‘Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it’ In the debate, however, Trump also claimed these millions of deportations have not been spoken about. "Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it," Trump said. But there is extensive reporting that shows otherwise. For years, news outlets have reported on Obama’s deportation numbers. Some examples: 2010: The Washington Post reported that "the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants." 2012: NPR reported that the Obama administration "deported a record 1.5 million" in his first term. 2014: An analysis by The New York Times found that since Obama became president, "two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all." 2016: The New York Times reported in June that Obama "has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2.4 million formal removals." Even immigration advocates have called out Obama for his deportation record, challenging his campaign promise to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Obama was dubbed the "Deporter-in-Chief" in 2014 by Janet Murguía, president of the National Council of La Raza, an immigrant advocacy group. "For the president, I think his legacy is at stake here," Murguía told Politico in March 2014. "We consider him the deportation president, or the deporter-in-chief." We pointed out the Politico article to Trump’s campaign and a spokesperson said, "That was published over two years ago." But Trump’s claim at the debate did not specify that deportations under Obama are not currently being talked about -- which would still be an inaccurate statement. Obama addressed the "Deporter-In-Chief" moniker in a 2014 interview with Jorge Ramos, a Fusion and Univision anchor. Ramos told him 2 million deportations under his presidency had destroyed families and that he was called "Deporter-in-Chief." Obama said it was "not true" when Ramos said he could’ve stopped deportations. "There certainly has been a lot of folks who have focused on Obama’s deportation record," said William Stock, an immigration lawyer and president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "No one can argue that not only have there been hundreds of thousands of removals each year, but there have also been a lot of people talking about those removals." The number of deportations under Obama have been raised by the press, advocacy groups and even at congressional hearings with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump adviser, Stock said. Our ruling Trump said "Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it, but under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country, they've been deported." More than 2.4 million people have been deported under Obama’s presidency. But Trump’s claim that "nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it," is completely wrong. Not only is federal data issued about it on a yearly basis, there has also been extensive media coverage about it. Immigration advocates have called out the president for it and congressional hearings on deportations have also taken place. Trump’s claim is partly right. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02456	On expanding Medicaid as part of the health care law	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/feb/25/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-medicaid-expansion-he-supported/	States across the country are still debating whether to expand Medicaid to serve the poor as part of the federal health care law. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is on record supporting an expansion, but he did not always hold that view. Scott’s critics continue to argue he isn’t pushing for the expansion hard enough. It’s sure to be an issue in the governor’s race, so we wanted to look at the evolution of Scott’s position on the issue on our Flip-O-Meter, which evaluates whether a politician changed their stance -- we leave it up to voters to make judgments about any such changes. (Scott is expected face former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat -- we have evaluated several Crist stances on our Flip-O-Meter.) Medicaid and the health care law Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The Medicaid expansion would allow states to offer health insurance to all of the poor. Before the law, you had to be poor as well as either disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child to qualify. The law says the federal government will cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, gradually declining to 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. Even before he ran for governor Scott was a persistent critic of President Barack Obama"s federal health care push. In 2009, Scott spent $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients' Rights and oppose the law. But on June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obamacare. At the time, about 3.8 million people -- or about 21 percent -- of the state’s population was uninsured. The Supreme Court’s ruling said that states could skip the Medicaid expansion without facing financial penalties. In response to the ruling, Scott said on Fox News that Florida would not expand Medicaid, adding that it "just doesn’t make any sense" and that it was too costly. Then a change of position On Feb. 20, 2013, Scott summoned the media to the governor’s mansion where he announced that he still opposed setting up a state exchange but now supported a three-year Medicaid expansion. Scott said that a three year expansion would allow the state to then judge if it was working before deciding whether to re-authorize it. "On the question of Medicaid expansion, there are no perfect options. To be clear, our options are either having Floridians pay to fund this program in other states while denying health care to our citizens, or using federal funding to help some of the poorest in our state with the Medicaid program as we explore other health care reforms...," he said. "While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care." At the time, Scott said that his mother’s recent death gave him a new perspective. "As I wrestled with this decision, I thought about my Mom’s struggles raising five kids with very little money," he said. The tea party crowd pounced on Scott’s flip-flop. "This is just another example of Republicans lying to Floridians," said Everett Wilkinson, a tea party activist, calling Scott "the Benedict Arnold to the patriot and tea party movement in Florida." Though Scott supported the Medicaid expansion, he also made it clear it wasn’t one of his legislative priorities. The Legislature ended up rejecting the expansion, which included $51 billion in federal dollars over 10 years. In an interview with reporters in Washington on Feb. 24, Scott was asked about his opinion on Medicaid expansion and said he still supports it. Our ruling Scott fought the health care law before he became governor, and after the law passed, he continued to fight it. After the Supreme Court upheld the law, Scott said definitively that he opposed the Medicaid expansion. But several months later, in February 2013, Scott announced that he supported Medicaid expansion. He qualified that position by saying he wanted to try it for three years, so Florida could then judge how it was working. But he didn’t push the Legislature to approve it, and legislators ultimately rejected the expansion. In 2013, Scott completely reversed his stance on Medicaid expansion. So we rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-02663	"We expanded charter" schools.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/13/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-charter-schools-have-grown-virginia/	Former Gov. Bob McDonnell was not shy about about claiming success during his final State of the Commonwealth Address. Among the accomplishments he cited in his hour-long speech: "We expanded charter" schools. Charter schools are alternative primary or secondary academies that receive tax dollars but are not subject to all of the regulations and laws that govern public schools. In exchange for the waivers, the institutions sign a charter guaranteeing certain results. While charter schools have become popular in many states, they’ve encountered stony resistance from local officials in Virginia. So we thought McDonnell’s claim of expansion during his administration -- which ended Saturday -- was worth a look. Taylor Keeney, a McDonnell spokeswoman, cited figures from the state Department of Education showing there were three charter schools in Virginia when McDonnell became governor in January 2010 and now there are six. The growth, when put in a national perspective, is microscopic. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there were 5,274 charter schools across the country in 2010-11, the most recent figures available. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported 6,004 charter schools for the 2012-13 school year. The states with the most charter schools were California with 1,065; Florida, 576; Arizona, 534; Ohio, 374; and Texas, 280. In the region, North Carolina had 107; the District of Columbia, 57; and Maryland, 52. McDonnell has often blamed the resistance in Virginia on local school boards which, under state law, have the final say on whether a charter school is opened. In 2010, he backed legislation that would have allowed the state Board of Education -- which is appointed by the governor -- to override any locality’s rejection of a charter school.. The General Assembly passed a watered-down version of the bill that keeps the final decision in local hands. It provides a process by which a charter school whose application was denied could return to the local school board for reconsideration. In 2012, McDonnell backed successful legislation that established a state panel of experts to help prospective charter schools prepare applications to local school boards. It also mandated that approved charter schools receive per-student funding that is "commensurate" with other public schools in the locality. Officials from two national organizations advocating charter schools told us they were unimpressed with McDonnell’s record, saying three new academies over his four-year term does not represent a change of culture in Virginia. The Center for Education Reform rates Virginia’s laws second worst among the 43 states that have charter schools. Similarly, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools ranks Virginia No. 39 out of 43 in its rankings of laws. "Virginia is the the rock-bottom tier of states," said Todd Ziebarth, senior vice president for state advocacy and support at the alliance. "They may have opened the door, but they shouldn’t expect a stampede," Ziebarth said. "One of the big takeaways under the McDonnell administration is a general disappointment in the charter school community because McDonnell seemed to support charter schools and made some tweaks every year, but at the end of the day, his administration didn’t result in very significant changes in the law." Our ruling McDonnell, citing accomplishments during his term, said charter schools in Virginia "expanded" during his administration. The number rose from three to six -- barely a ripple in a nation of about 6,000 charter schools. The tiny increase underscores a larger truth unmentioned by McDonnell: He was unable to change state laws that are highly unfavorable to charter schools. Adding three new new charter schools does represent a expansion, however. McDonnell’s statement is accurate but omits the context: Virginia still has just a handful of charter schools.

pomt-13297	"You can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/hillary-clinton/clinton-said-terrorists-use-trumps-remarks-about-m/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized Republican Donald Trump during their second debate for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Clinton questioned how such a religious test would be implemented, saying Trump’s comments have been "extremely unwise and even dangerous." "And indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters," Clinton said at the Oct. 9 square-off in St. Louis, Mo. Trump has adjusted the temporary ban on Muslim immigrants he once proposed to say he would instead suspend immigration from regions with a "proven history of terrorism." Clinton has said before that Trump is being used "to essentially be a recruiter" for people to join the cause of terrorism. Earlier this year, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, issued a 51-minute video telling "Muslims of the West" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. The video says the United States has a history of "slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps." It then shows a video of Donald Trump where he is calling "for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" until United States representatives can figure out what is going on. Trump made that statement after the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks. The video calls for American Muslims to leave the United States and join the terrorist group, the Wall Street Journal reported. This spring, Newsweek also reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip of Trump speaking about Brussels. "Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show," Trump says in the video, as ISIS lets the phrase "absolute horror show" repeatedly echo and fade. Clinton’s campaign sent us a Politico story about that video, pointing out that it also features "English subtitles, musical accompaniment and a song of sorts, with the lyrics: ‘Brothers rise up! Claim your victory! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go for jihad.’ " Her campaign also pointed to Foreign Affairs and Time articles reporting that an ISIS spokesman wrote on ISIS-affiliated channel, "I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump." Trump’s campaign did not return requests for comment. Clinton is right about the Trump’s comments being incorporated into propaganda, but it’s difficult to know what effect his words have had on recruitment, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Obviously, we know less about how effective his comments have been as a recruiting tool -- reliable data is hard to come by," Gartenstein-Ross said. "But that is how it's being used." Our ruling Clinton said, "you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters." An East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group has used a video clip of Trump in one of its videos, telling "Muslims of the West" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States and urging them to join the terrorist group, according to multiple news reports.

pomt-08276	Georgia and other states with weak gun laws have more crime.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/09/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-gun-claim-takes-aim-georgia/	New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State. Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia among the states with the weakest gun laws. "Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?" asked CNN's Kiran Chetry. "There's no argument about that," Bloomberg replied. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim "absolutely ridiculous." "If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not," Parsons said. "Yet, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country." The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed. But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a little deeper. The report, "Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking," was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns and completed in September. Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson. Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia. Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases were dismissed. Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states.Per capita, Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii. The report contains a checklist of 10 "key gun laws" and which states have passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak gun laws. The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent misdemeanantsand whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns. Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun dealers. Gun dealers who don’t conduct background checks of prospective gun owners can go to jail. Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized the findings, saying crime has "plummeted" in states said in the study to have weaker gun laws. We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the other one offered mixed results. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have "weak" gun laws were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population. The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th during those five years. We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have "weak" gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked 20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account variables that might impact a state's crime rate. Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview. Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a correlation between places with more guns and homicide. "Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides," Miller said. They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates. "Most crimes don't involve guns," Hemenway said. "If there's causation at all, it's not clear." So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms. We rate Bloomberg's statement as a Mostly True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2010-11-09T06:00:00	2010-10-18	['None']
pomt-13248	"In about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again" through Obamacare.	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-misleads-about-floridians-who-will-los/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continued his attacks on Obamacare during the first U.S. Senate debate against his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio said that Obamacare has "enormous problems." "No. 1, it is running up our debt. No. 2, people are losing their coverage. In about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again," he said. "It is collapsing under its own weight because it doesn’t work." We will fact-check if that many Floridians are poised to lose their health care plans. Obamacare plans Bloomberg News reported Oct. 14 that nationwide, more than 1 million people will lose plans -- and the largest number of losses will be in Florida with more than 400,000. Bloomberg interviewed state regulators and learned a few health insurance companies are quitting the marketplace where people can shop for policies. Sign up for coverage begins in November. In August, Aetna announced that it would stop selling Obamacare plans in 11 states, including Florida for 2017, due to significant financial losses. UnitedHealth is exiting the individual market, and Humana will withdraw from most of the counties it serves in the individual market. As of May 9, approximately 420,000 enrollees in Florida are expected to lose their plans due to withdrawals in the individual exchange marketplace with additional enrollees losing coverage off-exchange, according to Karen Kees, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Floridians who lose their plan can sign up for another one. Fifteen insurance companies have filed requests to sell individual coverage plans in Florida, including 11 insurers that requested to sell plans on the exchange. "It’s not 400,000 are going to be uninsured. (It’s) 400,000 are going to have to switch insurers," said Timothy Jost, author of the Health Affairs Blog and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. And many people each year change plans any way when they seek out a better deal, he said. The premium could be similar for most shoppers since the amount is based on tax credits that are set based on a consumer’s income, Jost said. While the state said that premiums will increase on average 19 percent, Jost said that is before the tax credits that apply to many buying on the marketplace. Jost said the irony in the disruption is that Rubio pushed to defund the risk corridor program that was intended to stabilize the market so that plans that made big profits would pay in and those with big losses would collect. In the end, those funds were limited. "Rubio has to take a lot of credit for Floridians losing coverage," Jost said. "Had the program operated the way it was intended to operate, a lot more insurers would still be in the marketplace." Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said while these Floridians will still be insured a new plan could mean changes for them. "Yes, they will get something of similar price and quality, but it won’t necessarily be in the same network, it may not cover their current doctor," he said. However, it is deceptive to say Floridians will "lose" coverage without explaining that they will get a new plan, said David Himmelstein, professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College. "Many Floridians will have to change insurers," he said. "Some will likely have worse, or more expensive coverage -- although we don't know how many at present. Is that losing coverage? I don't think most people would characterize it that way." Nationwide, most consumers will have multiple choices but fewer than in the past, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Rubio made a similar misleading statement before about people losing health care. In 2013, Rubio said that "300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance." Since Florida Blue provided assistance with switching plans, we rated Rubio’s statement Mostly False because he jumped the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn’t have insurance. Ultimately, more than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue. This time, Florida Blue is expected to pick up many of those who will lose coverage with another carrier. Florida Blue currently has about 700,000 people covered through the marketplace, which is more than any other carrier, spokesman Doug Bartel said. It will continue to offer plans in every Florida county. "We fully expect based upon our products, price, network and benefits that we will pick up many of the consumers whose insurance company is leaving the marketplace," he said. Rubio’s debate statement also ignores that due to the Affordable Care Act, more Floridians have coverage. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. So that’s more than the 400,000 who will "lose" their plan -- and they aren’t actually going to lose insurance. Federal data shows that the percentage of insured in Florida has been steadily dropping. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. The majority of Americans still get their insurance through their employer -- not the individual marketplace. Our ruling Rubio said in the Senate debate "in about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again" through Obamacare. That’s a reference to more than 400,000 Floridians who are expected to lose their plans under the Obamacare exchange. However, Rubio omits that they will be offered another plan including by Florida Blue, which will remain in every county in Florida. Rubio also ignores the fact that due to the marketplace, 1.7 million Floridians have signed up for coverage -- larger than the more than 400,000 who will have to switch plans. The percentage of Floridians who are uninsured has been dropping under Obamacare in recent years.

abbc-00253	Lachlan Macquarie, governor of NSW from 1810 to 1821, is often remembered by history as a man of the enlightenment who brought civilisation to the colony.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-27/fact-check-did-lachlan-macquarie-commit-mass-murder-and-genocide/8981092	The issue is not cut and dried. In April 1816, Macquarie ordered soldiers under his command to kill or capture any Aboriginal people they encountered during a military operation aimed at creating a sense of "terror". At least 14 men, women and children were brutally killed, some shot, others driven over a cliff. Although Macquarie's orders included an instruction to punish the guilty with as little injury to the innocent as possible, archival evidence shows he knew innocent people could be killed. In addition, Macquarie explicitly instructed his soldiers to offer those Aboriginal groups encountered an opportunity to surrender, and to open fire only after meeting "resistance". These instructions appear to have been ignored. Historical records suggest the soldiers offered no opportunity to surrender, opening fire on a group of people ambushed at night and who were fleeing in terror. Macquarie appears to have glossed over this failure in the weeks following the massacre, telling his superior back in England that his men acted "perfectly in Conformity to the instructions I had furnished them", and claiming the soldiers had indeed encountered resistance before opening fire. Macquarie was ultimately responsible for his men. By today's standards, his actions — and lack of action in not bringing soldiers who disobeyed his instructions to account — would, as a minimum, likely be regarded as a war crime involving a disproportionate response that led to a significant loss of life. And, depending on the definition, the incident might also be described as "mass murder", perhaps akin to recent military massacres in which innocent civilians attempting to flee were killed. The issue of whether or not the actions amount to genocide is a complex one. A legal definition of genocide did not exist until after World War II. It is questionable whether this can be applied retrospectively to Macquarie's actions, which took place some 130 years before the UN General Assembly made genocide a crime under international law. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that Macquarie set about deliberately to "destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", as per the UN definition, however misguided and destructive some of his Indigenous policies might have been. It is, therefore, problematic to suggest that Macquarie, as an individual, was guilty of ordering genocide. However, it can be argued that the impact of the wider conflict between Aboriginal people and Europeans (whether soldiers or vigilante settlers), combined with a range of other factors — the loss of land and food sources, the spread of disease, the removal of children, and alcohol abuse, for example — contributed to the large-scale loss of life and culture that resembled genocide. Experts contacted by Fact Check acknowledged the nuance in the arguments, but differed in their interpretations of Macquarie's actions and his culpability or otherwise.

pomt-03274	"Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/07/alan-krueger/alan-krueger-top-economist-obama-says-most-new-job/	Policymakers and pundits are spending a lot of time these days talking about part-time jobs -- whether they are becoming more common at the expense of full-time jobs, and how problematic that is. Republicans note that President Barack Obama’s health care law requires larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers, which they say gives companies an incentive to cut workers’ hours so much that they become part-time workers and thus exempt from the health insurance mandate. And beyond the question of Obamacare’s incentives, some economists worry that since the most recent recession, companies have been unusually willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers. We recently noticed two seemingly contradictory comments on this topic -- one from a Republican, one from a Democrat -- and thought it would be worthwhile checking both. In this item, we will check a comment made by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, during an interview with Sara Eisen of Bloomberg television. Eisen asked Krueger whether we’re "creating a part-time economy. The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker's hours or putting a freeze on hiring." He responded, "I think that's highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions." (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama’s health care law.) In the other item, we checked a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that "this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time." These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary: Date Full-time employees Part-time employees March 2010 111,195,000 27,527,000 July 2013 116,090,000 28,233,000 Change +4,895,000 +706,000 So Krueger is right -- 87 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from full-time jobs. Still, we will note that if you use a shorter time horizon, such as calendar year 2013, a large percentage of jobs created were part-time positions. In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument. Our ruling Krueger said that "since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions." The statistics show that 87 percent of the increase in jobs between March 2010 and July 2013 consisted of full-time jobs. A shorter time frame would show the opposite pattern, but on the numbers, Krueger is right. We rate the claim True.	None	Alan Krueger	None	None	None	2013-08-07T09:00:00	2013-08-02	['None']
pomt-01250	"I don't know who (Jonathan Gruber) is."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-she-doesnt-know-who-jonathan-gru/	Just days after a Republican sweep in the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats found themselves with an embarrassing development on the Obamacare front. The controversy involved Jonathan Gruber, a leading health care economist whose work is widely cited as underpinning the Affordable Care Act and who advised the Obama administration as the law was being drawn up. (This prior fact-check we did runs down Gruber’s involvement. We’ve also interviewed him from time to time as an expert on the law.) Critics of the law located a video from a 2013 conference at the University of Pennsylvania in which Gruber said some impolitic things about how the law was put together, including a remark about "the stupidity of the American voter." Gruber’s remarks addressed the idea of a "community rating," the notion that health insurance is least expensive when everyone -- sick and healthy, old and young -- is required to buy health insurance. Doing it this way keeps rates down by sharing health care costs across a larger population, but it typically requires forcing people to have health insurance through a mechanism like penalties for refusing to purchase insurance, which the law includes. Gruber also addressed how various aspects of the law were massaged in order to make the law more palatable to lawmakers and, ultimately, to voters. Here’s the full version of what he said, beginning at about the 20:30 mark. "Mark" refers to Mark Pauly, a fellow health care economist who was on the panel with Gruber. "Mark made a couple of comments that I do want to take issue with -- one about transparency in financing, and the other is about moving from community rating to risk-rated subsidies. It’s just -- you can’t do it, politically. You just literally cannot do it. Not just transparent financing but also transparent spending. "This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure (the Congressional Budget Office) did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay? So it's written to do that. In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in — you made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money — it would not have passed. Okay? Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. "And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass. ... Look, I wish Mark was right that we could make it all transparent, but I'd rather have this law than not. … Yeah, there are things I wish I could change but I’d rather have this law than not. And I think that involves some trade-offs that we don’t prefer as economists but which are realistic." There’s a lot of high wonkiness here, but two aspects outraged critics of the law. First was Gruber’s use of the word "stupidity" to describe the American voter. And second was his defense of a "lack of transparency" when the law was being debated. On Nov. 11, not long after the controversy broke, Gruber offered MSNBC’s Ronan Farrow an apology. "The comments in the video were made at an academic conference," Gruber said. "I was speaking off the cuff, and I basically spoke inappropriately and I regret having made those comments." In the meantime, Democratic officials began to distance themselves from Gruber. Few did so as aggressively as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who had shepherded the law through the House when she was speaker in 2010. In response to a question in a Nov. 13 press conference, Pelosi told the reporter, "Well, you gave an interesting set of observations, but one that you skipped is Mr. Gruber's comments were a year old, and he has backtracked from most of them. He's not even advocating the position that he was at some conference. So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill. With all due respect to your question, you have a person who wasn't writing our bill, commenting on what was going on when we were writing our bill, who has withdrawn some of the statements that he made. So let’s put him aside." We decided to take a look at Pelosi’s claim that, referring to Gruber, "I don't know who he is." Given Gruber’s prominence in the field of health care policymaking, it would be odd if Pelosi had never heard of him. Certainly her staff did -- on Dec. 1, 2009, they issued a news release titled "Health Insurance Reform Mythbuster - ‘Health Reform And Insurance Premiums’ " that cites Gruber by name seven times. (It’s no longer on Pelosi’s site but is archived here.) Still, the fact that her aides knew about Gruber isn’t a smoking gun that she did. The smoking gun instead comes from video of a news conference she held on Nov. 5, 2009. During that news conference, she addressed differences between the bill she was backing and one offered by Republicans: "We're not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we'll have a side-by-side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT's analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo, versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even from now, and much less preventing the upward spiral." When this 2009 comment came to light, the Washington Post reported that Pelosi's office told them that the minority leader "meant that she didn't know Gruber personally." Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told the Post that Pelosi "said she doesn’t 'know who he is,' not that she’s 'never heard of him.’ " When we asked Hammill if he wished to elaborate, he told PolitiFact, "We've cited the work of dozens upon dozens of economists over the years. As the leader said today, Mr. Gruber played no role in drafting our bill." (He also directed us to a document produced by Pelosi’s office rebutting some of the claims surrounding what Gruber said.) It’s not clear whether Gruber played a direct role in drafting the House bill -- though he certainly advised the Obama administration in the process of passing the health care overhaul, and there’s little doubt that the ACA shares much in common with the Massachusetts bill Gruber did help devise. But there’s little doubt that Pelosi’s claim from the Nov. 13 press conference -- that "I don't know who (Gruber) is" -- is inaccurate. Our ruling Pelosi said, "I don't know who (Jonathan Gruber) is." Video showing Pelosi citing Gruber’s work offers the clearest evidence that she did indeed know who he was, and even her office now acknowledges that she meant to say that she didn't know Gruber personally. Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2014-11-13T17:17:02	2014-11-13	['None']
pomt-06619	More private-sector jobs were created in the second year of the Obama administration than in the eight years of the Bush administration.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/20/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-jobs-increased-faster-2010-8-yea/	During a Sept. 17, 2011, edition of the MSNBC show Up with Chris Hayes, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered a defense of the U.S. economy’s job creation record during President Barack Obama’s tenure. "When President (George W.) Bush was president for those eight years with those tax policies, we lost jobs," Pelosi said. "In fact, more jobs were created in the second year -- that would be last year -- in the private-sector in the Obama administration than in the eight years of the Bush administration. And they want us to repeat those tax cuts at the high end which, again, did not create jobs, but they did deepen the deficit." It’s a variation of a talking point we have checked twice in the past year. Before we rule on Pelosi’s current iteration, we’ll review how we rated the previous two instances. What Pelosi has said previously The first time came in October 2010, during an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Pelosi said, "More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration." We found that data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private-sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,981,000 Americans employed in the private-sector. So the United States lost 653,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch. That made it easy for Pelosi: If the United States had netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 106,793,000, a number that grew to 107,570,000 by September 2010. That worked out to 777,000 jobs created. (The numbers here are sightly different from what we reported in our original item, due to after-the-fact numerical revisions by BLS.) But we noted at the time that Pelosi had cherry-picked the data, choosing a time frame favorable to Obama. If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would have been stuck with a net loss of 3.4 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 777,000 she came up with for the first eight months of 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline. Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of roughly 4 million private-sector jobs. On balance, we gave Pelosi’s October 2010 statement a rating of Half True -- right on the numbers, but misleading due to cherry-picking. Pelosi’s second offering, in May 2011, earned a lower rating, since she misstated a portion of the talking point. During a May 16, 2011, interview with Bloomberg television, Pelosi said, "In the first year of the Obama administration, more jobs were created in the private-sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration, with all of the tax cuts that President Bush had." This time, she pointed to the first year of the Obama Administration -- January 2009 through January 2010 -- when the economy shed almost 4.2 million private-sector jobs. So while job growth under Bush was anemic by historical standards, it was still better than the 4.2 million jobs lost under Obama. That means Pelosi was wrong, and we rated the claim False. Pelosi’s new statement Pelosi’s statement from last weekend continues the cherry-picking approach: She cited numbers only for jobs created in 2010. Using the period January 2010 to December 2010, the number of private-sector jobs increased by more than 1.2 million. If Pelosi had used more current numbers, she actually would have had a stronger case: From January 2010 to August 2011, the increase in jobs was almost twice as big -- nearly 2.4 million. Even the smaller of these two numbers beats Bush’s eight-year jobs increase -- but she continues to conveniently ignore the first year of the Obama administration. If you take the entirety of Obama’s term -- January 2009 to August 2011 -- the nation has lost 1.8 million jobs, which is still worse than what happened under Bush. Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi, argues that it’s proper to keep the first year of Obama’s tenure out of the equation. "Republicans may wish to wipe the slate clean and forget about the financial crisis that nearly destroyed our economy and the recession that began under President Bush," said Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi. "The figures are correct and clearly demonstrate that private-sector jobs are being created, but not fast enough – we have much more to do, and we urge Republicans to join us to pass President Obama’s American Jobs Act." We understand the impulse to make such adjustments, but in Pelosi’s formulation, this principle is applied unequally. If the first year of the Bush administration, which also included a recession, were excluded from her calculation-- this would have magically erased a loss of 2.4 million jobs under Bush. The next seven years of the Bush presidency would have shown a gain of nearly 1.8 million jobs, rather than a loss of 653,000 for the full eight-year period. Interestingly, if Pelosi had started the count for each president at the beginning of the second year of their presidencies, it would not only have been more defensible methodologically, but it would have also backed up Pelosi's argument better. Leaving out the first year for each president, private-sector job growth under Obama would have been 2.4 million, compared to 1.8 million under Bush. However, in none of the three statements by Pelosi that we've fact-checked did Pelosi use that method. Our ruling Pelosi compared a select time frame in the Obama administration against the entire length of the Bush administration -- a methodology that treats the two presidents unequally. The irony is that if she had used better methodology, she would have had a sounder argument that more private-sector jobs were created under Obama than under the Bush administration. For her general point, we give Pelosi some credit. For her methodological sins -- repeated at least three times -- we give her thumbs down. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-02476	"Since 2009, Georgia's public schools have lost nearly 9,000 classroom teachers while the number of students has gone up."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/21/jason-carter/georgia-down-9000-plus-teachers/	On Tuesday, Jason Carter, a Democratic state senator from Atlanta and an announced candidate for governor, called for Georgia to do more to support its teacher workforce, including: restoring its commitment to a 10 percent bonus for National Board-certified teachers; bringing back incentives for highly qualified and experienced pre-k teachers; and resuming HOPE scholarship programs designed to train and recruit teachers. Carter said there’s ample evidence that Georgia’s public schools -- and thus teachers -- have been dealt some tough blows. "Since 2009, Georgia's public schools have lost nearly 9,000 classroom teachers while the number of students has gone up," he said in a statement. Carter, a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, is expected to hammer hard in the governor’s race against the policies of the GOP majority and years of state budget cuts to education. Those cuts, combined with falling local property tax collections, have forced school districts to reduce staff, increase class sizes, furlough employees and shorten their school years. Chances ramped up for education to be a hot topic in the Republican primary as well, with State School Superintendent John Barge in the mix of announced GOP challengers to incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal. We started our truth test of Carter’s statement by asking for the source of his information. A spokeswoman referred us to a November report published by the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. The report was based on an online survey taken over the summer. Of the state’s 180 school districts, 140 -- representing 92.8 percent of all public schools -- participated, according to the GBPI. Among the findings: The surveyed districts now have 8,982 fewer teachers in their classrooms than they did in 2009. We checked in with the state’s two major teacher groups -- the Professional Association of Georgia Educators and the Georgia Association of Educators. The data developed by the GBPI and cited by Carter seems "credible to me," PAGE spokesman Tim Callahan said. Added GAE President Calvine Rollins: "What we do know is that class sizes have increased tremendously." We compared the GBPI information against data that districts are required to submit annually to the state.The results were very similar. In fiscal 2009, which covers the 2008-2009 school year, Georgia had 120,660 teachers in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade -- 115,277 full-time and 5,383 part-time -- according to the annual state report card on education. That compares with 111,401 public school teachers -- 107,729 full-time and 3,672 part-time -- working in fiscal 2013, or the 2012-2013 school year. And the difference is 9,259 fewer teachers statewide. As to the claim by Carter, that school enrollment rose in this period, state data show he’s correct. Student enrollment wasn’t growing rapidly but it did increase. There were 1,615,066 students in Georgia public schools in fiscal 2009 and 1,657,506 in attendance in fiscal 2013, according to state data. On Oct. 1, the 180 districts collectively counted and reported to the state Department of Education that they had 1,723,439 students on their rolls. Carter’s statement was based on solid numbers. Georgia has lost about 7.6 percent of its teachers since 2009. Enrollment wasn’t booming, but it did grow by about 2.6 percent. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-09084	U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin didn't want a border fence to block illegal immigration "because he is afraid that someone will get hurt trying to go around the fence."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/25/michael-j-gardiner/gardiner-says-langevin-opposed-us-mexican-border-f/	The United States may be a melting pot, but few things divide people faster than the topic of illegal immigration. Michael J. Gardiner, one of three Republicans hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District, devotes a lot of space to the issue on a web page called Illegal Immigration: Costly and Unfair to Citizens, Tax payers, and Legal Residents. In the section on "Common sense measures to control illegal immigration and its costs," he has this paragraph under the category "physical obstacles”: "James R. Langevin is opposed to fences where they could work, because he is afraid that someone will get hurt trying to go around the fence. Thus he would deprive us of the abiliity <sic> to manage immigration in an orderly way. This is not leadership. It is powerlessness and a misplaced sense of responsibility. Our Government must not be disabled frm <sic> doing its job." So Langevin doesn't want a secure border because he's afraid someone might get hurt trying to circumvent it? We called Gardiner at his law office and asked for the source of that assertion. He sent us to a website called OnTheIssues.org, which tracks voting records on a variety of issues, and a web page called "James Langevin on Immigration." "Voted NO on building a fence along the Mexican border" is the headline for the top item of the page, a reference to House Resolution 6061, which was passed by the House on Sept. 14, 2006 and ultimately became law. It called for at least two layers of reinforced fencing along portions of the U.S.-Mexican border. Langevin, we confirmed, voted against it. But nowhere on the website does it actually say, as Gardiner does, that Langevin opposed the measure because he thought the fence might cause someone to get hurt. In fact, the web page Gardiner cites lists other reasons opponents were against the 700-mile fence, such as the fact that the resolution had no funding for a barrier expected to cost at least $7 billion, no money to maintain it, and ignores real enforcement measures such as hiring more border patrol personnel. We found other arguments against the resolution, any of which might have been Langevin's motivation to vote no. Even when OnTheIssues.org described safety concerns, it was a lot less cavalier about the argument than Gardiner. It said opponents supported voting no because "Walls, barriers, and military patrols will only force those immigrants to utilize ever more dangerous routes and increase the number of people who die in search of an opportunity to feed and clothe their families." Gardiner said he wrote his position paper before he realized that the arguments listed on OnTheIssues.org were not attributed to Langevin, or anyone else in particular. "I suppose I missed that the first time, in my enthusiasm to research his record," the candidate said. "I can't say what he specifically said, to be fair." In his enthusiasm, Gardiner made assumptions that have no basis. So regardless of the real reason for Langevin's vote, the Truth-O-Meter says Gardiner deserves a Pants on Fire . For the record, we asked Langevin’s office why the Congressman voted against the legislation. Spokeswoman Joy Fox responded with an email saying that Langevin is not convinced that the border fence is an answer to the problem of border security. “He had serious concerns that the costs of the bill would not result in significant improvements to our border security. And these concerns, unfortunately, have been borne out. The border fence initiative has been beset by ineffective management, cost overruns and missed deadlines,” Fox said.	None	Michael J.

pomt-10496	Hillary Clinton's international travels included "no serious diplomacy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/04/dick-morris/clintons-trips-not-all-puffery/	Sen. Hillary Clinton's talk on the campaign trail has at times inflated rather than clarified her accomplishments in matters of foreign policy. We found accuracy problems with her claims that she brought peace to Northern Ireland (Half True), that she helped negotiate open borders for Kosovo refugees (Barely True), and that she dodged sniper fire in Bosnia (Pants on Fire wrong). But after schedules for her days as first lady were released on March 19, 2008, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris said the schedules proved Clinton's foreign travel was not relevant experience. "What's there, for us all to see, is one soft event after another, a schedule far more typical of such first ladies as Mamie Eisenhower or Lady Bird Johnson than of a future presidential candidate," he wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Post two days later. "During her international travels, there was no serious diplomacy, just a virtually endless round of meetings with women, visiting arts-and-crafts centers, watching native industries and photo opportunities for the local media." We analyzed all of Clinton's foreign trips as first lady from 1993-2001 and found that Morris goes too far when he says she did "no serious diplomacy" and filled her traveling days with puffery. Interactive map of Hillary Clinton’s foreign trips as first lady. To start with, she regularly met with government officials. In March 1995, she met with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A few days later she met with P.V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister of India. In Eastern Europe in July 1996, she met with President Ion Iliescu of Romania and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic. In a tour of Central American countries in 1998, she announced major aid packages for hurricane relief and addressed the Congress of Guatemala. In Egypt in March 1999, she met with President Hosni Mubarak: The 15-minute courtesy call stretched to an hour, with Clinton expressing concern about the treatment of his country's 6-million to 10-million Coptic Christians, according to reports from the time. Yes, many of these meetings were brief, and we have no reason to think the first lady brokered agreements or executed new policies. But to say that the meetings did not constitute "serious diplomacy" is wrong. Her meetings were with heads of state — not just their spouses — and the American media covered them as legitimate news stories about America's ongoing foreign policy concerns. Morris is correct that Clinton met with many women. Virtually every trip has her meeting with some sort of women's group. But they weren't tea parties; they usually focused on significant social issues such as entrepreneurship, health care, human rights, education or child care. One of Clinton's most favored issues was clearly microcredit, an international movement with a goal of giving small loans to the poor, often to women to start their own, home-based businesses. Clinton visited microcredit programs regularly when she traveled overseas — the issue appears on her schedules more than 50 times. One of her earliest trips as first lady was a 1995 visit with Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a microcredit pioneer and founder of the Grameen Bank. Yunus went on to win the Nobel Prize in 2006. Morris' criticism that Clinton's travel was frivolous doesn't match up with what her schedules and news reports show. We found the truth of the matter to be somewhere between Clinton's bragging and Morris' put-downs. Meanwhile, we find his statement that the trips did not constitute any serious diplomacy to be False.	None	Dick Morris	None	None	None	2008-04-04T00:00:00	2008-03-21	['None']

pomt-07085	Says President Barack Obama promised he would cut the deficit in half, but instead will at least double it.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/24/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obama-going-break-promise-deficit-an/	In a recent interview on New Hampshire Now, a talk show on WKXL-AM in Concord, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said President Barack Obama’s first term was littered with broken promises. "People won’t be duped twice. He made huge promises to the country -- 10, 15 big promises and he’s broken or left unfulfilled almost every one of them," Pawlenty said. "Just a couple of quick examples: He said in 2009 early, ‘I will reduce the deficit in half by the end of my first term.’ Instead he’s going to multiply it by two, three, four or five." We raised our eyebrows. So we checked in with Alex Conant, spokesman for the Pawlenty campaign, and asked him to provide some supporting evidence. Conant cited a comment by Obama in February 2009 at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit in which Obama said he was "pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." So Pawlenty is right about the first part. As for the second part of the statement, Conant pointed us to an estimate of federal debt from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that does official budget estimates. "If you look at this CBO projection of federal debt, (Table 1, Page 2), you'll see that the publicly held debt will double with even the most generous revenue projections," Conant wrote. "If revenues continue to stagnate, and businesses do not grow, the debt will grow by even larger margins." But Pawlenty said "deficit" -- not "debt." They are not the same thing. We inquired again but never heard back from Conant. Here's how they're different: The deficit is the amount by which the government’s spending exceeds its revenue for a given period, usually one year. The debt is the accumulation of the prior deficits. There are actually two major ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt owed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money that is owed to beneficiaries in the future. The "debt held by the public," which Conant referenced, currently represents about two-thirds of the $14.4 trillion gross federal debt. If you're measuring the deficit, Pawlenty’s right that Obama hasn't yet fulfilled his promise -- at least according to the current projections for the end of his four-year term. The annual deficit was $1.4 trillion when he took office in 2009. In CBO's most recent projections from April, the deficit is projected to be $1.16 trillion in fiscal year 2012 and $901 billion in 2013. So he's got to cut a lot more from the budget in the next two years to achieve the goal. But it was incorrect for Pawlenty to say the deficit will more than double. In fact, it is on track to go down, although possibly not as much as Obama promised. And even if Pawlenty meant "debt," the facts don't support his claim. The publicly held debt is projected to continue growing -- from the $7.5 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $12.66 trillion in 2013, which is less than double. Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that Pawlenty may have erred by using fiscal year 2008 as a starting point. The debt and deficit both roughly double if he were comparing 2008 to 2012. The debt also doubles by the end of 2013 if you use, as a baseline, Obama's first full day in office -- Jan. 21, 2009 -- when the publicly held debt was $6.3 trillion. But even then, Pawlenty’s multipliers of "three, four or five" would be gross exaggerations. Marc Goldwein, an economist at the centrist New America Foundation, said it’s more important to take in the big picture, rather a small sample of years, for analysis. "The baseline should be -- what do we need to do to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path," Goldwein said. "We can manipulate numbers however we want to show how deficits change, but the important thing is what deficits and debt are and will be." Our ruling There is some truth to Pawlenty’s claim: Obama made a pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. And he’s falling short so far. But there’s a lot more of Pawlenty's statement that’s wrong. The deficit, which should not be confused with the debt, is projected to decrease, not increase. And even if Pawlenty mixed up the words or used the incorrect fiscal year as a baseline, Pawlenty’s suggestion that the deficit could multiply by "two, three, four or five" is not supported by the facts. We rate Pawlenty’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05144	"Most of Ted Cruz’s money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/21/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-xx/	Fresh from leading the May 2012 Republican primary for his party’s U.S. Senate nomination, David Dewhurst declared that voters in his July runoff with Ted Cruz will be choosing between Texas and Washington. According to a June 5, 2012, email blast from the Dewhurst campaign, the lieutenant governor told Sean Rima of San Antonio’s KTSA (550 AM): "This is a choice, ladies and gentleman, between Texas and Washington. Most of Ted Cruz’s money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas, and they’ve run millions and millions of untrue ads against me." Questionable advertising aside, we wondered if Cruz, a lawyer and former state solicitor general, had indeed raised most of his money from Washington and out of state. To back the claim, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed out a Houston Chronicle news story published five days after Dewhurst made his comment. We’d typically rule out this type of research since we expect a statement to be supported at the time it’s made. In this case, though, we confirmed that figures cited in the story were based on finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission by Dewhurst and Cruz before Dewhurst spoke. According to Cruz’s campaign-finance filings as posted on the election commission website the day we searched, his reports at the time the Chronicle did its story covered contributions received from early 2011 through May 9, 2012. The Chronicle story says Dewhurst has raised more than 90 percent of his campaign cash in Texas, while Cruz has pocketed 35 percent of his proceeds from outside the state, raising more than $1.5 million from more than 1,000 donors who live outside Texas. The story says Cruz has received donations from every state except for Vermont, while Dewhurst has reaped $180,800 from 88 people in 20 other states and the nation’s capital. Generally, the story says, Dewhurst has outraised Cruz, $18.4 million to $5.8 million, but Cruz has an 8-to-1 edge beyond Texas. A June 19, 2012, analysis by the Texas Tribune notes that it’s not known where more than $1 million of Cruz’s contributions came from. That’s because donations of $200 or less are not required to be itemized. The Tribune reported that of $4.6 million in itemized individual contributions that Cruz received, 39 percent — $1.5 million — came from out-of-state contributors. According to a related June 12, 2012, post on the Chronicle’s Texas on the Potomac blog, Cruz has raised $381,451 from 169 Washington donations. By our math, such donations account for about 7 percent of Cruz’s total contributions. Dewhurst, the post says, had drawn 11 donations from Washington donors, totaling $6,750. So, Cruz has raised less than 10 percent of his money from Washington givers, less than 40 percent from donors outside Texas, though this does not account for the origins of his unitemized donations. When we followed up, Hirsch of Dewhurst’s campaign pointed out that outside groups have put some $3.8 million into touting Cruz or opposing Dewhurst, also as reported by the Chronicle. That $3.8 million includes $1.3 million designed to directly support Cruz's candidacy, the Chronicle reported, and $2.5 million spent by the anti-tax Club for Growth on targeting Dewhurst. The Tribune said in its article that two Texas super PACs have put $3 million into supporting Dewhurst’s candidacy. Hirsch pointed out, too, that according to the Center for Responsive Government, which tracks campaign spending, FreedomWorks, another group, has spent about $133,000 promoting Cruz, while the Senate Conservatives Fund has spent more than $500,000 doing the same. Throw in these outside expenditures and one could speculate that as much as $5.3 million intended to help Cruz or oppose Dewhurst has been raised from, or spent by, individuals and entities from outside Texas, though we do not know how much of the outside groups’ spending originated from non-Texas givers. Significantly, though, it’s unlikely the groups spent such funds hand-in-glove with Cruz’s campaign. That’s forbidden. The election commission says on its site: "Independent expenditures represent spending by individual people or groups or political committees... expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates. These expenditures may not be made in concert or cooperation with or at the request or suggestion of the candidate, the candidate’s campaign or a political party." Our ruling Dewhurst says Cruz has raised most of his money from donors in Washington and out of state. Through early May 2012, in reality, Cruz had gathered less than 10 percent of his campaign’s itemized contributions from Washington givers and less than 40 percent from outside Texas. That’s not "most." Our sense is that spending by outside groups for or against Cruz or Dewhurst belongs in a different category than money either one has raised. Such groups are barred from coordinating expenditures with candidates. Still, Dewhurst’s statement has an element of truth; Cruz has gotten considerable out-of-state support.

pomt-09679	A cap-and-trade plan promoted by Barack Obama would hit hardest "those already struggling to make ends meet."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/17/sarah-palin/cap-and-trade-electricity-rates-fixes/	In her new book, Going Rogue , Sarah Palin says President Barack Obama's support for a cap-and-trade plan is "misguided." "The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet. So much for the campaign promise not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year." Before we examine her claim, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't familiar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Barack Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008. "Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket," Obama told the Chronicle . "Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers." (Separately, we rated Palin's statement on this comment True .) Ordinarily, higher electricty rates would hit hardest those "already struggling to make ends meet," because it's awfully hard in this day and age to do without a basic level of electricity. But the actual legislation being considered in Congress now takes that into account, and includes measures intended to lower electricity rates for consumers. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively, wrote the bill that passed the House in June. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given to companies for free. But eventually, they would have to buy those permits from the government. Under the bill, 30 to 40 percent of the revenues raised would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. But we do know that the bill seeks to offset those higher costs through rebates for low-income consumers. In fact, the poorest people might see a net benefit from cap and trade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan, independent arm of Congress. It analyzed the effect on rates by household income in 2020 and found that the lowest 20 percent of households would see a net benefit of $40 per year. The next 20 percent of households would see an added cost of $40 per year. The middle 20 percent would pay $235 a year more; the second-highest 20 percent would pay $340 a year more, and the top 20 percent would pay $245 a year more. (The top tier does a little better because of credits for businesses.) The House bill is not the final version of cap and trade; the Senate still needs to consider its own bill. Palin is correct in that lower-income households would feel the impact of higher utility costs, but the House bill contains significant offsets to help people of modest means. Thanks to its offsets, the plan is not entirely regressive because the lowest one-fifth of households would see a net benefit. So we rate Palin's statement Half True.

pomt-09003	"To say a family has to buy a product from a private company is clearly beyond the delegated powers of the U.S. Constitution."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/13/john-oxendine/gov-hopeful-john-oxendine-said-heath-care-unconsti/	Republicans vying for governor took the opportunity during Sunday's televised debate to bash massive federal health care changes. The bill, signed by President Barack Obama in March, is unpopular among state Republicans. Predictably, none of the candidates liked it. But one statement made on the Fox 5 program by front-runner John Oxendine made us curious, especially since the legislation is chock-full of stuff people on both sides of the aisle find murky: "To say a family has to buy a product from a private company is clearly beyond the delegated powers of the U.S. Constitution," he said. But are they required to buy it? And does the law violate the U.S. Constitution? First, a little history. After the Democrat-backed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed, critics, especially Republicans, complained that it's unconstitutional for a number of reasons, including that it makes people buy health insurance. States banded together to file suit against the federal government in March. Gov. Sonny Perdue hoped to join them, but state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democrat who is running for governor, refused to file suit. Perdue made an end run around him in May by getting a private firm to handle the work at no cost to the state. When asked for clarification, Oxendine's campaign said that making individuals make a purchase is well beyond the powers of the federal government. We covered the constitutionality of health care reform in an earlier PolitiFact Georgia item July 1. It noted the issue has yet to be decided in court, and plaintiffs aren't assured a win. The suit remains in its early stages, which means that Oxendine's statement that the bill is "clearly beyond the delegated powers of the U.S. Constitution" is not correct. Not yet, at least. And maybe not ever. Now we turn to the matter of whether the health care bill says families have "to buy a product from a private company." We find the rule is a bit more complicated than Oxendine's statement makes it out to be. Citizens are required to have health care coverage by 2014 under the bill. But not all will have to buy it from a private company or buy it at all, said tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, and Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots. There are multiple exceptions to the rule. For instance, people under financial hardship, who have religious objections to purchasing health care or are American Indians do not have to buy it. People on Medicaid, which covers low-income people, don't have to buy insurance from a private company. The government covers them. The punishment for failing to buy health insurance is pretty mild. You don't get tossed into jail. Instead, you pay a tax penalty. The penalty is small in comparison to the cost of buying insurance, Antos and Gleckman agree. In 2014, it's $95 for most individuals. Later on it grows to $695. Higher-income people will pay based on different criteria. So Oxendine's statement about the families buying health insurance had some truth to it: The federal government did tell families to have health insurance. Many will purchase it from private companies. Some people, however, don't have to buy it or will get it from the government. People who are required to buy it, but hate the thought of doing so, can pay a tax penalty that will likely cost them less than insurance. But the constitutionality of the law is far from settled, and Oxendine's statement that Congress "clearly" overstepped its authority is premature. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-05026	President Obama’s health care law says "when you sell your house now you have to pay a 3.8 percent tax."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/15/vincent-buddy-cianci/talk-show-host-buddy-cianci-says-obamas-health-car/	It's the bogus claim that refuses to die. Initially, the idea that President Obama's health-care law requires everyone who sells his or her home to pay a 3.8-percent sales tax was the stuff of unsigned chain e-mails. On Wednesday, it was embraced by former Providence mayor and current talk show host Vincent "Buddy" Cianci. Cianci was grilling Democratic congressional candidate Anthony Gemma about the health-care law; Gemma was barely able to get a word in edgewise. But it was Cianci’s questioning that caught our attention. Cianci: "Are you in favor of the part of Obamacare that says when you sell your house now you have to pay a 3.8-percent tax? When you sell the house. Are you for that?" Gemma: "No." Cianci: "Well then, what are you supporting the Obama health-care plan for? Because that's what it calls for." Gemma: "At the end of the day, at the end of the day . . ." Cianci (interrupting): "So if you sell your house, you've got to pay 3.8 percent. And you're for that? You're for that? I just want you to go on record. You're for paying the 3.8 percent when you sell the house? I just want to put you on tape. So you're for that? So the next time I ask you, you change your mind, that you can't say . . ." Gemma (interrupting): "I'm not for new taxes. I'm not for new taxes. I'm for appropriate . . . " Cianci (interrupting): "Well no. Are you for that? One question. Don't argue with me. I'm trying to get you some publicity. I want the people to know how you stand. Are you for the 3.8-percent tax on the house that a person sells when Obama's health plan goes in? Are you in favor of that? Are you in favor of that?" Gemma: "I am, I am for it, for it . . ." Cianci (interrupting): "Yes or no. Are you for it or against it?" Gemma: "I am for it -- the affordable . . . ." Cianci (interrupting): "Ok, thanks. I have to go to a break. He's for the tax." That's four times Cianci makes reference to a 3.8-percent tax if you sell your house. We e-mailed Cianci to see if he had any new information about the tax. We didn't hear back from him. PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have looked at this issue before. (We last published an item on this in February.) They've all come to the same conclusion. The health-care plan does include new taxes. One of them is a 3.8-percent tax on home sales by the wealthy and won’t affect the vast majority of sellers or buyers. Here's why. The tax does not apply to individuals with an adjusted gross income of under $200,000 in the year the sale takes place. Nor does it apply to couples with an AGI below $250,000. The amount a person (or a couple) makes on the sale is not included in the income calculation. That rule alone eliminates the tax on more than 97 percent of tax returns. Even if the seller exceeds the income limit, the tax only applies to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself. That's why it's not a sales tax, as it's sometimes characterized. Finally, the first $250,000 in profit is excluded from the new tax. For couples, the first $500,000 in profit is excluded. To put that in perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported in June that the typical home was selling for $182,600 in May 2012. That's sale price, not profit. So if a couple bought a $100,000 home years ago and they sell it in 2013 for tens of millions of dollars, the new tax will cost them nothing if their combined adjusted gross income is under a quarter of a million dollars. And if their annual income is in the tens of millions of dollars but their profit on the sale is a half million dollars or less, they will also escape the tax. Cianci repeatedly made it sound as though every seller would have to pay the tax. The new tax does not replace the long-standing capital gains tax on money made from the sale of property. That is still in effect. Our ruling We gave this claim a Pants on Fire when it was a chain e-mail making the rounds earlier this year. It got a Pants on Fire when it first surfaced, in 2010. It has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations as well. Yet Cianci repeated this wild misrepresentation of one aspect of the new health-care law no fewer than four times in 45 seconds. Perhaps he and Gemma, a successful businessman, make enough money to qualify for the tax if they sold their homes at a hefty profit. But for the vast majority of Rhode Islanders, suggesting that this tax applies to them is nonsense. There may be no stains on Cianci's jacket, but there's a blaze in his britches. We rate his claim Pants on Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-02206	The U.S. Justice Department has "taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/23/barack-obama/obama-boasts-about-number-voting-rights-cases-take/	During the week of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, President Barack Obama gave a fiery speech to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network Convention in Manhattan in which he attacked Republicans for leading efforts to pass laws "making it harder, not easier, for people to vote." "We're not going to let voter suppression go unchallenged," Obama said on April 11. "So earlier this week you heard from the attorney general, and there's a reason the agency he runs is called the Department of Justice. They've taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009, and they've defended the rights of everybody, from African-Americans to Spanish speakers to soldiers serving overseas." Obama’s statement that the Justice Department had taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009 was disputed by Hans von Spakovsky, a former DOJ lawyer under President George W. Bush who is now an election law expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Spakovsky wrote in a blog that the Justice Department website showed only 39 such cases under Obama. A reader contacted us about the discrepancy, so we decided to fact-check Obama’s statistic. Voting Rights Act The Voting Rights Act dates back to 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law shortly after signing the Civil Rights Act. The law was intended to prevent denying the right to vote based on race. Section 5 of the law required the federal government to pre-approve some states’ changes to voting laws, affecting mostly states in the South, including parts of Florida. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the pre-approval provision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County vs. Holder case. With states like Florida, Texas and North Carolina passing laws about voter ID or other restrictions, voting rights has emerged as a hot topic and could play a role in 2014 races, including the battle for governor in Florida. To dispute Obama’s number of more than 100 cases, the Heritage Foundation pointed to a DOJ list of voting section litigation cases that included 41 cases filed since 2009. The cases pertain to discrimination, absentee voting overseas and other matters. (We don’t find the difference between 39 and 41 significant -- von Spakovsky said that the case involving the New Black Panther Party was filed in early January, before Obama was inaugurated, so that’s one he didn’t count.) The reason why that DOJ website page shows a much smaller number than the one Obama cited is that the online list represents only cases filed by the Justice Department -- not cases in which the department was a defendant or filed an amicus. Justice spokeswoman Dena Iverson sent PolitiFact a list of voting rights cases in which the voting section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice began its participation after January 21, 2009. That list contains 102 cases. "The list includes all voting rights cases whether the department participated in the case as a plaintiff, a defendant, amicus or otherwise," Iverson said. The list includes cases that have concluded and are pending, as well as cases that are moot due to the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, she said. It does not include cases if they were strictly federal appellate cases or out-of-court settlements reached in 2010 and 2012 under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. So the "more than 100 cases" referenced by Obama refers to a broader list than the one on DOJ’s website cited by Heritage. The list of 102 cases includes about a half-dozen cases involving the state of Florida, including a few in which the state of Florida was the plaintiff. One of the most notable cases is the Justice Department complaint against the state or conducting a purge of its voter registration rolls within 90 days of an election. (A federal appeals court ruled April 1 that Florida violated the law, but by then Secretary of State Ken Detzner had announced he had canceled the next round of the non-citizen purge.) We sent a summary of DOJ’s explanation about the 102 cases to von Spakovsky. "To say that it is a positive development when the department is a defendant in a lawsuit is silly – such an action is not being undertaken because the Department is being aggressive in launching lawsuits to protect voting rights. It is because a state or local jurisdiction has sued the Department claiming DOJ has done something wrong. Under that definition, if DOJ is sued 100 times because of its wrongdoing, this would be a positive development," he told PolitiFact in an email. "This was deceptive claim by the president – to any layman, taking on cases means filing lawsuits to enforce the law on behalf of victims." He also argued that it would be far-fetched to say that filing an amicus brief is "taking on a case." We asked a few other experts what they thought about the cases. Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law school professor, said that DOJ’s explanation was legitimate. "Some of the more significant cases (e.g., DOJ litigating the Texas redistricting from this cycle) involve the DOJ as formal defendant in what used to be a lawsuit under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. And in other cases, having the DOJ as an amicus adds a great deal to the court's resolution of an issue." However, Levitt said that it's difficult to come to any meaningful conclusion just by counting the number of cases. "All cases aren't the same, either in scope or difficulty level. ... And jurisdictions don't infringe in the same ways, at the same rate, across time. Even if the cases were all of the same scope and difficulty, you'd expect the number of cases to rise or drop based on what's actually going on in the states and whether it violated the law," he told PolitiFact. University of California law professor Richard Hasen said that the Justice Department "has faced an interesting and difficult environment in which to bring suits under the Voting Rights Act." The department knew if it was too aggressive under the preclearance part of the law that there was a danger the Supreme Court could strike it down -- which ultimately happened. For other types of suits, most of the low-hanging fruit was gone by the time Obama took office. Since the Shelby decision, the Justice Department has brought two significant suits trying to get North Carolina and Texas covered again by a preclearance rule. "These cases are quite significant, and if they are successful they likely will spur other suits in this area," Hasen said. "I'd say that in evaluating significance, it is not just the number of suits but the nature of the suits which matter." Our ruling Obama said the Justice Department has "taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009." Obama’s statement was somewhat vague, because he didn’t explain during his speech what he meant by "taken on" cases. Some listeners could have interpreted that to mean all cases in which the department was the plaintiff. That's not the case though; the Justice Department has a list of 102 cases that include instances in which the department is the plaintiff, the defendant or played some other role.

pomt-05146	Since President Barack Obama took office, "you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation" earning over $170,000.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/21/eric-hovde/under-obama-1700-transportation-workers-eclipse-17/	Political newcomer Eric Hovde has introduced himself to Wisconsin voters with television and radio ads that largely criticize how Uncle Sam handles money. In a June 12, 2012 interview, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate hammered away some more at that theme, singling out President Barack Obama. "The only people that are getting wealthy, or doing well, are in government," Hovde told conservative radio talk show host Vicki McKenna, whose show airs in Milwaukee and Madison. "I think you had only one person in the (U.S.) Department of Transportation making $170,000 a year going back four years ago and now, under President Obama, you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation making over a 170 grand." Hit the brakes. Hovde hedges a bit on the first part of his statement, but he’s claiming that since Obama took office, the number of federal transportation employees earning more than $170,000 per year went from nearly none to 1,700. That’s quite a jump. Let’s get under the hood for some analysis. Michele Bachmann In 2011, two other fact-checking operations examined a statement by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn, that is similar to Hovde’s. The Washington Post Fact Checker evaluated Bachmann’s claim that only one DOT employee made $170,000 a year "at the beginning of the recession. We had the trillion-dollar stimulus, and 18 months into the recession, we had 1,690 employees making over $170,000." The Fact Checker noted that Bachmann’s claim almost exactly quoted a December 2009 article in USA Today, which reported on an increase in the number of all federal workers earning more than $100,000 since the recession started in December 2007. When we asked Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing for evidence to back Hovde’s claim, he cited the same sentence from the article, which said: "When the recession started, the Transportation Department had only one person earning a salary of $170,000 or more. Eighteen months later, 1,690 employees had salaries above $170,000." Lansing noted the statistic was also repeated in Stealing You Blind, a July 2011 book published by conservative Regnery Publishing. But as The Fact Checker pointed out, USA Today made it clear that the recession began under President George W. Bush -- and that Bush had recommended across-the-board raises for federal employees. Those raises, after getting through Congress, resulted in boosts of 3 percent in January 2008 and 3.9 percent in January 2009. The Fact Checker concluded "it is clear that the bulk of the new salaries were instituted before (Obama) took office." The University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org also said Bachmann wrongly blamed Obama in her claim, concluding that at least two-thirds of the DOT employees were receiving more than $170,000 before Obama took office. We also asked the Obama administration to respond to Hovde’s claim. Moira Mack, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said there were 1,699 transportation employees who earned more than $170,000 when Obama took office. Nearly all worked in the Federal Aviation Administration, primarily in flight control towers. Mack said that as of December 2011, the number had risen to 2,464. She attributed the increase of 765 employees during Obama’s tenure to the Bush-led across-the-board pay increases as well as a collective bargaining agreement for air traffic controllers, signed under Obama, that provided 3 percent raises in 2010, 2011 and 2012. When we pointed out the two fact checks and the OMB’s information to Lansing, he said Hovde’s main point is that the number of federal employees is "exploding" and their pay has gone up under Obama. Our rating Hovde said that since Obama took office, "you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation" earning over $170,000. Actually, there were that many federal transportation workers earning over $170,000 a year when Obama took office, largely as the result of raises pushed by President Bush.

pomt-04358	"Veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-touts-his-record-improving-employment/	During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Barack Obama touted his accomplishments on getting unemployed veterans back to work. "What I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it’s time to do some nation building here at home," Obama said. "And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans -- rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place. "You know, I was having lunch with a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances," Obama continued. "When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we’ve said is let’s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office." We wondered if Obama had his statistics correct. We looked at data on veterans’ employment compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans -- all veterans, as well as those who have specifically served in the post-Sept. 11, 2011, armed forces. While Obama didn’t specify what type of veterans he was referring to, the context suggests he was referring to post-9/11 veterans. The statistics for all veterans Unemployment rate for all veterans, January 2009: 7.4 percent Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he’s wrong. Unemployment rate for all veterans, September 2012: 6.7 percent Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent Obama had said veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he’s right. The statistics for post-9/11 veterans only Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, January 2009: 8.9 percent Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he’s right. Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, September 2012: 9.7 percent Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent Obama had said veterans unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he’s wrong. Tallying the results So, whichever measure you use, Obama’s formulation was half-right. We should also note, as we have in the past, that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation’s labor market is sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a bigger impact on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed at boosting veterans’ employment. Our ruling Obama said, "Veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office." Whether you’re talking about all veterans or just those who served after 9/11, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-04039	Says Chuck Hagel has called for "an end to our nuclear program."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/30/americans-strong-defense/chuck-hagel-has-called-end-our-nuclear-program-say/	The United States faces terrifying threats from foreign countries, but Chuck Hagel, the nominee for defense secretary, wants to close up our nuclear shop, says Americans for a Strong Defense, a group formed to oppose Hagel’s nomination. "We live in a dangerous world," says the narrator in an ad that ran shortly before the Jan. 31 hearings were set to begin. "Iran. North Korea. Even Russia." Ominous news coverage mentions "brand new threats from Iran aimed squarely at the United States," North Korea launching a "long-range missile" and Russia "test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile." The narrator continues: "But Barack Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense wants America to back down. An end to our nuclear program. Devastating defense cuts. A weaker country." We wanted to explore whether Hagel, a former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska, supports "an end to our nuclear program." Americans for a Strong Defense launched the ad to run in five states: Arkansas, Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana and North Carolina, where Democratic senators are up for re-election in 2014. The group has Republican ties; board members include Romney advisors Brian Hook and Danny Diaz. Maurico Claver-Carone, author of the Capitol Hill Cubans blog, is also a board member. The group is one of a handful of conservative groups attacking Hagel. We have previously fact-checked other claims about Hagel’s positions on Iran and sanctions, including one by the Emergency Committee for Israel and by U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami. Global Zero Many of the attacks on Hagel’s positions about nuclear weapons relate to a May 2012 report he co-wrote for Global Zero, which describes itself as an "international movement for the elimination of all nuclear weapons." It has drawn support from hundreds of world leaders, including President Barack Obama. (Hagel doesn’t have a paid job with Global Zero.) This is not a peacenik report from the tie-dye set advocating getting rid of the defense department or all weapons. The co-authors included high-level security and international experts: General James Cartwright, a former commander of the U.S. nuclear forces under President George W. Bush; Richard Burt, a former U.S. chief nuclear arms negotiator; Thomas R. Pickering, a former ambassador to Russia; and Gen. John J. Sheehan, who held senior NATO positions. The report called for nuclear weapon reductions in the United States and Russia and negotiating with other countries to reduce their arsenals. It outlines a goal of having no more than 900 nuclear weapons within 10 years in the United States. That would be an 80 percent reduction, said Bruce Blair, co-founder of Global Zero and study director, in an interview with PolitiFact. The authors argued that the United States’ large nuclear stockpiles aren’t a reliable way to deter or defeat terrorists. An example: 9/11. Our stockpile "proved utterly powerless" to deter or respond to the attack. "In fact, strong conventional forces and missile defenses may offer a far superior option for deterring and defeating a regional aggressor," they wrote. The report does mention the long-term goal of "total elimination" of nuclear weapons -- a 2010 Global Zero plan identified that goal for the year 2030. The 2012 report mentions the option of pursuing elimination of nuclear weapons unilaterally but calls that "the less good approach." The report focuses more on working together with Russia and pursuing a multilateral approach: "Nuclear arms regulation must become comprehensive and universal." The report also criticizes the current "launch-ready" postures, which give the president potentially mere minutes to decide about launching an attack, and calls for waiting 24 to 72 hours to strike. Blair told PolitiFact in an interview that the goal is to "ensure that no other country has nuclear weapons to threaten us or any of our allies. ... The goal is really to set the bar at zero for everyone." Global Zero sent us a statement by Hagel’s co-authors emphasizing that they called for bilateral reductions with Russia and multilateral negotiations. "The suggestion that we naively believe that the elimination of nuclear weapons can be achieved easily or in short order is likewise false. We, again, have clearly stated in our many reports and statements that this cannot be achieved quickly nor easily. It will take decades of painstaking work, including the establishment of a verification regime with universal, intrusive inspections," the statement said. Americans for a Strong Defense also cited additional, similar comments of Hagel’s, urging the United States to move toward world elimination of nuclear weapons. Other experts The experts we interviewed about reducing nuclear weapons said that Hagel’s views represent the bipartisan mainstream among nuclear and security experts, and that the United States can safely reduce its nuclear arsenal. The Global Zero report’s recommendations would lower nuclear risks to the United States, said nuclear proliferation expert and Harvard professor Matthew Bunn in an email to PolitiFact. "Why that isn't something to be celebrated in a Secretary of Defense is beyond me. It mentions the possibility of elimination of nuclear weapons only briefly, as a long-term objective; every President since Eisenhower (except George W. Bush) has embraced the goal of prohibition of nuclear weapons in a similar way — ironically, Ronald Reagan was perhaps even more of an enthusiast for nuclear disarmament than Barack Obama." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that the ad creates a misleading impression about the threat the U.S. faces. "What the ad is not explaining is that North Koreans have no more than 10 nuclear bombs and don’t have the capability of delivering those bombs across the Pacific U.S.," he said. "The Iranians at this point thankfully don’t have any nuclear weapons. It implies those counties have something they could hit us with -- something nuclear -- and they don’t." Our ruling The ad paints a picture of a "dangerous world" in which countries including Iran and North Korea are ready to attack the United States, while Hagel wants to back down and put "an end to our nuclear program." The ad leaves viewers with the false impression that Hagel wants to quickly shutter our nuclear program -- regardless of the nuclear ambitions of other countries, including our foes. Hagel has called for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons, but with some major caveats the ad ignores. He is a supporter of Global Zero, which has called for worldwide elimination by 2030. The report he co-authored calls for reducing the U.S. stockpile to 900 nuclear warheads by 2022, but it says that the best way to achieve that reduction is together with Russia and other countries.

pomt-13575	"Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president ..."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/22/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-wrongly-says-richard-nixon-released-tax-/	Tim Kaine has been goading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to release his tax returns to the public, just as the Democratic ticket did recently. Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said Trump’s refusal to release his forms is a break from past GOP nominees, including one who Kaine said was not known for his ethics. "Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president because he said, as has every major party nominee of both parties since, the American public have a right to see my tax returns," Kaine told a crowd during a Manchester, N.H., rally on Aug. 13. We weren’t aware that Nixon released his tax returns while he was on the campaign trail. So we asked the Hillary Clinton campaign where Kaine got the information for that statement. Sarah Peck, the Virginia director of communications for the Clinton campaign, pointed us to news articles and other sources about Nixon’s tax disclosures. We also looked at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has compiled tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees. On the group’s website, you’ll find copies of Nixon’s tax returns from 1969 through 1972. But there’s a catch. Those returns were not released while Nixon was running for president. They were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected. At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings. Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, a function of having secured a large deduction for donating his vice presidential papers to the National Archives, said Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts. To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation despite the fact that the president was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us. So Nixon did indeed release his full tax returns as president. Did he ever do that while he was running for that office? Nixon ran for president three times, so let’s go back a bit further in history. Peck pointed us to a 1984 story in The New York Times, which noted that in his successful 1968 campaign for the presidency, Nixon released a brief summary of his financial affairs. In the 1968 nominating contest, Nixon faced a field of GOP candidates that included Michigan Gov. George Romney. Romney, whose son Mitt was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, released a dozen years of his tax returns to Look magazine, according to a Bloomberg column written by Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia. "Look (magazine) then went to Nixon, who proved distinctly less forthcoming. He permitted a writer to inspect photocopies of his returns, but only three years’ worth," Mihm wrote. The history professor added that the issue didn’t come up during the general election campaign, because Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey also refused to release his tax returns. Mihm told us that Look magazine merely summarized selected information from Nixon’s returns, rather than publishing the documents themselves. "I suppose one could argue that Nixon gave a journalist access to his returns, but that’s not the same thing as releasing them," Mihm wrote in an email. Thorndike also told us that Nixon’s limited disclosure in that instance wouldn’t really count as the candidate releasing his tax returns to the public. A reporter was able to look at them but wasn’t allowed to keep a copy of them, Thorndike noted. "In my book, that would not count as releasing your tax returns, because the whole crowd source thing is a big part of it," Thorndike said. We couldn’t find any record of Nixon releasing tax returns during his two other runs for the presidency - in 1960, against John F. Kennedy, or in his 1972 re-election bid against George McGovern. Thorndike said that, to his knowledge, Nixon didn’t release his returns during those campaigns. Mihm also told us he’s not aware of Nixon releasing his tax returns during any of his presidential campaigns. Still, Thorndike said Nixon’s presidential tax return disclosure, while he was president in 1973, did start a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public. Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns publicly but instead provided a summary of his taxes. But Jimmy Carter did publicly release his tax returns while running against Ford in 1976. In fact, every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, Thorndike said. Our ruling Kaine said, "Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president ..." Nixon never released his tax returns during a presidential campaign. But there is a kernel of truth in Kaine’s statement. Nixon released his full returns when he already was president, to quell controversy over his taxes. Also while running in 1968, he allowed a reporter to examine his returns, but beyond that limited circumstance, there’s no record that Nixon opened his tax forms to the general public. While Kaine’s statement has an element of truth, it ignores facts that would create a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e5913d6f-75bb-4d4e-bb5b-c112a9635685	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-08-22T10:18:49	2016-08-13	['Richard_Nixon']
pomt-12350	"Edward Snowden: Osama bin Laden is still alive living in the Bahamas."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/12/antinews/years-old-story-edward-snowden-can-prove-osama-bin/	A fake news story that said former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had proof that terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was enjoying a taxpayer-funded lifetime vacation in the Caribbean has resurfaced after several years. "Edward Snowden: Osama bin Laden is still alive living in the Bahamas," read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on AntiNews.in, a repository of wild-eyed conspiracy stories. It was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news. The post said Snowden told the Moscow Tribune that instead of killing the al-Qaida leader in May 2011, the United States set him up with a cushy retirement fund through the CIA payroll. As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with "five of his wives and many children" collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account. "Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time," Snowden is allegedly quoted as saying. "What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him." We could find no evidence that Snowden, who leaked classified information about the federal government’s surveillance programs, has ever said such a thing about bin Laden. Snowden fled to Moscow to avoid espionage charges and has since given several interviews, but this post is fake. Versions of the story have appeared on many other websites over the last several months. But it originated on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a parody website we’ve identified on our list of dubious news sources, way back on Aug. 25, 2015. The site’s disclaimer noted that "WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle." The site’s stories are fabricated. As far as we can tell, the Moscow Tribune is not even a real media outlet, although there are Twitter and Facebook accounts under that name that do share news stories (the paper in Moscow, Idaho, is called the Daily News). The version of the post on AntiNews.in also cited a Dec. 31, 2015, post on a site called NaijaPicks.com, which said it worked "to keep you informed on what's going on in Nigeria, Africa and the world over." The post also included real quotes from Snowden reported in The Guardian newspaper in 2013.

pomt-06967	"95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated in the [Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal] report at all."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/15/shirley-franklin/ex-mayor-franklin-says-small-percent-educators-nam/	Former Mayor Shirley Franklin won’t let a cheating scandal of historic proportions darken her sunny assessment of Atlanta’s Public Schools. Franklin said that ex-APS Superintendent Beverly Hall, whom investigators implicated in the cheating, left the district "significantly better than she found it." Pants on Fire, we ruled. The day after our ruling became public, Franklin told WXIA 11 Alive that she stands by her comments, and critics need to put the controversy in perspective. Cheating took place at some 40 schools, she said, but an investigative report on the scandal implicated only a small percentage of the district’s educators. "95 percent of the teachers and the principals are not implicated in the report at all," Franklin told reporter Jennifer Leslie on Saturday. "There are 3,000 teachers and principals, and this report says that about 5 percent were involved in this." Only 5 percent? What about investigators’ conclusion that the cheating was "widespread"? PolitiFact Georgia hunted for answers. The report, released July 5, found that cheating took place on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, a set of standardized tests administered across Georgia. Typically given in first through eighth grade, they’re designed to determine how well students meet state curriculum standards. The report implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, in the cheating scandal. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined. Time magazine called it "likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date." We contacted Franklin, who told us in a voice mail that the numbers she used in the TV interview were from news accounts, but did not give specifics. The Truth-O-Meter soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia used an internal Atlanta Journal-Constitution database, state and federal data, and information from APS’ website to check Franklin’s claim. According to the AJC’s database and state and federal figures, there are some 4,000 educators in the district, which means that about 5 percent of the district’s educators were implicated. Franklin’s arithmetic is correct, but we noticed some holes in her approach. Franklin’s calculation includes high school educators, but the CRCT is given only to students in grades 1 through 8. Also, Franklin’s number lumps teachers with principals and does not consider the number of schools involved. We took these factors into account and made our own calculations. They led us to very different conclusions. Cheating may have been limited among the rank and file, but the numbers show it was commonplace among school leadership. Some 2,370 teachers handle students in grades 1 through 8, according to AJC’s database. The report implicated 140 of them, or about 6 percent. Principals are a different story. A recent APS list shows 70 of them at the district’s elementary and middle schools. Thirty-eight of them were implicated, or 54 percent. Investigators found cheating in 44 out of 70 elementary and middle schools, which amounts to 63 percent. It’s also worth noting that a top cheating investigator warned Monday that the true percentage of educators involved is very likely higher than the numbers in the report suggest. A "wall of silence" among school employees made it difficult to identify all of those involved, former Attorney General Mike Bowers said. This news makes Franklin’s claim that only a small percent of educators were implicated "at all" appear too clear-cut. So, how do we rule? The arithmetic behind the number Franklin uses in her claim that "95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated . . . at all" is accurate. But the impression she gives -- that if you put the cheating in perspective, only a small percent of the district is tainted -- ignores crucial context. More than half of the district’s middle and elementary school principals were implicated, and cheating took place at nearly two-thirds of APS schools. These percentages may be lower than the true number of cheaters. Franklin cherry-picked a number that supported her point, leaving out important details and taking things out of context. Her claim therefore meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.	None	Shirley Franklin	None	None	None	2011-07-15T06:00:00	2011-07-09	['None']
pomt-00120	Says the Washington Post fact-checked a charge he opposed pre-existing condition protections for health insurance "and gave that Four Pinocchios."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/28/peter-roskam/roskam-fibs-about-facts-and-fact-checks-his-health/	In their final televised debate ahead of the November midterms, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam of Wheaton and Democratic challenger Sean Casten tussled over a wide range of disagreements and accusations, but one about health care policy stood out. Roskam, seeking a seventh term in his west suburban district, was asked by debate moderator Carol Marin of WTTW to reconcile repeated votes to repeal Obamacare with his claim that he strongly supports insurance safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions. "Well, like many people have said, let’s take the good things out of it and embrace those and shun the bad things. And that’s exactly what we did," Roskam responded, referring to a Republican substitute for Obamacare that was narrowly defeated. "Sean has falsely accused me of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios." Did fact checkers at the Washington Post indeed side with Roskam? And has Roskam always championed those pre-existing protections, as he claimed? The short answer is "no." No such fact check exists. PolitiFact and Washington Post fact checkers have also determined that the Republican health plan Roskam backed would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The longer answer involves a concerted effort by several congressional Republicans, as well as President Donald Trump, to misleadingly recast the GOP as defenders of one of the most popular elements of the very health care law that they have attempted to dismantle for years. Playing with Pinocchios First a word about Pinocchios. Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker use a different rating system than PolitiFact’s "Truth-O-Meter" to measure degrees of distortion and mendacity, with Four Pinocchios being the worst rating someone can receive. "Egad," was the initial response from Glenn Kessler, the Post’s lead fact checker, when we notified him about Roskam’s claim to have been exonerated by the paper. Kessler told us no such fact check exists. At the same time, he pointed to recent Four Pinocchio ratings he had given to Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, and Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, for making essentially the same claim Roskam made. Since we first contacted Kessler, he has told followers on Twitter that at least three other Republican House members have joined Denham, Brat and Roskam in repeating the false assertion, among them Rep. Rodney Davis, who is locked in a tight re-election battle in the central Illinois 13th District. Kessler called them all out on Twitter following our inquiry. "Lawmakers, if you voted for AHCA, defend your decision, but do not try to hide behind our Pinocchios," he wrote after quoting Roskam specifically. [From the Washington Post: These Republicans are misleading voters about our Obamacare fact checks] In support of Roskam’s claim, the Republican’s campaign pointed us to a Washington Post fact check of a statement from Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California that took her to task for significantly inflating the number of people with pre-existing conditions that would be put at risk by the GOP plan, called the American Health Care Act. It passed the House but died in the Senate last year. That’s the same fact check Denham erroneously cited. Nowhere does the piece about Harris credit the Republican substitute health plan backed by Roskam and the others with protecting pre-existing conditions. Indeed, Kessler authored a more recent piece likening the GOP pledge to protect pre-existing conditions to former President Barack Obama’s unsustainable promise that under Obamacare, "if you like your plan, you can keep it." In 2013, PolitiFact named that Obama promise its Lie of the Year. PolitiFact recently revisited the pre-existing condition coverage debate, explaining why Republican proposals on pre-existing conditions are inferior to those contained in Obamacare. Like Obamacare, the GOP plan guaranteed that those with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage outright. But it would allow for insurers to charge some with pre-existing conditions significantly more for coverage, potentially making policies too expensive to afford. Our ruling Roskam said his Democratic opponent had falsely accused him "of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios." No such fact check exists. Roskam’s campaign did point us to a fact check of a claim made by a Senate Democrat that greatly overestimated the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions who might not be able to access coverage if Obamacare were replaced by GOP substitute. But that fact check had nothing to do with Roskam or his stance. Roskam voted for the substitute, which would have weakened the pre-existing condition protections of Obamacare. We don’t hand out Pinocchios, but we have a similar measure for whoppers like Roskam’s. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-08552	When Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our schools, "I've stood up to them to protect local control."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/30/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-she-stood-local-control-schools/	Florida Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, running as a Democrat for governor, says she's in favor of local control for schools. In a Sept. 17, 2010, TV ad, Sink says: "Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats have no business trying to run our local schools. When they've tried, I've stood up to them to protect local control. And I'll stand up to them again as a parent and as your governor." Education is an important topic for many voters and the bill that Sink based her claim on was one of the most controversial during the Florida Legislature's 2010 session. So it's important for Sink, running for governor, to present herself as a leader on the topic. Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings told us Sept. 27 that Sink was referring to Senate Bill 6 -- the bill that would have overhauled teacher pay and tenure statewide. The bill, pushed by Republicans and strongly opposed by teachers unions and Democrats, was filed in the Senate on March 1. The bill was approved by the Senate on March 24 and the House on April 9. Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill April 15. Keep that timeline in mind -- it's important here when evaluating Sink's claim. We did a Nexis search on Sink and "Senate Bill 6" and the first reference we found was a March 31 news release from Sink's campaign -- one week after the Senate voted in favor of the bill. Sink said in the press release: "These proposals are bad for our children and our state. As a mother whose two children went to Florida public schools, I feel strongly that our local school districts should be the ones making these kinds of decisions for our students and teachers -- not politicians in Tallahassee. I also have a serious problem with placing even more unfunded mandates on our local school districts, as they are already facing significant budget concerns." Jennings sent us a list of newspaper articles and Sink press releases that showed her opposition to Senate Bill 6. Here are excerpts of what Jennings provided, in chronological order: In a press release on April 8 -- one day before the House vote -- Sink stated: "It's clear that the people of Florida don't want Tallahassee politicians dictating a rigid, one-size-fits-all policy to our local school districts. Florida is a diverse state and every classroom is different. As a mother whose two children graduated from Florida's public schools, I strongly believe in preserving local control of local schools." In a press release April 9 -- the day the House voted in favor of the bill -- Sink called on Crist to veto Senate Bill 6 and "stand with the people of Florida against this attempt by Tallahassee politicians to take control away from our local schools. This Tallahassee cram-down is wrong for our children and our state," said Alex Sink. She launched an online petition drive urging Crist to veto the bill. On April 16, the Palm Beach Post stated that Sink rallied more than 16,000 Internet opponents in that online petition drive. So by March 31 -- after the Senate approved it -- Sink clearly opposed Senate Bill 6. She reiterated her opposition April 8 -- the day before the House voted for it and again April 9 when she urged Crist to veto it. But where was Sink earlier? During the first two weeks of March, teachers unions, educators and others statewide were loudly objecting, as seen in numerous news articles and letters to the editor. A brief glance at some big-name voices in the Senate Bill 6 war who publicly opposed the bill before Sink did: The statewide teachers union: The Florida Education Association sent a press release March 8 bashing the bill. A Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article March 3 quoted the FEA's general counsel criticizing the bill and quoted Miami Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat and former educator, opposing the bill. "This is just another attempt to destroy public schools," Wilson was quoted saying. Florida School Boards Association: Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association, opposed the bill by early March. A March 8 Tallahassee Democrat article stated the Leon County School Board watched a video of Blanton in which he said: "I've been doing this 35 years, as you well know, Senate Bill 6 may be one of the worst education bills I've ever seen filed in the history of the Florida Legislature." Broward and Palm Beach school leaders: By March 25, teacher union presidents in Broward and Palm Beach -- two of the larger counties in the state -- voiced opposition, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Pat Santeramo, president of the Broward Teachers Union, called it "probably the worst legislation developed in years. It is just pitiful." Robert Dow, president of the Palm Beach County Classroom Teachers Association, called it "a sledgehammer to public education." On the same day, the Miami Herald quoted Broward Superintendent Jim Notter calling the bill "a crushing blow against our most important employees, our teachers." The people: On March 31, the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald wrote that Crist's office had received 700 calls on the issue the previous week, House lawmakers received hundreds of thousands of e-mails and thousands of phone calls and a Facebook page called "Stop Senate Bill 6" had almost 17,000 supporters. One other question to raise about Sink's claim: Is it fair to say that politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our local schools? For Senate Bill 6, we will define "bureaucrats" as Florida Commissioner of Education Eric J. Smith. The department didn't propose the bill, though Smith was on record as supporting it by March 26. Finally, though Senate Bill 6 failed, politicians and bureaucrats already have quite a bit of say in local schools. Let's name a few examples: state law dictates how many days a year schools must be in session, a range of dates for holding the FCATs and what subjects must be taught. We asked Jennings how much credit Sink should get for opposing the bill a week after the Senate approved it. "Not only did she stand up before the governor made the decision to either sign or veto this bill but before it was passed through both the House and Senate to strongly oppose it, she headed up a citizens' petition where over 12,000 Floridians signed it," Jennings said. So let's review: Sink's ad claims she "stood up" to politicians and bureaucrats "to protect local control." Sink clearly opposed Senate Bill 6 -- proposed by politicians and supported by the Education Commissioner -- which would have led to new teacher standards in schools statewide. But she was late in her opposition -- a week after the Senate voted for it and weeks after unions and educators started their much publicized protest. Thousands of Floridians had weighed in by calling or e-mailing elected officials in Tallahassee by the time Sink spoke up. Sink has omitted important context here, but she did stand up. We rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-09-30T13:11:49	2010-09-17	['None']
pomt-07616	Senate Democrats who left the state for weeks to delay a vote on union bargaining power exercised a "Wisconsin filibuster" provided by the state’s constitution.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/21/chris-larson/wisconsin-state-senator-chris-larson-says-democrat/	In the fall of 2010, Chris Larson was serving in relative obscurity as a member of the Milwaukee County Board. By March 2011, he was a political celebrity, lauded by some -- and vilified by others -- as one of 14 Democratic state senators who fled to Illinois for more than three weeks to thwart a quick vote on Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees. "Today’s Heroes: the Wisconsin 14" trumpeted the national AFL-CIO website. "When are they going to come back? Are they coming back from somewhere downstate? This seems ludicrous," MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews said on his March 9 show, 21 days after the Democrats left. "This is something that happens in a banana republic. When are we going to have a Legislature meeting in Wisconsin and decide this?" As senators on both sides face possible recall elections, Larson is now defending leaving the state not only as the right thing to do -- but as a matter of the lawmakers exercising their state constitutional rights. The Democrats returned March 12 after Republicans removed fiscal items from the bill, allowing them to vote without needing 20 members present -- the 3/5ths quorum requirement that allowed for the departure. There are 19 Republicans in the Senate. Interviewed March 11 at an Illinois rest stop on his way home, Larson told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) television reporter he would do it all again to stall moves by the GOP majority in Madison. "That’s a tool that our constitution gives us," Larson said. "It’s a little bit different than the U.S. filibuster, but it’s the Wisconsin filibuster and that’s how it works." The reporter followed up: "Leaving the state is the new Wisconsin filibuster?" Larson, cracking a brief smile, responded: "It is." Most people are familiar with the filibuster, a legislative tactic common to the U.S. Senate and some state legislatures that allows a minority-party’s objection to stall or kill final action unless a super-majority wants to proceed. In the U.S. Senate, it used to involve round-the-clock speeches but now is a simple procedural maneuver. During the heated and massive Madison protests, we heard some casual references to the boycott as a "filibuster with feet." But did Larson mean to assert that Wisconsin’s Constitution, adopted in 1848, provides for a filibuster? He did, according to his chief of staff, Justin Sargent: "This is in Article 8, Section 8 of the State Constitution. This constitutional filibuster essentially stops passage on a bill that is fiscal, if the body is lacking a 3/5ths quorum. In special session, this is the only defense the minority has to stop or even temporarily delay a bill." Larson himself was less emphatic when we asked him about the filibuster comparison. He said he meant only to draw an analogy between the boycott and a filibuster. We decided to test his claim given the historic nature of the boycott and the prospect it could happen again. Let’s start with what both sides -- and experts -- agree on: Wisconsin by legislative rule does limit debate. But it does not provide for a filibuster by statute, rule or any constitutional provision. Cutting off debate is rare, but it happens. The constitutional section Larson cites requires a 3/5th’s quorum to vote on certain tax and fiscal items -- not to pass the measure, but to act on the measure. It was that provision Democrats took advantage of in staying away. Beyond that, the debate turns to warring legal interpretations. But we can learn from those as well. Lawyers and officials on the Republican side say not only is there no constitutional filibuster, but the Democratic boycott violated the constitutional oath of office and a Senate rule that bars absenteeism without leave. "It’s a grossly frivolous and very dangerous misstatement that they could absent themselves purposely from the body to avoid a quorum," said Jim Troupis, a lawyer who advised Senate Republicans. "If there was no duty to attend, there would be no duty to have a Legislature." This would lead to an executive branch dictatorship, he contended. During the legislative battle, an Oconto County Circuit Court judge ruled that State Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) appeared to be violating a rule that requires senators to attend sessions. But he wrote that it is the Senate -- not the courts -- that enforce those rules. A lawyer who has advised the Democrats, Jeremy Levinson, agreed lawmakers have to show, but said the penalties for absenteeism are so weak that ultimately it is up to voters to decide whether lawmakers have shirked their duty. Levinson argues the constitution, in effect, allows boycotts because it lets legislators make their own rules -- and the rules have not effectively barred such behavior. University of Wisconsin political scientist Donald Downs, a constitutional scholar affiliated with the law school, agreed, with qualifications. "It’s a new constitutional argument," Downs said. "I would say the burden of proof is on him to show it’s a right, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court has been open-minded concerning the power of each house to determine it’s own rules." Labor lawyer and author Tom Geoghegan, a prominent liberal critic of unlimited filibustering, said the boycott move was permitted by the state constitution. "It’s a provision that’s an extra check on the majority just slamming something through," he said. But Andrew Welhouse, spokesman for Republican Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said the quorum requirement was turned on its head by Democrats. "It was originally intended as a way to protect the minority from the majority by making sure that a proper number of officials were there to do business, not enable the minority to stand in the way of the majority," he said. Looking back into history, what was the original stated purpose of the provision requiring 20 senators in attendance? The constitutional provision dates to Wisconsin’s statehood in 1848 and was modeled after a New York state provision. In a later discussion at the New York constitutional convention of 1915, it was said that a 3/5th’s quorum approach "was designed to prevent hasty and careless legislation and to insure a larger attendance when a bill was to be voted upon," according to documents archived by the New York State Library. Indeed, the Wisconsin boycott that would follow nearly a century later is an echo of sorts to concerns raised at the time. Opponents of the super quorum "argued that a small minority merely by refusing to make an appearance could obstruct a vote and defeat legislation." (italics added) So those are some of the arguments. Let’s get to the nub of the matter. Was the Democrats’ move a "constitutional filibuster" that’s only a little bit different than the U.S. Senate filibuster, as Larson said? The general idea is the same -- a procedural mechanism for stalling a vote. But it’s not a filibuster, said Geoghegan, as well as Mordecai Lee, a former Democratic state senator from Milwaukee. Closer to a filibuster, Lee said, was the 61-hour debate that Assembly Democrats forced on Walker’s budget-repair bill. Lester Pines, an attorney for the Madison teachers union, said the boycott delayed the vote, but he agreed that the Wisconsin Constitution "wasn’t intended to provide a filibuster." He called the Democrats’ action "civil disobedience." We asked Larson to explain why, if the action was provided for in the constitution, he and the others had to leave the state to exercise a Wisconsin constitutional right. He said the Democrats were just being "extra safe" because Republicans appeared to have the ability to compel attendance but it was unclear to what lengths they would go and what the legalities were. Court rulings are lacking on whether they could have stayed in state and avoided being forced back to the Capitol, he said. Of course, by noting they could have been compelled to return, Larson undermines the main argument that they were free to leave. Where does all this leave us? Larson attaches a clever label to the three-week Democratic boycott, calling it the "Wisconsin filibuster" and saying the state constitution explicitly gives senators that tool. Like the U.S. filibuster, the Dems’ move was a procedural tactic to delay a vote. But that’s about where the similarities end. There is no dispute -- even among Democrats -- that Wisconsin lacks a filibuster provision used in other states and in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, Democrats felt shaky enough about their legal ground that they left the state to avoid being compelled to return to Madison. The quorum provision in the constitution did create an opening for the Democrats to no-show. So, in that sense, Larson is correct that the constitution "gave" them a tool to delay the vote. But a critical fact that would give a different impression is left out: Wisconsin has no filibuster provision. That’s a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09684	Maj. Nidal Hasan, the man accused of the Fort Hood shootings, "was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/13/chain-email/chain-e-mail-links-supected-fort-hood-shooter-obam/	Since the shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Nov. 5, 2009, we've been inundated with e-mails about a purported link between President Barack Obama's administration and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist suspected of the shootings. Here are a few lines from one of the many versions of the e-mail we received: "It’s been a pretty incredible week and I don’t mean in a good way. But today we have been given a glimpse into the New World Order and it’s pretty scary," the e-mail begins. After complaining that Obama is pursuing a Muslim agenda, the e-mail says, "Did you know that Major Hassan was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration? No? Neither did I until my wife found information on line and followed the evidence to the source documents!" Our friends over at National Public Radio already checked out a version of this claim. The rumor, NPR concluded, started with Jerome Corsi, a writer for World Net Daily and author of The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality . The e-mails we were sent linked to the Corsi story as well. "Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the alleged shooter in yesterday's massacre at Fort Hood, played a homeland security advisory role in President Barack Obama's transition into the White House, according to a key university policy institute document," Corsi wrote. (We've checked three Corsi claims before and rated two False and one Pants on Fire.) The story links to a document published by the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., titled "Thinking Anew—Security Priorities for the Next Administration." It is the proceedings from a series of meetings of the organization's Presidential Task Force. On page 29 of the paper, Hasan is listed as a participant; he was one of more than 300 officials, reporters and Capitol Hill aides who signed up for the conference. In a statement, the think tank confirmed that the Hasan listed as a participant is the same Hasan accused of the Fort Hood shootings. But the statement also makes an important point: Hasan registered for the event on his own. He was not invited, and he attended only as an audience member in his capacity as a psychiatry fellow at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine. "All of these events were open to the public," the statement reads. "At no time has Nidal Hasan been affiliated with [the Homeland Security Policy Institute] or The George Washington University." So, Hasan chose to attend a conference relevant to his field, much like a doctor would attend a conference about diabetes, for example. But here's the more important point: The task force has nothing to do with the White House, according to Sharon Cardash, associate director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute. "HSPI's Presidential Transition Task Force is not and was not affiliated at all with the White House," she wrote us in an e-mail. "The Task Force was created prior to the election; and was not formed at the request of any administration." Indeed, HSPI established the transition task force in April 2008, before Obama was in office, let alone the Democratic presidential nominee. In a city where policy papers are published nearly every day, the work done by the group no more advised the Obama administration than any of the other papers that came out before or after GWU's. Corsi actually makes this point farther down in his story, which contradicts his headline: "While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity." And in an editor's note to the story, Corsi writes that, "Hasan is being reported as a participant in the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute's Presidential Transition Task Force, not as a member, noting the group was a university think-tank, not part of the Obama administration official transition team." But it appears that disclaimer came later, and that it failed to stop the avalanche of e-mails spreading the inaccurate report. Hasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was "an ADVISOR" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House. Another chain e-mail, another Pants on Fire!

pomt-00010	Says VA doctors are "censored from being able to talk to their patients" about marijuana, even in states where it is legal for medicinal use	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/09/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwins-claim-va-doctors-are-censore/	Legalized marijuana is gaining momentum in Wisconsin and nationwide after the Nov. 6, 2018 election, but U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says it remains off the menu for veterans. Baldwin, who was elected to a second term, has said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug under federal law, a category for drugs that have "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." Baldwin said veterans groups have told her they want the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to be allowed to research the medical benefits of marijuana and they want VA doctors to be able to talk about it. "(Doctors) are gagged right now, if that’s the right word," Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018, interview on "Devil’s Advocates," a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. "They’re muzzled, or censored, from being able to talk to their patients about the potential beneficial qualities if they were to use medicinal cannabis, and we’re trying to change that." Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Does that mean VA doctors can’t even discuss the drug? Let’s check it out. Marijuana, veterans are key issues Veterans were a central issue in Baldwin’s race against Republican Leah Vukmir, who criticized Baldwin’s inaction after whistleblowers reported concerns at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 2014. Some veterans had dubbed the facility "Candy Land," due to the widespread distribution of opioids, which led to the 2014 death of a former U.S. Marine. Baldwin disciplined top aides for the response to the whistleblowers and has since co-sponsored legislation to toughen opioid prescription guidelines and push education for VA providers. And marijuana has proven a winning issue in this election cycle. Michigan voters approved recreational marijuana on Tuesday, and Missouri and Utah legalized medical marijuana. North Dakota voters rejected what would have been the nation’s most permissive recreational use law. In Wisconsin, 16 counties and two cities had advisory referendums on marijuana-related questions. More than 70 percent of voters in Milwaukee and Dane counties said Wisconsin should legalize marijuana for recreational use, and in the city of Waukesha, 77 percent were in favor of legalizing marijuana for medical use. VA won’t dispense, recommend marijuana Marijuana straddles an awkward line between federal and state policy. It remains illegal per federal law, but 33 states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And veterans are using marijuana for their ailments. A study based on a 2014 survey found about 9 percent of veterans in the U.S. reported using marijuana in the previous year — roughly the same as the general population. About 41 percent reported using it for medical reasons -- a rate more than double the national average. The VA says its health care providers are limited by federal law and can’t recommend, prescribe or help veterans obtain marijuana — regardless of what state the facility is in. An information sheet on the department’s website details those restrictions, noting the VA also will not pay for medical marijuana prescriptions or allow marijuana use or possession at a VA medical center. But the sheet says the topic is not forbidden. "VA providers can and do discuss marijuana use with veterans as part of comprehensive care planning, and adjust treatment plans as necessary," the sheet says. "Veterans are encouraged to discuss marijuana use with their VA providers." It also notes veterans will not be denied VA benefits because of marijuana use and that providers will record marijuana use in the confidential medical record to have it available for treatment planning. A Baldwin spokesperson defended her claim, saying the bans have a chilling effect. "There is a clear prohibition on recommending or prescribing medical marijuana in the VA policy, which suppresses the ability of doctors to talk to veterans about all of their potential treatment options," said Kasey Hampton, Baldwin’s spokeswoman. Our rating Baldwin said VA doctors "are censored" from talking to patients about the benefits of marijuana. But the evidence her office cites relates only to VA bans on recommending or prescribing the drug. And VA guidelines explicitly encourage veterans to discuss marijuana use with providers. There’s an element of truth to Baldwin’s claim — since those discussions are presumably limited by the restrictions the VA imposes — but there is no evidence of censorship. That’s our definition of Mostly False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-11-09T06:00:00	2018-09-14	['None']

pomt-00548	"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-gdp-never-negative-ter/	During his rambling presidential announcement speech, real estate developer and television personality Donald Trump took on many, many targets. One of those was economic growth under President Barack Obama. "The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero." For starters, Trump didn’t even phrase his claim correctly. He said that "our gross domestic product … was below zero." Real gross domestic product was in the trillions of dollars -- not anywhere close to zero. He meant growth in GDP. But even phrased appropriately, his claim is wrong. (Trump's staff did not return inquiries from PolitiFact.) The real annualized change in gross domestic product during the first quarter of 2015 was indeed negative -- it fell by 0.7 percent. But "never below zero"? That’s way off. Negative GDP growth -- in other words, GDP shrinkage -- from quarter to quarter is one of the hallmarks of a recession. And there have been lots of recessions over the years -- 11 since World War II. The first year the government calculated the change in GDP from quarter to quarter was 1947. We looked back and found no fewer than 42 quarters over that period in which GDP shrank on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis. That’s roughly 15 percent of the time. Here’s a summary of how frequently this has happened historically: Year Quarters of negative GDP growth that year 1947 2 1949 3 1953 2 1954 1 1956 2 1957 2 1958 1 1959 1 1960 2 1969 1 1970 2 1973 1 1974 3 1975 1 1980 2 1981 2 1982 2 1990 1 1991 1 2001 2 2008 3 2009 2 2011 1 2014 1 2015 1 We should also note that the poor first quarter of 2015 may not end up as a negative quarter once the final revisions are made. In a couple of weeks, the government will release a final number that takes into account new and complete data, and it’s currently so close to zero that it’s possible it could slip into positive territory. It’s also worth noting that this quarterly figure should be taken with some caution. "This estimate does not suggest a recession," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University. "We've had a weird pattern in the last few years of weak first quarter estimates." Some analysts have chalked these up to unusually harsh winters that seasonal adjustments weren’t strong enough to iron out. The general rule of thumb is that it takes two quarters of negative growth to signal a recession. Finally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we’ll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents. Our ruling Trump said that in "the last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero." He messes up his economic terms; the gross domestic product was not "zero." And the growth in the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years. That’s a lot more than "never."

pomt-02095	"Virtually no Republican" in Washington accepts climate change science.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/18/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-virtually-no-republican-believes-/	More than 1,500 wildfires have ravaged California so far in 2014, more than twice the state sees in an average year. On ABC’s This Week, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, cited scientific research that links the increased number of fires to the state’s changing climate. Host George Stephanopoulos asked Brown how he’d adapt to the future, given skepticism among Republicans in Washington. Short answer: not easily. "That's a challenge," Brown said. "It is true that there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous. I mean there is no scientific question. There's just political denial for various reasons, best known to those people who are in denial." Brown then pivoted away from Washington to say that "we here in California are on the front lines, we got to deal with it." PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at how Republicans in Congress perceive climate change. We are focusing on Republicans in Washington because that’s how the question to Brown was framed. Republicans more skeptical about climate change Recent national polls say that Republican voters are less likely than Democrats and independents to believe humans cause global warming. Among Republicans, tea party Republicans are even less likely to accept the science than the party base. Among current Republicans in Congress, a group of 278, we were able to find many examples of politicians questioning climate change science to some degree. Most recently, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made waves for denying a link between human activity and climate change. "I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it," Rubio told Jonathan Karl on ABC’s This Week May 11. "And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy." That’s in line with other prominent Republicans, such as House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Organizing for Action, a group that backs President Barack Obama, published a lengthy list of climate change deniers in Congress, with evidence to back each one. Still others, like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have notably changed on the issue, even after co-authoring legislation to address the issue. Republicans who say they believe the science We found relatively few Republican members of Congress who accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made. Brown’s office didn’t return our request for comment, so we are unable to compare our evidence to any that he might have. Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y.: Grimm was a notable skeptic until April 2014, when he told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, "The mass majority of respected scientists say that it’s conclusive, the evidence is clear. So I don’t think the jury is out. There’s no question that, you know, the oceans have risen, right? And the climate change part is, is a real part of it." Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: Collins worked with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., on a climate change bill in 2009 that proposed an alternative to cap-and-trade cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.: "I am one senator who thinks climate change is a problem, humans are causing it, and we need to deal with it," he said at an Environment and Public Works Committee hearing in 2009. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.: He’s called climate change a "long-term concern." Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.: "Climate change is a global challenge that must be addressed with a global solution," he said in 2007 as he backed a climate change provision in a House bill. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: "I accept the fact that we as a country, and we as a world, need to address this issue," he said on the Senate floor in 2008. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.: When asked if he thought global warming was man-made, he said, "I’m not denying that." Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J.: "Do I believe in climate change? I do, yeah," he told National Journal in 2011. "With the weather patterns over the past five years. … What causes it? Quite honestly, I don’t know. … Humans have some effect on climate change. There’s so many factors." That’s eight out of 278, or about 3 percent. Are there others? It’s possible. Not every member of Congress has taken a clear stance on climate change, and we can’t read people’s minds. If we find more examples, we’ll update our list. Former Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., told PolitiFact that the number of Republicans like himself who stand by climate change science has been shrinking in recent years, due to a more polarized Congress. "There used to be a lot more of us," said Greenwood, who serves on the board of directors for the National Audubon Society. "A lot of us were very green in our voting records. That has changed. I think it's part of the phenomenon of the polarization of the Congress." Agreeing with climate change science also could be a political liability for Republicans. In 2010, South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis lost a Republican primary to tea party challenger Trey Gowdy. Inglis blamed his loss, in part, over his belief in climate science. Inglis has since formed the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, a conservative group that agrees with climate change science. Energy and Enterprise Initiative spokesman Price Atkinson said Republicans support efforts to reduce CO2 emissions but criticize the way Obama and Democrats want to go about it. "There are many Republicans in Washington who accept, understand and agree with sound science regarding climate change, but it's the way forward that is more difficult for my fellow conservatives," Atkinson said. "We agree with fellow conservatives in opposing the president and the growth of government thru increased EPA regulations, which is precisely the worst way to reduce carbon emissions." The charged political climate makes finding clear positions on climate change from many Republicans tough to come by, say experts who follow the issue. "Most Republicans say the same thing behind closed doors: ‘Of course, I get that the climate is changing, of course I get that we need to do something — but I need to get reelected,’ " Audubon Society President David Yarnold told National Journal in 2013. "Somehow they’re going to have to find a safe place on this." Our ruling Brown said that "virtually no Republican" in Washington accepts climate change science. When it comes to on-the-record comments of members of Congress, Brown’s characterization is about right. We found at least eight Republicans in Congress who publicly voiced support for the scientific consensus and many more conservative legislators who deny either a human link to the changing climate, or the fact that the climate is changing altogether. A reason for caution, however, is comments from someone like Yarnold — who suggest GOP members of Congress acknowledge climate change science behind closed doors but avoid the talk in public for political reasons.

pomt-14123	"You have to be a citizen to vote," but with same-day voter registration, "you have places where people just walk in and vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-noncitizens-can-vote-whe/	Donald Trump said he does not support same-day voter registration because he says it makes it easier for noncitizens to vote. Because Trump complained repeatedly that the primary process was fixed, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Trump if he supports policies that make it easier for people to vote. Same-day voter registration, for example, allows voters to register or update their information at the polls on Election Day. "No, no," Trump said to the suggestion. "I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks. And whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it. But you have to be a citizen to vote." "Well, of course," Todd replied. "That is the law as it stands already." Trump disagreed: "No, it's not. I mean, you have places where people just walk in and vote." In most states, people have to register to vote at least a few days prior to voting. But 15 states and the District of Columbia have or are in the process of implementing same-day voter registration. Is it really the case that noncitizens can just "walk in and vote" in these states? Election experts told us there’s no increased risk of noncitizens voting in states with same-day registration, as opposed to states that require voters to register in advance, because of the safeguards the states put in place. "It’s not that you can just show up and vote — you have to register and provide necessary ID," said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida. To register someone to vote, states have to establish the voter’s identity and residency. To meet equivalent standards when registering people on Election Day, same-day registration states require the voter to bring proper identification and proof of residency, such as a utility bill, with them to the polls. The specifics, though, vary by state because each state makes its own election laws. So if there are problems with ineligible voters using same-day registration, it likely has more to do with how the state implements the program, rather than a problem inherent to the general concept of same-day registration, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin. For example, some, but not all, states have an electronic database that they can use to check a same-day registrant’s eligibility on the spot. Others, like Iowa and New Hampshire, send a mailer to all same-day registrants, and if the card is returned as undeliverable, the state will investigate the case as potential election fraud. But the bottom line is that states strive to hold everyone to the same level of scrutiny in terms of identity verification. "For presidential elections, all states require voters to be U.S. citizens, and there is nothing inherent about same-day registration that would make it easier for noncitizens to vote," said Joshua Douglas, an election law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law. Douglas noted that some local jurisdictions do allow noncitizens to vote in certain elections, but it’s still illegal for them to vote in federal elections. Every expert we asked told us that there are anecdotal examples of noncitizens voting in federal elections, but it’s rare. And there isn’t any evidence that it’s more prevalent in the states with Election Day registration. For someone to vote fraudulently using same-day registration, they would have to lie about their eligibility in the presence of poll workers and others, and they would create a paper trail by filling out the paperwork. These factors serve as deterrents, in addition to the potentially severe penalties a fraudulent voter could face, like deportation if the person was in the country illegally. Burden pointed to a recent case in Wisconsin of a man who has been charged with election fraud for voting in the state’s April 5 presidential primary. The man, who is not a citizen but is in the United States on a green card, registered and voted at the polls on Election Day. But the state government caught the man, and a spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board told the local news that the agency had never encountered a similar case before, in 40 years of Election Day voter registration. "For someone who’s not eligible to vote, to walk into a polling place and use same-day registration is risky," Burden said, noting that there’s a higher risk of election fraud in activities that occur outside the polling location, such as mail-in ballots. Our ruling "You have to be a citizen to vote," but with same-day voter registration, "you have places where people just walk in and vote." In states with same-day voter registration, people don’t just walk in and vote. They have to provide the same level of identification as when registering in advance. Experts told us there is no additional risk of noncitizens casting ballots in states with same-day voter registration, nor is there any evidence that this occurs.

pomt-03256	Twenty four states have voter ID or comparable restrictions; before Barack Obama was elected, it was two.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/11/james-vincent/naacp-providence-president-jim-vincent-says-24-sta/	The question over what kinds of identification requirements should be imposed on voters -- and whether such rules are being used to exclude minorities, the poor and the elderly -- continues to be a hot topic. During the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, James Vincent, president of the Providence chapter of the NAACP, was asked about a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidating a key part of the Voting Rights Act. "I think within five minutes, both Texas and North Carolina couldn't wait to restrict voting rights," said Vincent. "Let's face it. I think there's 24 states that have voting IDs or some form of restrictions in terms of who can vote and who can't vote, and I think before President Obama was elected, I think it was two." He then spoke of "the demographic reality of the browning of America" and commented, "I think these things are related. All of a sudden you have a country that's being more diverse and then you have an African-American president, and now all of a sudden you have all these voting rights acts and the elimination of same-day voting and early voting." "I don't think that's a coincidence," Vincent said. We focused on the numbers. Recognizing that Vincent was making it clear that his tally might be off a bit, we were curious about the totals and whether the number of states with tougher restrictions had increased 12-fold since the election of the country's first black president. First, let’s look at the current situation. We quickly discovered that checking this factoid depends on where you want to draw the line on whether a law restricts voter rights. Some consider it restrictive to ask for any type of written identification. Others draw the line at photo ID requirements. Still others consider it restrictive to curtail laws that make it easier for people to cast their ballot, such as early voting. (Rhode Island’s voter ID law, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2012, requires voters to have one of several forms of identification, such as a birth certificate or Social Security card. Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, voters will be required to have a valid photo ID.) Vincent said he got the 24 number from the website of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He directed us to its 2013 "Map of Shame." Chris Melody Fields, an election protection coordinator for the Lawyers' Committee, said it doesn't just include states with photo ID rules. It "shows the overall assault on voting," she said. It identifies states that have passed "restrictive laws" that have eliminated or reduced early voting, eliminated same-day registration or passed a tougher proof-of-citizenship law. It shows 25 states -- not 24 -- with laws the group considers restrictive, including (but not limited to) ones where a photo ID is requested or required. However the laws in seven of those states have not yet been implemented or have been challenged. In 10 of the 25, a photo ID is only requested, not mandatory, although Fields warned that poll workers in some states misread the law and think that it is mandatory. To get another perspective, we turned to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks voter ID laws. Its website shows that four states require a photo ID and seven request one. Seven more states have passed legislation to require or request a photo ID, but those statutes are awaiting implementation or are under challenge. If you include states that have any type of voter ID requirement -- whether or not a photograph is involved -- the number of implemented laws jumps to 30. It will rise to 34 if all are implemented. So by the Lawyers' Committee definition, Vincent’s claim on the number of states with restrictive voting is close to the mark. By the conference's tally, which looks exclusively at voter ID laws, his count is low. Now let's look at the number of states that had voter ID laws before Obama was elected. Vincent said he heard during the debate on Rhode Island’s law that two states fell into that category. According to NCSL, in 2001, three states -- Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana -- asked for but didn’t require a photo ID and 10 states required some other form of voter identification. Between 2003 and 2008, when Obama was elected, eight more states started requiring some sort of ID, bringing the total to 18. Among them, Michigan and South Dakota started asking for photo IDs. Indiana and Georgia, started requiring them. "Indiana's law went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 and it was upheld," said Wendy Underhill, a senior policy specialist with NCS. "I think after that, it did give other states a signal that that was something they could copy. So it's possible between 2005 [when the Indiana law passed] and 2008 states were sitting tight to see how that was going to come out." Our ruling James Vincent said 24 states today require voter IDs or impose some other restrictions on voting, while only two states had such limits before Barack Obama was elected. He's using a measure set by the Lawyers' Committee that includes states with laws that request or demand a photo ID, and states that have restricted voting in other ways. The only comparable pre-Obama metric we could find, from the National Conference of State Legislatures, involves voter photo identification, so we'll stick with that. While only two states -- Georgia and Indiana -- required a photo ID to vote before 2008, Michigan, South Dakota, Louisiana, Florida and Hawaii, requested a photo ID, according to NCSL data. That means at least seven states -- not two, as Vincent claimed -- were demanding or asking for a photo ID for the 2008 election that put Obama in office. No matter which standard you use, the number of states adopting more-restrictive voter identification requirements has increased since 2008. We'll leave it to others to debate whether that’s linked to Obama's election and America's changing racial demographics. In short, Vincent was close on his first number but got the second number wrong. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-08804	"It is wrong for the average federal worker today to make more than $100,000 while the average private-sector worker makes less than $70,000."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/18/mike-keown/federal-employee-pay-out-control-candidate-says/	Mike Keown is running for Congress on the belief, in part, that the federal government is growing too big. Part of his argument comes from some recent newspaper articles about the salaries and benefits of federal employees. USA Today reported in March that federal employees have higher average salaries and benefits than private-sector employees in more than eight of 10 occupations. On Aug. 10, the newspaper reported that the average annual pay and benefits for federal workers is twice as much as private-sector employees. The August report was picked up by newspapers across the nation and by ABC News. Initially, we wanted to drop our pens and reporter notebooks and apply for jobs with Uncle Sam. Instead, AJC PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig into the numbers. Do federal workers really bring home twice as much money in salary and benefits as private-sector employees? Numbers in the newspaper story came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an agency within the U.S. Department of Labor. Keown, a Republican hoping to unseat Democrat Sanford Bishop to represent Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, highlighted one set of numbers from the Aug. 10 article on his Web site. "It is wrong for the average federal worker today to make more than $100,000 while the average private-sector worker makes less than $70,000," Keown wrote. Jay Walker, a spokesman for Keown, said the candidate was trying to illustrate his argument that the federal government should consider privatizing more of its higher-paying jobs. Walker could not recall when Keown, a state representative from Coolidge, posted his comments on his Web site. "They privatize the cheap jobs," Walker said. "Why can't you privatize the more expensive jobs?" The exact numbers, according to the story, were somewhat more ($123,049) in 2009 for federal workers and slightly less ($61,051) for private-sector workers. The total compensation, however, includes pension benefits, health care insurance and cost of living adjustments. USA Today reported that average compensation for federal employees has risen 36.9 percent since 2000. Those numbers were adjusted for inflation. The big difference, USA Today noted, seemed to be benefits. The average federal benefits were $41,791, compared with $10,589 for private-sector workers. Federal spending -- and the growing federal deficit -- has been a hot issue as the November midterm elections near. Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown made federal employee pay a theme in his successful campaign to fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy. President Barack Obama has proposed a 1.4 percent pay hike for federal workers in 2011, the smallest increase in a decade. Congressional Republicans want to stop across-the-board increases entirely, saying it will save the government $2.2 billion. No one disputes the raw numbers USA Today reported. The BEA and others quoted by USA Today, however, caution that those numbers do not tell the complete story. USA Today noted that the analysis did not consider differences in education and experience. The August report does not compare the salaries of people working in specific federal jobs to similar positions in the private sector. The BEA notes that its private-sector data includes employees of all professions. That means everything from minimum-wage jobs to the salaries of chief executive officers. Federal employees typically work in professional occupations that pay more, such as accountants, attorneys and economists, according to Congressional Budget Office research. The BEA also noted in recent years that the federal government is hiring more highly skilled workers who tend to make more money. Many of the lower-paid positions, the BEA found, have been contracted out to the private sector. "This trend contributed to higher average for federal government civilian employees than for private sector employees," the BEA says on its Web site. Mercer University economics professor Roger Tutterow said cost-of-living and experience must be considered when conducting salary comparisons. "There are a variety of factors that could account for that difference," he said. The articles do not indicate whether some factors, such as the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C. area, where many federal employees work, were considered. National Treasury Employees Union President Colleen Kelley was quoted in USA Today in March as saying any comparison between federal and private-sector employees is faulty because it "compares apples and oranges." The BEA notes many factors need to be considered when comparing pay and benefits of federal employees to private-sector workers. The statement on Keown's Web site does not mention those factors. Therefore, we rate Keown's statement as Half True.	None	Mike Keown	None	None	None	2010-08-18T06:00:00	2010-08-12	['None']
pomt-02291	Says he has engaged in the political process "only in the past decade."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/03/charles-koch/charles-koch-op-ed-says-his-political-engagement-b/	Following weeks of Democratic attacks -- including barbs from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. -- billionaire industrialist Charles Koch fired back with a response in the Wall Street Journal. In an op-ed on April 3, 2014, Koch called Reid’s comments disrespectful and a bad omen for democracy. He also defended the family company Koch Industries, one of the nation’s largest privately owned corporations. Koch said the fundamental concepts of equality before the law and personal freedom were under attack by government itself. "That's why, if we want to restore a free society and create greater well-being and opportunity for all Americans, we have no choice but to fight for those principles," Koch wrote. "I have been doing so for more than 50 years, primarily through educational efforts. It was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process." We wondered whether Koch was accurate when he said that "it was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process." Koch drew a distinction between "educational efforts" and the "political process." Those categories, though, are somewhat fluid and subject to reasonable debate. For example, Charles Koch and his brother David made several large financial commitments prior to 2004 to free-market oriented groups such as the Cato Institute, the Reason Foundation, the Mercatus Center and Citizens for a Sound Economy, which was the pre-2004 precursor of Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. Koch Industries also spent $2.6 million on federal lobbying between 1998 and 2003. Even if you set these expenditures aside, though, we found the Kochs have made many campaign contributions prior to 2004. Charles Koch, the author of the column, gave $54,500 to candidates or political committees before 2004, according to federal disclosure data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics and calculated by PolitiFact. That’s not a lot for a billionaire, though it’s not nothing, either. However, his brother and his company, both of whom have had ideological agendas closely aligned with his own, also gave money during that time -- a lot of it. Between 1989 and 2003, David Koch gave more than $1.7 million to candidates and political committees. And the political action committee of Koch Industries gave an additional $5.2 million to candidates and political committees over the same period. If you combine these totals -- and throw in political donations made by Koch Industries affiliates, as well as donations made by Koch-related entities at the state level -- then Charles, David and the PAC representing their privately held company collectively gave more than $7 million to candidates and political committees before 2004. And since then, they’ve spent much more. Robert A. Tappan, the director of external relations for Koch Companies Public Sector, told PolitiFact that the "past decade" reference "refers to the ‘Koch Seminars’ that have been held since 2003. We use the seminars to bring together businesspeople, thought-leaders, philanthropists, academics, scientists, and public officials to discuss ideas and issues about how to make the U.S. more successful and to create a freer society, with policies and leaders focused on helping people improve their lives." However, we don’t think most people would naturally assume that’s what Koch meant when he said he had only recently engaged in the political process. Our ruling Charles Koch wrote that "it was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process." Even if you ignore the deep reservoir of money Koch spent on "educational" and lobbying efforts -- expenditures that could plausibly be described as "political" -- Charles Koch personally gave a little more than $50,000 to candidates and political committees donations prior to 2004. And collectively, his brother and the PAC of the company they own directly supported candidates and political committees to the tune of $7 million over the same period. We rate his claim False.

pomt-07225	"We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/02/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-only-inches-away-ceasing-be-fr/	In his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H., Mitt Romney made a bold claim about the state of the American economy. "Government under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40 percent of our economy," he said. "We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy." At PolitiFact, we tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. But we think the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze. So we looked into the data and consulted an ideologically diverse group of economists and business experts. Our conclusion? Romney’s suggestion that the U.S. is in danger of losing its free market heritage is so far off base that it's ridiculous. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. (His staff did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion. "It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as we concluded recently, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation. "One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) But the strongest evidence that undercuts Romney's claim comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age. "We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time," Steuerle said. "The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy." So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. So, as measured by economists from both ends of the spectrum and, most importantly, from the conservative Heritage Foundation, it's ridiculously false to say we are close to losing our free-market economy. We find Romney's statement Pants on Fire.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-06-02T16:56:44	2011-06-02	['None']
pomt-12978	"In the last five years only one out of 60 -- one out of 60 -- appropriations bills has been passed on time before the end of the fiscal year."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/dec/21/tom-price/price-mostly-correct-budget-bills/	Before Georgia Rep. Tom Price of Roswell in metro Atlanta, was nominated for a position in Donald Trump’s cabinet, he was in charge of the House Budget Committee. The physician-turned-congressman has been an outspoken critic of Obamacare -- and Washington gridlock. Price will continue to be the chairman until he is confirmed for a Cabinet position by the Senate. At a recent event in Washington D.C. at the Brookings Institution, Trump’s pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services spoke on the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of the annual government funding process. Price said, "In the last five years only one out of 60 -- one out of 60 -- appropriations bills has been passed on time before the end of the fiscal year." Congress often passes spending bills belatedly. But we wondered, do so few really get passed on time? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Background For some background, we looked to who is responsible for what when it comes to the budget. The Budget Committee, which Price has chaired since 2015 after taking over from now-Speaker Paul Ryan, is made up of five members from the Committee on Ways and Means, five members from the Committee on Appropriations, and one member from the Committee on Rules. The committee is responsible for developing the annual budget resolution, which is what kicks off the budget process by setting the top line number for appropriations. Basically, it sets the ceiling for how much money the 12 annual appropriations bills can collectively spend. Appropriations bills start in the House. Both the House and Senate come up with their own versions of the bills. The chambers can pass bills individually, and regularly do, but the bills must match before being sent to the president. To start the process, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees take the top line number set by the budget committee, divvy it among the 12 bills and then write bills to those numbers. For the last several years, Congress has been prone to passing continuing resolutions that extend pre-existing appropriations, and omnibus spending bills that pack many smaller, regular appropriations bills into one, instead of new, individual bills each fiscal year. Additionally, only one-third of federal spending is done through annual appropriations bills approved by Congress. The other two-thirds is mandatory spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. But mandatory spending appropriations aren’t permanent -- Congress can make changes in the law that alter spending within mandatory programs. One lone bill We found that this bill, the lone appropriations bill passed before the end of the fiscal year that Price speaks of, does, in fact, stand alone. We reached out to Price’s spokesperson Ryan Murphy. He sent us a compilation of background information by some federal sources. Earlier this year, Congress passed an appropriations bill on military construction, which was signed into law by President Obama on Sept. 29, two days before the start of the 2017 fiscal year. According to a number of bills listed on Congress.gov, the military construction bill passed in September is the only full, line-by-line appropriations bill that has been enacted before Oct. 1 in the last five years. (Although continuing resolutions are technically appropriations bills and pass before the Oct. 1 deadline, this is the only full appropriations bill with new funding that was passed.) But some of the issue with Price’s statement comes from his choice of words. The House and Senate pass bills, but those versions must be reconciled and passed again before they can be enacted after being signed into law by the president. The Senate website says, "Once legislation has passed both chambers of Congress in identical form, been signed into law by the president, become law without his signature, or passed over his veto, the legislation is enacted." Our ruling Health secretary nominee Tom Price said, "In the last five years only one out of 60 -- one out of 60 -- appropriations bills has been passed on time before the end of the fiscal year." And that’s basically true. Congress has turned to omnibus spending bills and continuing resolutions to fund the government for the last couple of years, which differ from full appropriations bills. However, in the last five years, appropriations bills were passed by individual chambers before the end of the fiscal year, they just weren’t matched by the other chamber or reconciled. Even then, all but one was signed into law by the president (and enacted) after Oct. 1. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2016-12-21T06:00:00	2016-11-30	['None']

pomt-00307	Says that Dianne Feinstein said that "all vets are mentally ill in some way and government should prevent them from owning firearms."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/24/blog-posting/quote-dianne-feinstein-about-veterans-and-guns-fab/	A quote allegedly from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., saying veterans are mentally ill and shouldn't own firearms is fabricated. On Sept. 16, Facebook user Len Stanchick posted a combination of memes depicting Feinstein. One of them reflected her well-known faked quote which became viral in 2013. One of the images quotes Feinstein as saying, "All vets are mentally ill in some way and government should prevent them from owning firearms." Source: Facebook This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here's how the hoax was born. At a March 7, 2013, Senate hearing to reinstate a ban on certain types of assault weapons, Texas Sen. John Cornyn offered an amendment to exempt former military personnel from the law. Cornyn said that veterans should be allowed to own assault weapons as they are most highly-trained and qualified individuals. He also explained that disarming these people prevents veterans of a way to protect their families and communities. He said, "Members and veterans of the Armed Forces are the most highly-trained and qualified individuals to own these weapons for self-defense purposes. We should think long and hard before disarming these heroes, preventing them from protecting their families and communities." Feinstein oppposed the amendment. Part of her rationale was that some veterans could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. "If I understand this, this (amendment) adds an exemption of retired military. As I understand our bill, no issue has arose (sic) in this regard during the 10 years the expired ban was in effect and what we did in the other bill was exempt possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States. So that included active military. The problem with expanding this is that, you know, with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it’s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this. So, you know, I would be happy to sit down with you again and see if we could work something out but I think we have to — if you’re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally don’t have access to this kind of weapon." (See the discussion via C-Span starting from 1:30:00.) Feinstein never said that "all vets are mentally ill" or the "government should prevent them from owning firearms." However, that false quote was fabricated and spread throughout the internet, especially across different political forums. The story has been recycling since 2013 and most of them cite Los Angeles Times columnist Burt Prelutsky as the initial source in order to gain credibility. According to Snopes.com, Burt Prelutsky is not a Los Angeles Times columnist. Feinstein's words were mangled beyond what she said. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14901	Wisconsin’s Government Accountability Board "ignored their duties and did not regularly audit" voters to remove felons "for a span of 16 elections.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-state-board-failed-16-elections-/	To rally support for a GOP bill to break apart Wisconsin’s agency that oversees elections and ethics matters, Gov. Scott Walker is casting the Government Accountability Board as incompetent. At one point, he stormed Twitter using the #ReformGAB hashtag. In one Oct. 13, 2015 tweet, he claimed the agency wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions -- a claim we rated False. In another tweet from the series that day, Walker wrote: "GAB ignored their duties & did not regularly audit the voter rolls to remove all felons - for a span of 16 elections. #ReformGAB" With the issue still awaiting final action in the Republican-controlled Legislature, we decided to check it out. GAB history In 2007, the Legislature combined two agencies -- one overseeing ethics, the other overseeing elections -- to create the Government Accountability Board. The board was created in the wake of the 2002 caucus scandal, which involved politicians from both sides of the aisle misusing taxpayer-paid staffers to conduct campaign work, and amid other questions about how well elections were being overseen. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) led the charge. The bill was approved unanimously in the Senate and only had two dissenting votes in the Assembly. Since 2008, the board -- made up of retired judges appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate -- has overseen Wisconsin elections, campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws. One of the board’s responsibilities is to conduct post-election reviews to determine if any felons voted in that election. That’s where Walker’s claim comes in. The audit Walker’s team pointed to a December 2014 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau as support for his claim that the board "ignored their duties and did not regularly audit" voters to remove felons "for a span of 16 elections." So what does the report say? According to the audit, GAB officials told auditors in May 2014 that post-election felon audits from 16 elections between February 2010 through April 2014 had not been completed. Under state law, the board is required to conduct post-election audits of voters who registered on Election Day, or within 20 days before an election, to determine if any ineligible felons voted. The GAB staff told auditors they did not perform these reviews, in part, because of concerns that the system to identify felons who remained on probation or parole wasn’t reliable. Individuals who are not felons were being flagged as having voting illegally. One person was even charged with illegally voting as a felon based on a false positive match. Agency officials said they put post-election audits on hold until the system for checks was more accurate. The agency added additional steps to the final audit to catch false positives before referral to the district attorney. The audit notes the review was completed by July 2014. So this duty was postponed for 16 elections, but not ignored entirely. What’s more, Walker’s claim is a bit jumbled. He said the ignored duty was meant to remove felons. But the post-election felon audit is a final check to see if any felons voted, not primarily to remove them from voter rolls. That effort comes earlier in the process, and is done mainly by local clerks. Each month, GAB receives a list of felons from the Department of Corrections, which is then compared against the voter list. Matches are referred to the voter’s municipal clerk’s office, which decides if there is a true match and inactivates the voter. The Legislative Audit Bureau did not find GAB to have neglected this duty. GAB also provides clerks with the list of felons before the election to ensure none of them received an absentee ballot, registered later or on Election Day. Our rating Walker said the state Government Accountability Board "ignored their duties and did not regularly audit" voters to remove felons "for a span of 16 elections." The GAB postponed the completion of post-election audits, due to concerns about inaccurate identification of felons, according to a Legislative Audit Bureau report. But the audit in question was not primarily designed to remove voters from the rolls as Walker claims. That work, which involves local clerks, comes before the election. For a statement that is partially accurate, but misleading, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-11-06T10:15:00	2015-11-06	['None']

pomt-15082	At this point in 2012, "Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/20/karl-rove/rove-says-2012-nomination-fight-saw-many-poll-lead/	A major poll conducted soon after the second Republican presidential debate showed a huge bump for former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. A survey by CNN found Fiorina shot from 3 percent in early September to 15 percent now, putting her in a statistical tie for second with physician Ben Carson. Real estate billionaire Donald Trump still leads with 24 percent, but he’s down 8 points from the last CNN poll. The pundits had lots to say about a fluid field. Karl Rove warned against taking any lead in the polls too seriously at this point. "Let's just remember, we are at the beginning of this process," Rove said on Fox News Sunday on Sept. 20, 2015. "As of now, in 2012, Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney on Feb. 28 of 2012. " Rove said the Republicans might not settle on a nominee until March or even April. We thought it would be interesting to look back at the 2012 Republican contest and see if the "yellow jersey" moved around as much as Rove said. The GOP strategist was largely correct. The 2012 election polls Rove’s office told us his source was an interactive chart on RealClearPolitics.com. The bright lines show the rise and fall of several of the candidates. Perry reached 29.9 percent on Sept. 17, 2011, and had fallen slightly to 28.2 percent on Sept. 20, 2011. So that’s very close to what Rove cited. Source: RealClearPolitics.com We looked for each candidate’s highest poll average in each period when the lead changed hands. If we take the poll numbers at face value, the lead shifted nine times before Romney took it, held it and went on to win the nomination. For the purists, since most polls have a margin of error of at least 3 percent, we could discount those times when the lead was statistically doubtful. If we did that, we would still end up with six lead changes in the period Rove described. We should note that the lead sometimes went back to a previous lead holder. Overall, five candidates shared the lead: Romney, Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Candidate Date Overall % Lead Perry Sept. 20 28.2 8.6 Romney Oct. 10 21.9 5.5 Cain Nov. 3 26 2.2 Romney Nov. 12 22.5 0.5 Gingrich Dec. 13 35 12.7 Romney Jan. 18 33.1 14.8 Gingrich Jan. 27 29.3 2.3 Romney Feb. 8 34.5 11.7 Santorum Feb. 18 34.3 6.6 Romney Feb. 29 33 1.7 Source: RealClearPolitics.com Other polls Individual polls from different polling groups generally show a fair bit of movement, but not as much as the aggregated numbers that Rove used. For example, the Pew Research Center poll showed four lead changes. The Fox News poll also came up with four. These surveys were not done as frequently as all the polls that fed into RealClearPolitics.com's average, and so they might miss relatively brief periods when the lead bounced back and forth among Romney, Gingrich, Cain and Santorum. Flighty voters in the early months The 2012 Republican nomination saw a robust number of competitors. The race this year is even more crowded. Martin Cohen, a political scientist at James Madison University, said this all feeds into "the media's fetish with the new and exciting." Cohen places very little importance at polls at this point. "Voters are influenced by media coverage and the post-debate spin,"he told us. "But it doesn't mean that is the way they will ultimately vote or even whether they will vote at all." Cohen said if you want to spot the real leaders, keep track of who snags the best and most influential endorsements. Our ruling Rove said the leader in the race for the Republican nomination changed seven times between September 2011 and the end of February 2012. Using the polling average numbers, that is a fair summary, and some might argue that the lead moved around even more. We found that five individual candidates -- Perry, Romney, Cain, Gingrich and Santorum -- handed the lead back and forth during that time period. Looking at individual polls, the lead might shift less often, but the window on the race those polls offer is not as detailed as the method Rove used. There might be minor quibbles about the exact tally, but Rove was in the ballpark. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09573	"Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-says-supreme-court-ruling-allows-foreign-com/	On Jan. 21, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling striking down barriers to corporations spending money directly from their own treasuries to influence elections. The 5-4 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission has drawn fire from President Barack Obama twice -- first in a weekly radio address and, now, during his State of the Union address. The president told a joint session of Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, that "it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. Last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong." That's much the same argument he made in his Jan. 23 radio address, when he argued that "even foreign corporations may now get into the act" of spending "an unlimited amount of special interest money" for political purposes. We published an item on Jan. 26 -- one day before the State of the Union address -- that investigated whether the justices' ruling did in fact open the door to foreign companies spending freely on American campaigns. We're updating and expanding it now that Obama has mentioned this issue in his State of the Union address. First, some background. In Citizens United, the justices overturned previous decisions that prohibited, in the court's words, "corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an 'electioneering communication' or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate." While corporations are still barred from giving directly to federal candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees in order to spend money on electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts. Critics of the majority's opinion warned that allowing political spending by corporations could also undermine existing barriers to foreign corporate spending on elections. Current federal law -- legal eagles can find it at 2 U.S.C. 441e(b)(3) -- prevents "a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country" from making "directly or indirectly" a donation or expenditure "in connection with a Federal, State, or local election," to a political party committee or "for an electioneering communication." The majority opinion, authored by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, maintained that the court was not specifically overturning this barrier to foreign campaign spending, essentially saying that it was outside the scope of the opinion. "We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process," the majority wrote. But in a strongly worded and sometimes bitter dissent, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens latched onto the question of campaign spending by foreign companies as an example of the majority opinion's shortcomings, bringing it up no fewer than three times. "The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers," said Stevens. He went on to quote Fordham University law professor Zephyr Rain Teachout's observation that the Framers' "obsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country." (Teachout, incidentally, directed Internet organizing for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign.) But passionate as his view is, Stevens' dissent holds no legal authority. Indeed, the legal experts we spoke to after Obama's radio address said that the president was overstating the immediate impact of the opinion. They said Obama was correct that the ruling could open the door to foreign companies spending on American campaigns, given the general direction of the majority's opinion. But because the majority justices didn't actually strike down the existing barriers on foreign companies -- in fact, they explicitly wrote that it fell beyond the boundaries of their decision -- our experts agreed that Obama erred by suggesting that the issue is settled law. Until test cases proceed and further rulings are handed down, Obama's claim about foreign campaign spending is a reasonable interpretation, and nothing more. "Some people think that Kennedy's opinion in Citizens United logically leads there," said Robert Kelner, who chairs the election and political law practice group at the law firm Covington & Burling. "Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. We don't know for sure." Brett Kappel, a political law specialist with the law firm Arent Fox, said the Citizens United opinion "certainly could be read as declaring this provision unconstitutional, so I'd have to say the president's interpretation is correct -- but we won't really know for sure until a court rules on the issue." Critics of the ruling -- including some readers who contacted PolitiFact after we posted our original analysis -- have zeroed in on one scenario in particular, "that foreign corporations with U.S. subsidiaries are likely to be able to now spend unlimited amounts on American elections," in the words of the liberal blog Think Progress. In one theoretical example offered by the Web site Politico, "even if Sony Corp. in Japan couldn't spend money directly for or against a candidate, the electronics company's American-based subsidiaries could." According to Politico, the White House and Democratic lawmakers have been discussing legislation to mitigate the impact of the ruling, including directly addressing the question of how foreign companies should be treated. The scenario involving foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries hinges on a quirk in the law that had seemed to be of little consequence, but which now may loom large. The federal law cited above -- 2 U.S.C. 441e(b)(3) -- defines U.S. companies as those incorporated under U.S. law or that have their headquarters here. It is silent on the treatment of companies that are incorporated and headquartered in the United States but are owned by foreigners. That uncertainty could indeed provide a loophole for spending unlimited amounts of money on politics. But even that interpretation is not a slam dunk. Federal Election Commission regulations say that a foreign national cannot "direct, dictate, control, or directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process" for spending money for political purposes, a principle that could keep the critics' worst-case scenario from coming true, said Tara Malloy, an associate counsel with the Campaign Legal Center. What that FEC regulation means for political spending by a foreign-owned company is far from clear. So, if anything, uncertainties about how foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries would be treated only further muddies the question. Based on our reading of the court's opinion and interviews with campaign law experts, we find that Obama has overstated the ruling's immediate impact on foreign companies' ability to spend unlimited money in U.S. political campaigns. While such an outcome may be possible, the majority opinion specifically said it wasn't addressing that point, and only further litigation would settle the matter once and for all. So we find Obama's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08912	"25 percent of our economy is the financial sector."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/28/david-gregory/meet-press-david-gregory-says-financial-sector-equ/	On July 25, 2010, David Gregory, the host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner if the relative size of the financial sector in the United States bothered him. "As someone's who concerned about the overall growth of the economy, the role of education, innovation, manufacturing, does it trouble you that 25 percent of our economy is the financial sector, which doesn't actually make anything besides money?" Gregory asked. Geithner largely sidestepped the question, saying, "I don't know ... how large the system's going to be in the future. You can't really tell." But we were actually more interested in the statistic underlying Gregory's question. Is he right that the financial sector accounts for a full one-fourth of the American economy? To find the answer, we looked at several statistical tables from the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Here's what they show: • Gross output by industry. For the most recent year available, 2008, the category "finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing" accounted for $4.846 trillion in gross output, compared to $26.574 trillion for the entire economy. That's 18 percent. If you calculate it as a share of the private economy alone, which was $23.467 trillion that year, then it accounted for a little under 21 percent. Neither calculation reaches the 25 percent Gregory specified -- but the best estimation for the "financial sector" may be even lower. We asked economists whether they thought that "finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing" was really the right category to be using, and they agreed it was too broad. "However you look at it, including real estate, rental, or leasing would be wrong," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "At the core of Gregory's premise is that people are making money off of money. Real estate, rental, and leasing all involve tangible property of some sort." Fortunately, the statistics break out "finance and insurance" as a separate total. This category generated $2.169 trillion in gross output in 2008, which equals about 8 percent of the whole economy and 9 percent of the private economy. So by this measure, the actual percentage is far below what Gregory said. • Value added by industry. For 2009, "finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing" accounted for $3.058 trillion in value added, compared to $14.256 trillion for the whole economy. That's 21 percent. If you calculate it as a share of the private economy alone, which was $12.324 trillion that year, then it accounted for 25 percent -- the first number we've calculated that matches Gregory's percentage. If you use the narrower "finance and insurance" figure instead, you'll find that this category generated $1.198 trillion in value added in 2009, which equals about 8 percent of the entire economy and almost 10 percent of the private economy. Once again, the narrower category falls far short of Gregory's estimate. • Compensation of employees by industry. For 2008, "finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing" accounted for about $718 billion in employee compensation, compared to $8.037 trillion for the whole economy. That's 9 percent. If you calculate it with private compensation alone, which was $6.474 trillion, it works out to 11 percent. Both are well below Gregory's estimate. Once again, using the narrower "finance and insurance" figure instead, you'll find that this category generated about $608 billion in employee compensation in 2008, which equals less than 8 percent of the whole economy and a bit more than 9 percent of the private-sector economy. Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal-to-centrist Brookings Institution, suggests that Gregory may have been thinking about financial-sector corporate profits as a share of all corporate profits, which requires a different calculation. In 2009, the financial sector -- which does not appear to include real estate in this case -- recorded $331.2 billion in profits. Compared to the $1.309 trillion in total adjusted corporate profits, that's almost exactly the 25 percent figure Gregory mentioned. (We e-mailed Gregory but didn't receive a response by publication time.) Burtless agreed that if Gregory meant to cite the profits figure, then he misspoke. But Burtless added that the corporate profits number is notable for being high -- and rising in recent years. "The percentage is dramatically higher than was the case back when the U.S. economy was delivering much better income growth for Americans in the middle and at the bottom of the income distribution," Burtless said. "The years 1950 to 1973 were pretty good years for middle-income families, and back in that era, financial companies earned an average of 13 percent of all corporate profits. If Gregory was trying to suggest there may be something wrong with an economy in which 25 percent of corporate profits are earned by bankers, brokers, hedge fund managers, insurance companies, and the like, there may be something to that argument." A final note. While we aren't directly rating Gregory's claim that the "financial sector ... doesn't actually make anything besides money," we thought it would be worth relaying a strong objection to Gregory's characterization by Foster of Heritage. "You don't have to love Wall Street or the big banks to acknowledge the vital role of financial markets in helping those who do make things do so more efficiently and at lower cost, and in helping the nation use its financial capital to greatest advantage," he said. "If the financial industry 'doesn't make anything,' what exactly does the news business make? Of course, they both provide important services, and you know those services are important because people are willing to pay for them." Now let's get back to the specific statement we're rating -- that "25 percent of our economy is the financial sector." We calculated the numbers 12 different ways, and only one reached Gregory's 25 percent threshold. Reaching that level requires including "real estate, rental and leasing" in the equation (which our experts said is not the best way to calculate it) and dividing by the private economy only (a distinction Gregory did not make). By contrast, the narrower definition of the financial sector that our experts favored consistently produced percentages one-third to one-half as big as Gregory suggested. Still, one of our calculations did reach 25 percent, which is enough to rate his statement Barely True. CORRECTION: The initial version of this item mistakenly paraphrased Burtless as saying that Gregory may have been thinking of "corporate profits as a share of the economy." The story has been corrected above to say, "financial-sector corporate profits as a share of all corporate profits." Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	David Gregory	None	None	None	2010-07-28T14:52:43	2010-07-25	['None']

pomt-00783	"Suntrust Bank cancels account because company sells guns."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/apr/08/florida-news-flash/suntrust-bank-closed-brooksville-shops-accounts-se/	A bank suddenly closing checking accounts for a Brooksville pawn shop that sells guns has opened up Internet speculation that the Obama administration influenced the decision. Under the headline "Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns," the website FloridaNewsFlash.com recounts how American Gun & Pawn owner Steve Champion received a letter from SunTrust dated March 20, 2015, telling him his deposit accounts, safe deposit boxes and credit cards would be closed. (A reader first alerted us to the story after seeing it on Facebook.) The letter said that after an account review, American Gun & Pawn’s accounts were no longer jibing with SunTrust’s "corporate business objectives." There were no specifics in the letter, beyond information that he had a month to close his accounts or they would be closed for him. When Champion contacted the bank, he said a service rep told him he had received "one of those gun letters going around to the gun and pawn shops." The bank wouldn’t reverse the decision. Champion posted the letter on his shop’s Facebook page, kicking off a flurry of conspiracy theories that SunTrust and other banks were working at the behest of the Obama administration, which was trying to stamp out gun sales nationwide. FloridaNewsFlash.com, apparently first to report the news online, stoked the fire by saying it was part of an ominous program from the Obama administration called "Operation Choke Point." Many other sites have followed suit. SunTrust told us they didn’t close American Gun & Pawn’s accounts because the shop sold guns. As we dug into the details, we found that the bank was ending its relationship with some types of customers, but those customers weren't specifically gun shops. Bank policy SunTrust denied they are closing accounts with gun shops, but they are ending relationships with pawn shops. "Any suggestion that this is a firearms issue is inaccurate," spokesman Michael McCoy told us. SunTrust announced in a Aug. 8, 2014, press release that the bank had "decided to discontinue banking relationships with three types of businesses – specifically payday lenders, pawn shops and dedicated check-cashers – due to compliance requirements." The bank still works with firearms dealers, according to the release. It takes a little guesswork to determine just why SunTrust has stopped dealing with all pawn shops. There’s no specific regulation saying the bank can’t work with them, and SunTrust would only reiterate to us that they had adopted the policy. And we did find other cases of SunTrust dropping pawn shops in other parts of the country. We’re not going to weigh in on whether or not it’s fair for banks to deny accounts to pawn shops or payday lenders, although Champion said it was an unfair end to two decades of banking. "I’ve heard about stuff like this," he told PolitFact Florida. "But it doesn’t matter either way, whether I’m a pawn shop or a gun shop, because I’m a legal business. This is not right." Choke Point FloridaNewsFlash.com writer Samuel McCall didn’t want to comment on the record about Champion’s story, but said he reported it the way Champion told it to him. McCall’s report tied the SunTrust letter to the aforementioned Operation Choke Point. The U.S. Justice Department started Operation Choke Point in 2012 as a way to stop banking fraud. The operation specifically investigated banks’ relationships with "third-party payment processors" -- the payment services that online stores often rely upon -- to determine if they were defrauding consumers. Gun rights advocates drew a connection between gun dealers and Choke Point from 2011 guidelines from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that identified so-called "high-risk" businesses that commonly use third-party payment processors. The guidelines warned merchants who used these services had higher than normal potential for committing fraud. The FDIC list included pawn shops, payday lenders, pornography and yes, firearms and ammunition dealers. (The list also included telemarketers, fireworks sellers, dating services and coin dealers, among others.) This list led to a firestorm of criticism that the government was attempting to shut down legal businesses through Choke Point, eventually resulting in an investigation by the House Oversight Committee. A report from chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., concluded in May 2014 that the FDIC list had become a sort of hit list of businesses for Choke Point to target. The Justice Department denied the charge, saying none of their cases involved legal businesses like gun dealers or porn, and the FDIC removed the list in July 2014. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush told us the three fraud cases that stemmed from Choke Point involved banks. "In no case has the department targeted any lawful enterprise, such as gun or ammunition sellers," he said. But the American Banking Association told us it was likely banks had been influenced by federal guidelines in some fashion, though it had no specific information about which ones or why. The FDIC addressed banking concerns with a letter in January 2015 urging banks to evaluate customers "on a case-by-case basis" instead of denying service to entire categories of businesses out of fear of not complying with federal law. In any case, the backlash against the program continues, with groups like the U.S. Consumer Coalition running a website allowing people to share their stories of businesses allegedly being affected by Choke Point. Brian Wise, senior adviser for the group, contends Choke Point has one purpose the government won’t admit: "To go after businesses they couldn’t legislate out of existence for the last two decades." Our ruling FloridaNewsFlash.com said, "Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns." Actually, the bank decided recently to end relationships with pawn shops, payday lenders and check cashers, but it will still work with firearms dealers. The FDIC has warned banks to examine relationships with customers that use third-party payment processors, because of the risk of consumer fraud, and a federal program called Operation Choke Point has investigated the same issue. Gun rights advocates have argued that Operation Choke Point is a backdoor way of targeting gun shops, but the government denies there’s any such plan to target gun dealers, and no one has been able to truly prove otherwise. Overall, we rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Florida News Flash	None	None	None	2015-04-08T14:12:06	2015-03-29	['None']

pomt-09418	Because of a local version of Amendment 4, "the taxpayers of St. Pete Beach have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/17/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/voter-control-over-land-use-issues-has-cost-st-pet/	Putting land use decisions directly in voters' hands will lead to an avalanche of lawsuits that is costly for taxpayers, says a group opposing a ballot initiative that would give voters more authority over those decisions. Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. Opponents to the amendment point to big legal bills in the 10,000-person town of St. Pete Beach as an example of the consequences of the measure. St. Pete Beach adopted a similar citizens' initiative process in 2006. Since 2006, "the taxpayers of St. Pete Beach have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills," says the group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, an offshoot of Floridians for Smarter Growth. The groups are being funded by business interests, including the Florida Chamber of Commerce, Publix and statewide homebuilders. As we mentioned in our earlier item on Amendment 4, there is a debate between supporters and opponents whether St. Pete Beach's experiences are analogous to the statewide ballot proposal. And while we plan to explore that analogy in a future Truth-O-Meter item, we still are examining the individual claims in the ad. St. Pete Beach certainly has had its share of legal issues since voters narrowly adopted City Charter changes in 2006 that require voter approval on amendments to the city's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. Some lawsuits were brought by the city, others were brought by the groups proposing the citizen approvals, others came from developers. In September 2009, city commissioners noted that they were party to five different lawsuits related to the development approval process. At the end of November, the total was six. Most of the lawsuits relate to the city's development approval process. The most contentious suit is about a series of comprehensive plan amendments approved in 2008 that were believed to be friendly to developers. A group opposed to those amendments -- the same group that originally petitioned to create the voter approval process -- claims that the ballot questions were not worded properly. What's the cost to taxpayers for all this litigation? Ryan Houck, executive director of Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, told PolitiFact Florida that the total is nearly $700,000. That's out of the city's $20.4 million annual budget. The city itself previously has provided differing estimates. In January, the St. Petersburg Times reported that legal fees associated with the development lawsuits have cost the city more than $300,000, with the costs spread out over four years. That figure was based on statements made by St. Pete Beach City Manager Mike Bonfield. But on Feb. 23, 2010, City Attorney Susan Churuti (the former Pinellas County attorney) told city commissioners the legal fees associated with development lawsuits were "something in the range of $200,000." Churuti, who works for the Tampa firm Bryant Miller Olive, said that was an unusually large amount of legal work for a town the size of St. Pete Beach. "For the size of your jurisdiction, you got a lot going on," Churuti told commissioners. "It's not normal." Churuti said that because of scheduled hearings, and other court actions, the total legal bill is sure to rise. Because the numbers were so different, we went to the city's finance director, Elaine Edmunds, for an explanation. She referred us to Collette Graston, Bonfield's executive assistant. Graston has been asked to keep track of all the legal expenses related to the comprehensive plan lawsuits. Including bills paid in March 2010, the city has spent a total of $734,000 on the development lawsuits, Graston said. The difference between the other city figures are most likely because they are old figures, or were in reference to only one particular case. "You're not the first person to ask," Graston said. "And you won't be the last." No matter the dollar figure, attorney's fees clearly have been a central discussion point at City Commission meetings. City Manager Mike Bonfield said the city has exceeded its legal budget several years in a row, almost entirely because of development related lawsuits. And one city commissioner last year proposed raising the tax rate slightly to add $50,000 to the city's legal budget. The reason? Primarily to fight the development lawsuits.

pomt-07575	"American troops have never been under the formal control of another nation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/29/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-american-troops-have-never-been-und/	During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News Show on March 23, 2011, Republican strategist Karl Rove addressed some of the issues surrounding U.S. involvement with its allies in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya. At one point, Hannity said: "The United States is basically saying, ‘We're not going to lead this thing.’ So, France is actually proposing a political steering company to run the war." After some crosstalk, Rove said, "Who is on that committee? American troops have never been under the formal control of another nation.Why should we start now?" We wondered whether it was true that American forces had never been "under the formal control of another nation." So we asked nine military historians and other experts in the field. And their view was unanimous. "No, that’s not correct," said Brett Schaefer, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Absolutely false," concluded Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina. "Rove’s comment is misleading and uninformed," added Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. "Coalition warfare and the leadership of foreign commanders has played a part in U.S. history since the War for Independence, when the commander of the troops of the predecessor colonies, George Washington, entrusted a key mission and command of 2,000 Continental soldiers to a French Major General, the Marquis de Lafayette," wrote the Congressional Research Service in a 2001 report. "Since 1900, there have been at least seventeen military operations in which the United States has placed U.S. troops under a foreign commander." Our panel of experts pointed to a litany of historical examples: • The Boxer Rebellion. U.S. forces took part in the "eight-nation alliance" sent to China after rebel forces known as "boxers" threatened westerners in the country. A 20,000-man force eventually captured Beijing, and the victorious powers imposed large reparations. According to the U.S. Navy, the first (and unsuccessful) offensive included 2,100 sailors and marines from the eight nations in the alliance -- Great Britain, Germany, Russia, France, the United States, Japan, Italy, and Austria -- under the control of British Admiral Edward Seymour. • World War I. Vice Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly of the British Royal Navy oversaw an effort based in Queenstown, Ireland, to protect commercial ships off the coast of France and Great Britain. Among the assets under his control was a U.S. destroyer squadron commanded by Cmdr. J.K. Taussig. Meanwhile, U.S. Battleship Division Nine, a four and later five-ship group commanded by Rear Adm. Hugh Rodman, became part of the allied Grand Fleet under the command of British Adm. David Beatty, based in Scapa Flow, Scotland. Finally, the 369th Infantry Regiment (known as the "Harlem Hellfighters") became the first all-black combat unit sent overseas in World War I. There was no U.S. combat role available for black soldiers at the time, so Gen. John J. Pershing sent the 369th and its affiliates to join the French army. For their efforts, the soldiers were awarded the French Croix de Guerre. • Russian Revolution. Three U.S. battalions joined British, Canadian, Italian, Finnish and Serbian units near Murmansk that were under the command of a British general during the Bolshevik Revolution, according to CRS. • World War II. The commander of U.S. forces in the China-Burma-India theater was British, though the personnel varied. Initially it was Gen. Archibald Wavell, the commander-in-chief in India. Then in 1943, Adm. Lord Mountbatten was named Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia forces. Technically, U.S. forces in China were commanded by Chaing Kai Shek, the Supreme Allied Commander in China, though U.S. military leaders played an unofficial command role. Meanwhile, British Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson succeeded U.S. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, ultimately receiving the title of Supreme Commander of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, which included Italy. Wilson was succeeded about a year later by British Field Marshal Harold Alexander. During the Battle of the Bulge, the U.S. First and Ninth armies fell under British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. And British Adm. Bertram Ramsay was in charge of all allied forces taking part in Operation Neptune, the naval effort that paved the way for the the D-Day invasion. Ramsay said Neptune was "probably the largest and most complicated operation ever undertaken." • Cold War. While the Supreme Allied Commander-Europe (or SACEUR) has traditionally been an American, NATO war plans put Americans under sub-commanders who were British or German. In fact, the general in charge of managing the defense of western Europe in the face of a Warsaw Pact attack was traditionally a German general, said Andrew Bacevich, a career Army officer who now teaches international relations at Boston University. Meanwhile, the post of deputy commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, better known as NORAD, has been held by a Canadian since the 1950s. So if the commander is away, U.S. forces would be taking orders from a Canadian. • Recent conflicts. The CRS report cites several recent examples of U.S. troops under foreign control. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a U.S. brigade was placed under operational control of a French commander. Beginning in 1992, the ground component of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Combined Forces Command was commanded by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy. Hundreds of troops have served in the Multinational Force in the Sinai, which has been commanded by non-Americans, including a Canadian. The Balkan conflicts of the 1990s offered several examples, according to CRS. The U.S. sent a 342-man Mobile Army Surgical Hospital to Zagreb, Croatia, for the use of a United Nations force under French command. In 1993, roughly 600 U.S. soldiers patrolled the Macedonian border under a Swedish commander. And at one point in the Kosovo conflict, 6,515 U.S. troops served under a French general in NATO’s Kosovo Force. Finally, experts told PolitiFact that small American units regularly operate under the tactical command of allied leaders in Afghanistan. "U.S. troops have served under tactical foreign command in a wide array of NATO and UN operations over the last 65 years," said Janda of Cameron University. "However, it’s not the case that foreign commanders can do whatever they want with U.S. forces that are under their control. The United States contributes limited forces to specific commands for defined periods of time under stringent guidelines and operational limits, closely monitors their activity, and always has the right to withdraw them or countermand orders involving our troops at our discretion. Those are the same limitations every U.S. ally puts on their forces that operate under our command as well." Indeed, several of our experts emphasized that there is a difference between operational control and full command. "In the legal sense, ‘control’ is just the authority to direct forces to do a mission, and we've done that since at least World War I," said James Jay Carafano, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "‘Command’ includes authority for military punishment, responsibility for logistics and so on. Nations hardly ever give command of their forces to other nations." When we presented our findings to Rove, he conceded through a spokesman that he was in error. He said he "had checked, quickly, for post-World War II (instances), but of course (PolitiFact is) right about World War I in which Americans were under foreign command, and it looks like there are instances in World War II where U.S. troops may have been under the operational command of British leadership." Ultimately, there are at leat 17 examples, stretching back longer than a century, in which U.S. forces have worked, mostly successfully, under foreign operational leadership. So we rate Rove's statement False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2011-03-29T09:52:24	2011-03-23	['United_States']
pomt-10318	"John McCain intervened, which helped Airbus get that Pentagon contract."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/31/campaign-money-watch/letters-dont-amount-to-intervening/	An independent political group called Campaign Money Watch has begun airing a TV ad that paints Sen. John McCain as a bought-and-paid-for politician who swung a lucrative defense contract to a European company over an American competitor. The issue is McCain's role in a highly contentious and much-publicized battle over a contract to build a fleet of air refueling tankers for the Air Force. Chicago-based Boeing has been at odds with a rival bidder, a partnership between U.S.-based Northrop Grumman and European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), the parent company of Airbus. To the surprise of many, Airbus was awarded the roughly $40-billion contract in March 2008, but the General Accounting Office upheld a protest from Boeing, concluding that the Air Force made a number of errors in the bidding process. The contract will now be re-bid. What's interesting about this attack is that McCain's role in this particular defense project has long been seen as one of taxpayer hero. The whole reason there was a competitive bid for a contract to build the tankers is because McCain led a charge to scrap the Air Force's original plan, which was to lease jetliners from Boeing. As McCain made noise, government studies concluded that costs for the lease plan had been vastly underestimated. People were fired, some went to jail. It was a big scandal, and McCain has rightly claimed credit for it on the trail. None of that background appears in the ad. The ad claims McCain's campaign helped steer the contract toward Airbus, thereby selling out thousands of U.S. workers. First the ad notes that McCain has accepted contributions from Airbus executives and that former Airbus lobbyists were working on his campaign. We ruled this claim True. Then the announcer in the ad states, "And guess what? John McCain intervened, which helped Airbus get that Pentagon contract." In September 2006, McCain sent two letters to Defense Department officials about factors they should or should not consider in deciding the contract. Specifically, he urged them to ignore lawsuits currently before the World Trade Organization between the United States and the European Union about government subsidies for aircraft manufacturers. Boeing claimed government subsidies gave Airbus an unfair advantage. McCain argued that to include the lawsuits as an evaluation factor would detract from the competition by adding "an element of arbitrariness and capriciousness." It would also be unprecedented, he said. So does that amount to intervening? Did it help Airbus get the contract? And did the promise of campaign contributions influence McCain? Keith Ashdown, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, doesn't think so. "The word 'intervening' is not a word I would use," he said. "He was making sure there was a competition." Besides, he said, McCain didn't have a vote on who got the contract, so he didn't have the power to steer it to either company. It wasn't his call. "Intervening" is a subjective term. Some would say two letters arguing against subsidy disputes not being included in the bid competition constitutes intervening. But to imply those letters swung the contract in Airbus' favor overstates McCain's influence. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Campaign Money Watch	None	None	None	2008-07-31T00:00:00	2008-06-09	['The_Pentagon', 'John_McCain']
pomt-09206	"The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous. This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment."	false	/florida/statements/2010/may/21/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-former-healthcare-ceo-barely-escaped-pr/	After virtually ignoring millionaire Rick Scott and his unconventional campaign for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum launched a full attack on May 18, 2010, criticizing Scott for his role as a former CEO of a national hospital chain that bilked state and federal health care programs. Scott, 57, has been running an unorthodox campaign, spending millions of dollars in television advertising three months before the Republican primary. He's casting himself as an outsider and a reformer. The descriptions get a chuckle from McCollum's campaign. "The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous," McCollum campaign manager Matt Williams said. "This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment, whose failure in business has been portrayed on national news and around the world. He is an embarrassment." Democratic frontrunner Alex Sink issued a similar critique saying that Scott's company -- Columbia/HCA -- had pleaded guilty to 14 felonies as part of a federal fraud investigation and was forced to pay a record $1.7 billion in fines. You can see that analysis here. In this item, we wanted to see if the McCollum campaign is right to say Scott "barely escaped imprisonment." First, some background about the Columbia/HCA saga. Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals with a plan to brand hospitals -- like soft drinks or a clothes line -- through aggressive growth. The chain quickly grew, and in 1994, purchased the 100-hospital HCA chain. Over time, the publicly traded company swelled to become the nation's largest hospital chain, growing to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries. That's the good news. Now for the bad. In 1997, federal authorities went public with a massive multipronged investigation into Columbia/HCA and whether it was bilking state and federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, authorities were investigating whether the hospital chain ordered unnecessary lab work and billed Medicare and Medicaid for the cost, whether it attached false diagnosis codes to patient records in order to increase reimbursement to the hospitals and whether it billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. Scott resigned as Columbia/HCA's CEO in the middle of the investigation in July 1997. The fraud cases ultimately were resolved as part of two federal settlements -- one in 2000 and another in 2002 -- where Columbia/HCA agreed to pay a record $1.7 billion in fines and also agreed to plead guilty to 14 felonies in five states. The U.S. Justice Department called the Columbia/HCA deal the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history. How close was Scott to going to prison for his part in the fraud case? Not at all. Four Florida based Columbia/HCA excutives ultimately were indicted as part of the fraud investigation, but not Scott. Two executives, Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside, were convicted of defrauding Medicare in 1999 and were sentenced to prison. Jarrell was sentenced to 33 months in prison; Whiteside got 24 months. Those convictions, however, were overturned on appeal. Two other executives also were prosecuted in the case. A Tampa federal jury acquitted Michael Neeb and failed to reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick. "With the reversal of the Whiteside and Jarrell convictions, not a single individual has been convicted as a result of this seemingly limitless cost-report investigation,'' Columbia/HCA's lawyers wrote in a March 2002 court filing. Walter P. Loughlin, HCA's lawyer during the investigation, said Whiteside and Jarrell were the only two executives ever convicted. And while Columbia/HCA did plead guilty to 14 felonies, those were corporate convictions -- meaning no one served prison time. We did find an ABC News transcript from August 1997 in which reporter Brian Ross said Scott was a target of federal investigators. On World News Tonight, Ross said: "Columbia has denied the fraud allegations. But its chairman -- Rick Scott -- and five other top corporate executives have resigned. And federal investigators told ABC News today that Scott is now considered a prime target of the investigation." But Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott was never even interviewed as part of the case. She pointed us to a 2009 Fortune article. "Scott's not Bernie Madoff or Leona Helmsley," the article said. "He has never been charged with wrongdoing. He was never even personally contacted by investigators." McCollum's statement was that Scott "barely escaped imprisonment," but the fact is he was never indicted, and the only individuals convicted of wrongdoing associated with the Columbia/HCA ultimately had those convictions tossed out. The corporate convictions aren't tied to any individual and carry only fines, not prison time. While one ABC News report does say he was a target of an investigation, that doesn't translate to barely escaping a prison sentence. We rate McCollum's claim False.

pomt-06353	Wisconsin ranks 48th out of all 50 states in venture capital investment.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/06/john-klenke/rep-klenke-says-wisconsin-ranks-48th-venture-capit/	These days, there’s one thing politicians of all stripes agree on: Wisconsin needs to add tens of thousands of jobs for the state to emerge from its economic downturn. Economic development experts say one way to get more people working is to encourage the growth of promising young businesses in high-impact fields such as biotechnology. Those often-risky endeavors can accelerate their growth with a boost from investor "angels" and companies that provide venture capital. State lawmakers have spent a lot of time in 2011 trying to determine if taxpayer money should be used to boost such companies. The most controversial strategy calls for the use of state certified capital companies, or CAPCOS, that would serve as an investment conduit between the state and the anticipated job-creators. Millions of dollars are at stake, especially for the firms that would be allowed to use the state money. One proposal called for $500 million to be invested in state firms over the course of six years. That’s 10 times the size of the last state venture capital plan, which had a spotty outcome. In October, one group of Assembly Republicans, led by Rep. John Klenke (R-Green Bay) pressed ahead with a plan they had been working on all year that included CAPCOs. The lawmakers made the rounds, including to the Journal Sentinel, where they laid out their case to solve what they called the "capital crisis." Klenke argued that the level of venture investment in the state was woefully low, one of the worst in the country. His presentation included a PowerPoint chart with this statement: Wisconsin ranks "48th out of all 50 states in venture capital investment." Well, that would be pretty low. Do we really stink as a venture capital state? Let’s peel the onion. First, let’s look briefly at why the idea of including CAPCOs is so controversial, and why those firms have pressed so hard to be included in a Wisconsin program. Journal Sentinel reporters Kathleen Gallagher and Mark Johnson have investigated the performance of CAPCOs in a previous, much smaller venture capital program. They found that one of the CAPCOs invested only about half of the $16.6 million it got under a Wisconsin program designed in the late 1990s to create jobs, taking advantage of loopholes in what some lawmakers are calling a poorly written, badly monitored law. Some $8 million in state money remains unaccounted for. Klenke argues that CAPCOs would get money to companies faster and focus more on younger companies than conventional venture investors. By citing the 48th-place ranking, Klenke makes the need for his plan seem even more urgent. There’s one problem: He’s wrong. When Klenke was questioned about his figures by Journal Sentinel reporters, he vigorously defended them. When we asked Klenke -- repeatedly -- about his assertion that Wisconsin ranks third from the bottom, he offered a brief emailed explanation five days later: "This was a typo from the slides. It was intended to reference the Kauffman Entrepreneurial Index." Oh. The Kauffman index measures new business creation in the U.S. The report Klenke mentioned was for the period 1996-2010. It does show Wisconsin ranking 48th. So where do we rank on venture capital? That information is readily available. The venture capital industry is carefully studied with data broken down by state, dollar amount and so forth. The "gold standard" is the quarterly "MoneyTree Report" issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the National Venture Capital Association. In the first nine months of 2011, venture capitalists have invested $66 million in 12 Wisconsin-based companies, making us No. 25 nationally for the amount of venture investing, the report says. For comparison purposes, California is No. 1 at $10.6 billion, followed by Massachusetts at $2.2 billion. Wisconsin is sandwiched between New Hampshire ($80 million) and New Mexico ($58 million). John Neis, managing director of Venture Investors LLC, the state’s largest venture capital firm, said the level of venture investing here lags when compared with other factors, such as our population. We’re 18th in that category. Part of the problem is geographic. Venture capitalists generally like to live near the firms they invest in and help run. Those firms are predominately on the east and west coasts. Venture capital plays an "absolutely critical role in a number of key industries," including information technology, clean tech and life sciences, Neis said. Those are among the fastest-growing sectors with the highest paying jobs. For 2010, there was $121 million in venture investments in Wisconsin -- and $84 million went to two companies, Neis said. As Neis puts it: "We’re way behind." But, he also notes there are a dozen states that have no venture capital under management at all. Our conclusion Klenke says the Legislature should approve a venture capital plan that includes the use of controversial out-of-state investment firms -- and, to make the case in presentations, he emphasizes the sorry state of venture capital investing here. But we’re not 48th of 50, as he claims. He’s overstated our situation, and confused his reports. We rate Klenke’s statement False.

Obama has always had a 100 percent prochoice rating."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/06/barack-obama/obama-voted-consistently-for-abortion-rights/	The Clinton campaign has raised doubts about Sen. Barack Obama's record on abortion rights because he voted "present" rather than "no" on seven antiabortion bills when he was in the Illinois state Senate. The day before the Super Tuesday primaries, an e-mail from the head of the Connecticut National Organization for Women took issue with those votes, prompting a response from U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, an Obama supporter, who said the effort by NOW was divisive. "The facts are clear – in the Illinois state Senate, choice advocates asked strong prochoice legislators like Senator Obama to vote 'present' on Republican-designed bills like a ban on partial-birth abortion to protect a woman's right to chose," DeLauro wrote. "Senator Obama has always had a 100 percent prochoice rating." We're addressing the votes with this item and this article, so here we'll focus on Obama's record. Indeed, DeLauro is correct. Obama has 100 percent congressional voting ratings from NARAL Prochoice America for his three years in the U.S. Senate. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund similarly gave Obama a perfect score on its 2006 congressional scorecard. He also earned 100 percent records for his votes in eight years as a state senator, according to Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council. (She is neutral in the presidential race and her group has not endorsed a candidate.) "He has always voted in favor of abortion rights," she said. So we find DeLauro's statement to be True.

pomt-08185	"We were one of the first states in the U.S. to build sewers, to bring the treatment plant on line."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/28/jamie-samons/rhode-island-was-one-first-states-build-sewers-and/	In hindsight, World Toilet Day came not a moment too soon. With a sputtering economy and high unemployment, Rhode Island has had precious few bright spots to brag about in recent years. But on Nov. 19, the Narragansett Bay Commission, which operates two major sewage-treatment plants, celebrated World Toilet Day by pointing with pride to some of the most dark and foul parts of our state: the sewers. "Think about it," Narragansett Bay Commission public affairs manager Jamie Samons said. "We were one of the first states in the U.S. to build sewers, to bring the treatment plant on line, and now we’re tackling CSOs (combined sewer overflows). How lucky are we to know that we can flush reliably." Truth be told, it’s been awhile since we’ve thought about that topic. But with World Toilet Day as our inspiration, we decided to give it some thought. So we set out to prove or disprove the claim that Rhode Island was "one of the first states" to build sewers and a sewage treatment plant. A 1990 Narragansett Bay Commission document, "Reclaiming Our Resources: A History of The Providence Sewage Treatment System," sets the scene, taking us to the year 1854 when Providence, then the seventh largest U.S. city, faced its second cholera epidemic in five years. The city’s superintendent of health, Dr. Edwin Snow, describes the Moshassuck River as "filthy as any common sewer," saying "the stench arising from it at times pervades the whole neighborhood" and "at any time, dogs, cats and hogs may be seen in the water in every stage of decomposition." But there’s good news: "In the 1870s a sewer system was constructed which conveyed the city’s waste to be discharged through a series of 65 combined sewer overflows into the rivers and harbor," the document states. And in 1884, Providence sent City Engineer Samuel M. Gray to Europe to study the latest methods of treating household and industrial waste. He recommended a system to collect sewage at Field’s Point and treat it with a "chemical precipitation method" used in England. In 1901, the Providence Sewage Treatment system began operating, and the commission document says, "The chemical precipitation plant, the third of its kind in the United States, was described as ‘The largest of its type ever built.’ " So did that make us "one of the first"? To begin with, America certainly wasn’t the first country to come up with this sewer idea. In the Mesopotamian empire (3500 to 2500 BC), some homes were connected to a stormwater drain system to carry away waste, and the Romans built the Cloaca Maxima (AKA the central sewer system) in about 800 BC, according to P.F. Cooper’s "Historical Aspects of Wastewater Treatment." Also, Rhode Island certainly wasn’t the first place in America with sewers. New York, Chicago and Boston battle it out over which had the first sewer system, says Jon Schladweiler, the Arizona Water Association historian who runs the sewerhistory.org website and a traveling exhibit on sewer history. But Providence wasn’t far behind the front runners, he says. Brooklyn began construction in 1857 of "the first effective planned sewerage system in the country designed to remove sanitary wastes and stormwater," and Chicago began building "the premiere sewer system of the time" in 1859, according to Martin V. Melosi's "The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present." In "The Impact of Sanitary Reform," Jon A. Peterson says New York built about 125 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1865, and Boston installed about 100 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1873. He also mentions sewer projects under way in the 1850s in Chicago and Jersey City, N.J. And he says, "In New England, where urbanization had advanced furthest, engineers devised major systems for Providence in 1869." Providence also gets some love in a footnote found in "American Sewerage Practice," a seminal 1914 text by Leonard Metcalf and Harrison P. Eddy. "The sewerage system of Providence was declared in 1881 by Rudolph Hering, after a personal investigation of such work in our cities and in Europe, to be equal to anything abroad and much better than the work elsewhere in this country. The system was designed in 1869 by J. Herbert Shedd, then chief engineer of the water works and later city engineer." And "Mr. Shedd’s report of 1874 on these sewerage works was long a famous engineering document," Metcalf and Eddy say. "It is only right to point out that the Providence sewers formed for some years the model American system." You hear that, Connecticut? "Model American system." After a shout-out from Metcalf and Eddy, it’s safe to say Rhode Island enjoyed sewer All-Star status. But did we also have one of the first sewage treatment plants? Metcalf and Eddy say, "The first extensive treatment plant utilized chemical precipitation and was built in Worcester, Mass., in 1889-1890." Sewerhistory.org mentions an East Orange, N.J., treatment plant built in 1888 or 1889. And in "Municipal Wastewater Treatment," Andrew Stoddard says, "In 1886, the first wastewater treatment plant was constructed to protect beaches at Coney Island." But, hot dog, Providence wasn’t far behind with its treatment plant starting to hum in 1901. And by 1909, there were still only 19 cities with more than 30,000 people treating their sewage, Joel A. Tarr notes in "Goodbye to the Flush Toilet." So after reviewing the claim that Rhode Island was "one of the first states" with sewers and a sewage treatment plan -- a phrase that leaves plenty of wiggle room -- we rate Samons' statement True. We should mention that in later years Providence’s sewage treatment became a disgrace. By the 1970s, the deteriorating plant was spewing nearly 65 million gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage each day into Rhode Island’s waters. But in 1980, voters approved an $87.7-million bond issue for improvements, the Narragansett Bay Commission was formed, and by 1995 the Environmental Protection Agency was naming the treatment plant best of its size in the nation. So next time World Toilet Day comes around, don't just sit there. Stand up and cheer.	None	Jamie Samons	None	None	None	2010-11-28T00:01:00	2010-11-17	['United_States']
pomt-07353	Georgia is "one of only about seven states in the country" that has a AAA bond rating.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/may/09/nathan-deal/deal-touts-georgias-bond-rating/	Despite all of this state’s budget troubles and the struggling economy, Georgia’s no deadbeat, Gov. Nathan Deal said. During a speech before the Atlanta Press Club that looked back at his work during the first 100 days of his administration, Deal said Georgia’s long-standing practices have kept it in good financial shape. Deal’s evidence was our state’s bond rating. "We have maintained our AAA bond rating. We are one of only about seven states in the country that has such a rating," Deal said. One in "about seven" states? That sounds great for Georgia, but do so few states have such good credit? First, here’s a short primer on bonds. If Georgia needs more money than it has on hand for a major public project, it doesn’t borrow from a bank. Instead, it issues bonds, which are promises to pay back a loan with interest over a set period of time. "It’s just like a huge mortgage, essentially," said Lee McElhannon, the director of bond finance at the Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission. Members of the public buy the bonds as they would any investment. To figure out the likelihood that the state will make good on its bond, they consult information from the three major credit ratings companies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. These corporations analyze states’ credit worthiness and assign their bonds ratings based on factors such as the state’s existing debt, government framework, and economy. The highest rating is AAA (or Aaa for Moody’s). A high rating means a state will likely have an easier time raising money. We contacted Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield, who gave us more information. She said Georgia is one of eight, not seven, states that maintain a AAA bond rating with the three credit ratings companies, she said. We checked with the three ratings agencies and found she’s correct. The other states are Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia. A AAA rating takes some work to get. Only 4 percent earn that rating from Standard & Poor’s in the public finance sector, which includes state bond ratings, said Robin Prunty, managing director for state ratings. Every ratings agency says the state’s bond outlook is stable. Georgia has held on to its Moody’s Aaa rating since 1974, according to a report the agency issued in April. In conclusion: The actual number of states with AAA ratings from all major credit rating agencies is eight. But since Deal hedged and said "about seven," and his overall point was that Georgia’s credit is exceptional, we’ll give him a True.

pomt-01022	Wisconsin requires, "by law, a photo ID to vote."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/30/scott-walker/does-wisconsin-which-used-photo-id-once-require-it/	Here’s a claim Gov. Scott Walker made on the campaign trail, in Iowa, that he probably would not have made in Wisconsin: "We require in our state, by law, a photo I.D. to vote." That made us, as regular Wisconsin voters, say: Really? Walker’s speech First, let’s flesh out the claim. Walker made it during his Jan. 24, 2015 speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, a gathering of Republicans in Des Moines that featured several potential presidential candidates. The governor highlighted what he called the "common-sense conservative agenda that we’ve enacted in our state," trumpeting "pro-life legislation," defunding Planned Parenthood, tort reform and legalizing the concealed carry of handguns. Then he added: "And we believe it’s important to protect the integrity -- the integrity -- of each and every vote cast. So we require in our state, by law, a photo I.D. to vote." In one sense, Walker was careful in saying that "by law," Wisconsin requires photo I.D. But he was also misleading. As a result of ongoing legal battles, the law has been used only once, in a low-turnout primary nearly three years ago. The state of the law Here’s a recent history of photo I.D. in Wisconsin, based on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports and information from the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. May 25, 2011: Walker signs Act 23, which makes various changes in voting regulations. Its main requirement is that residents present a document, including photo identification, in order to vote. The document could be, among other things, a driver’s license, passport, state I.D. or a college I.D.. Feb. 21, 2012: The voter I.D. law is used for a primary election. The only state offices that were on the ballot were six circuit court judgeships, one each in six counties. March 2012: In separate cases, two state judges in Dane County enjoin the law on state constitutional grounds. In other words, the law can’t be used. April 29, 2014: The law suffers another setback, this time in federal court, when U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman in Milwaukee strikes it down. Adelman rules the law violates the federal Voting Rights Act and says it "will prevent more legitimate votes from being cast than fraudulent votes." Aug. 1, 2014: The law gets a boost from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which upholds it in the two Dane County cases. But the law remains blocked because of the federal litigation. Sept. 12, 2014: Back in federal court, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago reinstates the law, ordering it be used for the Nov. 4, 2014, elections. (The appeals court also rules, on Oct. 6, 2014, that the law is constitutional.) Oct. 9, 2014: The appeals court ruling is put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court, out of concerns that there was not enough time to implement it before the Nov. 4, 2014 elections. Jan. 7, 2015: The U.S. Supreme Court is asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to strike down the law. The high court has not yet announced whether it will take the case. Quite a winding road -- leaving us where? Waiting. According to Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel of the Government Accountability Board: The U.S. Supreme Court could decide to hear the case and issue a final ruling. Or it could refuse to hear the case, which would mean the federal appeals court ruling upholding the law would stand. Our rating Touting a number of conservative actions he has taken as governor, Walker said Wisconsin requires, "by law, a photo I.D. to vote." The 2011 voter I.D. law that Walker signed is on the books, although it has been used only once, in a February 2012 primary. Since then, the law has been blocked amid court challenges. And it can’t be enforced until there is a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. Walker’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-14902	The Koch Brothers are "spending more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties" in the 2016 elections.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/06/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-koch-brothers-are-outspending-either-/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently urged students at George Mason University and across the nation to stand against the Koch brothers. Multibillionaires Charles and David Koch run Koch Industries, headquartered in Wichita, Kan. They’ve generated headlines in recent years for their roles in creating conservative fundraising groups - including Americans for Prosperity - that are not required to disclose their donors or the amounts each gave. Sanders lit into the Koch brothers at an Oct. 28 rally for his Democratic presidential campaign that was held at GMU and live-streamed across the nation. "You all have one vote, and I hope you’ll exercise that vote," he said. "The Koch brothers - second-wealthiest family and extreme right wing family - they also have one vote, but they are going to spend some $900 million in this campaign to try to elect candidates who will cut Social Security, Medicare, federal aid to education and environmental programs. "When you have one family - this is America, this it not some small Third World country - when in the United States of America you have one family spending more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties, that is not democracy. That is oligarchy, and we have got to change that." The GMU rally hardly was the first time Sanders has claimed the Koch brothers personally will outspend either party this election cycle. It’s a standard line in his stump speech, and we wondered whether it’s true. We asked Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, for evidence. He sent us a link to the two political parties’ spending during the most recent presidential campaign and reports about projected spending for the Koch brothers’ political network leading up to the 2016 election. Political party spending In 2012, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee collectively spent $647 million, according to tallies from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics that Gunnels cited. The center’s figures show that the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Senatorial Committee together spent $674.5 million. The figures Gunnels cited were for each national party’s major fundraising organization for presidential and congressional races. But the total amount raised by the parties went higher, because both Democrats and Republicans have additional committees - such as state and local party organizations - that also spend money on campaigns. All told, the Democratic Party spent nearly $1.1 billion and the Republican Party spent slightly more than $1 billion in 2012, according to the center’s figures. Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the center, said her group doesn’t have an estimate for how much the parties will spend for the 2016 elections, although she expects total overall spending will increase from the 2012 cycle. Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending, told us he expects each party’s spending this cycle would be either the same or greater than it was in 2012. Koch network projected spending Gunnels referred us to a January 2015 story in The New York Times that said the Koch brothers told a gathering of mega-donors that their political network set a goal of spending $889 million in the next two years. The article said that type of goal would require a significant commitment from the roughly 300 donors the Kochs had recruited in recent years. Because the Kochs’ political network consists of nonprofit groups that don’t have to identify their donors, The Times said it would be impossible to determine how much of the money ultimately is contributed by the brothers and how much comes from other donors. As The Washington Post noted in an October fact check about a similar Sanders claim, the brothers released further details in Koch Industries’ June newsletter, saying that only one-third of their fundraising goal would be spent on presidential, congressional, state and local races. The remaining two-thirds, the newsletter said, would help "support research and educational programs, scholarships and other efforts designed to change policies and promote a culture of freedom in the United States," including donations to the United Negro College Fund and criminal justice reform. In an October radio interview with American Public Media’s "Marketplace," Charles Koch dialed back the spending projection, saying he expected his political network to spend $750 million, with about $250 million of it dedicated to campaigns. "And as I said, a very small portion of that 250 (million) comes from the so-called Koch brothers, and even less from me than from my brother, because everybody can choose what they want to give to," Koch said in the radio interview. "So it isn't the Koch brothers doing it. It's other people doing it." "Marketplace" host Kai Ryssdal said that sounded disingenuous. "You have money in politics throughout the system, and for you to sit there and say, ‘I'm sorry, this isn't really us,’ doesn't ring true and will not ring true when people hear this interview," Ryssdal said. Our ruling Sanders said "one family" - the Koch brothers - will spend more than either major political party in the 2016 campaign. Since it’s too early to know what each party will spend on the next year’s elections, Sanders bases his claim on what each party’s congressional and presidential campaign committees spent in the 2012 cycle. That came to $647 million by Democrats and $675 million by Republicans. These, however, are low-ball figures. When spending by the parties’ state and local committees are considered, the total rises to about $1.1 billion for Democrats and $1 billion for Republicans. On the other hand, Sanders high-balls the Kochs’ plans, pointing their announced goal in January to raise $900 million and not their updated estimate last month of raising $750 million. In either case, the Kochs made it clear that most of the money would not come from their own pockets but from a political network of anonymous contributors. Sanders also overlooks the Kochs’ assurances that only one-third of the money will go to political campaigns, with the remainder dedicated to research and educational programs that "promote a culture of freedom." So anyway you dice it, it does not appear that the Koch brothers will outspend either one of the major political parties in next year’s elections. The burden is on Sanders to prove otherwise, and he falls short. We rate his statement False.

pomt-14637	Says Mexico can afford to build a wall because the country's trade deficit with America is billions of dollars.	false	/florida/statements/2016/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-course-mexico-can-pay-wall-becau/	Donald Trump’s critics say Mexico can’t or won’t pay for a wall at the border, which he says is hogwash. "When they say ‘but Mexico can't pay for the wall,’ I say of course they can," said the Republican frontrunner at a town hall in Norwalk, Iowa, on Jan. 20. "We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. Humongous. It's a humongous number. It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall. The wall's peanuts compared to that." Trump’s statement prompted these questions: What is the amount of the trade deficit and the cost to build the wall? Mostly importantly, does a big trade deficit mean the Mexican government has money to pay for a wall? The Trump campaign did not respond for this fact-check. The size of the trade deficit The U.S.-Mexico trade deficit was $50 billion for 2014. It was about $54 billion for the first 11 months of 2015. That means Mexico sold the United States $54 billion more in goods and services than the United States sold to Mexico. Balanced trade -- in which exports and imports are equal -- is rare. The U.S. economy has run overall trade deficits in every year since 1976. Sorting out the costs to build a wall is messier. Cost of a border wall The border with Mexico is about 1,900 miles. Federal law in 2006 required the construction of an approximately 700-mile fence. Border fencing and associated costs added up to about $6 billion as of 2012. "It’s a lot more expensive than we expected when we started, and it was much more difficult," said Ronald Vitiello, deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, before a Senate committee in May. But the costs have left Trump, who promised to "build a great wall," undeterred. His immigration plan includes no price tag, although he wants to force Mexico to pay for it by taking money from remittances and jacking up fees on visas. News reports estimating the price of a wall have varied widely. For the fence already built, the costs fluctuated depending upon the terrain. A Congressional Research Service report noted in 2009 that the challenges include "costs versus benefits, location, design, environmental impact, potential diplomatic ramifications, and the costs of acquiring the land needed for construction." Media reports we saw to complete such a wall ranged from $5.1 billion to $25 billion — plus additional costs to maintain it. "The only way to come up with any type of real cost estimate, you would have to do what we did: Get the Army Corps of Engineers or somebody else to survey and plan and come up with a fence type, and environmental impacts," said Thad Bingel, a senior official at Customs and Border Patrol during the George W. Bush administration. From an engineering standpoint, it’s possible to do it. But the cost would be enormous, and it would be more efficient to invest in equipment or staff, he said. "Largely the reason we didn’t fence those portions was Border Patrol didn’t think we needed fencing there," because those portions had a river, mountains or a lot of desert, Bingel said. Trade deficit has nothing to do with cost of the wall So let’s review what we know so far: The trade deficit is about $50 billion. It’s difficult to pinpoint a price to build the wall, although the estimates we saw were smaller than the deficit. However, the bigger problem with Trump’s statement is he suggested Mexico can afford to pay for the wall because of the amount of the trade deficit. There is no proof of that. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no connection between the size of the trade deficit and finding money to build the wall. "Trump’s connection of the trade deficit with a Mexican border fence is just nonsense," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Just because the Mexican economy has a trade surplus relative to the United States doesn’t mean the Mexican government has the resources to build a border wall. It would be like me threatening my neighbor to build a new fence or else I’ll stop shopping at Walmart." Mark Perry, a University of Michigan professor and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the trade deficit is based mostly on trading and investment by private individuals and companies -- not the government itself. "It’s not like there is $54 billion sitting around somewhere in Mexico, like a magic pile of dollars, that could be used to build a wall," he said. The Mexican government does not have adequate funds to pay for health, education or roads -- much less build a wall, said Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that analyzes globalization. "The trade surplus does not represent money in some idle bank account controlled by the Mexican government," he said. Our ruling Trump said, "When they say Mexico can't pay for the wall, I say of course they can. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. ... It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall." The trade deficit is about $50 billion. Estimates to build a wall vary widely, though the ones we saw were smaller than the trade deficit. It’s impossible to know a precise figure because Trump hasn’t offered a detailed plan. However, Trump’s overall message here is misleading because he suggests that the size of the trade deficit is proof that Mexico could pay for the wall. In reality, the trade deficit has nothing to do with whether the Mexican government could afford to write the United States a check to build the wall.

pomt-05852	Maryland is "creating jobs at 2 ½ times the rate that Virginia is."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/13/martin-omalley/gov-omalley-says-maryland-creating-jobs-2-12-times/	The growing rivalry between Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is on national tour. The two faced off Feb. 5 on CNN’s State of the Union, disagreeing on why the economy has improved. McDonnell, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, gave all the credit to job-creation policies by GOP governors and was dismissive of President Barack Obama’s efforts. O’Malley, head of the Democratic Governor’s Association, lauded the president’s "choices and policies." McDonnell criticized O’Malley’s proposals this year that Maryland raise its income tax on top earners, as well as increase levies on gas and cigars. McDonnell boasted that Virginia’s 6.2 percent unemployment rate trumps Maryland’s 6.9 percent rate. O’Malley corrected McDonnell; Maryland’s rate was 6.7 percent in December, the most recent figures available. "And we’re creating jobs at 2 ½ times the rate Virginia is," O’Malley said. We’ll stipulate O’Malley is correct about about his state’s unemployment rate. But his claim that Maryland is creating jobs at 2 ½ times the pace of Virginia was news to us. So we checked it out. Raquel Guillory, O’Malley’s chief of communications, told us her boss’s statement was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She sent us two sets of BLS numbers to back O’Malley’s claim. The data compared seasonally-adjusted employment figures in Maryland and Virginia. In January 2011, Maryland had 2,508,300 non-farm jobs. The number rose by 30,300 in December, to 2,538,600. That’s a 1.21 percent increase. Virginia had 3,641,100 non-farm jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 22,000 in December, to 3,663,100. That’s an 0.6 percent increase. Maryland’s rate of increase, under O’Malley’s formula, would be two times Virginia’s rate. The second set of numbers compared private-sector employment. In January 2011, Maryland had 2,011,900 private jobs. The number rose by 25,600 in December, to 2,037,500. That’s a 1.27 percent increase. Virginia had 2,941,200 private jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 15,900 in December, to 2,957,100. That’s an 0.54 percent increase. So Maryland’s rate of increase, under O’Malley’s formula, would be roughly 2-1/3 times Virginia’s rate. Do O’Malley’s numbers prove Maryland is outperforming Virginia? Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, questioned O’Malley’s methodology of comparing the first month of 2011 with the last. He said economists usually compare job numbers from the same month over a period of years to remove any possibility of seasonal distortion, such as Christmas or summer employment. Kara Markley, a mid-Atlantic regional economist with the BLS, made a similar observation. "We would typically compare the same month year-to-year with the not seasonally-adjusted data," she said. That data paints a far different picture from the one O’Malley framed. In December 2011, Maryland added 24,700 jobs to its 2,529,300 tally from the previous December -- a 0.98 percent increase. Virginia added 35,600 jobs to its total of 3,644,500 from 2010 -- an 0.97 percent increase. By that method, Maryland’s job creation rate topped Virginia by 1/100th of 1 percent. Using the same month-to-month method, we ran a comparison for all of 2010 and 2011. Virginia came out ahead in eight months, Maryland did better in four. Howard Wial, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said monthly employment numbers from each state are voluble and can be greatly impacted by the hiring or firing decisions of a single corporation. So who’s the better job creator, Maryland or Virginia? O’Malley or McDonnell? Rephann said these are complicated questions that would require many years of data, and analyses of policies and the impact of federal employment in each state. "I don’t know how you could demonstrate, over a given year, which state had the better policies," he said. Time and again, economists have told us politicians take far too much credit for job gains and assign far to much blame for losses. The O’Malley-McDonnell squabble evoked the same response. "Governor’s really don’t control their economies," Wial said. "It’s political theater," Rephann said. Our ruling:. O’Malley said Maryland is creating jobs at 2½ times the rate of Virginia. He based his statement on the two state’s employment numbers in January and December of 2011 and comparing the percentages of increase. Maryland came out ahead under O’Malley’s formula, but not quite by the magnitude the governor claimed. Two economists told us better measurements would come from comparing unadjusted job figures from the same month in different years. Under this formula, using numbers from December 2010 and December 2011, the two states essentially came out even. When we compared each month in 2010 to its counterpart in 2011, Virginia usually came out ahead of Maryland. So O’Malley’s claim only approaches validity when he gets to cherry-pick the data. We rate his statement False.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2012-02-13T11:30:00	2012-02-05	['Virginia', 'Maryland']
