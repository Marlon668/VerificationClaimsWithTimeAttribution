pomt-07836	Orrin Hatch co-sponsored a 1993 health care bill that had an individual mandate.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/cenk-uygur/hatch-once-supported-individual-mandate-said-cenk-/	With Keith Olbermann's recent departure from MSNBC, the cable news channel has re-shuffled its liberal talk show hosts and added a new pundit, Cenk Uygur (pronounced Jenk You-grr). Uygur recently ripped Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for courting the tea party movement. First, Uygur showed video of Hatch saying that he, like the tea party, was opposed to the health care law. "I was the one who raised the issue about the job-killing employer mandate, and of course the unconstitutional employee mandate," Hatch said. "I've been all over the world for our country. Everywhere we go, people have always been amazed by America. And yet, we're in danger of losing the greatest country in the world. So we've got to fight back." "Here's what I'm amazed by -- Orrin Hatch," Uygur said. "You're going to tell me you're tea party? There's no one who's more Republican establishment than Orrin Hatch, who's been there for approximately 800 years. ... By the way, did you hear him putting dirt on the mandate? He said, oh, I can't put a mandate. I'm totally against that. Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? ... It's unbelievable." We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years. (Hatch was elected in 1976, not 1210.) But we were interested in Uygur's comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate. We wondered if that were actually the case, so we decided to check it out. Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups. To counter that, the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls. Chafee's plan, one of several Republican alternatives, created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies. It also required everyone to buy insurance -- an individual mandate. Chafee's plan was backed by a group of Republican senators, including Hatch, according to news reports from the time. When the plan was formally introduced as legislation, Hatch was one of the co-sponsors. Two other current senators also co-sponsored the plan: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. We examined the old legislation, which we found in the THOMAS legislative database. The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law. The main difference is how the fines work for those who don't buy insurance. The new law sets a dollar amount; the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We contacted Hatch's office to ask for an explanation for Hatch's change of position, but we didn't hear back. Last year, Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who had also co-sponsored the plan. Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993, backing away from policies on health care they once supported. Uygur asked, "Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate?" We didn't, but we checked the record. Hatch was the co-sponsor of a Republican-backed bill that included an individual mandate. We rate Uygur's statement True.	None	Cenk Uygur	None	None	None	2011-02-14T15:40:07	2011-02-09	['None']

pomt-02802	"Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/02/facebook-posts/facebook-group-says-congress-has-raised-minimum-wa/	The idea of raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour is becoming a hot button issue. Supporters say that wage is so low it forces the working poor to seek out food stamps to survive, adding to the burden of taxpayers and subsidizing the profits of low-paying companies such as Walmart and McDonalds. Critics say that raising the minimum wage kills jobs, makes it harder for companies to hire new workers, and adds to the costs of goods and services for everyone. (Nineteen states have their own minimum wage laws that exceed the federal base. Among them is Rhode Island, where the minimum wage, now $7.75, goes to $8 on Jan. 1.) Raise the Minimum Wage, a Facebook group that wants Congress to pass an $11 minimum wage, is criticizing Congress, claiming it’s quick to give itself pay increases but slow to raise the minimum wage. It posted a picture of the Internet's well-known "Grumpy Cat" accompanied by this message: "Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times." It has been shared more than 8,800 times. We wondered whether the data are correct. To count the number of minimum wage increases since 1988, we turned to the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its handy chart shows that in 1981, Congress had set the minimum wage at $3.35 per hour, where it remained until April 1, 1990, when it rose to $3.80. Since then, there have been six additional increases. That's seven in all, not three as the Facebook post asserts. And how often has Congressional pay increased? For that data, we turned to a Nov. 4, 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress, which tracked pay going back to 1789. In 1988, members of Congress earned $89,500 per year. The following year, Congress passed a law establishing automatic pay increases for itself unless the House and Senate specifically voted to forego raises, which it has done repeatedly. The law was amended in 1991. Since then, members of the House have seen their annual pay increase 14 times. The Senate has received 15 increases, which is the number the Facebook post got correct. Members of both bodies now receive $174,000 per year, with leaders receiving additional pay. So where did Raise the Minimum Wage get the idea that there have only been three minimum wage increases? It comes from that fact that the seven increases were the result of three Congressional votes, in 1989, 1996 and 2007. By that standard, Congress has only voted twice to increase its pay, although those votes produced 15 pay hikes. One commenter on the Facebook page said, "The minimum wage should be increased by the same percent each time Congress gets a pay raise." In fact, the minimum wage is now 116 percent higher than it was in 1988. By contrast, the pay for members of Congress has increased by 94 percent and inflation has increased by 97 percent. Our ruling A posting by the Facebook group Raise the Minimum Wage said, "Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times." Although Congress has scored 15 pay increases thanks to the automatic formula it adopted in 1989, it has also approved seven increases in the minimum wage during that period, not three. Because the posting ignores more than half the minimum wage increases since 1988 while giving the false impression that Congress has actively voted itself raises 15 times, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11619	Says "22 to 24 people" came into the United States due to family connection with suspect in the October 2017 New York City terror attack.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-unsubstantiated-claims-about-chain-m/	President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that more than 20 people have migrated to the United States due to family ties to a terror attack suspect. A man drove a truck onto a bike lane and pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on Oct. 31, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why "chain migration" and a visa lottery program should end. "This man that came in — or whatever you want to call him — brought in, with him, other people … He was the point of contact — the primary point of contact for — and this is preliminarily — 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that’s not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we’ve wanted to do that for a long time," Trump said Nov. 1. Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: "So the lottery has to end, chain migration — he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why?" Two days earlier during a meeting on immigration with bipartisan lawmakers, Trump said it was "22 to 24 people came in through him." We wondered if Trump was right: have at least 22 people come to the United States due to familial links to Saipov? Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security provided information to substantiate Trump’s claims. A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases. Experts told us Trump’s figures are improbable. Green card holders have limits on family sponsorship Saipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States. Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old. That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J. "Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false," said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. Once in the United States, green card holders, such as Saipov, are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children. We have not seen any reports of 29-year-old Saipov fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the United States since his arrival. Generally, is it possible for one green card holder to bring in 22 or more relatives? "It may be possible, but it’s very unlikely," said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute working with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program. "Theoretically, if someone had many foreign-born children, and those children had many children, they could sponsor one spouse, plus 21 children and grandchildren. The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children." But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said. A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members. As the New York Times and Washington Post’s Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen (he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him. There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a "fourth-preference" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years. The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, "benefited from extended family chain migration" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said. Ullah, accused of setting of a pipe bomb inside a New York City subway terminal, is also a green card holder. The department did not describe Saipov as having "extended family chain migration." Our ruling Trump said that "22 to 24 people" came into the United States due to family connection with the suspect in the October 2017 New York City terror attack. The Trump administration did not provide any information to support this repeated claim about Saipov. Green card holders, such as Saipov, can only petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States. Media reports indicate that Saipov married a woman who already lived in the United States and that their three children were born in the United States. Saipov could not have petitioned parents or siblings in his current immigration status. Without evidence to support it, we rate Trump's claim False.

pomt-03975	Says he was the first local official to endorse Barack Obama	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/13/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-says-he-was-early-obama-supporter-cu/	First impressions mean a lot in politics. And for Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, who is gearing up for a run at Ohio Gov. John Kasich next year, they are especially important. A Democrat who previously served as mayor of Lakewood, FitzGerald is not well-known beyond Greater Cleveland. He has been traveling the state for nearly a year in an effort to build relationships with party activists who can help make him a credible candidate. The effort intensified last month when ex-Gov. Ted Strickland, a fellow Democrat, said he would not seek a rematch with Kasich, a Republican. FitzGerald has been the most active in a group of potential challengers that also includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and former Rep. Betty Sutton. While speaking last month at the Ohio College Democrats’ winter conference in Cincinnati, FitzGerald mixed his dry humor with political biography. He presented himself as a reformer -- a theme familiar to local voters who elected him to lead them past a corruption scandal. The boast that caught our eye was one reported by the Cincinnati Enquirer: "He proudly said that he was the first Cuyahoga County official to endorse President Barack Obama." PolitiFact Ohio found the line interesting and wanted more context. We reached out to the Ohio Republican Party, which sends trackers to capture FitzGerald’s public remarks on video. (FitzGerald frequently jokes that the trackers’ jobs are the only ones Kasich can take credit for creating, but we’ll set that claim aside as political hyperbole.) Video provided by the GOP shows FitzGerald made the claim about his Obama endorsement toward the end of a 20-minute speech. While praising the young crowd for its engagement, he drew inspiration from Obama. He recognized Ohio Senate Minority Leader Eric Kearney, who spoke before him, and noted that Kearney was an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 campaign. Then FitzGerald continued: "I was the first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse him." Cuyahoga County has nearly 60 municipalities, each with its own set of elected leaders. Obama began his campaign for the presidency in early 2007. At the time, FitzGerald was a city councilman and mayoral aspirant in Lakewood, Cleveland’s second-largest suburb. FitzGerald won his race for mayor that year and was in office by the time the 2008 primary season began. A search of Plain Dealer archives revealed then-County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones as one of Obama’s key local supporters in early 2007. Jones was one of several local officials to attend an Obama’s first Northeast Ohio event Feb. 27, an East Side rally less than three weeks after Obama officially entered the race for the White House.The newspaper’s first mention of FitzGerald as an Obama backer came Jan. 31, 2008, when he represented him at a Lakewood straw poll. Obama beat Hillary Rodham Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin, according to the story. We reached out to Jones, now pursuing an acting career. "I don’t know how he calculates that he was the first," said Jones, who could not remember when he formally endorsed Obama. "I think that’s incapable of being proven or disproven. How did this manifest itself? He would have had to have gotten up pretty early to beat me to it." When reached by PolitiFact Ohio, FitzGerald said he pledged his support the day Obama declared himself a candidate for president, Feb. 10, 2007. But he added that there probably was no record of the endorsement because he offered it through an Obama campaign web site. "He might have beaten me to the web site," Jones allowed. FitzGerald accurately recalled that Obama began his campaign as an underdog. Clinton was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But FitzGerald also acknowledged that he hardly was a heavy-hitter at the time. Even in its infancy the Obama campaign was enough of a force that it didn’t have to worry about telling the world about a city councilman’s endorsement. "No one cared about it then," FitzGerald said. But now it’s a handy tidbit as the county executive contemplates a run for governor. FitzGerald told PolitiFact Ohio that he couldn’t remember why he shared it with the College Democrats, other than to emphasize the importance of getting involved early in a cause you believe in. According to the Ohio GOP video, here’s what he said after claiming first dibs on Obama: "There’s a lot of great things that President Obama has done. One of the great things that he’s done is that he has empowered young activists more than any other presidential candidate that I have seen — and, I would argue, ever — since Robert Kennedy." FitzGerald, though, clearly said he was the "first elected official in Cuyahoga County to endorse" Obama. To endorse is to "approve openly" or "to express support or approval of publicly and definitely," according to the most applicable definition offered by Merriam-Webster. We don’t doubt that FitzGerald was one of the first local supporters of the future president. His work in the straw poll, at a time that many were still in Clinton’s corner, confirms that. But FitzGerald’s initial backing, offered quietly online and by his own acknowledgement tough to verify, doesn’t equal an endorsement in the most accurate sense of the word. FitzGerald is correct that his support wasn’t a big deal at the time. So even if he was the first or, more precisely, one of the first, he might have overstated the importance of his endorsement. And Jones rightly questions whether it can be proven who, technically, was the first. FitzGerald is unable to offer proof. The gubernatorial prospect’s statement has an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, FitzGerald’s claim merits a rating of Mostly False.	None	Ed FitzGerald	None	None	None	2013-02-13T14:52:14	2013-01-26	['None']

pomt-15253	Says Donald Trump is for a single-payer health care system.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/02/rick-perry/donald-trump-still-single-payer-health-care/	For all his success firing up the GOP base, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump may be a Republican in name only when it comes to health care, says former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry -- at 11th place in the polls and currently just shy of making it into the first Republican debate Aug. 6 -- has been trading jabs with Trump for weeks. Trump mocked Perry’s glasses in July, and Perry responded by calling Trump "a cancer on conservatism" and challenging him to a pull-up contest. Perry switched up his attacks from the physical to the political on Aug. 2’s Fox News Sunday. "He's for single payer," Perry said. "How can anyone who's a conservative stand up and say I am for single-payer health care?" Perry’s campaign referred us to a Buzzfeed piece and a PunditFact article that noted Trump’s past support for a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. Perry’s claim goes further to suggest Trump, like Vermont socialist and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, currently supports a single-payer system, which is a specific type of universal health care in which the government foots the bill for all residents. We wanted to know if Trump still supports that model. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our inquiry, and his campaign website does not outline any of his positions on major issues, including health care. So we scoured transcripts and videos from Trump’s public statements and interviews. Trump has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, but his general stance on health care is much murkier. On the medical record Trump has said multiple times that he would "get rid of Obamacare" as soon as he takes office. He’s also repeatedly attacked the Healthcare.gov website as a $5 billion failure that "has never worked" (which rates False). But disliking the Affordable Care Act, which is not a single-payer system, is not the same thing as condemning the concept of health care for all. During his short-lived flirtation with a 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump supported universal health care without ambiguity, and he voiced support for a single-payer system in several instances. • "If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare," Trump told CNN’s Larry King in October 1999. • "I would put forth a comprehensive health care program and fund it with an increase in corporate taxes, " Trump told The Advocate right before he dropped out of the race in February 2000. • "The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing," Trump writes in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Trump has said very little about single-payer health care since 2000, according to our search of the LexisNexis database. Reading between the lines Trump’s more recent comments about health care systems contradict each other, which experts say suggests he hasn’t formed a clear position. While bantering with David Letterman on Jan. 8, 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland’s publically funded health care system and suggested that the problem with the Affordable Care Act is its implementation. Here’s a transcript of their exchange: Letterman, recounting how cheap it is to treat injuries abroad: "In one case, I had my arm reattached and at the end of the procedure ... it was like $12 dollars!" Trump: "A friend of mine was in Scotland recently. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in troubl,e and they released him and he said, ‘Where do I pay?’ And they said, ‘There’s no charge.’ Not only that, he said it was like great doctors, great care. I mean we could have a great system in this country." Letterman: "Are people afraid of socialism?" Trump: "Well, people are afraid of a lot of things. But it’s mostly incompetence. … How do you spend $5 billion on a website, just the creation of the site itself, and it doesn’t work? … There are things you could do to give unbelievable healthcare and a much better healthcare system. It’s a complicated topic, unfortunately." Experts told us Trump is either implicitly supporting a single-payer system or putting his foot in his mouth. "The Scottish system is a classic single-payer system, like the English system, except better funded," said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. "He should stop citing Scotland," said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "He doesn’t seem to know what the Scottish system is. Most market-oriented people are not real keen about it." In a July radio interview, Trump came short of rejecting his previous position for a Canadian-style plan and instead talked about a totally different approach. He called himself a "conservative with a heart" and described his alternative to the Affordable Care Act: "Great (private) plans" made through "deals with hospitals" that allow the government to help people "at the lower levels." On July 31, a spokesperson for Trump clarified to Forbes that he’s "never supported socialized medicine" but is for "a universal ‘market-based’ plan that would offer a range of choices." The sort of system Trump is alluding to — a universal, market-based system with a mix of public and private funding — is essentially what the Affordable Care Act establishes, Jost said. More teased-out conservative alternatives with less government regulation than the Affordable Care Act can be found in John McCain’s 2008 proposal or Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s reform bill, Wilensky said. Our ruling Perry said Trump is "for single-payer health care." Fifteen years ago, Trump was decidedly for a universal healthcare system that resembled Canada’s system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens. Recently, he's said he admires Scotland’s single-payer system and disses the Affordable Care Act as incompetently implemented. However, a Trump spokesman denied that the candidate supported "socialized medicine" and suggested Trump prefers a "free-market" solution. Other than that, though, the Trump campaign has been silent about what his specific health care policies are; perhaps Trump will be pressed on this point during the Aug. 6 debate. Given the current evidence, Perry's attack is partially accurate, but leaves out details. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2015-08-02T17:03:17	2015-08-02	['None']

According to Murphy, Rubio "said Social Security and Medicare have, quote, ‘weakened us as a people.' " Rubio said that Murphy distorted his words. "What I said is debt is weakening our country, it absolutely is," Rubio replied in the Oct. 26 debate at Broward College. Murphy was referring to a speech Rubio gave at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in 2011. The quote is accurate, but it did not come in a speech arguing for such drastic reforms to Social Security and Medicare as Murphy described. Rubio’s ‘weakened us as a people’ comment During his speech, Rubio said Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start. "These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to. "We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job. ... "The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained." A Rubio spokesman pointed us to the section in which Rubio said the programs didn’t take into account future costs. But Rubio did say that such programs "weakened" Americans. Rubio has long called for reforming Social Security and Medicare. In Florida, about 21 percent of Florida’s population -- about 3.9 million people -- receive Social Security benefits. About 4 million Floridians use Medicare for health insurance. The programs accounted for 41 percent of federal program expenditures in fiscal year 2015. The programs face long-term financing shortfalls, leading program trustees and federal budget experts to call for action by Congress. Rubio has said that he favors raising the retirement age for people such as himself in their 40s but not for current retirees or those who will retire soon. "Social Security will go bankrupt, and it will bankrupt the country with it," Rubio said at a March presidential debate in Miami. "So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents." Does Rubio want to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher? Murphy also said that Rubio supported the bill by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher. Rubio has supported a "premium support system" that would give seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase insurance from Medicare or a private provider. That was similar to a plan by Ryan. Rubio voted for the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The burden would have fallen on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. While Rubio was in the Senate, Ryan’s Path to Prosperity budget resolution introduced in 2011 got rid of all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures. His resolution punted on Social Security: "In the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the president, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund." This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions. While running for president in 2015, Rubio wrote an op-ed on Social Security in which he called for raising the retirement age, reducing growth in benefits for wealthy seniors and making it easier to save money -- but he didn’t call for privatization. In his current race, Rubio’s Social Security plan on his website makes no mention of privatization. Our ruling Murphy said that Rubio "said Social Security and Medicare have ‘weakened us as a people,' " he said. In a speech in 2011, Rubio talked about government programs intended to help people and said, "These programs actually weakened us as a people." Rubio argued that people no longer had to worry about saving once they viewed it as the government’s job and that the government supplanted the role of families and religious institutions to help people in need. Rubio also expressed concern that that lawmakers lacked foresight as to how to pay for the programs in the future. The caveat here is that the quote is not evidence of Rubio aiming to dismantle these programs.

pomt-05728	President Obama's "budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/05/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-obama-if-reelected-would-drive-debt/	Gov. Bob McDonnell says the country can’t afford another four years of President Barack Obama. "[The president’s] budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected," McDonnell, a Republican, said at Politico’s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference. The total U.S. debt stands at about $15.5 trillion. About two-thirds of it is owed to investors and the rest is owed to trust funds for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare. McDonnell’s statement caught our eye. If Obama is re-elected, would his policies really lead to a $9.5 trillion expansion of the national debt by the time the president leaves office in January 2017? Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, stressed to us that McDonnell’s statement was made during an hour-long "extemporaneous" exchange over a range of issues. Then he offered a clarification. Martin said in an email that McDonnell had cited a figure on what the debt would be at the end of a 10-year projection contained in the president’s budget for the current 2012 fiscal year. Martin pointed to White House summary tables for that budget estimating it would lead to a total national debt of $26.3 trillion in 2021. The tables essentially assume that policies in the budget will be carried out for a decade. On Feb. 13, more than a week before McDonnell made his statement, the president introduced his budget for fiscal 2013, which starts Oct. 1. The White House projected the plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022. "Under the terms of his introduced budgets, the president, if re-elected, would leave office in January 2017 with the national debt estimated to reach approximately $25 trillion by 2021," Martin said. But that’s not what the governor said. McDonnell said the debt would hit the $25 trillion mark by the end of a hypothetical second Obama term in January 2017. There’s a considerable difference. The president’s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 -- the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. That’s still a leap from the current debt, but $3.7 trillion below what McDonnell said. To put that number in focus, $3.7 trillion is also the entire amount this year’s federal budget. The sum would roughly cover four years of government spending on Social Security or six years of outlays for defense. Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that while 10-year projections are important to budget, they are also extremely volatile. "These things are about 100 percent guaranteed to be not right on the mark," he said. Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition -- an organization that advocates balanced budgets -- does not put much stock in measuring debt by simple dollars. Gordon said it’s best to look at it in proportion to the country’s Gross Domestic Product -- the total goods and services produced -- because that compares the debt to a nation’s ability to pay. U.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. The White House projects it would peak at 107.8 percent of GDP in 2014 under Obama’s budget before dropping to 102.3 percent in 2021. Our ruling McDonnell said that if Obama is reelected this year, his budget policies would push total U.S. debt to about $25 trillion by the time the president’s second term expired in 2017. The governor’s spokesman qualified the statement. McDonnell, he said, cited a White House projection of the national debt in 2021 if Obama’s policies are continued. Indeed, the administration has estimated a $25 trillion debt that year. But in 2017 -- at the end of a second Obama term that McDonnell addressed with dread -- the debt would be $21.3 trillion. That’s still a heavy load, but significantly less then the governor claimed. McDonnell’s statement is based on the element of truth that the debt will continue to rise under Obama’s policies, but greatly exaggerates by how much. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-14560	"My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-his-two-appointments-florida-supreme/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s positions on some issues, such as immigration, have been to the left of other members of the GOP presidential field. But last month, Bush laid down a marker on his own conservatism: his selection of conservative judges. "I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor, and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees," Bush wrote in an article for Medium. "We sought judges who had shown humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives. Additionally, two of the appellate judges I named as governor, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court." We wondered whether Bush was right that Cantero and Bell "have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives." Our research suggests that Bush has a point, though the case is stronger for Bell than for Cantero. Some preliminaries We will note that Bush’s Medium article misspelled Cantero’s first name. It’s actually Raoul. Second, due to a grammatical misfire, what Bush wrote was somewhat misleading. Saying that Bell and Cantero "have earned reputations as (the court’s) most consistent conservatives" suggests that Bell and Cantero continue to serve as justices. That’s not the case -- both left the court to take positions in the private sector in 2008, almost eight years ago. Though Bush can hardly be blamed for their early departures from the court, it does mean that his successor, Charlie Crist, got to nominate their replacements. As it happens, though, their replacements were Canady and Polston -- the two other judges whose appointments Bush takes credit for in the Medium article. About the Florida Supreme Court Though Republicans have long had strong majorities in the Florida Legislature and haven’t lost a gubernatorial race in the state since 1994, the state Supreme Court has been a somewhat surprising bulwark for Democrats in recent years. The last Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles, appointed three of the seven members in 1997 and 1998 -- Barbara Pariente, Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince. Quince’s appointment was complicated; Chiles chose her, but due to the timing of judicial and gubernatorial terms, Bush ended up being the one to officially install her. (Bush’s role in the appointment of Quince -- who’s seen as a liberal -- may muddy his conservative bona fides to some, but the scenario was such an unusual one that we’ll set it aside in this analysis.) The other four justices currently on the court were named by Crist, who was elected as a Republican but later became an independent while in office and ultimately made an unsuccessful run for governor as a Democrat in 2014. Crist’s two picks from the early part of his tenure -- Canady and Polston -- are generally considered to be conservatives. His two later picks, Jorge Labarga and James Perry, are generally considered moderate to liberal. All told, then, under its current makeup, the Florida Supreme Court tends to lean moderate to liberal -- certainly more so than either chamber of the Legislature or the current governor, Republican Rick Scott. In fact, under the current court, 5-2 decisions -- with conservatives Canady and Polston in the minority -- have become rather common. Notably, the court -- with Canady and Polston in dissent -- has taken an aggressive stance on redrawing legislative and congressional districts that had been drawn by Republicans. Bell and Cantero in context We found general agreement that both Bell and Cantero were conservative, though Cantero perhaps less "consistent" than Bell, to use Bush’s word. On the one hand, when Cantero stepped down, the Tampa Bay Times called him "one of the high court’s two most conservative judges." The Associated Press called him "one of its most conservative members." The Ocala Star-Banner called the two justices "reliable conservative voices," noting their dissents in a 5-2 decision in 2006 that overturned a school voucher program supported by Bush. In 1993, Cantero wrote a letter to the editor of the Miami Herald that defended anti-abortion protesters, saying, "Abortions kill children," the Times reported. The Bush campaign also pointed us to a web posting by the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group that described Bell and Cantero as "widely regarded as conservative in their judicial philosophies." On the other hand, Cantero had an "unpredictably independent" streak, the Times wrote on his retirement: "He blasted a Bush privatization measure, in which private attorneys with little-to-no criminal law experience were being hired to replace public defenders for death row inmates. Cantero called their performance some of ‘the worst lawyering I've seen.’ " Indeed, the death penalty is probably the issue on which Cantero has deviated most from traditional conservatism. Cantero authored the majority opinion of State of Florida vs. Steele (2005), which ruled that unanimity should be required for jury recommendations of death sentences. Bush expressed openness to the idea, but the Legislature never acted, and hasn’t since. Indeed, from the private sector, Cantero has continued to urge unanimity in death penalty cases, including a 2012 Miami Herald op-ed he co-wrote. Cantero also joined a unanimous decision -- along with Bell -- to overturn a law supported by Bush and the Legislature to reinsert a tube into Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged patient whose case became a cause celebre, especially for some social conservatives. "It was a proud moment for us that we were able to reach a unanimous decision," Cantero told the Associated Press at the time. "We were able to work through the issues dispassionately." Our ruling Bush said, "My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives." Bell and Cantero were certainly the most conservative members of the court when they were serving on it. However, Bush could have phrased his statement more carefully, to avoid suggesting that they are still on the court. Also, Cantero did sometimes break ranks with the traditionally conservative position, such as on the death penalty. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-02-10T18:11:38	2016-01-24	['None']
pomt-11036	Says Wisconsin "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952. And I won Wisconsin. … Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/29/donald-trump/president-trump-makes-some-interesting-claims-abou/	On a warm June afternoon, President Donald Trump proudly presided over the groundbreaking of Foxconn’s new $10 billion operation in Mount Pleasant, Wis. Shovelsful of dirt were tossed and speeches were made hailing the company’s decision to build its complex in Wisconsin. In the midst of it all, Trump took a moment to hail his own 2016 victory in Wisconsin, a win that was vital to securing the presidency. Wisconsin, Trump said on June 28, 2018, "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952." He went on: "And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win." (He made a nearly identical claim the night before, at a rally in Fargo, N.D.) Say what, Mr. President? A look at the numbers According to the American Presidency Project, the following Republicans have won Wisconsin’s presidential vote since 1952: 1956: Dwight D. Eisenhower 1960: Richard M. Nixon 1968: Richard M. Nixon 1972: Richard M. Nixon 1980: Ronald Reagan 1984: Ronald Reagan 2016: Donald Trump The Republican presidential dry spell stretched from the 1988 election, when Democrat Michael Dukakis won Wisconsin, through 2012 when Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin. But it did not stretch back to Eisenhower. And, for the record, the one state Reagan lost in 1984 was neighboring Minnesota, not Wisconsin. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin "hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952." and that "Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win." Election records show that Trump is wrong on both counts. Very wrong. The president might want to find another applause line for Wisconsin, because Republican candidates not named Trump won the state six times since Eisenhower’s 1952 win.

pomt-07193	Says Craig Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/08/janice-hahn/are-craig-hahn-and-sarah-palin-cut-same-political-/	A new campaign video from California congressional candidate Janice Hahn, a Democratic Los Angeles city councilwoman, is remarkable not so much for its attacks on her opponent Republican Craig Huey -- it's fairly standard abortion and the-Republicans-want-to-end-Medicare fare -- but rather for its efforts to tie Huey's positions to that of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. "Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey," the narrator begins. "Which supports a radical plan to end Medicare, but wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy? Palin and Huey again." "But which one called Planned Parenthood a 'murder mill'? Only Craig Huey. We don't need Craig Huey's extremist right wing agenda." The Palin cameo is an intriguing political strategy, one that appears to bank on Palin's negative baggage. "They clearly see Palin as a polarizing figure," said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. "And so the more closely they can tie Huey to Palin the better." The ad appears to be aimed at sparking larger voter turnout in the heavily Democratic Los Angeles district, he said. Huey, a business consultant and political commentator, and Hahn are facing off in a July 12 special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who retired in February. In this item, we are going to focus our fact-check on the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill." In a separate item we will focus on whether both Palin and Huey "would ban a woman's right to choose in every case." We have dealt with similar Democratic claims that Republican support for dramatic reforms to Medicare means they want to end Medicare, and we have concluded those claims go too far. This comes from a post to electionforum.org, on May 5, 2011: The murder mill keeps churning This makes me sick. Planned Parenthood gets $350 million in tax dollars each year—nearly $1 million dollars a day. For this, it kills more than 325,000 babies annually. A thousand dollars per abortion… When we first put that quote to Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Huey's campaign, he said Huey did not recall ever having used that language to describe Planned Parenthood, though he does want to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions. When presented with a link to the post, Gilliard consulted with Huey and said it appeared a staffer for Huey wrote the post. "From what we can tell, that was posted on his website," Gilliard said. "It's not his language. But he's standing by it, because it's on his website." Gilliard said you won't hear Huey using that phrase, but "he's fine with it. It was on his site." It remains to be seen whether linking Palin to an opponent can be an effective political strategy (much as many tried to tie Republican presidential candidates to George W. Bush in the 2008 campaign) but as for the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill," it's on Huey's website, and he stands by it. We rule the ad's claims True.

pomt-12058	Says Tony Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/08/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-mostly-misfires-attack-governor-cand/	The day after word surfaced that state schools superintendent Tony Evers would announce a campaign for governor, the Wisconsin Republican Party attacked. Unveiling a digital ad campaign on Aug. 21, 2017, the GOP claimed Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students." The Madison-area teacher was fired for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts. The Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license. They made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017. As we’ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher’s license for "immoral behavior" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case. The governor’s race Republican Gov. Scott Walker has all but announced he will seek a third term in 2018. Evers, a Democrat, has won three statewide elections for state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, since 2009. The other leading Democrats with gubernatorial campaigns up and running are Andy Gronik, a businessman who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point, and state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire. The case of Andy Harris The Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district’s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school. Here are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator’s decision and a state appeals court decision: Dec. 2009 School district announces Harris had been placed on leave because he received from his sister 23 emails containing pornography and other adult content. Many were jokes that showed images of nude or partially nude women, one of which Harris shared with a co-worker who complained to the principal. None were seen by students. An investigation by the school district finds that more than 30 teachers and administrators had accessed inappropriate jokes or sexually explicit materials on their school computers. Seven educators in addition to Harris were disciplined: five teachers received unpaid suspensions, one substitute teacher was dismissed and an administrator resigned. May 2010 School board fires Harris. The district notifies the state Department of Public Instruction, per a state law requiring school districts to report dismissals that are based on immoral conduct. Feb. 2012 Acting on a grievance filed by the teachers union, arbitrator Karen Mawhinney, a Burlington attorney, overturns Harris’ firing and reduces his penalty to 15 days of unpaid suspension. Harris’ behavior did not meet the state law’s definition of immoral conduct because "there was no endangerment of the health, safety, welfare or education of any pupil," she wrote. She also said "his worst offense is forwarding one inappropriate e-mail to two friends and not exercising the good judgment to discourage his sister from sending these types of e-mails to him." She added: "The fact that he was discharged while others were suspended or received written reprimands or nothing at all, the discharge cannot stand." Aug. 2013 State Court of Appeals upholds a decision made by a circuit court, which had upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Jan. 2014 After state Supreme Court announces it will not review the appeals court decision, Harris returns to the classroom. The next day, Walker asks Evers to begin the process of revoking Harris’ teaching license. Apr. 2014 The Department of Public Instruction announces it will not revoke Harris’ license, saying his conduct "was highly inappropriate" but did not meet the legal definition of "immoral conduct" in state law because it "did not involve children in any manner." Now let’s evaluate the Republicans’ attack. ‘Found guilty’ The GOP says Harris was "found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school," suggesting there was a criminal conviction. Harris did share images of nudity, and at least one instance forwarded an email containing such images, he received on his school computer. But he was never accused of, or charged with, committing any crime. ‘Immoral conduct’ When Harris was fired in December 2010, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal advisers, "as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil." And is the pivotal word there. (Indeed, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards would make that point in successfully advocating that the law be changed.) Evers’ department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator’s decision, that his behavior didn’t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department’s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. That position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris’ firing, Walker signed a measure that redefined immoral conduct to include "the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material." That is, the new law, which Evers supported and which was prompted partly by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn’t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn’t. Finally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn’t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris’ return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn’t feel comfortable in Harris’ class. The GOP says that endangered students’ education, since they were missing valuable instruction time. In response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher’s license only based on the teacher’s conduct -- not based on parents’ objections to a teacher or a district’s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall. Our rating The state Republican Party says Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students." The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students. Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher’s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher’s conduct didn’t endanger kids. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-13261	"We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/pence-wrongly-says-more-half-hillary-clintons-meet/	Instead of focusing on allegations from several women that Donald Trump sexually violated them, the media should devote attention to the "avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption" during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Trump’s running mate Mike Pence said. "The national media is ignoring an avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption during the years of the Clinton administration," Pence said Oct. 16, 2016, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. "The New York Times just a few minutes ago posted a story about — in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. "We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation." We looked at Pence’s claim about Qatar in another fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on his claim that "more than half" of meetings Clinton took as secretary of state were with major donors to her family’s global charity. Pence’s claim comes from an Associated Press story published in August, headlined, "Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State." But "many" does not mean "more than half" of all her meetings. Not even close. Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009-13. The Associated Press analyzed 154 of her State Department meetings and found that 85 of those were with Clinton Foundation donors. Those 85 gave as much as $156 million to the foundation, combined. But this is a tiny subset of Clinton’s meetings. The analysis excluded meetings with people who work for the U.S. government or foreign governments. And it does not include many meetings Clinton took in the second half of her term because the Associated Press only had access to detailed schedules from the first half. ABC reported back in 2013 that Clinton met with 1,700 foreign leaders and had 755 meetings at the White House while secretary of state. So that’s at least 2,455 meetings the Associated Press did not include in its analysis The Associated Press mischaracterized its own reporting in a post on Twitter claiming that "More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation." The AP later deleted the tweet. Pence described the donors as major. According to the AP, at least 40 of the 85 donors Clinton met with contributed more than $100,000 each. Twenty gave more than $1 million, the AP reported. The Associated Press report showcases the ethical minefield that resulted from the lack of a bright line separating Clinton’s State Department from her family’s foundation. However, merely showing that Clinton met with some foundation donors does not in itself prove any substantial wrongdoing, such as undue influence over State Department policy. For example, the Associated Press article mentions meetings with foundation donors Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist from Bangladesh, and Nancy McMahon, head of MAC AIDS, which was partnering with the State Department to address gender-based violence in South Africa. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told the Associated Press that the department does not prohibit meetings with "political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations — including the Clinton Foundation." Our ruling Pence said, "We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors of the Clinton Foundation." Pence inaccurately described an Associated Press report. The report found that of 154 meetings Clinton took with private individuals over about half of her time as secretary of state, 85 were with people who had donated to the foundation. But the analysis leaves out thousands of meetings Clinton took, including every time she met with employees of both U.S. and foreign governments. It also only covers part of her time as secretary of state. We rate Pence's claim Mostly False.

pomt-11819	Says the individual mandate is "highly unpopular."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/14/donald-trump/how-unpopular-obamacare-individual-mandate/	While President Donald Trump was overseas, he urged on congressional Republicans who were forging ahead with their tax plans. "I am proud of the Republican House and Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes and reform," Trump tweeted Nov. 13. "We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair and highly unpopular Individual Mandate in Obamacare and reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35 percent with all of the rest going to middle income cuts?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com From Trump's tweet to the Senate Republicans' ears, apparently. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., emerged from a closed-door Republican caucus meeting Nov. 14 saying, "We’re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful." The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repeal would reduce deficits by more than $300 billion over 10 years, although about 13 million fewer people would not have health insurance. The health care law’s requirement that most people have coverage has long stuck in Trump’s throat. We wondered if the mandate is "highly unpopular," as he said. The polling shows that it is the least popular of the Affordable Care Act’s changes, but how people feel about it depends on how you frame the question. When asked simply if they like or don’t like the mandate, as many as two-thirds of the people say they don’t. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 63 percent had an unfavorable opinion in November 2016. An Associated Press/NORC poll in January 2017 came back with 36 percent in favor, 13 percent who didn’t care one way or the other, and 50 percent who opposed it. The White House press office noted a February 2017 YouGov poll that found that 34 percent favored including the mandate in any bill to replace the Affordable Care Act and 66 percent opposed it. The press office also pointed to similar results from an April 2017 Harris poll. Repeal drive muddied the waters Public opinion became more complicated around the time Republicans started voting on bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. As that process moved forward, more pollsters began asking people if they thought the individual mandate should stay or go. In March 2017, CNN/ORC gave respondents a list of options and asked them if they "favor or oppose including that policy in a replacement bill." Half, 50 percent, said the requirement to obtain coverage should be kept and about half, 48 percent, said it should be ditched. The Kaiser tracking poll in October 2017 took a different approach to the same topic, and got results similar to CNN/ORC. Kaiser set up the question this way: "The Trump administration has made a number of changes related to the health insurance marketplaces. Do you approve or disapprove of the following actions made by the Trump administration?" Kaiser described the policy as "the federal government may stop enforcing the requirement that all individuals have insurance or pay a fine." Half, 50 percent, of the people said they approved of that, while 47 percent said they didn’t. Again, a split decision. An earlier Kaiser tracking poll triggered higher levels of support for enforcing the mandate. In August 2017, pollsters framed the issue in terms of "President Trump taking actions to make the law (Obamacare) fail." Put that way, only one-third, 31 percent, said they wanted Trump to stop enforcing the mandate, and two-thirds said it should be enforced. Broadly speaking, in the context of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, most polls show that about half of the public opposes the mandate and about half supports it. Policy and politics Obamacare has many moving parts that interact with each other. The individual mandate has a particularly strong tie to the law’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The rationale is that if the government is going to force insurance companies to cover everyone, then it must deliver a big insurance pool with a lot of healthy people in it. (There might be other ways to get to more or less the same place, but this fact-check is about the mandate.) The pre-existing conditions protection is popular. In the November 2016 Kaiser poll, nearly 70 percent of the public supported that piece of the puzzle. But only 35 percent liked its evil twin, the individual mandate. In 2014, the Kaiser Family Foundation probed what people know about the mandate and found that opinions were "malleable." "When people were told that most people already fulfill the mandate with coverage they get through an employer or government plan, or that people would not have to pay the fine if buying insurance would take up too large a share of their income, support increased to 6 in 10," said Liz Hamel, director of Kaiser’s public opinion research team. Hamel told us that attitudes about the mandate have shifted as overall support for Obamacare has grown. Republican views have largely held steady, but independents have warmed to the law, and Democrats even more so. "Democrats in particular have rallied around the ACA in the past year as it has come under threat of repeal or dismantling by executive order," Hamel said. "In the current political context, people who support the ACA are willing to defend even the pieces of it that they don’t like rather than see the whole law undermined or repealed." Our ruling Trump said the individual mandate is "highly unpopular." As recently as February 2017, a YouGov poll found that 65 percent of people opposed it, a finding that is consistent with earlier polls from other organizations. That’s a fair sign of the provision’s unpopularity. On the other hand, when people were given more details about the mandate, they had a more favorable view, as high as about 60 percent. And in the context of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the most recent polls found the public generally split 50/50 on whether to keep the mandate in force. Public opinion about the individual mandate is not a simple black-and-white choice. As a leading expert explained, people might not love it, but they are willing to live with it.

pomt-05988	Says most states, but not Texas, permit jurors to ask questions of witnesses in trials.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/22/efrain-de-la-fuente/efrain-de-la-fuente-says-jurors-most-states-not-te/	A Travis County judicial candidate, Democrat Efrain De La Fuente, told a local group that he favors letting jurors pose questions of witnesses during trials provided the questions are vetted through a judge. "That’s seeking the truth," De La Fuente, who seeks the judgeship of the 167th Criminal District Court, told the Central Austin Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011. "We shouldn’t be paying lip service to this thing we call fact-finding. Looking for the truth. Everybody – most of the states in this country have come on board. Texas needs to come on board." We had no idea Texas was out of step. Asked for backup information, De La Fuente’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, replied by email that jurors in civil trials in Texas are already allowed to ask questions of witnesses, though De La Fuente’s "most states" comment was referring to civil and criminal trials. Wick pointed us to a November 2011 blog post about a 2007 decision by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland upholding the presentation of two written questions from a jury to a witness. Nationally, that decision says, most state courts that have taken up the question of letting jurors ask questions of witnesses have left that up to trial judges, though a few courts have held juror questioning to be an error or abuse of discretion. A 1992 decision by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Morrison v. State, barred juror questioning in Texas criminal cases. In its ruling, the court aired concern that jurors would imperil their impartiality by questioning witnesses. "We know of no authority establishing or authorizing jurors to ask questions of witnesses in the criminal jurisprudence of this state and therefore find the same to be error," the court said. Of courts around the country that do allow juror questioning, the Maryland decision says, many suggest procedures a court should follow. The decision includes guidance from the Kansas Supreme Court stating: "The trial court should not solicit questions and should only permit them for purposes of clarification. The testimony of a witness should not be interrupted by questions from jurors. Jurors should submit questions in writing and without any discussion with other jurors. Counsel should be afforded the opportunity to object outside the presence of the jury. The trial court must determine the relevancy of the questions. The trial court should instruct the jury not to draw any inference if a question submitted is not asked. The trial judge, rather than counsel or jurors, should question the witness. Finally, counsel should be given the right to further examine the witness following the jury’s questions." Legal experts in Texas guided us to Tracy Christopher, a justice on Houston’s 14th Court of Appeals, who has studied juror questioning in civil trials. In a telephone interview, Christopher said that when she was a trial judge, she permitted jurors to question witnesses a few times. "It is a useful tool," she said. "It does slow down the trial slightly." The Texas Supreme Court has not acted on any case testing juror questioning in civil trials, Christopher said, though lower state courts of appeal have concluded that juror questioning is permissible -- with safeguards such as the judge soliciting written questions whose admissibility is determined with the jury and witness out of the courtroom. So, the highest criminal appeals court in Texas has naysayed jurors asking questions in criminal trials. But Texas judges are free to let jurors ask questions in civil trials. Seeking precise information on practices in other states, we read a 2007 report by the National Center for State Courts, which describes itself as an independent court improvement organization. The report states that according to surveys of lawyers and judges, written questions from jurors are "mandated for criminal trials in three states, prohibited in 11 states, and left to the sound discretion of the trial court in the rest," or 36 states. "In civil trials, juror questions are mandated in four states, prohibited in 10 states, and left to the discretion of the trial judge in the rest," the report says. In a telephone interview, an author of the report, Paula Hannaford-Agor, told us Texas ranks among five states -- the others are Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and Nebraska -- with court opinions outlawing juror questions in criminal trials. Of late, she said, the practice is strongly discouraged in seven other states -- Illinois, Louisana, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- though no laws or court rulings bar it. Hannaford-Agor said juror questioning of witnesses in Texas civil trials may be allowed, yet it occurs infrequently. Make that very infrequently. In the center’s surveys of Texas judges and attorneys, 1.5 percent of 518 respondents said the judge had allowed juror questions during the respondents’ latest trial in civil court. The surveys were taken from 2004 through 2006, Hannaford-Agor said. As we corraled this information, De La Fuente told us in an interview that he knows juror questioning is already possible in Texas civil courts. He said that he usually tells voters as much, though did not do so at the Democratic forum. If elected, he said, he intends to urge legislators to permit juror questioning in criminal trials. Our ruling As De La Fuente said, Texas is among the minority of states that bar juror questioning in criminal trials. Contrary to what he said at the forum, however, Texas is among the majority of states allowing judges to permit juror questions in civil trials. We rate his overly sweeping claim Half True.

pomt-12313	Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/21/donald-trump/white-house-tweet-wrongly-says-obamacare-led-fewer/	In its drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the Trump administration turned to Twitter with a list of how bad the program is. "Obamacare has led to higher costs and fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. It has failed the American people," it tweeted June 21. An accompanying video described multiple failings. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com One of its attack lines jumped out at us as particularly wrong: that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. On its face, it is wrong. Before passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, many Americans either couldn’t afford insurance or were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. That changed with Obamacare. A 2016 estimate from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department put the number of people who gained coverage at 20 million. That included 2.3 million young adults who took advantage of a provision in the law that allowed them to stay on their parents’ plans until they turned 26. The remaining 17.7 million got coverage through either a private plan or public insurance, primarily Medicaid. "Americans inherently have more access to care then they did before Obamacare," said Timothy Callaghan, a health policy professor at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. The drop in the uninsured rate gives another way to look at this. Gallup, a major polling organization, reported that by the first quarter of 2016, the fraction of people ages 18 to 64 without insurance had fallen to 11 percent. "This marks a record low since Gallup and Healthways began tracking the uninsured rate in 2008," the report said. In 2008, the rate was 14.6 percent. Part of the decline was due to an improving economy. About half of Americans get their insurance through their employer. Part was tied to the individual mandate, the provision in the health care law that required all adults to have insurance. Another factor was the expansion of Medicaid for poor people, an option chosen by about 36 states. That provided coverage to about 10.7 million people who weren’t eligible before, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted source of neutral data. The White House statement does apply in a more limited sense. The video included the statistic about insurance companies deciding not to offer policies on the health insurance exchanges set up under the law. The original idea of the exchanges was to have companies competing for business. In many counties, particularly rural ones, it hasn’t turned out that way, said Daniel Polsky, professor of health management at the Wharton School. "Fewer plan options will be available when compared to the early years of the Affordable Care Act," Polsky said. He called that "an unfortunate aspect" of the law, but noted that the White House has added to instability inside the exchanges. Despite requests from insurance companies, the administration has not promised to continue payments that make policies affordable, plus it has indicated it won’t enforce the individual mandate. The exchanges represent a small slice of the insurance market. It’s for people who don’t get insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid or Medicare. The individual market covers about 7 percent of all Americans, and slightly more than half of those policies are sold on the exchanges. We reached out to the White House for this fact-check and did not hear back before we published. Our ruling The White House tweeted that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. About 20 million more people have insurance today than before, directly as a result of the new health care law. The White House neglects that critical point. The sole thread of truth is that with the insurance exchanges set up by the law, the number of carriers has dwindled. That is a real problem, but as experts and insurance companies have noted, that is partly a result of what this administration has done. Its policies on spending and enforcement have undercut the ability of carriers to participate in the exchanges. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10197	"I said two years ago that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem and we had to work on it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/17/john-mccain/ringing-an-alarm-not-averting-a-crisis/	The turmoil on Wall Street is prompting the presidential candidates to offer prescriptions for restoring order to U.S. financial markets. John McCain is using the opportunity to remind voters that he called on Congress to crack down on government-chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Appearing on CNN's American Morning on Sept. 16, 2008, McCain sought to blame much of the crisis on Wall Street greed and inept or corrupt government regulators. "Ask any American citizen who has been the victim of a bureaucrat or a bureaucracy," McCain said. "I said two years ago that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem and we had to work on it. And I have always opposed greed of Wall Street and I know how we can fix this." McCain echoed his remarks later in the day during a speech in Tampa, saying, "Two years ago, I warned the administration and the Congress that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed to be fixed. It turns out, the problem was even bigger. They waited too long, and now we have a housing crisis, three bailouts with taxpayers' money, and a financial crisis." In both appearances, McCain was referring to his 2006 decision to sign on to a Republican-led regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The occasion that prompted McCain's involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an "arrogant and unethical corporate culture" in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company's housing mission. The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac. "If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release. So it's true that McCain spoke out — after a widely read report drew attention to chicanery at the firms. But the implication in McCain's remarks is that his remarks in 2006 were in some way a warning about the financial markets disaster that struck in 2008. That strikes us as quite a stretch. First of all, congressional efforts to increase oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac extend back to the early 1990s, making McCain a latecomer to the debate. The regulatory efforts proved unsuccessful because of Congress' complicated relationship with the firms, whose dominance in the home financing market makes their stability critical to the economy. Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises — a type of private corporation created by Congress for an explicit purpose; in this case, to lower the cost of capital in the housing market. Though critics have long maintained that the firms were too large and didn't have enough capital to guard against risk, many lawmakers worried that stricter regulation would interfere with the firms' role in the housing market. (The now-defunct Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as OFHEO, oversaw Fannie and Freddie but had limited regulatory authority.) In his appearances, McCain tries to connect the accounting scandals with the broader meltdown in the mortgage markets. But the current crisis arose because banks and mortgage companies made risky "subprime" loans to people with poor credit histories that were then packaged into securities and sold to institutional investors. As interest rates rose and home prices began to fall, homeowners unable to refinance the loans or sell their properties began to default, unleashing a cascade effect through financial markets. That phenomenon had nothing to do with Fannie and Freddie's internal problems; in fact, both firms were praised for cushioning the financial free fall and keeping the market afloat by spending billions of dollars to purchase subprime loans. Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it's debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it's a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie's loan portfolios soon enough, and would have sounded an alarm. Shaken by the extent of the subprime crisis, Congress and the Bush administration earlier this year completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Last weekend, the government took the additional step of placing the two firms into conservatorship — essentially a government takeover in which Treasury will extend up to $200-billion of support to the companies. Barack Obama's campaign responded to McCain's remarks by labeling his desire for tougher oversight a myth. Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor noted that McCain in 1992 voted against imposing stricter controls on Fannie and Freddie during Senate debate on a broader housing bill, and this year argued against providing big government bailouts in response to the crisis, whether for big lenders or homeowners. We give McCain some credit for weighing in on problems surrounding Fannie Mae, even though he got involved after a comprehensive government report issued a loud alarm to anyone watching. However, his attempts to depict those efforts as some sort of early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis just don't wash. All McCain was talking about then was the potential fallout of accounting troubles in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He didn't say anything about a freewheeling climate among creditors that had major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans. We rule his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00918	Says President Barack Obama made "unilateral changes" to Obamacare "38 times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-has-taken-unilateral-action-health-c/	In making the case that President Barack Obama overstepped his bounds on immigration, House Speaker John Boehner pointed to another sore spot: Obamacare. "It’s the president of the United States overreaching, and that’s just not on immigration. You know 38 times he made unilateral changes to Obamacare," Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation March 1. "Many of these, I believe, far beyond his constitutional authority to do so." PolitiFact looked into a similar claim about Obama’s actions on the Affordable Care Act in 2013, when Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said Obama had made 19 changes to the health care legislation since it became law in 2010. We rated that claim Half True. So we wondered where Boehner got the 38 "unilateral changes" figure. Boehner’s staff pointed us to the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market principles in health care. A Feb. 25 article lists 48 changes to the Affordable Care Act, but they aren’t all unilateral -- meaning that weren’t made by the Obama administration without the input of the other branches of government. The Galen Institute’s list includes: Two changes because of Supreme Court decisions; 17 changes as the result of congressional action; 29 changes by the Obama administration. Among the unilateral actions by the administration, according to Galen: delays on insurance provider transparency requirements, choosing which mandates apply to U.S. territories, and delaying the policy sign-up deadline. Galen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner told PolitiFact that the think tank will soon update its unilateral action count to 30, with the administration’s recent decision to reduce cost-sharing. The law originally called for out-of-pocket maximums to be lowered for those between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, but the administration changed this provision to only apply to those between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level. She added that the administration repeated three of the unilateral actions, bringing the count up to 33. And an August 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan government program, included five additional examples. All of these combined adds up to 38, Turner said. It’s worth noting, though, that the Congressional Research Service report does not count every single administrative change to the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it selectively chose the "more significant actions that have been the subject of debate among health policy analysts and, in some instances, the target of criticism by opponents of the ACA." So according to the report, there have been 12 significant "delays, extensions" or "other actions taken by the administration." The report says that the most controversial action has been the 2013 decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate -- the requirement that employers with 50 or more employees must offer full-time workers affordable health insurance or pay a penalty -- to 2015. Larry Jacobs, chair of political studies at the University of Minnesota, said that in addition to the employer mandate delay, the most significant actions have been abandoning the long-term care program (CLASS) and the small employer program (SHOP). Of Galen’s more comprehensive list, most are technical changes, rather than policy changes, said James Thurber, director of American University’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. "Most are insignificant administrative actions by (Health and Human Services)," Thurber wrote in an email to PolitiFact. "This is common under all presidents." Our previous fact-check on this subject noted that Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. For example, the Bush administration chose to extend the deadline and waive penalty fees for Medicare Part D enrollees. "Presidents always use administration to find feasible, workable paths and to work their agenda," Jacobs said. "Since Nixon and then Reagan, an ‘administrative presidency’ has emerged where presidents use their large administrative staff, agencies and departments to work their way." Our ruling Boehner said Obama made "unilateral changes" to Obamacare "38 times." Boehner’s staff sent us a link to 29 unilateral actions, and it takes some creative picking and choosing to get the count up to 38 -- including counting two delays of the same regulation as separate actions. Further, the Congressional Research Service only considers 12 of these actions to be significant policy changes. Lastly, experts said administrative changes are a routine part of the lawmaking process and have occurred "under all presidents." Boehner’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

When we started to lose to other countries in basketball, America created the Dream Team and crushed the competition in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In recent years, politicians have lamented America’s education standing with the goal of doing better. Georgia state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers talked about the problem -- and offered some ideas -- at a Republican Party-led "Solutions Summit" in Athens last month. An Athens Banner-Herald article included a claim by Rogers, a Republican from Cherokee County, that the U.S. is near the bottom of developed nations in education. Near the bottom! U.S. students can’t be performing that poorly? The article paraphrased Rogers, so we asked his office whether the newspaper got it right. It did, said Rogers’ chief of staff Adam Pipkin. "Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement," Rogers said at the meeting. Rogers’ office showed us the information he used to back up his claim: a weblink from a prominent education foundation that compared America’s top math students with top math students in other nations. The link, from the Broad Foundation, says eighth-graders in America are two years behind in the math studied in other countries. Let’s focus on the first part of what was on the foundation’s page. The ranking came from a 2006 study of students for the Program for International Student Assessment, which examines the academic performance of 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in more than 60 nations. Students were asked the same questions, such as estimating the size of Antarctica or determining the best route between various rail stations. An international contractor randomly selects schools to take the exam, PISA organizers say. The selection of schools and students, they say, is said to be as inclusive as possible. U.S. Department of Education officials say 5,233 U.S. students took the 2009 exam. The most recent assessment, however, was done in 2009. That study focused on about 60 nations. We focused on about 30 countries, since the rest are not on the United Nations’ and/or CIA’s lists of developed nations. In that assessment, American students, on average, indeed ranked near the bottom of about 30 developed nations in math. American students ranked in the middle in science and in the top half in reading. The 2009 report was released in December 2010. Pipkin countered that the 2009 PISA report included U.S. students in public and private schools, "so it is difficult to determine where the public school students would have ranked as an individual group." Rogers, however, did not say he was specifically speaking about public school students. Pipkin had another concern about the 2009 report. He said it included nations such as Chile, Estonia, Israel and Slovenia that he said aren’t "international competition" and helped boost the U.S. into the middle in the science category. We did use Israel, but not the others for our comparison. The U.S. still ranked in the middle in science. We then reviewed a report on the U.S. Department of Education’s website that tracked fourth- and eighth-grade U.S. students against their counterparts in other countries in math and science. The report, called the "Trends in International Math and Science Study," was from 2007. American fourth-graders ranked in the top third in both subjects. The eighth-graders did as well in math but were in the middle in science. As with the PISA exam, we excluded countries not on the CIA’s and/or United Nations’ lists of developed nations. The tests are said to be administered the same way in all countries. Officials acknowledge that some countries, such as the U.S., have a higher percentage of immigrant students, which may be a factor in the scores since they are not taking the exam in their native language. Students in each country are selected from a national probability sample of all students in the particular grade or of a particular age. The exam is voluntary. Now, to the claim about eighth-graders. That came from a 2003 report by Michigan State University professor William H. Schmidt that is on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Schmidt wrote American 12th-graders ranked near the bottom internationally on a math literacy exam. American eighth-graders were also below average internationally. We were initially dubious of the article, since he mentioned studies done in 1995 and 1999. That seemed like such a long time ago. A student could have begun first grade in 1999 and graduated this year. Schmidt, a distinguished professor of statistics and math, explained he prefers the earlier research to the 2007 study. He said the earlier studies include more nations that are a better comparison for U.S. students. Schmidt believes much hasn’t changed since the reports from the late 1990s. "The best [U.S. students] in some indicators are in the middle of the pack, but at the worst, at the bottom," he told us. Schmidt believes some developed nations such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands are better at math and science because their educational systems are more focused with rigorous standards for their students. For example, he said eighth-graders in some nations are learning algebra and geometry while American students are still focused on less complex arithmetic. Schmidt also said most American eighth-grade teachers are not as versed in math as their counterparts in many nations. Schmidt said there is hope for U.S. students to make a Rocky-like comeback in math. He said about 40 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards -- national expectations for what students should learn and be able to do in every grade level and subject. In July 2010, Georgia’s Board of Education approved Common Core Standards in English and math. So back to Rogers and his claim. The most recent international reports that include developed nations show American students are in the bottom third in math, in the middle in science and in the upper third in reading. The results don’t entirely back up the senator’s claim. They show he’s partially accurate. We rate his claim as Half True.

pomt-06322	"Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/12/jim-webb/sen-jim-webb-says-ronald-reagan-raised-debt-ceilin/	U.S. Senator Jim Webb, who will not seek reelection next year, has been lamenting the partisanship that grips the nation. During a recent interview with ABC News, the Virginia Democrat was incredulous over the fighting that occurred this summer before Congress raised the debt ceiling so the United States could pay its bills. An August deal raised the federal government’s $14.3 trillion borrowing authority to $16.4 trillion, a level that is expected to keep the government operating until early 2013. "(President) Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times," said Webb, a former Republican who served as Reagan’s secretary of the Navy . Webb is hardly the first Democrat to cite Reagan’s record on the debt limit. President Barack Obama, in a televised speech on July 25, said raising the borrowing cap has been a routine practice by Congress and presidents since the 1950s. Obama also said Reagan increased the debt ceiling 18 times. We asked Webb’s office what the Senator based his statement on. Will Jenkins, Webb’s director of communications, cited a chart by the Office of Management and Budget that details 18 different laws signed to raise the debt limit during Reagan’s presidency from January 1981 to January 1989. This seemed like a cut-and-dry case for PolitiFact Virginia. But like so many of the claims we investigate, there was a snag. We came across several news stories saying Reagan hiked the debt limit 17 times, not 18. For example, Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, was quoted in a July 16, 2011, article in The Hill newspaper using the lower number. We also found references to 17 Reagan-era debt limit hikes in The Washington Post and FactCheck.org. We looked at the OMB chart again. After each law increasing the borrowing limit is a column showing the new, higher level of the debt ceiling. Two of the 18 bills - one approved on May 15, 1987, and another approved on July 30, 1987 - are listed as boosting the debt limit to the same amount -- $2.32 trillion. Should they be counted as one increase, or two? Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted in an e-mail that the May, 1987 increase to $2.32 trillion was a temporary hike. When that limit expired on July 17, 1987, the debt limit reverted to a previous level of $2.1 trillion, Kogan said. But after a couple of weeks, Congress passed yet another temporary debt boost at the end of July 1987 increasing the debt ceiling from $2.1 trillion back to $2.32 trillion, he said. Kogan, a former senior adviser to the Office of Management and Budget, said it’s a semantic question as to whether the July, 1987 should be considered its own increase, but added he personally would consider it a second debt ceiling hike. Our ruling: Webb said Reagan signed off 18 times on increasing the national debt. Figures from the Office of Management and Budget do show 18 laws were signed to increase the debt limit during Reagan’s eight years in office. A semantic argument can be made that the actual debt limit was raised only 17 times during the Reagan administration, but we don’t think it’s worth the haggle. We rate Webb’s statement True.

abbc-00259	The notion that Australia is becoming less equal has become a point of contention in political debate, with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten claiming "the deck is stacked against ordinary people".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-16/fact-check-income-inequality-has-it-improved/8804976	Mr Morrison's claim is unjustified. The evidence Mr Morrison puts forward to support his claim focuses on a relatively short time frame and is subject to volatility. Furthermore, his claim is underpinned by income data from the 2016 census that is potentially problematic, and unpublished calculations that have not been released for independent scrutiny. Experts contacted by Fact Check broadly agree: Australia is less equal today than it was in, say, 1981. And the broad trend over the decades since the early 1980s would appear to point to widening disparity. However, the experts are not united about what has happened in recent years. Some suggest inequality has got no worse, while others suggest it has. This uncertainty is also reflected in the data: one credible set of figures shows a slight deterioration of inequality, another one a slight improvement. Mr Morrison was excessively definitive in the face of data which is not definitive.

pomt-08865	"Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/04/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-democrats-planning-largest-tax/	Sarah Palin said she wrote her notes on her hand so the "liberals" couldn't say she got her numbers wrong when she appeared on Fox News Sunday. Well, we're independent fact-checkers, and we still found accuracy issues with the former governor's statements on the expiring Bush tax cuts. "Let's turn to the Bush tax cuts, which are also becoming a big issue, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy," said host Chris Wallace. "The Obama White House is now saying end the tax cuts. And these are the tax cuts for the top 2 percent of all households in America. You can save $678 billion, and it won't hurt the recovery. Governor, if you're serious, as you say you are, about the deficit, don't you have to do something?" "To reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt, you rein in spending," Palin replied. "You cut the budget. You don't take more from the private sector and grow government with it. ... The Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress -- they're all wet on this idea. It's idiotic to think about increasing taxes at a time like this." Wallace: " But you know, they would argue, 'Look, the economy did just fine during the Clinton years. The rates on the top 2 percent would be restored to what they were during the Clinton years.' The Republicans keep talking about being deficit hawks. This is $678 billion you're not going to pay for. They're saying you're being hypocritical. I say 'you' -- I'm talking about Republicans." Palin: "Yeah. No, this is going to result in the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And again, it's idiotic. And my palm isn't large enough to have written all my notes down on what this tax increase will result in. Let me just go through a couple of things that I want people to be aware of, because, you know, the spin coming from Gibbs and the White House -- you're never going to get the truth out of their messaging. But Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history. It's a tax increase of $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, and it will have an effect on every single American who pays an income tax. Small businesses especially will be hit hardest. ..." Wallace: "Can I just ask you, what do you have written on your hand?" Palin: "$3.8 trillion, next 10 years, so I didn't say 3.7 and then get dinged, you know, by the liberals saying I didn't know what I was talking about." (Read the complete exchange.) What caught our attention for fact-checking purposes was her claim that the Democratic plan would result in "the largest tax increase in history." Wallace's question was about letting the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy expire. President Barack Obama's plan would increase income taxes for individuals making more than $200,000 and for couples making more than $250,000, with indexing for inflation. Wallace mentions that the Republican proposal to retain the tax cuts for the wealthy is "$678 billion you're not going to pay for." That's a reasonable estimate of how much increasing taxes on top earners would generate over 10 years. Palin, however, responded as if the Democrats intend to allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire for everyone. If that were to happen, it would increase tax revenues by approximately $3.8 trillion over ten years. But that's not what Democrats are proposing; they want to leave tax rates untouched for people who make less. We've looked for a Democrat who supports letting all the Bush tax cuts expire, and we haven't been able to find one. (And in fact, the most notable person we've found who advocates letting them all expire is Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. He said it would help bring down the deficit.) In fact, a handful of Democrats in Congress have supported keeping tax rates for the wealthy lower, too. But, to be clear, the tax cuts passed during the Bush administration do expire at the end of 2010. So if Congress doesn't act, taxes will go up for most people. The reason the tax cuts have expiration dates is because they were passed via a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. At the time, members of Congress hesitated to make them permanent for fear of deficits. So Palin is confusing the issue here by using numbers that assume all the tax cuts are going away. That is not the Democratic plan nor is it President Obama's plan. Now, let's look at the potential tax increases in comparison with other tax increases throughout history. Economists like to do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth. The most prominent study of tax increases and tax cuts over time was done by the U.S. Treasury Department, "Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills." It calculated the size of all major tax provisions from 1940 to 2006 by calculating them as a percentage of GDP. There are no formal congressional proposals yet to keep the Bush tax cuts in place, so we don't have precise estimates from official sources like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Still, there's a good bit of consensus on what the tax increases would look like, both if lower rates expired only for high earners and also for all incomes. Wallace's number of $678 billion over 10 years is reasonable for high earners, and Palin's estimate of $3.8 trillion over 10 years is within a reasonable range, if you're talking about all taxpayers. (We've also seen estimates of $3.7 trillion and $3.2 trillion.) We ran the number with some help from tax experts and found that if only the tax cuts for high earners expire, the resulting tax increases would not be the largest in history. Tax increases for high earners would be roughly 0.4 percent of GDP in the first year they take effect. That's significantly less than a 1982 tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The tax increase resulting from the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 came to 1.23 percent of GDP when the tax changes were fully implemented, four years after the law's passage. If you let all the Bush tax cuts expire, the tax increase would come to just above 2.2 percent of GDP. Clearly, that would be larger than the Reagan tax hike of 1982. But it would be smaller than one of the tax increases passed during World War II -- the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. But again, letting all the tax cuts expire isn't the plan the Democrats are proposing, and it's not what Wallace asked Palin. Palin said, "Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history." She was asked about tax cuts for the top 2 percent. Either Palin is confused about the revenue numbers involved with extending the tax cuts, or she's willfully distorting the Democratic plans. We'll let you be the judge of that. Regardless, Wallace was very specific about asking her about tax increases for the top 2 percent. And that does not represent the largest tax increase in history. The unlikely outcome that she seems to be talking about -- that all of the Bush tax cuts will be repealed -- wouldn't be the largest tax increase in history either. Palin read the number on her hand correctly, but that's about all she got right. So we rate her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08642	Horse racing could boost Georgia's economy by $1 billion a year and create 10,000 to 20,000 jobs.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/17/jb-powell/candidate-says-georgia-could-cash-horse-racing/	Georgia agriculture commissioner candidate J.B. Powell is willing to make a bet on the ponies. He wants the Peach State to allow horse racing. "Georgians deserve to have a commissioner of agriculture who will fight for common-sense ideas that will help lead Georgia out of the economic challenges we face," Powell, the Democratic Party's nominee for commissioner, said in a Sept. 9 news release. Powell believes horse racing could increase the state's struggling economy by $1 billion a year and create at least 10,000 jobs. Bugle player, begin the first call song please. Powell is in a three-man race to replace Democrat Tommy Irvin, who has been Georgia's agriculture commissioner since 1969. Gary Black is the Republican Party's nominee. Kevin Cherry is running as a Libertarian. So can this plan create as many jobs as Powell says and bring in that much money to Georgia? The idea is not new in Georgia. State lawmakers have discussed it before, but some conservatives have been reluctant to support another form of gambling. The state constitution must be amended to allow gambling on horse racing, also known as pari-mutuel betting. The candidate's evidence in support of horse racing is a 2006 study done for the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council by Deloitte, a well-known financial advisory and auditing firm. Horse racing generates an annual economic impact of $26 billion and nearly 147,000 jobs in the United States, according to the study. The Powell campaign based its estimate on Georgia's potential on how horse racing is performing in Florida. The Deloitte report found Florida sees an annual total economic impact of $2.2 billion from horse racing. The report said horse racing is responsible for 22,000 direct jobs and 51,700 total jobs. Graham Balch, Powell's campaign manager, noted that the Sunshine State has 18.5 million residents. Georgia's population is about 9.8 million. Since Georgia's population is about one-half of Florida's, Balch believes it is reasonable to conclude Georgia could see 50 percent of the economic impact from horse racing. Another advantage Georgia has is Atlanta ranks only behind Ocala, Fla., and Lexington, Ky., in the number of horse owners. "Given Georgia's level of horse ownership and climate and size, it is a realistic projection to say Georgia could at least have an economic impact of $1 billion or more like eight states around the country," Balch wrote in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia. "All fact based information leads us to believe that $1 billion in economic impact and 10,000 to 20,000 jobs is the best estimate possible and in our research we have not seen any information to contradict the projections for Georgia." Powell believes Georgia can get to the $1 billion mark, but it will take time -- at least three years. Georgia would be beginning in the horse racing business while Florida has a head start, said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of Public Sector Consulting, a nonpartisan research firm that did a study on the economic impact of horse racing in Michigan in 2002. "I would be very careful when looking at a neighboring state and say 'They do x and we can do y,' " Williams said. The Michigan study found horse racing had an economic impact of $1.2 billion in 2001. Michigan had a population of nearly 10 million residents in 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Regulated pari-mutuel horse racing has been in existence in Michigan since the 1930s. Michigan had seven racetracks at the time. Public Sector Consulting used revenue from racetrack operations as the primary factor to determine the economic impact. Williams said Georgia must examine how many people would come for horse racing from outside the state. He said spectators and bettors from Georgia could be taking away revenue from other in-state leisure activities. Williams also issued another warning: Horse racing in Michigan was suffering economically at the time of the study. The industry, he and others noted, is now in a more precarious state financially across the country. Some say the answer is combining horse racing and casino gambling. Arthur H. Anderson, a consultant for a committee attempting to bring racing to Georgia and South Carolina, said places such as Hoosier Park in Indiana show the idea can work. Anderson, who is involved with the Georgia-South Carolina Horse Racing Committee, estimates a casino/racetrack with a "funplex" for children and destination shopping can generate about $500 million a year. The committee would use the revenue to support the state's education system. Anderson supports running two tracks in Georgia, which he says can bring $1 billion to the state. A casino would need state approval, and Georgia's leaders have been against the idea. The Indianapolis Star reported in May that money wagered on horse racing in Indiana has dropped from $190 million in 2005 to $147 million in 2009. Money from slot machines has been used to supplement lagging horse racing revenue, the Star reported. The American Horse Council study found the economic impact of horse racing in Indiana in 2005 was $294 million. Powell's proposal would not include casino gambling, his campaign manager said. We looked at Virginia because it is a Southern state, its population of nearly 8 million people is closer to Georgia's and its one pari-mutuel racetrack, Colonial Downs, opened in 1997. One report from about five years ago shows the annual economic impact of the horse industry is $1 billion, which includes recreation equine activity. Virginia equine leaders note the horse racing business there has suffered in recent years. The Deloitte study on Florida found about 40 percent of the horse industry's economic impact in that state comes from racing. At that rate, the annual impact for horse racing in Virginia would be about $400 million. Virginia officials are working on an economic impact study. We believe there are some problems in using Florida to determine the potential economic impact of horse racing in Georgia. For example, Florida draws more tourists, some of whom are inclined to visit the racetrack. Some well-respected economists, such as the University of Georgia's Jeff Humphreys, said Powell's estimate may be correct, but more information is needed. We agree and rate the candidate's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	J.B. Powell	None	None	None	2010-09-17T06:00:00	2010-09-09	['None']
pomt-02573	"The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/30/mark-schlereth/espns-schlereth-says-teams-now-spend-their-money-o/	ESPN's Mark Schlereth, a former offensive lineman for the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, says offenses get all the breaks these days in the National Football League. That’s one of the reasons Schlereth is picking the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl 31-17. The offenses-first trend has spread from NFL policies to refereeing to the contracts teams award players, Schlereth said on Mike & Mike. "We use to say defense wins championships? … Are we now at a place, Mark, with the way the game is played where the offense has the edge?" asked host Mike Greenberg. "Based on the way all the rules have been for the passing game and to protect the quarterback and you can't hit people, yes, certainly," Schlereth said. "The rules are bent that way for the offense to have the advantage, I think, and that's why you see the majority of teams now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football." We decided to dig a little deeper into how the NFL’s 32 teams allocate their salaries to see if Schlereth is correct. NFL teams this year have a salary cap of about $123 million, which is generally the maximum teams can spend on players. There are plenty of ways for teams to manipulate that figure, and several teams spend way below the salary cap. The NFL Players Association publishes a public report showing overall spending toward the salary cap for each team but not a detailed breakdown by offense vs. defense. To find that, we turned to Spotrac.com, which provides a much more detailed position-by-position analysis. Their reporting is used by USA Today, the Guardian and others to report about NFL spending patterns. In the end, it’s something of an estimate, but it’s the best information publicly available and considered reliable. So are NFL teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as Schlereth suggested? We’ll start with the big numbers and work backward. For the 2013-14 year, the NFL’s 32 teams spent a total of $1.7 billion on offensive players compared to $1.6 billion on defensive players. If you measured the money as a percentage, that would translate to 51.5 percent offense, 48.5 percent defense (the margin is actually closer once you consider that NFL teams spend money on a kicker and punter who are not part of either the offense or defense). For perspective, that’s closer than the popular vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Spending by individual teams varies greatly. The Philadelphia Eagles spent nearly $74 million on offensive players, compared to $38.5 million on defensive players. The Cincinnati Bengals, conversely, spent $69 million on defensive players and $45 million on offensive personnel. (Both of those teams made the playoffs.) The Seahawks and Broncos both spend more money on offense, by the way. But while the Broncos are considered the "offensive" team, the Seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team. Team Offensive spending Defensive spending Seattle $69,386,205 $51,800,008 Denver $66,084,673 $47,763,533 Overall, of the NFL’s 32 teams, 11 spent more money on defense than offense, three teams spent just about the same amount on offense and defense and 18 spent more money on offense than defense. To put that in percentages, a little more than 56 percent of teams spend more on offense and about 44 percent do not. That gives the offenses the edge, though not decisively so. One last note: By saying "now," Schlereth is suggesting that the move toward spending on offenses is a recent development. That’s not necessarily correct. While salary cap data is harder to come by for previous years, we did find a Sports Illustrated list of all NFL players from 2008 and their salaries. In 2008, offensive players made $1.7 billion (the same amount they made in 2013) while defensive players made about $1.52 billion. Part of the difference is simple numbers -- NFL teams paid 85 more offensive players in 2008 than they did defensive players. Our ruling Schlereth said, "The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football." We reached out to Schlereth through his chili sauce company (yes, really) but did not hear back. There’s definitely evidence that NFL teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players. It's part of the reality of NFL football, where the most expensive players are typically quarterbacks. But the disparity wasn’t that significant in 2013, and it’s actually less than it was in 2008. Schlereth's claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Mark Schlereth	None	None	None	2014-01-30T14:00:00	2014-01-27	['None']
pomt-14672	Says Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama "naive" for saying he was would "sit down and talk to the Iranians" during the 2008 Democratic primary.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/bernie-sanders/sanders-obama-was-right-clinton-was-wrong-iran/	Recent positive developments in the United States’ relationship with Iran proves that President Barack Obama was right, and Hillary Clinton was wrong, said Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. On Jan. 17, 2016, Obama announced that Iran released several American prisoners, among other diplomactic achievements, including a legal settlement over a military equipment dispute. NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders Jan. 17 if he thinks Iran is still an enemy of the United States. "It’s funny," Sanders replied. "If you think back to 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama, she was critical of him. A question was asked to Obama that said, ‘Would you sit down and talk to the Iranians?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I would." Point being, you talk to your adversaries. You don’t run away from that. Secretary Clinton, I think, called him naive. Turns out that Obama was right." Clinton and Obama’s back-and-forth on Iran and other foreign policy issues was a main feature of the 2008 Democratic primary. At one point, Clinton did call Obama’s position on Iran diplomacy "naive," but Sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time. Fighting words This all started at a July 2007 Democratic presidential debate, where CNN took questions from YouTube users. One user asked, "Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?" Obama was the first to respond, saying, "I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of (the George W. Bush) administration, is ridiculous." (Obama made similar comments throughout the campaign.) Clinton also answered the question, saying she agreed that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and "get back to diplomacy." But she distinguished herself from Obama by saying she, as president, would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year, without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. Instead, she would first send envoys. Clinton’s "naive" comment came the next day in an interview with the Quad-City Times in Iowa. "I think it is wrong for any president to say he or she will not talk to people because they’re bad or evil," she said. "But the question was very specific, asking whether either of us would talk to a list of leaders of five countries with which the United States has serious difficulties within the first year of becoming president, and I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive to say he would commit to meeting with Chavez and Castro and others within the first year. As I said last night, there has to be a lot of diplomatic effort." Sanders’ made it sound like Clinton shut the door on diplomacy, when in reality she was supportive of diplomacy, though she advocated for a more cautious approach than Obama. Competing memos from both campaigns emphasized this distinction, and the two candidates argued about it at another primary debate. At the time, we gave Obama a Mostly False rating for claiming that Clinton "agrees with (John McCain) in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like." Clinton clearly said she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration. It’s worth noting that Obama did not personally meet with Iranian leaders in his first year. It wasn’t until 2013 that he spoke over the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani — the highest-level talks between the two countries in 30 years. Obama did announce in April 2009, four months into his first term, that the United States and five other countries would engage in talks with Iran — the P5+1 group that eventually negotiated the nuclear deal. For her part, Clinton as secretary of state was personally involved in diplomatic efforts to increase global sanctions on Iran that helped move the nuclear deal forward. Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton called Obama "naive" for saying he was would "sit down and talk to the Iranians" during the 2008 Democratic primary. This is a simplified description of the back-and-forth between Clinton and Obama. Both candidates said they supported more diplomacy between Iran and the United States than what the Bush administration had pursued. Clinton’s position differed from Obama’s in that she supported a slower approach, starting with lower-level talks. Obama, on the other hand, said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders in his first year as president, without preconditions. It was Obama’s approach to diplomacy with Iran that she called naive, not the idea of pursuing diplomatic relations in general. Ultimately, Obama did not meet himself with Iranian leaders in his first year. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-03474	A hidden provision in Obamacare taxes sporting goods as medical devices.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/14/chain-email/chain-email-claims-health-care-law-contains-hidden/	PolitiFact started checking claims about the three-year-old Affordable Care Act, the health care law often called Obamacare, before the legislation became law. The checked statements have rated from True to Pants on Fire! on the Truth-O-Meter, but falsehoods have often drowned out the truths.Though some of the law's provisions have gone into effect, and many of its biggest features kick in next year, polls show the public still has a hard time understanding what's in it. We've looked repeatedly at the most persistent claims, and have seen many of them evolve. We at PolitiFact Ohio thought we had a new claim this month, when a reader forwarded a chain email we hadn't seen before. We looked into it, saw it dealt with a subject familiar to us, and found that it has been examined by our friends at the nonpolitical Snopes.com and several other rumor-checking sites. The email is built on a sales receipt from Cabela's, the Nebraska-based outdoor merchandise chain whose locations include Ohio. The receipt, like one posted by Snopes.com, shows a charge for a "medical excise tax." The chain email claims that Cabela's has "refused to hide" the charge, which is "supposed to be hidden from the consumer." It goes on to say that the medical excise tax is "hidden in Obamacare," and that it applies to certain medical devices starting Jan. 1, 2013. Quoting an IRS publication on excise taxes, the email asks: "What do I find under 'medical devices' under 'manufacturers taxes'?" In answer, it lists: "Sport fishing equipment; fishing rods and fishing poles; electric outboard motors; fishing tackle boxes; bows, quivers, broadheads and points; arrow shafts; coal; taxable tires; gas guzzler automobiles, and vaccines." Let's take the parts of the claim separately. First, it is true that there is a 2.3 percent tax on the first sale of certain medical devices in the Affordable Care Act, but it is not hidden. We've done at least six fact-checks about it, starting in October 2009, and it has been cited in numerous print and broadcast ads by opponents of the health care law, including a spot for presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The tax is one of the provisions in the law that offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The tax does not apply to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, bandages or other medical devices "generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use," the law states. The tax does not apply to devices made for export. It does apply to imported devices as well as those made domestically. The Internal Revenue Service has posted information about what constitutes a taxable medical device. None of the items listed in the chain email are included. Those items are listed by the IRS as being subject to excise taxes that predate the health care act and have nothing to do with it. Contrary to the emailer's claim, the items are not listed under "medical devices" by the IRS. So why the charge on the receipt from Cabela's? The company earlier gave an explanation to its hometown Scottsbluff Star-Herald newspaper. And it confirmed to us that it was reported accurately. A Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide "glitch" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent "medical excise tax" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded. Vendors typically use new sales software at the start of a year to handle changes in tax laws, Snopes.com noted. Even though the cost of taxes are typically passed along to consumers, however, the medical device excise tax applies only to manufacturers and importers, not to consumers. Like many chain emails, the one about Cabela’s mixes fact with falsehood. The fact is the existence of the medical device excise tax, effective on Jan. 1, as part of the Affordable Care Act. But there the accuracy ends. The tax is not hidden. It does not apply to consumer products. The emailer’s "proof" of the claim that it does is actually, at best, an erroneous interpretation of an IRS posting on other excise taxes. Finally, Cabela’s told the Star-Herald that its charge was the erroneous result of a software "glitch," and the money would be refunded. The email is not accurate, and its preposterous claim that fishing tackle, tires and gas-guzzling cars are classified as "medical devices" puts it in another category: Pants on Fire!

pomt-02942	"The vast majority of people in this country are keeping their (health insurance) plan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/29/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-vast-majority-americans-will-ke/	It’s the question-du-jour about the new health care law: Are people going to be able to keep their health insurance if they like it? President Barack Obama has several times said yes. But cancellation notices coming in the mail to policyholders tell another story. The contrast between Obama’s promises and what’s playing out in America has led to a fierce political war of words about who lied, who knew what and when, and how Americans will have to deal with the ramifications. Former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod and Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn debated the issue Monday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Coburn: "You're no longer eligible to buy your own plan, which was the No. 1 promise that the president made to the American people. You cannot get what you had." Axelrod: "Most people are going to keep their own plans, senator, and you know that." Coburn: "That’s not true." Moments later, Axelrod made his point again: "The majority of people in this country, the vast majority of people in this country, are keeping their plan. People who are uninsured are going to have choices they never had before." In this fact-check, we wanted to dig into what’s happening to the American health insurance system to see what policies are being canceled, how many, why and how you might be affected. A good starting point is to see how Americans get their insurance right now. Using census data, the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that in 2012, a little less than 50 percent of the public got their coverage through an employer-based plan. That is, a business negotiates a contract with an insurance company and offers health coverage to its workers. The second largest group, about 30 percent, gets insurance through either Medicare, Medicaid or both. A third group of people with insurance, about 6 percent, buy policies directly from insurance companies. This is called the individual market. (The remainder of Americans, around 16 percent, are currently uninsured.) The health care law that was passed in 2010 made changes to all three legs of the health insurance stool, but the biggest changes came in the individual market. Before the health care law was passed, the individual market was widely considered a mess. Insurers could turn you down for pre-existing conditions, and none of the insurance was standardized, so if you bought a policy, it wasn’t always crystal clear what you were getting. The law’s goal always had been to get these people into standardized plans that cover a defined list of benefits. As a result, some existing policies did not meet standards set by the new health care law. This is why people in this group may be seeing cancellation notices. Kaiser estimates that 15 million people are in the individual market. They are likely to have a very different experience from the "vast majority" cited by Axelrod. In New Jersey and Florida, hundreds of thousands of people have received cancellation notices and more are popping up across the country. It’s unclear how many people in the individual market will be forced to change their plan. And what happens to people who are will vary. People can buy another plan from the same company or shop around. Some of them will be eligible for government subsidies and some will not. This group is where the disruptions are most likely. Another group of people -- about 90 million -- are covered through through Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act does make changes, most notably in something called the Medicare Advantage program, they are not being moved into new coverage plans. That leaves the nearly 150 million people who get their insurance through the plans their employer offer. Those plans could change. But it’s tough to say how substantially, and how much as a result of the health care law. Part of that is because plans change every year. Still, some companies are making changes to bring costs down. For example, UPS is telling their employees that if their spouse can receive health insurance through a different employer, UPS will no longer offer them coverage. That certainly could mean people are not keeping their health care plan. How much of the blame should be shouldered by the health care law is a different matter. We asked a variety of experts to comment on the literal accuracy of Axelrod’s statement. For the most part, regardless of their opinion of the new health care law, they gave Axelrod the benefit of the doubt. "It’s probably true -- at least for next year," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H. W. Bush. "Most employers aren’t going to do anything about the insurance they are offering for 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act." "He is absolutely right," said Bob Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. But Laszweski also said Axelrod was intentionally diverting attention from the real problems taking place in the individual market. Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, "I would make the same comment that David Axelrod makes but without any real facts. The people with large employers are not really being impacted by the (health care law) and neither are the Medicare and Medicaid recipients." Sabrina Corlette, program director at at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, echoed Anderson’s point. For Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, rejected Axelrod’s claim, largely because no one has the hard evidence to back it up or refute it. "No one has the data to be sure," Marmor said. "Axelrod has no authority for his claim. It is a hope." But Marmor is among the minority of the experts we consulted. "It's simply true," said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington health consulting group. "Most of the lives are in the large corporate customer base and we're seeing virtually no dropping of coverage there." What does it mean to keep your plan? In the view of some analysts, if the plan offered by an employer changes, it is not the same plan and this would make Axelrod wrong. Chris Conover, a critic of Obamacare and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, said the Affordable Care Act requires that every plan offer certain minimum benefits, such as free preventive care. It also allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents’ plan. Those and other rules drive up premiums and lead to employers offering different plans. Conover said millions of people "actually have had to purchase more expensive coverage even if they were perfectly happy with their old coverage." Axelrod’s office takes a different view. We contacted them and his staff pointed us to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Based on responses from 966 organizations, including firms both small and large, the survey found that 94 percent were definitely or very likely to continue to offer coverage. In that sense, the majority of Americans would still get insurance through their employer. Still, in the survey, about half of the companies estimated Obamacare would raise costs in the range of 1 to 4 percent. Many businesses, in the range of 30 to 40 percent overall, planned to increase the employee share of premiums, raise their deductibles and in other ways shift costs to workers. But it is important to remember that cost and risk shifting has been with the country for a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey of employer plans reports that in the past 10 years, the average share of premiums paid by employees has gone up and the fraction of workers in high-deductible plans has risen steadily since 2006, reaching one fifth of the people in the study in 2013. Richard Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group of insurance companies, said the impact of the health care law takes place within an insurance marketplace that has been far from static. "There have been year to year changes to policies," Zirkelbach said. Of all the factors that drive those changes -- rising medical costs, changes in the health of the people in the insurance pool, and government regulation -- Zirkelbach believes the Affordable Care Act rules are having the largest impact as employers look to 2014. Zirkelbach points especially to the minimum requirements for every insurance plan. The employee benefit survey reports that about three quarters of all plans meet all minimum requirements and need no further changes. Our ruling Axelrod said the vast majority of people are keeping their health care plans. That’s certainly what the 2010 health care law intended. The law was crafted largely to leave in place the health care delivery systems for people who get health insurance either through their employer (about 50 percent of people with insurance) or through the government-managed Medicare or Medicaid programs (about 30 percent). Some changes may be occurring in the employer market that would stop people from keeping the health care plans they have. But the bigger issues are in the so-called individual market, which accounts for about 6 percent of Americans who now have health care. The health care law, in essence, raises standards that will make many plans offered in the individual market obsolete. Experts told us there is no precise data to determine how many people will be forced to change health care plans, but they generally agreed the number will be small this year. The broad consensus is that, for the time being, most people will see changes in their coverage and what they pay for that coverage consistent with changes they have seen with their insurance over the past decade.

pomt-04609	"Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/19/naacp/-person-voter-fraud-very-rare-phenomenon/	With less than two months to November’s presidential election, voter laws have taken center stage. The latest area of contention is Pennsylvania, where the outcome of the state’s new voter identification law is before that state’s Supreme Court. Pennsylvania’s law, signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett in March, follows similar laws in states such as Georgia, and it is scheduled to take effect in time for the November general election. Pennsylvania’s law would require voters to show an official ID -- including a state driver’s license, government employee ID or a state nondriver ID card -- to cast a ballot. Thirty-one states have laws in place that will require all voters to show ID at the polls this November, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. As in other states, supporters say the law is necessary to combat voter fraud; opponents say the new law disenfranchises poor, minority and elderly voters who are less likely to have the approved IDs. Opponents also say the voter ID laws are unnecessary because the voter fraud used to justify the laws doesn’t exist. Politifact has done extensive research on the issue of voter ID laws and the impact on voters and Election Day turnout. The NAACP, working with a variety of civil rights groups opposing the state’s law, held a news conference in Philadelphia last week warning about the possible negative impact the voter ID law could have on Pennsylvania’s eligible voters. In an announcement about the news conference, the NAACP said that "Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally." That number the organization used is very specific for a 12-year period. The NAACP figure deals only with "in-person voter fraud." And only with cases that have been "proven." This type of voter fraud, experts say, is extremely rare. PolitiFact Georgia wondered how the civil rights organization had arrived at its conclusion. What was the criteria examined for the voter fraud cases? How was the fraud proved or disproved? And is the number correct? We asked the NAACP about the basis for its claim and found that the group used statistics from a nationwide analysis of 2,068 cases alleging election fraud that were reviewed by News21, a Carnegie-Knight investigative reporting project staffed by college journalism students. Results of News21’s seven-month analysis were released in August. The claim made involves a narrow type of election fraud, in-person voter fraud, that voter ID laws are intended to prevent. The News21 team defined that type of fraud as that involving individuals who vote in person on Election Day by impersonating another registered voter. To get the data, News21 reporters sent records requests to elections officers in all 50 states seeking every case of fraudulent elections activity, including registration fraud, absentee ballot fraud, voter impersonation fraud and casting an ineligible vote. News21 said it received no useful responses from several states. With some states, including Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Carolina and South Dakota, the cases included in the database came from a survey of alleged election fraud conducted by the Republican National Lawyers Association. And in some states, some but not all local jurisdictions responded, and some responses were missing important details about each case. Despite those issues, News21 defends its work as "substantially complete" as the largest collection of election fraud cases gathered by anyone in the country. After compiling all the information into an election fraud database, News21 found that 207 cases of other types of election fraud existed for every case of voter impersonation. "It’s difficult to study the issue of impersonation fraud, which I understood [from the News21 case analysis] to be really just allegations," said Michael McDonald, an associate professor in the department of public and international affairs at George Mason University whose electoral system research was compiled as The United States Elections Project. "Still, yes, it’s plausible and occasionally people have done it. ... But by all accounts it’s a very rare phenomenon." In Georgia, for example, News21’s database includes 301 cases of reported election fraud and no cases of voter impersonation. Twenty-three total election fraud cases were listed for Pennsylvania; none were for voter impersonation. The data compiled by the News21 project have been used widely by various civil rights groups and cited in several news articles as the issue of election requirements -- specifically voter ID laws -- has intensified. For the most part, the News21 analysis has been unchallenged, with the exception of the Republican National Lawyers Association, which has supported voter ID laws. News21 began gathering data in January by reviewing about 375 cases of alleged voter fraud collected by the RNLA. The News21 analysis found that the RNLA cases consisted mainly of newspaper articles about various election issues with little supporting evidence of actual in-person voter fraud. In an email response to PolitiFact Georgia, Michael Thielen, the RNLA’s executive director, classified News21’s analysis involving the in-person voter fraud cases as "highly flawed in its very approach to the issue." And, by stating that voter impersonation is the only type of election fraud that voter ID laws could prevent, the News21 report was result-driven, attempting to prove that voter ID is not necessary, Thielen said. Thielen and the RNLA maintain that voter ID laws would prevent several types of election fraud, including voting in multiple states, noncitizen voting and voting in multiple jurisdictions within a state. He referenced the RNLA’s December 2011 Vote Fraud State Survey, a compilation of limited searches for election law crimes within the 50 states in recent years. The RNLA is working on a detailed response to News21’s report, Thielen said. The NAACP’s claim -- actually, News21’s -- that only 10 provable cases of voter impersonation have occurred in the country in the past dozen years is based on extensive analysis and data received from the actual elections officials in charge of handling these issues. Without doing a repeat of the 50-state data collection and review, it is impossible to re-create the same type of research. Supporters of the voter ID laws, including the RNLA, still defend them. But the RNLA’s own research alleging that more cases of fraud exist than the News21 claim includes several other types of election fraud, not just voter impersonation. The NAACP’s claim, and in turn News21’s, appears mostly accurate, with an extensive database supporting it. There are a few missing pieces, however, in the data. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02079	Obamacare is "one big fat VA system."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/	The uproar over allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and delays that potentially cost veterans their lives has opened the Obama administration to criticism that it was slow to respond to the VA’s own internal reports. Some also see a connection between troubles at the VA and the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. On Fox News’ The Five, four of the show’s pundits built the case that if Obama digs deeply into the VA, it will raise more questions than he would like about how the Affordable Care Act is structured. When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a "single-payer" system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in. "If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare," Guilfoyle said. Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year "are going to die waiting" for treatment because of Obamacare. Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to "one big fat VA system." Obamacare: One big fat VA system The VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies. But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country. In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule. Some notes about the Affordable Care Act: Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. The government has not seized control of hospitals or nationalized doctors. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges. Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. "Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance," Buchmueller said. Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. "It’s an army," Getzen said. "In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation." Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA "is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office." They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently. Scott Harrington, an adjunct scholar with the conseravtive American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, described the changes under Obamacare as a step in the direction of a government-run health care system. "But it’s a long way from getting there," Harrington said. The idea that the Affordable Care Act was a "government takeover of health care" was named as PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. 500 people dying a year from Obamacare Bolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result. "President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare," Bolling said. At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients. "You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits," Bolling said. "If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples." While we won’t fact-check Bolling’s prediction, we do think it’s important to point out two problems with Bolling’s math for people who saw the segment. First, the Congressional Budget Office projects that through 2024, 26 million people will gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So Bolling exaggerated the base number by about 50 percent. Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us. "The average in the U.S. is between four and six," Getzen said. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the average number of visits fell from 4.8 a year in 2001 to 3.9 in 2010. Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed. Our ruling Guilfoyle said Obamacare is "one big fat VA system." We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03964	"I was the first member of Congress to call him (Barack Obama) a socialist..."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/15/paul-broun/broun-touts-pinning-socialist-label-obama/	U.S. Rep. Paul Broun has never been known as a wilting flower. During his time in the U.S. House, the Georgia Republican has become known for his strong, conservative opinions and controversial statements involving evolution. Those strong positions were on full display in a recent fundraising letter to donors that surfaced this week. In soliciting funds for his run for the Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss, Broun criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and alleged their policies are ruining the country. "I was the first member of Congress to call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like government control of health care and redistribution of wealth," Broun says of Obama in the letter. PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone says they’re the "first" to make a particular statement, so we researched the claim to see if Broun’s bar should be lowered. Stories about Broun’s letter were published earlier this week by other news outlets and political pundits across the state. The conservative political blog Georgia Tipsheet called the letter "a predictably confrontational fundraising appeal" and noted that Broun was among the earliest to attach the (socialist) barb to Obama. The liberal blog Daily Kos called Broun’s letter "crackpot haiku." In August 2009, Broun told an audience at North Georgia Technical College that Obama -- along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reid -- were members of a "socialist elite," while deriding Obamacare (what critics call the national health care law). Then, in January 2011, after Obama delivered his State of the Union address, Broun said in a Twitter post that the president did not believe in the Constitution, and instead "You believe in socialism." Broun compared Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator in November 2008, but apologized a week later for making the statements. "The point I tried to make is that he is extremely liberal, he has promoted a lot of socialistic ideas, and it just makes me concerned," Broun told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter at the time. Obama’s socialist moniker doesn’t stop with Broun. In October 2008, then-Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accused Obama of pursuing a "socialist" agenda for telling blue-collar worker Joe the Plumber during a campaign stop that spreading the wealth around is good for everybody. That same month, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich told a newspaper reporter, "(Obama) is left of Teddy Kennedy. With all due respect, the man is a socialist." PolitiFact has examined before whether Obama is a socialist, a claim made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire. But we’re ruling on a different claim here: whether Broun was the first to place the "socialist" label on the president. So was Broun’s claim accurate? We called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun’s staff for comment, but received no response. PolitiFact Georgia found that Broun’s socialist name-calling goes back to 2009 when he said the president was a member of the "socialist elite," and in 2011 said the president believed in socialism. But one of Broun’s congressional colleagues, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, called Obama a socialist in October 2008; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized Obama’s "socialist" agenda during that same month. Based on our research, Broun was not the first member of Congress to specifically call Obama a socialist. In November 2008, Broun did compare Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator. Philosopher Karl Marx is described historically as a revolutionary socialist, and Hitler was head of the National Socialist German Workers Party. But even that criticism was made a month after other congressional members lobbed their socialist charges. Congress consists of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, and Obama was called a "socialist" by an Ohio senator a year before Broun actually used the term "socialist." We rated Broun’s claim False.

pomt-13635	"(Paul Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/10/david-canon/professor-house-speaker-paul-ryan-has-only-propose/	Even after endorsing Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan continues to wrestle with the divide between him and his party’s presidential nominee. "We’re different people," Ryan, who is from Janesville, told reporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "There are different kinds of conservatives." While Trump appeals to emotions, Ryan tends to be cast as the GOP’s policy wonk. But in a July 9, 2016 New York Times article, the chairman of the University of Wisconsin’s political science department suggested Ryan’s reputation may be overblown. Why? Few of his plans ever become law. "(Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999," David Canon was quoted as saying. "Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been. "He is an ideas guy." When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is "putting it on paper and having a real debate." In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn’t follow his own advice — or hasn’t had much success with it. Let’s take a look. Bills, bills, bills The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law: "One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on ‘evidence-based policy making.’ " A visit to Ryan’s profile at Congress.gov shows — when filtered by "Sponsored Legislation" and "Became Law" — the same three bills referenced in the article. While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills "sponsored" by Ryan. "Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill," Canon wrote in an email. "Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill." According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law. New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement’s context in the article reflects that. But Ryan’s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan’s tenure. "Any realistic look at (Ryan’s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong," said spokesman Ian Martorana. He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write: Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 Trade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said. Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator. "Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment," she wrote in an email. "Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor." While this legislator hasn’t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic. Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill’s content and committee chairs, while they don’t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators. A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers. It takes into account the content of a lawmaker’s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker’s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker’s impact. By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999. The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held. Our rating Canon told the New York Times that Ryan "has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999." Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but — like Canon — ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn’t solely sponsor. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a76b05-8d40-4be1-a98d-32bb0f903f19	None	David Canon	None	None	None	2016-08-10T05:00:00	2016-07-09	['None']

pomt-00613	A 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would "be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/29/tim-sheehy/would-paying-half-cost-new-milwaukee-bucks-arena-b/	News broke on May 27, 2015 that an agreement was close on how to pay for a new $500 million arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, the basketball team that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once led to glory. Some details of the proposed arrangement between the Bucks and state and local government officials were new. But the overall cost sharing was, more or less, what had long been expected: The Bucks’ owners would pay half and taxpayers would pay half. According to Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, such a split would be good for taxpayers. Here is what he said April 10, 2015 on "Here and Now," a Wisconsin Public Television show: "If this comes out close to a 50-50 partnership, it will be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country." In other words, Sheehy, who supports the new arena, is saying that taxpayers picking up half the tab for a new Milwaukee arena is relatively low, compared to how much taxpayers have contributed toward arenas for other National Basketball Association teams. The parties set a self-imposed deadline of May 29, 2015 to try and finalize the financing deal, which would have to be approved, likely within the next few weeks, as part of the 2015-’17 state budget. So, let’s take a look. The Bucks and their arenas The Bucks joined the NBA in the 1968-’69 season. Led by Abdul-Jabbar and another future Hall of Famer, Oscar Robertson, they won their only league championship in the 1970-’71 season. That, according to the team, meant the Bucks went further, faster, than any expansion team in the history of major professional sports. In recent years, however, the Bucks have struggled, and that is one reason there has been a drive to build a new arena. The team’s current home -- the $90 million BMO Harris Bradley Center, which was built through a donation by the late Milwaukee philanthropist Jane Bradley Pettit -- opened in 1988. The 18,600-seat arena is the third-oldest and the third-smallest in the 30-team NBA. Momentum for a new arena picked up in April 2014, when the Bucks’ longtime owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl of Milwaukee, announced he was selling the team to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. Kohl and the new owners pledged to contribute $250 million toward a new arena. Coming up with the other $250 million has been the sticking point, leading to months of negotiations involving Gov. Scott Walker, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. There is time pressure in that the NBA has said a new arena must be built by the fall of 2017, or Milwaukee would risk losing the team to another market. Other arena deals To see how other NBA arenas have been financed, we turned to two sources: The 2012 edition of "Financing Economic Development in the 21st Century," a textbook that includes a chapter on financing professional sports facilities. And a database, last updated in August 2014, that is maintained by Marquette University Law School’s National Sports Law Institute. We’ve listed the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the arenas in the league -- that have been built since 1999. We went back to 1999 because a wave of NBA arenas -- seven of them -- went up that year. As we’ll see, there is some disagreement between the figures provided by the textbook and by Marquette. Holy Cross College sports economist Victor Matheson, who wrote the sports facilities chapter in the textbook, told us that’s not surprising because there are different ways to define a public contribution and because stadium financing deals aren’t always transparent. Based on the two sources we checked, at least eight of the 15 NBA arenas built since 1999 were financed with more than 50 percent taxpayer support. Indeed, although there is some variation in the figures in the two sources, seven of the eight arenas were built with at least 82 percent public money (the total cost figures are according to the textbook). Arenas built with more than 50% public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Orlando 2010 $480 million 90% 87.5% Charlotte 2005 $265 million 100% 100% Memphis 2004 $250 million 100% 83% Houston 2003 $235 million 82% 100% San Antonio 2002 $186 million 85% 84% Oklahoma City 2002 $89 million 100% 100% Miami 1999 $213 million 100% 59% New Orleans 1999 $114 million 100% 100% Conversely, the textbook and Marquette agree that only four of the arenas were built with taxpayer contributions of 50 percent or less. Arenas built with 50% or less public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the textbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Dallas 2001 $420 million 50% 30% Toronto 1999 $265 million 0% 0% Denver 1999 $160 million 22% 3% Los Angeles 1999 $375 million 16% 19% There was not agreement between the between the two sources on the public portion paid for arenas in Brooklyn, Indianapolis and Atlanta: NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Indianapolis 1999 $183 million 100% 43% Atlanta 1999 $214 million 29% 91% Brooklyn 2010 $637 million 24% N/A Our rating Sheehy said a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would "be much better in terms of the portion of the public financing than most of the other arena projects done around the country." Of the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the cities in the league -- built since 1999, at least eight were built with more than 50 percent of the money coming from taxpayers. Seven of those eight were built with at least 82 percent public money. We rate his statement True.	None	Tim Sheehy	None	None	None	2015-05-29T14:40:19	2015-04-10	['None']

pomt-05727	Says State Comptroller Matthew Boxer "pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton" in order to "get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid. This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/05/michael-doherty/michael-doherty-claims-new-jersey-towns-are-artifi/	State Sen. Michael Doherty wants to see action taken immediately to address what he considers a fraudulent practice in many New Jersey municipalities where property values are being lowered to secure more school aid from the state. In a Feb. 28 interview on NJToday, Doherty claimed that activity was documented in a report issued by the state comptroller. "And the other one was a report by our state comptroller, Matthew Boxer, and he pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton, and they do that because that also means they get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid," Doherty (R-Warren) said. "This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately." Fraud? Money? PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued. But after reviewing the comptroller’s August 2010 report, we found that Doherty is exaggerating its findings. The comptroller’s report shows that some municipalities "artificially" reduce property tax collections through the use of tax abatements, possibly leading to the increased need for school aid, according to the report. However, tax abatements are allowed under state law and don’t represent an act of "fraud." Also, while such abatements may indirectly generate additional school aid, their purpose is to attract investment to areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation. First, let’s explain what a tax abatement is. Through tax abatements, municipalities reduce or eliminate property tax bills for certain landowners, who are typically businesses and developers. In the case of long-term abatements, property owners are exempt from paying taxes, but must contribute so-called "payments in lieu of taxes," or PILOTs. But none of that PILOT money goes to the local school districts, which also are losing the property tax revenue. As a result, such tax abatements may increase the need for state aid, according to the comptroller’s report. "The school district still needs the state aid at the enhanced level since the district itself does not see the benefit of the PILOT amounts, and taxpayers throughout the state pay the resulting bill," according to the report. So, Doherty is correct that tax abatements may result in sending more school aid to those communities. But we found two problems with Doherty’s characterization of tax abatements. First, Doherty’s "fraud" claim suggests that such practices are somehow illegal. The comptroller’s report raises multiple concerns about the tax abatement process, but still indicates that such tax exemptions are permitted under state law. Secondly, Doherty suggested that the purpose of tax abatements was to generate additional school aid. But tax abatements are meant to "encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment of distressed areas," according to the comptroller’s report. The increase in municipal revenue through PILOTs also was cited by some officials "as a motivation to grant abatements," the report states. The comptroller’s report does not claim the purpose of tax abatements is to receive more school aid, according to Peter McAleer, spokesman for the comptroller’s office. McAleer told us that determining such a purpose "would require reading the minds of those who grant the abatements, and it’s impossible to make an across-the-board conclusion about the state of mind of hundreds of different local officials." But Doherty argued that municipalities are manipulating the numbers and school districts are using the low real estate values as justification for demanding greater school aid. "So my statement is 100 percent accurate," Doherty told us. "I see the big picture...I see how it affects the school funding formula and the distribution of school aid." Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Doherty said, according to the comptroller’s report, many municipalities are "artificially lowering" real estate values to secure more school aid, a practice he referred to as "fraud." The senator is right that tax abatements may lead to greater school aid in communities with these tax-exempt properties. But he’s wrong to claim those practices constitute "fraud," and that their direct purpose is to generate additional school aid. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-10690	"He's (Romney) the one who said that he would be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/rudy-giuliani/he-didnt-say-that-but-he-did-shift-to-the-left/	While Romney never said he was "to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights," Romney did reach out to gay and lesbian voters during his failed 1994 bid for Kennedy's Senate seat. More to the point, Romney said he could outperform Kennedy on gay and lesbian issues. In an October 1994 letter to the Massachusetts chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights group, Romney wrote, "For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area. But I believe we can and must do better." And during an August 1994 question and answer session with the Boston gay and lesbian newspaper Bay Windows, Romney said he could be a more effective advocate for gay rights than Kennedy because he is a Republican. "When Ted Kennedy speaks on gay rights, he's seen as an extremist. When Mitt Romney speaks on gay rights he's seen as a centrist and a moderate," he said. By 2002, when Romney defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to become Massachusetts' governor, he had backed off his support of gay rights. O'Brien said she would support legislation to legalize gay marriage, while Romney said he would not. After Romney won the election, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2004 that gays and lesbians must be allowed to marry in Massachusetts, making it the first state to confer that right. Romney fought it every step of the way. While he didn't say that he would "be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights," he did say he would be a more effective gay rights advocate than Kennedy because of his centrist/moderate stance. So apart from the license he takes with Romney's wording, Giuliani's attack is Mostly True and demonstrates just how far Romney has shifted to the right since his first foray into politics in 1994.

We find the claim is accurate. Dodd first introduced the bill in 1985 and it became law in 1993, more than seven years later. It allows workers to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or the illness of a close family member. It's fair for Dodd to say that he had to work hard to get the bill passed. It was stymied by a Republican filibuster in the Senate in 1988. It fared better in 1990, passing both chambers, but the first President Bush vetoed it. The veto was sustained, and the issue was off the table for the session. Later, in 1991, Dodd found a critical ally in Republican Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri. They negotiated changes that would make the legislation more palatable to the business community and bring on more Republicans. The bill cleared in 1992, only to be vetoed again by Bush. Again, the veto was not overridden. Finally, in 1993 the legislation cleared for the third time and President Clinton signed it into law. It took compromise to allay the fears of the business community and get enough Republicans to support it. When it passed, the States News Service quoted Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. saying "Dodd has been a bulldog on this."	None	Chris Dodd	None	None	None	2007-10-30T00:00:00	2007-11-05	['None']
pomt-06748	"We rank below Ethiopia, I'm told, in terms of our exports per capita, well below any of the other developed countries we trade with, and well below China and (South) Korea."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/25/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-export-values-capita-lag-e/	Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is a former United States trade ambassador who supports more trade agreements to increase U.S. exports. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, the senator said the U.S. "should be the largest exporter in the world, which we are in many categories, but also per capita. We are well behind all of our trading partners." Not only behind trading partners, he said: "We rank below Ethiopia, I'm told, in terms of our exports per capita, well below any of the other developed countries we trade with, and well below China and (South) Korea and countries we hope to trade with more, in the case of Korea through the Korean trade agreement." When Portman made a similar statement early this year, saying that U.S. trade lags behind other developed nations, PolitiFact Ohio rated it as True. We found that the United States trails only Germany and China in terms of merchandise shipped abroad, but that U.S. exports are a smaller portion of the overall economy. The value of U.S. exports in relation to the nation's gross domestic product ranks near the bottom of a list of more than 200 exporting countries compiled by the World Bank. Portman cited a different measure, exports per capita, on PBS. Knowing his expertise in international trade, PolitiFact Ohio again wanted to know more. We looked at figures from the CIA World Factbook and were surprised at what we found. U.S. exports per capita (about $3,400 in 2009) were less than half of South Korea's ($7,700), just as Portman said. But U.S. exports were substantially more per capita than China's ($899) and spectacularly more than Ethiopia's ($19). We asked Portman's office for clarification, and were told the senator "was referring to the GDP number" on PBS. Portman referred more than once to "exports per capita." But PolitiFact Ohio does understand slips of the tongue, and Portman clearly has expertise on this issue. When we substituted "percentage of GDP" for "per capita" -- a substitution only suggested by our checking with his office -- his statement on PBS is accurate about China and South Korea, but not about Ethiopia. By a slim margin, exports from Ethiopia are a smaller percentage of GDP (11 percent) than are U.S. exports (13 percent) on the World Bank list. So where does that leave us? Portman's underlying point remains that U.S. exports lag behind other countries. Yet even allowing that he misspoke on the terms for his comparison, he still is off point on one of his examples.

pomt-12358	"The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/08/jesse-kremer/republican-wisconsin-lawmaker-wrongly-states-its-f/	During a May 11, 2017 hearing on his bill to create tougher penalties for college students who disrupt public speakers, Wisconsin state Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, had this exchange with state Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison: Berceau: So, my question is, if a geology student says, "I’m sorry, but the Earth is only 6,000 years old" -- rejecting science that says that the Earth is considerably older than that -- is it not OK for a professor to tell that student that they’re wrong? Kremer: So, this bill stays out of the classroom. Yes, the Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact. But, we can discuss that outside of this room. (He chuckles.) Berceau: You said that it is a fact, you do believe it’s a fact? Kremer: Yeah, I do. While the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old is an article of faith for some, in this context Kremer presented it as a knowable fact. Let’s take a look. Kremer and his bills Kremer, who represents a rural area northwest of Milwaukee, is known for proposing legislation that is, in his words, "red meat for conservatives". For example, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; place gender restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms; and allow concealed carry permit-holders to carry guns on public school grounds and college campuses. Kremer introduced the speech bill six days before the hearing, which was held by a state Assembly committee. It would require the state’s Board of Regents to adopt a policy for Wisconsin’s public colleges that includes "a range of disciplinary sanctions for anyone under an institution's jurisdiction who engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct that interferes with the free expression of others." A student violator could face a one-semester suspension or expulsion for a second offense. The bill, which is expected to be taken up by the Assembly in June 2017, comes as free speech issues have grown more contentious on college campuses across the country, fostering concerns among Republicans that conservative speakers aren’t treated equally. The Capital Times reported on Kremer’s 6,000 statement from the hearing on June 7, 2017, triggering national news stories. Coincidentally, the same day, scientists reported on the discovery of fossils in Morocco that date back roughly 300,000 years, indicating that mankind evolved earlier than had been known. The scientific consensus is that the Earth itself is much older than that. The Earth’s age The topic never seems to get old. 2014: Facebook posts about two Republican U.S. senators and former presidential candidates claimed in part that Marco Rubio of Florida believes the Earth is 9,000 years old and that Rand Paul of Kentucky believes it is 10,000 years old. Neither had made such statements, and PolitiFact National’s rating on the posts was Pants on Fire. 2015: A talk that then-GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson gave four years earlier made news. He had said in 2011: "I am not a hard-and-fast person who says the Earth is only 6,000 years old," but, "I do believe in the six-day creation." 2017: The Washington Post’s Dear Science column answered the question: How do we know how old the Earth is? The answer: "Scientists now know the Earth is actually 4.54 billion years old, an age built on many lines of evidence from the geologic record." Smithsonian.com and the scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (based on very old rocks, of course) also say around 4.5 billion. But Kremer is far from alone in his belief. The 6,000 figure Many attribute the 6,000 figure to James Ussher (1581–1656), an Irish archbishop who concluded that Adam was created in 4004 B.C. He made his calculation, in part, by counting the number of generations in the Bible. An Institute for Creation Research article says, however, that the work in which Ussher made the estimate contains 12,000 footnotes from secular sources, as well as 2,000 references from the Bible, indicating, the article says, that most of his evidence was non-biblical. And the magazine Wired once observed: Ussher was far from the first person to wildly miscalculate the universe’s age ….Among others to try their hand were Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, both of whom arrived at estimates younger than Ussher’s. All labored without a number of modern tools — not only for measuring radioactive decay or rates of the universal expansion, but an intellectual framework for conceiving of time on scales beyond the biblical. That wouldn’t exist for another century, when a Scottish farmer and geological enthusiast named James Hutton, looking at riverbank stone formations, saw a record of sedimentary deposition that couldn’t be contained in 6,000 years. Or many times that. That was a radical idea, and it took another century to be widely accepted, even in the scientific community. Kremer told us his statement is based on his "deeply held religious beliefs, and thus First Amendment freedom of religion and expression, can be found here based on sound biblical and historical evidence." He pointed us to an AnswersInGenesis.org article that also cites Ussher and concludes in part: Cultures around the world give an age of the Earth that confirms what the Bible teaches. Radiometric dates, on the other hand, have been shown to be wildly in error. The age of the Earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust — it’s a worldview issue. But geology and environmental science professor Nelson Ham at St. Norbert University, a Catholic college in De Pere, Wis., told us: "Kremer's statement is certainly not a scientific fact," noting the many estimates of around 4.5 billion years. "Determining that age has come from measurements that are testable and repeatable, following the scientific method." Our rating Kremer says: "The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact." Kremer states a biblical belief, but goes too far in describing it as a fact. It’s a matter of settled science that the Earth is much older, with the current consensus being that it is about 4.5 billion years of age. We rate the statement False.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was appointed head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared to be another instance of a fake headline placed atop an old story only advocating for the move. "Just in today: Trey Gowdy is the new director of the FBI!" read the headline on a June 23, 2017, post on Snoopack.com. Facebook users flagged the post as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post touts that Gowdy, the new head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had been noted as a potential replacement for ousted FBI Director James Comey. But it didn’t mention anything about that being a done deal, as the headline said. Indeed, there was talk in May that Gowdy was a potential candidate to replace Comey, but Gowdy took himself out of the running on May 15. He tweeted that he "would not be the right person" to take the job. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Snoopack.com post is an uncredited copy of a March 29 post from AngryPatriotMovement.com, which initially carried the headline, "Petition: Appoint Trey Gowdy as director of the FBI." That original post went on for longer than the Snoopack.com version, and asked readers to share the post on Facebook to show support for Gowdy. TeaParty.org also copied the AngryPatriotMovement.com post, crediting the site and adding an online petition form. There’s no indication why the post about Gowdy, who has been the target of fake news before, was resurrected on June 23. Snoopack.com did not reply when we sent them an email via their online submission form. On June 7, President Donald Trump nominated Christopher Wray to head the FBI. Wray must be confirmed by the Senate. Fake news websites often put fake headlines on out-of-context news or opinion posts that aren’t bogus, leading to serious confusion for readers.

pomt-00158	"Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/23/blog-posting/hurricane-headed-toward-migrant-caravan-not-so/	A headline on a site called Patriotic Express misleads by giving the impression that a hurricane is headed directly toward a caravan of immigrants bound for the United States. "Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path," said the Oct. 22 headline on patrioticexpress.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Hurricane Willa is projected to make landfall on Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday, Oct.t 23. However, its projected landfall is more than 1,000 miles north of the caravan’s current location. The latest news reports say the caravan is in the town of Huixtla, in southern Mexico. Hurricane Willa’s watch and warning advisories do not extend to Huixtla. Patriotic Express cites weather.com (The Weather Channel) as reporting that the hurricane "should approach landfall along the southwestern coast of mainland Mexico by late Tuesday, which is expected to occur anywhere from near or north of Mazatlán to near Puerto Vallarta." (The Patriotic Express links to an outdated page on weather.com, but latest updates on weather.com maintain that landfall is expected in that general region, "south of Mazatlán and well north of Puerto Vallarta.") The caravan is far from that point. Parts of the Patriotic Express story are less misleading than the headline, saying that the hurricane "is set to cross the path that the migrants will eventually cross." "As the caravan heads north, there’s no doubt that they’ll eventually run into deteriorating conditions leftover from Willa — which we’ll soon see what level of damage it imposes upon populated areas of Mexico," the post said. "The strain on resources in many areas of Mexico is already bad — let alone the possibility of being hit by a major hurricane and a large army of hungry migrants." Though the caravan is heading north, it’s uncertain if it will cross the towns expected to be impacted by Hurricane Willa. Even then, the caravan — walking north — would be many days away from reaching that point if it went that direction. (If it chose to go to the Brownsville, Texas, border, it would be on the opposite side of the hurricane’s expected landfall.) The number of people in the caravan has increased since it started Oct. 13, reports peg the number traveling at around 7,000 — lower than 10,000 claimed in the Patriotic Express headline. A headline on patrioticexpress.com claimed, "Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path." The hurricane is expected to make landfall in Mexico — but nowhere near the caravan’s current location. It’s uncertain whether the caravan will pass through towns impacted by the hurricane.

pomt-07458	Says the fluoride Austin is putting in its drinking water is "toxic waste."	false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/19/mike-ford/austin-resident-says-flouride-compound-added-local/	In a letter to the editor published in the March 18 Austin Chronicle, Mike Ford suggests Austin residents have reason to question whether fluoridated water is safe. "How many would be comfortable if they knew that the fluoride Austin is putting into our drinking water is fluorosilicic acid (toxic waste from the fertilizer industry) that the city buys from Lucier Chemical Industries?" his letter states. Eww. Ford, an Austin resident, is part of Fluoride Free Austin, which has urged the city to stop putting fluoride in drinking water. On March 22, a City Council committee took testimony on the practice--and at least one speaker referred to the chemical additive as an industrial toxic waste, according to video of the hearing placed online. Ford answered our request for backup by forwarding information from various sources including a November 2009 memo from an assistant city manager to Austin’s City Council stating that after voter approval, the Austin Water Utility began adding fluoride to the water supply Feb. 2, 1973; the council can change the practice by majority vote. Nationally in 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 195.5 million people (72.4 percent) on public water systems had access to "optimally fluoridated" water, up from 69 percent of individuals on public water supplies in 2006. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates how much fluoride that drinking water should have. The current recommended range is 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams (parts per million) per liter of water, though the EPA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans in January to consider setting the limit at the low end of the current standard, 0.7 milligrams. Peter Silva, an EPA water administrator, said: "EPA’s new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride." One health effect is dental fluorosis, which the agency’s announcement says "may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth-forming years, age 8 and younger. Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild or mild form – as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting of the tooth surface, is rare in the United States." (It’s not rare in the Texas Panhandle, where groundwater is naturally high in fluoride.) The city of Austin memo says the "level of fluoride naturally occurring in the raw water supply for the City of Austin is 0.20 to 0.24 mg/l or parts per million. The Austin Water Utility adjusts the fluoride level to a range of 0.6 – 0.9 mg/l, averaging at about 0.75 mg/l. These values are well within the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines for optimally fluoridated water as well as being within the recommended range from (the World Health Organization)." And what of the chemical compound cited in Ford’s letter? The memo says the fluoride product used is hydrofluorosilicic acid, which fulfills a standard ensuring "purity of products for the control of potential adverse human-health effects from products added directly to the water during treatment, storage and distribution." There’s no mention of fertilizer in the 17-page memo. Next, spokeswoman Jill Mayfield of the water utility sent us a statement stating that the acid, also known as FSA, is supplied by Mosaic Chemicals, which she said has bought Lucier Chemical. Mosaic generally describes itself as the world’s leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash, two primary fertilizers. Mayfield said hydrofluorosilic acid is "derived from apatite which is a type of limestone deposit used in the production of fertilizers. The apatite is ground up and treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid (the main ingredient in the production of phosphate fertilizer) plus a solid and two gases. The two gases, hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride, are captured in water to form hydrofluorosilicic acid." An entry on Mosaic’s site aligns with Mayfield’s explanation. It says the vapor stream from the phosphoric acid reaction is scrubbed with water to form FSA from the naturally occurring silica and fluorine in the phosphoric acid." We ran Ford’s description of the acid as "toxic waste" past the company. Spokesman Rob Litt replied by e-mail: "Many fluoridation opponents will cite the toxicity of the chemical in its concentrated form. This is a fallacy as no one is ingesting this concentrated form. By this rationale, these same individuals should also be opposed to Vitamin D, B6, A & E, which are all considered toxic in concentrated form." For more perspective, we contacted the CDC where Linda Orgain, a spokeswoman in its Division of Oral Health, said by e-mail that fluorosilicic acid "is not toxic waste." She pointed us to a CDC web page on water fluoridation with a section stating: "All additives used at water treatment plants, including fluoride additives, must meet strict quality standards that assure the public’s safety. These additives are subject to a stringent system of standards, testing, and certificates by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI). Both of these entities are nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations." Orgain added: "There are no health implications for community water fluoridation – at the level used for community water fluoridation (currently 0.7-1.2 mg/L) fluoridation prevents and controls tooth decay – preventing about 25 percent of decay in children and adults, throughout the lifespan." We filled Ford in on our research. He replied that the acid purchased by water providers cannot otherwise be dumped in the ocean, inland waterways or landfills unless it’s contained: "It’s toxic until they sell it to the city and then magically the city puts it in our water." Next, the CDC’s national water fluoridation engineer, Kip Duchon, said it’s ridiculous to call the water additive toxic waste. Duchon said the compound put in water comes from gypsum, a byproduct of phosphate-based fertilizer plants that often ends up piled in landfills. The compound results from a gas that’s isolated via vacuum extraction, he said, then quenched with water, making the acid. Per Ford’s point about pouring the acid into bodies of water, Duchon replied: "It’s no different than any other acid (undiluted) that would kill everything in the lake. It would be irresponsible of anyone to capriciously or arbitrarily dump . any chemical in a water body." Duchon said the acid becomes toxic at concentrations of more than 100 milligrams per liter, over 100 times the concentration in Austin’s water. He said he was aware of one episode involving such a toxic error involving a small community’s water well; an Alaska man died. Ford urged us to seek more on the compound’s toxicity from Neal Carman, also a participant in Fluoride Free Austin. Carman said a loophole in federal environmental law makes it possible to sell the compound so long as it’s going to be diluted. Then, he said, it’s no longer considered a hazardous waste. We were unable to confirm or disprove this claim; Mosaic’s description of the acid it ships to Austin says it’s corrosive but stable when stored properly. At the EPA, spokesman Richard Yost said by email that in "water at levels used for fluoridation, hexafluorosilicic acid hydrolyzes essentially completely to fluoride ions and various forms of silica... Various forms of silica and silicates occur in nature as sand and do not represent any health hazard." Yost said the fluoride compound put into Austin’s water is not on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act list of "hazardous constituents" nor is it on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s hazardous materials transport list. Finally, we asked city officials to speak to Ford’s "toxic waste" reference. Philip Huang, medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, said it’s misleading and inflammatory to call the acid, which he calls a byproduct, toxic waste. Staff toxicologist Janet Pichette said the key issue for any substance is concentration. Even too much water "could kill you," she said. Last gulp: Ford’s statement accurately notes that the water utility buys the acid that fluoridates Austin’s drinking water from a fertilizer maker. Yet there’s no reasonable support for calling the the same acid toxic waste; it’s not poisonous at its concentration in the water. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10219	"The average American family" saw income rise $7,500 under Bill Clinton and decline $2,000 under George Bush.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/08/barack-obama/trend-is-right-but-numbers-are-wrong/	Update: The Obama campaign provided new information after we first published this item. We've included the additional material, but it doesn't change our ruling. In making his case for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama cited statistics to argue that Americans have lost economic ground during the Bush administration. "We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma," Obama said in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008. "We measure progress in the 23-million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush." We looked up the income numbers to see what happened to incomes during the Clinton years. We found Obama is correct that incomes went up under Clinton but dropped under Bush. But the numbers he uses aren't right. We looked to the U.S. Census report Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007. Numbers in the report are adjusted for inflation and reflect 2007 dollar values. The report indicates that median household income during the Bush administration dropped from $50,557 in 2000 to $50,233 in 2007, a decline of $324. Under Bill Clinton, median household income rose from $44,359 in 1992 to $50,557 in 2000, an increase of $6,198. The Obama campaign uses different numbers to calculate income. They look at households in which the age of the householder is under age 65. The campaign believes this more accurately reflects earnings power for workers, because seniors have Social Security income that automatically rises with inflation. During the course of our research, we found a commentary written by one of Obama's economic advisers that cited the numbers Obama used, with the caveat that it applied to "working-age households." That would leave out seniors, and could conceivably change the numbers we found in the census. (The article didn't include a citation.) Obama didn't use the "working-age" caveat in his speech. Using those numbers, inflation-adjusted income goes from $51,039 in 1992 to $58,555 in 2000 to $56,545 in 2007. That comes to a drop of $2,010 during the Bush administration and an increase of $7,516 during the Clinton administration. (Note if you want to do your own calculations at home: Pull them from Census reports from the respective years, then use the more technical CPI-U-RS inflation calculator found here .) Having said all that, Obama didn't mention working-age families as part of his speech. Obama is right with the overall point he's making. Incomes did rise under Clinton and decline under Bush. But the numbers he uses don't include seniors, who today represent about 12 percent of the population. So we rate his statement only Half True.

pomt-04165	"I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/20/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-she-cut-45b-spending-while-ch/	Cutting government spending – it’s a refrain many New Jerseyans say they want to hear from their elected officials. Cue Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who announced Dec. 11 that she would run for governor next year and is very familiar with wielding a budget ax. "I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care," Buono said in her gubernatorial announcement ad on YouTube. Spending did decrease while Buono chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, but it was not a singular effort.. Let’s look at how budgets work and then explain the $4.5 billion cut. New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Senate Budget and Appropriations and the Assembly Budget committees review it, and public hearings are held. The committees present the budget in what’s called an annual appropriations bill, which must be approved by the Legislature and the governor. The governor must sign the budget by July 1. Now, the cuts. David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed in an e-mail to Buono that appropriations from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010 dropped by $4.481 billion. The cuts were made after revenues plummeted by more than $3.5 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, and fell another $1 billion from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010, according to Richard Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean. "Thus, by necessity, appropriations needed to be reduced by the Governor and the Legislature to achieve a balanced budget as required by the constitution," Keevey said in an e-mail. So the cuts were made by a combination of people, including former Gov. Jon Corzine. Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that the senator wasn’t claiming sole responsibility for the cuts. "In the budget process both bodies of government vote on the final budgets, but the Senator's role as budget chair allowed her to oversee the budget process for those two years and begin to restore some sense of fiscal sanity to the process." Buono’s chairmanship was an important part of the process, noted Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "The inference is that she has the responsibility because she helped design the cuts," he said. "The fact of the matter is she was an important part of the process but the template was put on the table by the governor. I would basically say there is a core of truth to what she’s saying." Buono also claimed she protected education and health care while cutting the budget. But it was actually $2 billion in federal stimulus money Corzine included in his fiscal year 2010 budget that protected both. Keevey noted that $1.1 billion of the stimulus went to school aid appropriations. Without it, school aid would have dropped $900 million. Our ruling Buono claimed, "I have the experience as Senate Budget Chair of cutting $4.5 billion in spending -- to close the deficit while protecting education and health care." The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services confirms a $4.481 billion decrease in spending from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010. The recession had much to do with the cuts, with revenues plummeting from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 and spending adjusted accordingly. Also, the federal government, not Buono, protected education and health care with $2 billion in stimulus money. While it’s true that Buono’s chairmanship gave her experience in budget cutting, she alone isn’t responsible for cutting $4.5 billion. It was a team effort. And the last word on cuts, funding and balanced budgets belongs to the governor. For those reasons, we rate her statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02700	"More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/03/tom-graves/graves-compares-obamacare-affordability-belief-fak/	The skepticism of some Americans knows no bounds. It extends, apparently, a quarter-million miles from Earth. A Georgia congressman and his staff recently saw a poll on the percentage of Americans who believe the historic 1969 moon landing was a fraud and compared it with another recent survey on the federal health care law known as Obamacare. "More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable," U.S. Rep. Tom Graves’ Twitter account said in a Dec. 19 posting. It reminded some of us on the PolitiFact Georgia team of some lyrics from the Chumbawamba tune "Everything You Know Is Wrong." I was there when they landed on the moon. In a studio in Kentucky in June. Maybe that band is on to something. Graves, a tea party favorite who represents the conservative-leaning northwest corner of the state, has been a vocal foe of the health care law. The Twitter posting was included in a photo of astronauts (allegedly?) trekking across the moon. Graves encouraged his Twitter followers to retweet his message, stating "the fact that #Obamacare hurts families is no conspiracy theory!" The conservative National Review published an article with the headline "More People Believe Moon Landing Was a Hoax Than That Obamacare Will Lower Healthcare Costs." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the House member was engaging in a conspiracy theory of his own by suggesting that a larger percentage of Americans believe the moon landing was staged than those who think Obamacare is affordable. Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker quickly sent us two polls to support the congressman’s point. The first poll is by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C.-based operation. It was conducted in March, asking nearly 1,250 Americans their opinions about various conspiracy theories through automated telephone interviews. The margin of error was 2.8 percent. The results were released the day after April Fools Day. The pollsters asked questions such as whether global warming is a hoax, whether Osama bin Laden is still alive, did the federal government allow the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to occur and whether Paul McCartney was killed in a car wreck in 1966 and secretly replaced to keep the Beatles together? On to the question that piqued our interest. "Do you believe the moon landing was faked, or not?" Seven percent of respondents answered they believed it was faked; 84 percent did not believe it was faked, while 9 percent were not sure. The respondents were registered voters, and some of their answers to various questions went along party lines. For example, three-fifths of Republicans believe global warming is a hoax while three-quarters of Democrats do not believe it is a hoax. On the moon landing question, independents and Democrats were more slightly inclined than Republicans to believe it was a hoax. Just 5 percent of the respondents, and this was uniform across party lines, believe the Paul McCartney conspiracy theory. Now that we’ve determined it was Sir Paul who sang on "The Long and Winding Road," what about the health care poll? The Washington Post and ABC News joined forces in December to find out what Americans believe would be the impact of the health care law on their wallets. They specifically asked: "Do you think your health care costs (are increasing) as a result of these changes to the health care system, (are decreasing), or are remaining about the same?" Five percent said they expected their costs to decrease. Forty-seven percent said the costs would increase. Forty-four percent believe their costs will remain about the same. The remaining 4 percent had no opinion. About 1,000 people answered the question in a telephone poll, which was done between Dec. 12 and 15. The margin of error was 3.5 percent. So where does that leave us? Graves said this: "More Americans believe the moon landing was fake than believe Obamacare is affordable." One problem for Graves is the ABC News/Washington Post poll doesn’t actually use the word "affordable." There is a difference between saying you believe something will increase or decrease as opposed to whether a buyer considers something affordable. If you look solely at the percentage of respondents who say their health care costs will decrease and those in the PPP poll who say they believe the moon landing was faked, the congressman’s claim doesn’t seem out of this world. The numbers are close, though, and within the margin of error. The poll also clearly shows a lot of people think Obamacare will make health insurance more expensive, and a relatively few think that costs will come down. Graves has a point here. But it needs a lot of context to be properly understood. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2014-01-03T06:00:00	2013-12-19	['United_States']
pomt-01710	"We have less crime in the (Rio Grande) Valley than we do in other major Texas cities."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/08/juan-chuy-hinojosa/does-rio-grande-valley-have-less-crime-major-texas/	A South Texas state senator objected to Gov. Rick Perry’s plans to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting crime in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley isn’t as bad as in other parts of the state. In a July 21, 2014, press release, Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the "humanitarian crisis" reflected in Central Americans crossing the Rio Grande "needs to be resolved through immigration reform and working with Mexico and Central American countries to stop the flow of immigrants coming across our border. To call up the National Guard is a very simplistic approach to a complex problem." Besides, Hinojosa said, "we have less crime in the Valley than we do in other major Texas cities. If we were to use crime as a basis to deploy the National Guard then we should be sending the National Guard to other metropolitan areas in our state." Has there been less crime in the region closest to the state’s southern tip than its big cities hundreds of miles away? We’ve explored crime near the border before. In March 2010, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry’s claim that his border-security efforts led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime. His cited calculations didn’t consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years of data. Later, we saw flaws in descriptions of El Paso as the nation’s safest city, partly because the FBI has counseled against using its crime research to reach comparative judgments. In this instance, we were curious about Hinojosa’s twist on the crime comparison. Asked how Hinojosa reached his conclusion, Luis Moreno, his Senate chief of staff, forwarded a July 24, 2014, email from the Texas Department of Public Safety including a chart tallying arrests in 2013 and "to date" in 2014 in counties including Hidalgo in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2013 and in 2014, the chart shows, Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties each had more arrests than Hidalgo County. Nueces County, home to Corpus Christi, had the fewest arrests among the checked counties. Moreno said he did not ask DPS to convert the arrest counts to arrest rates. FBI crime figures As we launched our run at comparisons, we recognized with the help of Texas criminologists that the latest available data, as compiled by the FBI, enable comparisons only through the first half of 2013. That omits the 12 months through June 2014 — the period during which officials including Perry raised stepped-up concerns about border security in the wake of more unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande. That caveat in mind, we looked at different reported crimes by county and city, finding the senator’s statement held up for many -- but not all -- comparisons. We drew our figures from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks seven "index" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. A hedge: State officials have said these counts underreport the amount of drug-cartel-related violence by not folding in common cartel-tied offenses such as extortion and kidnapping, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in an October 2011 news story on crime in the border region. Strap in; our comparisons follow. Total reported offenses, January through June 2013 An FBI chart presents counts of reported offenses in the first half of 2013 for more than 20 Texas cities, rolling in several of the biggest cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin but not Fort Worth) and smaller cities including Brownsville and McAllen, key cities in the Rio Grande Valley, which consists of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willacy counties. In the first half of 2013, each of the big cities had more total reported incidents of violent and property crime than the two valley cities. But that’s arguably not surprising given that Houston, Dallas and the other non-valley cities are much more populous than their valley counterparts. Adjusting for population differences To account for population differences, we focused on estimated rates of violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents. By this balancing metric, each of the sampled big cities had a higher rate of violent crime than Brownsville or McAllen in the first half of 2013. McAllen also had the lowest rate of property crime in this sampling. But the reported property-crime rate for Brownsville (2,156 per 100,000 residents) narrowly outpaced the rate for Dallas (2,137 per 100,000 residents). Crime rates, 2012 Seeking a full year’s comparison, we turned to population-adjusted rates for specific reported crimes in 2012 as broken out in an undated annual report by the DPS. Generally, the report showed, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin had more crimes per 100,000 residents than the valley cities of Brownsville and McAllen or the valley counties of Cameron, Hidalgo and Starr. But there were indications of places in the valley experiencing more crime. Rural Willacy County, population 8,355, bested all our sampled cities and counties with 108 rapes per 100,000 residents, based on its 2012 total of nine reported rapes. Based on 37 total reported assaults, the county also trailed only Houston in our sampling in its rate of aggravated assaults, and it landed third for its rate of reported burglaries. Also, Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen had higher rates of reported larceny than Houston or Dallas, according to the report. Another twist: Harlingen’s general rate of 5,279 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 3,543 total reported offenses) exceeded Dallas’ rate of 5,049 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 62,680 reported offenses).

In this snapshot, Harris County had the No. 1 violent crime rate, but the valley’s Starr County landed second and Hidalgo County was third. Willacy County didn’t show up in this data set. Harris County also ranked first in its rate of reported property crimes in our sampling. However, the valley counties--Hidalgo, Starr and Cameron--ranked second, third and fourth ahead of Bexar, Travis and Tarrant counties.

We don’t know how crime compares in this way for the months since June 2013. But for 2012 and the first half of 2013, reported crime rates, adjusted for population differences, mostly showed the big cities outside the valley experiencing more crime.

pomt-08196	"Demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/24/ohio-department-transportation/odot-cites-heightened-amtrak-ridership-light-poten/	Republican Gov.-elect John Kasich has made it clear he will cancel Ohio’s $400 million passenger train project when he takes office in January. Gov. Ted Strickland, who lost to Kasich earlier this month and strongly supported the project, denied Kasich’s recent request to halt spending on environmental and engineering studies related to it that already has topped $1 million. Advocates for the project, which would use federal stimulus money to establish a Cleveland to Columbus to Cincinnati train line, remain hopeful Kasich will change his mind. While Kasich views the 3C rail corridor as a waste of money, supporters say it will create jobs and meet a growing demand for passenger train service. The Ohio Department of Transportation issued a news release on Oct. 25 touting the increasing desire among Ohioans to travel by train. The department said "demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year." ODOT, under the leadership of Strickland appointee Jolene Molitoris, is overseeing the $400 million rail project. Department spokesman Scott Varner said the increasing demand for passenger rail "adds to the viability of the 3C. It shows there is a ridership demand." Even though Kasich seems determined to kill the train project, we decided to look into Ohioans’ supposedly increasing appetite for train travel. If accurate, it would be a worthy factoid for rail advocates to put before Kasich. Amtrak is the only passenger rail operator in the state, according to the Ohio Rail Development Commission, so passengers on its trains would fully account for ridership in Ohio. To measure ridership, Amtrak counted the number of passengers who boarded a train or got off a train at one of Ohio’s seven Amtrak train stations. The counting method exposes Amtrak to some level of duplication. If a passenger is traveling within the state – from Cleveland to Sandusky, for example -- he would be counted twice: once when he boards the train in Cleveland and again when he gets off in Sandusky. Spokesman Marc Magliari said Amtrak would not release statistics of intercity travel in Ohio because the information is considered proprietary. But he said such travel is rare. "Most people aren’t going from Elyria to Bryan," Magliari said. According to Amtrak, there were 128,174 passengers whose train ride began or ended at an Ohio train station in the 2009 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. There were 146,861 such passengers in the 2010 fiscal year. That’s a 14.6 percent increase. The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation regularly audits Amtrak’s operations. Three such audits have been initiated so far this year. However, the Inspector General’s office could not say whether or not Amtrak’s ridership figures are accurate. "We do not have any information that would lend to us having a response," David Wonnenberg, of the Inspector General’s office, said in an e-mail. "We have not issued an audit report in which these or similar questions came up." Amtrak confirmed the figures on which ODOT relied to boast about Ohio’s spike in passenger rail ridership. The railroad’s method of counting passengers does leave some room for inflation. But since the same counting method was used in 2009 and 2010, such increases would occur in both years so the impact on the data would be consistent. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07012	Forty percent of union members voted Republican in 2008.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-40-percent-republicans-voted-joh/	On the July 3, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, panelists discussed the connections between labor unions and the Democratic Party. During the exchange, Bill Kristol, the editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, said that despite longstanding ties between unions and Democrats, support for Republicans among voters who are union members is higher than one might think. The discussion began with a clip of Vice President Joe Biden appearing before a union audience in Las Vegas, joking about the bond between unions and Democrats. A moment later, Kristol said, "Joe Biden spoke more truth than he realized when he made this joke that, well, you guys, it's out of the question that you union members could vote Republican. A lot of union members vote Republican. I think a third -- what is it, 40 percent, even of union members voted Republican even in 2008? "And, in fact," he continued, " ... it's a real question how much the union leadership speaks for the members. And I do think it's very important for the Republican candidate in 2012 to be able to win over what we used to call Reagan Democrats, many of whom are (or) who have been union members." To check Kristol, we decided to look at exit poll data -- the surveys taken every two years of voters leaving polling places. These surveys, which are designed to capture a snapshot of the electorate on Election Day, classify voters by a range of demographic questions, some of which involve union membership. We looked at the exit poll numbers for 2008 and found that 39 percent of voters from union households voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared to 59 percent for Democrat Barack Obama. So Kristol’s memory was essentially correct. Still, we’ll provide a couple minor caveats. First, there are slight differences between how voters from union households voted (that is, the numbers we cited above) and how union members themselves voted (which is specifically how Kristol phrased his comment). Union members voted 60 percent for Obama and 37 percent for McCain -- two points less for McCain than voters who lived in union households. (Voters from union households accounted for 21 percent of the electorate in 2008, while union members accounted for 12 percent.) Second, judging by the context, we think Kristol meant voting patterns in the 2008 presidential race, but it’s worth noting that the same exit polls painted a different picture of union voter behavior in House elections. In 2008, voters from union households split their vote for House candidates this way: 34 percent for Republican candidates and 64 percent for Democratic candidates. The numbers were similar for actual union members -- 34 percent backed Republican candidates and 65 percent backed Democratic candidates. We also wondered about the long-term trendline, since Kristol’s implication was that Republicans did pretty well in 2008 in securing union votes. So we looked at past levels of union support for GOP candidates. For presidential elections, we compared the GOP candidate’s vote share from union members to the GOP candidate’s vote share from all voters. (In every case, the Republican did better among all voters than among union voters.) We found that McCain did better than almost all of his Republican predecessors in winning votes from union households. McCain won 46 percent of the vote nationally, so his union backing was only 7 points behind his overall support. Since 1952, only one other Republican candidate did as well among union voters -- Ronald Reagan in 1980, who also had a gap of just 7 points between overall support and union support. But Reagan wasn’t able to repeat his magic in 1984 -- his union vote trailed his national vote by 13 points. And that pattern continued until McCain in 2008, with the gap bouncing between 11 and 13 points from 1984 to 2004. So there’s some support for the notion that Republicans are doing pretty well among union voters these days. Kristol’s recollection on Fox News Sunday was very close to reality. We’re only lowering him a notch due to a lack of clarity about whether he meant union members as opposed to union households, and about which 2008 election he meant -- presidential or House. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Bill Kristol	None	None	None	2011-07-07T10:16:16	2011-07-03	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06570	Because of Jim Whelan, "the 1990s are the only decade since the 1920s when the population of Atlantic City actually went up."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/30/jim-whelan/former-atlantic-city-mayor-jim-whelan-says-his-rec/	Following the years when political boss Nucky Johnson ruled the Prohibition-era boardwalk, Atlantic City saw its population drop decade after decade through the greater part of the 20th Century. That is, until Jim Whelan came along. Seeking re-election to his State Senate seat, Whelan, a Democrat, has pointed to Atlantic City’s population growth during the 1990s as one of his achievements as city mayor. Whelan served as mayor from 1990 to 2001. In a Sept. 15 debate against his Republican opponent, Assemblyman Vince Polistina, Whelan said the following about his record: "John Adams told us years ago facts are stubborn things. Here are some facts. The 1990s are the only decade since the 1920s when the population of Atlantic City actually went up." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Whelan’s statistics on population growth are accurate, but he may be taking too much credit. The increase in Atlantic City’s population was part of a larger trend involving other American cities, and coincided with the growth of the city’s casino industry. First, let’s explain the population figures. Starting in 1860, the population of Atlantic City rose for seven consecutive decades, from 687 residents in 1860 to 66,198 in 1930, according to U.S. census data. But then, the numbers started to fall. Between 1930 and 1990, the city’s population declined every decade for a total loss of nearly 43 percent, according to census data. In Whelan’s first year as mayor, the city’s population was 37,986. Ten years later, Atlantic City’s population had increased by about 6.7 percent to 40,517 residents. However, by 2010, the city’s population had fallen slightly to 39,558. So, Whelan is correct that his tenure included the only decade of population growth since the 1920s -- but how much did he have to do with that? Whelan acknowledged he is not solely responsible for the population growth, but said his administration put an emphasis on basic services and providing "safe, clean streets." Whelan noted that his administration hired more police and demolished blighted buildings. Gwendolyn Harris, executive director of the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers University, said a mayor and city government can receive credit for population growth. City officials are involved in making quality-of-life improvements and facilitating development, she said. But a significant factor in the city’s population growth was the growth of the casino industry, which was put in motion more than a decade before Whelan became mayor. In his first year in office, Atlantic City was home to 12 casinos. Keith Mills, director of Atlantic City’s Department of Planning and Development, who has worked in the department since 1988, attributed the population growth, in large part, to the demand for casino workers. In fact, the number of casino employees increased during Whelan’s tenure and peaked in 1997 at 49,123 workers. Another contributing factor was the development of new housing stock through the reinvestment of casino dollars, as required by state law -- a process that involved both city officials and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, Mills said. As for Whelan’s role, Mills said a mayor still needs the cooperation of the city council, just as President Barack Obama needs Congress to support his initiatives. "It takes a lot to move anything along. … It’s no different here in Atlantic City," Mills said. Population studies experts also pointed out that Atlantic City’s growth in the 1990s was part of a national trend of urban population increases in certain cities, a movement partly driven by the influx of immigrants. "This is not a unique experience," said Janice Madden, a professor in the Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Census data show that Atlantic City’s immigrant population sharply increased during Whelan’s mayoralty. By 2000, the number of foreign-born residents had increased by 166 percent since 1990, and represented nearly a quarter of the city’s population. But, Madden said, city governments still need to have policies that attract new people and keep existing residents in town. Our ruling Whelan’s statistics about Atlantic City’s population changes are on target, but the population growth came from a variety of factors. As the city’s political leader, Whelan obviously played a role in new development and other improvements, but he also inherited a booming casino industry and served at a time when more immigrants were moving to urban areas across the country.

pomt-14638	Under Ted Cruz’s tax plan, "businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/26/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-flat-tax-charges-16-perc/	Ted Cruz’s tax plan, envisioning tax returns that fit on postcards, would whack businesses twice over, Marco Rubio says. We wondered about that. In the Jan. 14, 2016, Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Rubio of Florida said that under the plan advocated by Sen. Cruz of Texas, businesses basically "will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees." A moment later, Rubio said Cruz’s plan "does not eliminate the corporate (income) tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees." Cruz disputed that characterization, saying in part that "a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away." Cruz’s plan replaces the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and others with a flat tax. Does it also make businesses pay 16 percent on profits and payroll, as Rubio said? Cruz’s plan outlined After emailing Rubio’s campaign about how he reached his 16 percent conclusions, we turned to Cruz’s tax plan as outlined by his campaign. "Under the Simple Flat Tax," Cruz says on a campaign webpage, "the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent. For a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. The Child Tax Credit will remain in place," Cruz proposes, and the plan revamps the earned-income tax credit while preserving deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments. Here’s the flat-tax postcard as envisioned by Cruz: SOURCE: Web page, "The Simple Tax Plan," Ted Cruz presidential campaign (viewed Jan. 20, 2016) Next up: the 16 percent element. On Cruz’s website, we spotted no direct indication the 16 percent would apply to payroll spending. "For businesses," Cruz says there, "the corporate income tax will be eliminated. It will be replaced by a simple Business Flat Tax at a single 16 percent rate. The current payroll tax system will be abolished, while maintaining full funding for Social Security and Medicare." Cruz further says the business flat tax "will be based on revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments." In general, Cruz says, his proposed tax overhaul will deliver a tremendous economic boost, according to the "well-respected Tax Foundation," a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that describes itself as a leading independent tax policy research organization. Independent breakdowns We fetched the foundation’s October 2015 analysis of Cruz’s plan which, the foundation said, would "replace the corporate income tax and all payroll taxes with a 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax,’ or subtraction method value-added tax. In addition, his plan would repeal a number of complex features of the current tax code." Farther along, the analysis spelled out a payroll aspect. Specifically, the foundation said, Cruz’s plan: "Enacts a broad-based, 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax’ or value-added tax. This tax is levied on all business profits, less capital investment. This would include the payroll of business, government, and nonprofit institutions, as well as net imports. The tax would exempt from taxation the purchase of health insurance. A business transfer tax is also often known as a subtraction-method value-added tax. While its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries, it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions. The foundation also said: "Under current law, some taxes on labor are explicitly levied on nominal wages, reducing take-home pay, while others are implicitly passed on to workers through lower nominal wages. The business transfer tax would also fall substantially on payrolls, but it would do so entirely through implicit reductions in nominal wages rather than explicit reductions in take-home pay." That’s a bit gobbledy-gooky for us. A foundation official, Kyle Pomerleau, told us by phone and email that what Rubio said largely holds up, though it would be wrong to conclude businesses under Cruz’s plan would pay 16 percent on the same money twice. That is, Pomerleau elaborated, Cruz’s plan eliminates the existing payroll tax, which is 15.3 percent of wages (half of that paid by employers, the other half by employees), but the plan counts payroll expenditures as part of net business profits, which are taxed at 16 percent. "Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax," Pomerleau emailed, "his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level." Another authority, Joe Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us by phone that Rubio was accurate about Cruz’s plan presuming he meant what most people define as "profit" by his phrase "what you make." Rosenberg walked us through how he sees Cruz’s plan working: Say a business buys something for 50 cents at wholesale and has to pay its employees 50 cents, accumulating $1 in costs. Then the business sells the something for $1.10, drawing a 10-cent profit. Under the Cruz plan, Rosenberg said, the business pays the flat tax solely on the 60-cent difference between the $1.10 in sales and the 50 cents spent on the wholesale purchase. And, Rosenberg noted, there’s another way to pin what Cruz’s plan subjects to the 16 percent tax -- by isolating what the business "makes," the 10 cents, and then adding the 50 cents in employee payroll. "It’s very fair to interpret what Sen. Rubio said as correct," Rosenberg said, though it’s also worth mention (again) that Cruz’s plan eliminates existing payroll and income taxes. Broadly, Rosenberg didn’t agree that Cruz’s plan whipsaws businesses, saying: "It’s a change in the way they’re taxed. It’s not taxing something twice." We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s camp about his claim nor did Cruz aides engage. Footnote: A Jan. 14, 2016, foundation post by economist Alan Cole says Cruz and Rubio aren’t proposing entirely distinct tax approaches. "In fact," Cole wrote, "if you put together two taxes from Rubio’s plan (and fiddle with the rates), you can actually synthetically construct the business flat tax from Cruz’s plan!" Our ruling Rubio said that under Cruz’s tax plan, "businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees." Under Cruz’s plan, that rate applies both to net income and payroll expenditures though the way this description was phrased by Rubio merits clarification.

pomt-06749	Says enrolling a student in a subsidized lunch program triggers an "at risk" designation, resulting in an extra $6,000 to $7,000 of state school aid per student.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/25/michael-doherty/state-sen-mike-doherty-says-school-districts-recei/	Taxpayers are picking up the tab for more than just lunch in Elizabeth schools, according to state Sen. Michael Doherty. A story in The Sunday Star-Ledger revealed three officials from the Union County school district allegedly enrolled their children in a subsidized lunch program, even though they earn too much to qualify for it. Doherty (R-Warren), one of several New Jersey officials who called for an investigation into the matter, wrote a letter to acting state Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf saying he’s worried the program opens another avenue for abuse. "This year, when you appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, I informed you about the potential for abuse of the free and reduced price lunch program, and how enrolling a student in the program triggers an "At Risk" designation, which results in an additional $6,000-7,000 of state school aid for a student," Doherty wrote to Cerf in an Aug. 22 letter. "This additional school aid, which can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars, is collected from taxpayers throughout the state." PolitiFact New Jersey found Doherty is mostly right: when a student is enrolled in the federally supported lunch program, they are designated as at risk. But his claim that each at-risk student brings in up to $7,000 in additional state aid needs clarification. We’ll first explain how an at-risk designation translates into increased per-pupil spending. The "School Funding Reform Act of 2008" set up the formula that calculates how state education spending is determined for New Jersey school districts. The formula sets a minimum amount that the state believes must be spent on a student to provide a "thorough and efficient education." The base amount can increase depending on a variety of factors, including whether a student is considered at risk. At-risk students include those who qualify for a free or reduce-price lunch, according to state law. An at-risk student is weighted differently in the formula, increasing the amount of funds the state believes should be spent to educate that child. So, we’ve determined Doherty is correct about the at-risk designation. But what about his claim that for each at-risk student, a school district receives up to $7,000 more in state aid? The state auditor released a report in June, which said: "The Department of Education's state formula aid per the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 is increased to a school district by between $4,700 and $5,700 for each student eligible for the school lunch program." Stephen Eells, the state auditor, said his department calculated the aid figures based on the minimum per-pupil spending amount set by the state -- and then rounded the figures. So, a student in a school district where less than 20 percent of the population is considered at-risk receives about $4,700 more in aid. For districts, like Elizabeth, where more than 60 percent of the student population is considered at risk a student brings in nearly $5,700 in more aid, per Eells calculation. Other districts fall somewhere within that range, Eells said. Justin Barra, a spokesman for the state education department, said the education department doesn’t calculate specific costs for at-risk pupils because it is just one of many factors. But, he said in an email that the state "estimates that no district receives more than $6,000 per at-risk student, with a significant number much lower than that, and some receiving no funding at all." Doherty told us his figures were in reference to districts like Elizabeth, but he doesn’t make that clear in his letter. Still, his numbers aren’t far off from the state auditor’s figures for a district with a student population that includes more than 60 percent of at-risk students. Here's the difference. Doherty included money for security aid, which is increased from a base amount of $70 per student to up to more than $400 per at-risk student, according to the state funding formula. Doherty also included at-risk students who are bilingual, a designation that further increases per-pupil spending by his calculations to nearly $7,000. The ruling Doherty said school districts receive an additional $6,000 to $7,000 in state aid for every student enrolled in a free or reduced-price lunch program. Doherty was right that more education funding is allocated for students who receive a subsidized lunch. Though the amount of that funding varies by district, we think Doherty’s statement is on point. We rate his claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Michael Doherty	None	None	None	2011-08-25T05:00:00	2011-08-22	['None']

pomt-10349	Barack Obama wants to "unilaterally disarm our nation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/chain-email/obama-wants-to-reduce-stockpiles-not-disarm/	Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to "unilaterally disarm our nation" — and they say they have the video to prove it. "You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or false ... watch and listen to Obama's own words," warns one e-mail. "Look at this ASAP — it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon," another e-mail states. "This is shocking and reprehensible," opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants "a world without nuclear weapons," but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: "Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. "Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. "Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] "You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much." We suspect that the phrase "a world without nuclear weapons" may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: "A World Free of Nuclear Weapons." "The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete," their essay said. "Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective." The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for the Wall Street Journal a year later, titled "Toward a Nuclear-Free World," in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, the Weekly Standard published a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. "He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament," Pike said. "If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with." The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. "Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States," Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, "Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'." On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting "some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context." Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-07-15T00:00:00	2008-05-21	['None']
pomt-01286	The gender gap in his support is "not unique to me" and "there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections" in recent years.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-gender-gap-his-support-similar-o/	In mid-October, Republican Gov. Scott Walker answered a journalist’s question about Democratic challenger Mary Burke’s superior poll numbers among women, minorities and young people. How did he account for that? "Some of those issues are just historic patterns, they’re not unique to me," Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 14, 2014. "If you look at Republican-Democrat (numbers) you could make -- in the last dozen or so elections -- similar parallels to that. So there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections." He added: "For a lot of this it’s a matter of getting our message out, getting our story out. We’re not conceding any votes in the state of Wisconsin." With several gender-based issues at the heart of each side’s TV advertising, and experts saying the Nov. 4, 2014 election is likely to come down to turnout efforts on each side, we wanted to check the historical record on the so-called gender gap and Republican candidates. Are Walker’s 2014 poll numbers among women and men pretty similar to the gender gap seen in past Wisconsin elections for GOP candidates? For this pre-election analysis, we turned to the exit polls taken of voters as they leave the voting booth after each election. We examined comparable races in recent Wisconsin history, as well as polling data in the 2012 and 2014 campaigns in Wisconsin. Defining the gap The gender gap -- Republicans doing better with men than women; Democrats doing better with women than men -- is a feature of contemporary politics. Within each party, men and women don’t vote that differently. But the Democratic Party has fewer men among its supporters; the Republican Party has fewer women. One way to measure the gender gap is to simply take the difference between how a candidate does with men and how that candidate does with women. In the 2012 recall race, Walker got 59 percent of the male vote and 47 percent of the female vote -- a gender gap of 12 points. (His opponent Tom Barrett got 40 percent of the male vote and 52 percent of the female vote, also a 12-point difference). That 12-point gender gap was the largest in a Wisconsin U.S. Senate or governor’s race for which we were able to obtain exit poll data in recent decades. But it is not dramatically at odds with how Republican candidates have performed in Wisconsin in other major races in the past few years. Historical picture The gender gap has been growing in Wisconsin. In her 1988 U.S. Senate race against Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Susan Engeleiter did three points worse with women than men. In his 1992 Senate race against Democrat Russ Feingold, GOP Sen. Bob Kasten did two points worse with women than men. But these gender gaps grew in the 1990s and 2000s -- ranging in the mid- to high-single digits. For example, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson did four points worse with women than men in 1994 and seven points worse in 1998. Republican Mark Neumann did four points worse with women in his 1998 race against Feingold. And Republican Mark Green did five points worse with women than men in his race against Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2006. The gender gap got bigger still in the 2010 election. Walker did nine points worse among women than men in winning the governor’s race, as did Republican Ron Johnson in winning his U.S. Senate race against Feingold. In the 2012 U.S. Senate race against Tammy Baldwin, Republican Tommy Thompson did 10 points worse with women than women. Looking back over that landscape, it’s clear that Walker’s 12-point gender gap in the 2012 recall race is the biggest of all these races, but it’s consistent with the trend of a growing gender gap. And it’s not a great deal bigger than other big statewide races in 2010 and 2012. Presidential races When you broaden the focus to consider presidential voting in Wisconsin, the biggest difference is that the gender gap appeared earlier in time and hasn’t really grown that much. Some examples: George Herbert Walker Bush did 10 points worse with women than men in his 1988 race; George W. Bush did 11 points worse with women in 2000 and six points worse in 2004; John McCain did six points worse with women in 2008 and Mitt Romney did nine points worse with women than men in 2012. We have been describing these Republican candidates as doing "worse with women" but you could just as easily describe them as doing "better with men," since the gender gap is a double-edged sword for the two parties. For Republicans it can result from weakness among women, but it can also result from strength among men. For Democrats, it’s just the other way around. In his two victories for governor, Walker lost women voters, but not overwhelmingly, getting 48 percent of women in 2010 and 47 percent in 2012. The gender gap in those races was more about Walker’s strength with male voters, winning men with 57 percent in 2010 and 59 percent in 2012. 2014 governor’s race What does the gender gap look like in the 2014 race between Walker and Burke? For the answer, we can turn to the regular polling done by the Marquette University Law School. We also looked at the gender gaps in these other races in Marquette’s polling: the June 2012 recall race between Walker and Barrett; the 2012 Senate race between Baldwin and Thompson; and the 2012 presidential race between Romney and Barack Obama. We calculated the average gender gap in all the polling for each race. And once again, the Walker races featured the biggest gender gaps, though they were only marginally bigger than the other two races. The 2012 recall race had the biggest gender gap of the four contests. We should note that if the question is not the gap between men and women, but Walker's performance with women specifically, his numbers are actually better than the most Republicans in recent years in Wisconsin. That is, he has lost among women, but not by as much as many other candidates in his party in this state. The most notable exception is Thompson, whose landslide victories for governor featured big winning margins among both men and women. Thompson’s victories in the 1990s, in fact, are the only case we could find in recent decades of a Republican winning women in Wisconsin in a statewide contest for governor, U.S. Senate or president. One last note about the gender gap this year. In Marquette’s polling of the Walker-Burke race, the gender gap has fluctuated a lot from poll to poll, raising some eyebrows among political observers. It’s not unusual for swings to occur among subgroups of voters, and it’s sometimes due to random variation from survey to survey. The gender gap shrank dramatically in Marquette’s first October poll, but returned in Marquette’s last pre-election poll taken Oct. 23 to 26. If you average all the Marquette polls this year, you find that the gender gap is alive and well. Walker has been winning 52 percent of male registered voters and 42 percent of female registered voters over the course of nine 2014 polls. Burke has been winning 48 percent of female registered voters and 40 percent of male registered voters. Our rating Walker said the gender gap in his support is "not unique to me" and "there’s not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections" in recent years. Walker is correct when he suggests the gender gap in his race is not dramatically different from that seen for other Republican candidates in other comparable races in Wisconsin in recent history. At the same time, according to exit polls, Walker’s 2012 recall win featured a bigger gender gap than any other recent race for governor or U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05717	"Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/07/gary-johnson/marijuana-use-claim-close-mark/	Most Georgians missed it, but there was a presidential debate here after all. Actually, it was a forum, and the candidates weren’t the Republicans vying for the White House. (CNN canceled a debate set for last Thursday in Atlanta when GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Ron Paul said they had other plans.) These candidates were Libertarians, five of them, and they answered questions from a moderator for about an hour at their party’s Georgia state convention Feb. 25 in Athens. The Truth-O-Meter started swaying when Gary Johnson, who won a straw poll afterward with 79 percent of the vote, was asked a question about legalizing marijuana. Johnson, who believes in legalizing marijuana, said an individual’s drug problem should be handled by his or her family -- not the criminal justice system. He then offered this statistic: "Fifty percent of the [high school] graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done some illegal drugs," said Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico. We wondered whether Johnson, who initially tried running as a Republican for president this year, was correct? For the record, Johnson doesn’t believe teenagers should have access to marijuana. Johnson does believe marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and thinks the money the federal government spends on marijuana enforcement could be better spent "against the individuals committing real crimes against society." The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on marijuana use. According to the CDC’s most recent data, from 2009, nearly 46 percent of 12th-graders had smoked marijuana at least once. Nearly 51 percent of 12th-grade boys had used marijuana, while the percentage of girls was lower, at just over 40 percent. In Georgia, the percentage of all 12th-graders who tried marijuana at least once was nearly identical to the national average. The CDC figures showed the following for other illicit drug use by 12th-graders in 2009: Nearly 8 percent had used cocaine. 2.5 percent had tried heroin. About 4 percent used methamphetamines. 8 percent had tried Ecstasy. Slightly more than 3 percent had used steroids. There was no overall figure for the percentage of 12th-graders who used any illegal drug. The federal National Institutes of Health has data on its website that says 42 percent of 12th-graders in 2009 had tried marijuana. The percentage had actually declined from nearly 48 percent in 2002. Officials there provided PolitiFact Georgia some data for all types of illicit drug use by 12th-graders. "In 2011, 50% of high school seniors reported having tried an illicit drug at some time, 40% used one or more drugs in the past 12 months, and 25% used one or more drugs in the prior 30 days," Shirley Simson, a media specialist for the NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, told us via email. Simson said there’s been an increase in the past four years, primarily due to more teenagers smoking marijuana. The National Center for Education Statistics has data on its website that says about 47 percent of the graduating class of 2009 had tried any type of illicit drug. The percentage has declined each year since 2000, when 54 percent of high school seniors had tried drugs. We couldn’t find data about the percentage of high school seniors graduating this year who’ve smoked marijuana or have done any kind of illicit drug. The studies we’ve found show drug use among 12th-graders hovers around the 50 percent mark, with a slight decline in recent years. We rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-08499	Sen. Barbara Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit (Hispanic immigrants) people to come here legally to work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/08/susan-b-anthony-list/spanish-language-ad-claims-sen-barbara-boxer-voted/	A new Spanish language ad from the Susan B. Anthony List, a Republican group that opposes abortion, and the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes gay marriage, attacks Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on its core issues, saying that Boxer "doesn’t share our values" because she "supports abortion and homosexual marriage." The ad, running on Spanish language TV in several large California markets, also attacks Boxer on immigration, saying she "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." It's a surprising attack, given that Boxer is a well-known advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. Boxer has long favored tougher border security, but she has also advocated a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States. Asked for backup for the ad's claim about Boxer, a spokesman for SBA List pointed us toward a May 23, 2007, story in the New York Times that notes Boxer's opposition to a "guest worker" provision proposed for the comprehensive immigration reform initiative that year. According to the story, "Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, denounced the guest worker program, saying it would create a pool of 'desperate low-wage workers' whom employers could easily exploit." The guest worker program proposed in the 2007 immigration bill was part of the negotiated "grand bargain" that sought to get bipartisan support for the bill. The program would have allowed temporary visas for several hundred thousand immigrants to fill unskilled jobs. The visas could be renewed twice, so long as the guest worker returned to his home country for at least a year between visits. And to return, the worker would need sponsorship from an employer. Many immigration advocates feared it would create an environment where employers could abuse guest workers, because they could control whether that guest worker could return. And Boxer voted to eliminate it. A May 29, 2007, editorial in the New York Times described the guest worker provision in the bill as "an absurd employment hokey-pokey — you put your two years in, then one year out, then repeat that twice and go home forever. It would be massive indentured servitude — colonial times all over again, but without any hope of citizenship for those taking our most difficult and despised jobs." The ad doesn't explain any of this background. It merely says Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." In fact, Boxer has long been a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform. In 2006, she voted for an immigration reform package that included a more immigrant-friendly temporary guest worker provision. In addition, while she voted against the version of the guest worker provision included in the 2007 immigration reform bill, she ultimately voted to continue debating the bill, although it subsequently died. Boxer's campaign also notes that she co-sponsored the AgJobs Act of 2009, to allow illegal immigrants who work in the fields to get temporary visas, and eventually a path to permanent residency. And in April 2010, Boxer and 15 other senators sent a letter to President Barack Obama expressing support for a bipartisan immigration reform bill this year. Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said, "The ad suggests she has been an anti-immigration vote in Congress and that's not accurate. She voted against that piece of it." Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration, said the ad "is clearly intended to convey that she’s against what advocates call 'comprehensive immigration reform' when, in fact, she’s all for the left-wing version of it ... What she voted against was the third leg of 'comprehensive immigration reform,' which is insisted on by the business and libertarian right, which is the increased importation of captive labor via guestworker programs." The immigration attack on Boxer doesn't come completely from left field. Trailing badly in polls among California's Latino voters, Republican Carly Fiorina -- who has backed Arizona's controversial immigration law -- has used similar criticisms of Boxer in an attempt to weaken the Democrat with Latino voters. According to an Oct. 6, 2010, story in the Los Angeles Times, "though Fiorina has revealed little about how she would approach immigration issues, she has sharply criticized Boxer for seeking to strip a proposed temporary worker program from federal immigration legislation in 2007 that ultimately collapsed in the Senate." We think the ad's claim about Boxer's record on immigration is highly misleading. It states simply that Boxer "voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work." Boxer did not vote against the immigration reform bill in 2007. She voted against a provision in it that she felt would lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers. Moreover, the ad ignores Boxer's history of support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a program to allow immigrants to come to the United States to work legally. We rate the ad's claim about Boxer's immigration record False.	None	Susan B. Anthony List	None	None	None	2010-10-08T10:04:38	2010-09-30	['Barbara_Boxer']
pomt-01048	"The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/22/barack-obama/obama-says-automakers-have-paid-back-all-loans-it-/	In the run up to his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama was once again trumpeting his administration’s intervention in Detroit. "Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end," Obama said Jan. 7 in Detroit. "The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in." In December, the Treasury Department announced it sold the remainder of its 54.9 million shares in Ally Financial — formerly, General Motor’s financing service, GMAC — for $1.3 billion. With the deal, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the United States was "winding down the Auto Industry Financing Program," the federal program that saved the auto industry— or bailed it out, depending on your view. Back in 2012, we looked at Obama’s campaign claim that GM and Chrysler "repaid their loans." We said it was Half True, partially because the government still owned stock in both automakers and it was too soon to say if taxpayers would recoup their investment. But it’s two years later, and the Treasury has since sold off most of its holdings in both companies. So we decided to take a look at this issue again. There are several circumstances that make this confusing and complicated. For starters, the bailout of the auto industry started in the waning weeks of President George W. Bush’s tenure. It continued during the early months of the Obama administration. All told, the Treasury Department reported that the program cost taxpayers $79.7 billion, of which $70.4 billion was recovered. Under that estimate, the program lost about $9.3 billion. In April, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program would end up costing about $14 billion. The Obama administration, however, makes the case that only $57.3 billion of the investment came under their watch and therefore that should be all that they’re accountable for. Let’s review the timeline, starting in 2008: Bush secured $700 billion to bailout the financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008. In November of that year, Obama was elected and soon after met with Bush to discuss the transition. It was during those early meetings that Obama began to lobby Bush to provide some financial assistance for the auto industry, according to reports. The New York Times wrote Bush had "balked at allowing the automakers to tap into the $700 billion bailout fund, despite warnings ... that General Motors might not survive the year." A month later, Bush announced a $17.4 billion bailout for Chrysler and GM that provided short-term financial relief through March 2009. He handed off to the incoming Obama administration the decision on how the companies would have to restructure themselves. The investment would grow to about $23 billion in short-term loans by the time Bush left office. As Politico noted in December 2008, Bush’s move was a "reversal for the White House," adding that, "President-elect Barack Obama and Democrats had long advocated that course, and Bush had resisted it." The New York Times reported that Obama "embraced the plan," though he did not comment on the details. To get to Obama’s claim that the "auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in," the White House is taking credit for all of the money recovered from the auto companies in the last six years. This is somewhat problematic. Why? Obama is essentially saying ignore the money Bush invested and only look at what my administration spent on the bailout when calculating the "expenses" side of the ledger. But for Obama to make the claim he has recovered everything he invested "and more," he’s including money paid back on loans also given out under Bush. You might ask, "Why not just look to see which loans were repaid?" It’s a good question. Unfortunately, it’s a lot more complicated than that. Both GM and Chrysler went through structured bankruptcies in 2009 to remain viable. The process resulted in both automakers essentially killing off their old companies and creating New GM and New Chrysler. During that process, most of their debt was converted into preferred and common stock owned largely by the government that would gradually be sold off (in the case of Chrysler, it was acquired by Italian carmaker Fiat, while the GM stock was publicly offered and later partially bought back by New GM). Some of the dealings resulted in profit, some did not. Additionally, Old GM and Old Chrysler were saddled with some debt that has not been recovered. Because most of the debt was in stock, it’s difficult to know if the money coming back into the Treasury was from the Bush loans or from the Obama administration. At the same time, it’s possible the Treasury would not have recovered any of the investment from either administration had Obama’s White House not taken the steps to restructure the companies through a managed bankruptcy. Obama created a taskforce upon taking office to determine how to proceed with the auto companies. They had three options: no further government assistance; more loans with no strings attached; or more financial resources on the condition the companies would restructure. In both cases, the third option was chosen. The administration had a heavy hand in the restructuring, forcing the sale of Chrysler to Fiat and requiring GM to fire its CEO, close plants, shrink staff and eliminate lines like Pontiac and Saturn. The general consensus from both a legislative panel and experts is that the intervention by the administration kept both companies out of long, drawn out bankruptcies that could have resulted in the liquidation of GM and Chrysler. That likely would have impacted Ford as well (Ford didn’t take government money, but lobbied for GM and Chrysler to receive assistance, noting that the three automakers shared parts suppliers) and threatened the U.S. auto industry existence. It’s impossible to know what would have happened had the administration not stepped in. However, it’s fair to say right now both companies are profitable and American car makers are in stable positions. Additionally, a $9 billion hit is less than the $24 billion loss the Treasury predicted in 2011. Our ruling Obama said, "The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in." We’ll note that losses from automaker loans were expected to be higher, and the action taken by the Obama administration resulted in GM and Chrysler paying back the bulk of their loans. But to say they've paid back "every dime and more," requires considerable cherry-picking. Obama doesn’t count any outstanding loans made by the Bush administration, which seem to have been made with Obama's quiet support and which were restructured (resulting in some losses) under the bankruptcy Obama's Treasury helped manage. And to get into the black, he counts money the automakers paid back for Bush administration loans. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression. That’s Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-22T17:13:19	2015-01-07	['None']

pomt-12576	Says "2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash" in a nearby county.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/11/countynewsroominfo/fake-news-site-alters-real-story-fiery-car-crash-t/	A fake news website looking to spread malware lured readers by altering details of a tragically true news story of a fatal car wreck that killed two women and several children. At least 22 posts we first noticed on April 10, 2017, on the website CountyNewsroom.info carried headlines that declared, "2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash," followed by the name of a county, such as Stark County or Schuyler County. Facebook users flagged multiple versions of the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. The story is fake, although it does steal details from a real event (more on that in a second). The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used. When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won’t be linking to any of the stories for that reason. The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as "Police." The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it’s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not. There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia. The small country in the Caucasus has been a growing source of multiple fake news websites since the 2016 presidential campaign. We emailed the person listed in the WHOIS lookup, but have not heard back. The story, meanwhile, gives no indication in which state it is located, but the details of the accident are identical in each version. Two men — Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47 — were the sole survivors of a crash that killed their families, the posts said. According to the story, the two men were in a minivan with their families when the minivan hit a black BMW on the side of the road. The minivan was then struck from behind by "a big rig," sending the minivan toppling into a ravine. The minivan caught fire, the story read, and the two men managed to escape. Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities. "Words can’t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene," a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. "It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly." The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said. While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif. Some, but not all, of the details were changed. Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post. Their wives and four children, not five, were trapped in their minivan and killed in the fiery wreck. The children were aged 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the two men did suffer burns trying to save their families. The quote is unaltered, and came from a California Highway Patrol officer named Dan Williams. Another CHP officer also is quoted in some true reporting of the incident. The author of the post made minimal changes to real news stories about the accident, using the shocking specifics to fool readers into clicking. But visitors thinking they are reading about a local accident end up being fooled into exposing their computers to an attack with pornographic software. We rate this story False.

pomt-10355	"Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/09/barack-obama/no-shortage-of-choppers-for-floods/	In a news conference in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama took a question about whether "a terror attack might be good for Senator John McCain's campaign." The theory behind the question was that McCain is a military veteran who has spent his decades in Washington developing strong foreign policy credentials. Obama answered by arguing that the policies supported by McCain and President Bush have actually made the country more vulnerable to attack: "I don't think that the Bush administration or John McCain have shaped policies that are optimal in order to deal with the terrorist threat. We're seeing backsliding in Afghanistan. We've got bin Laden sending out audio tapes. We've got interactive Internet sites that al-Qaida has put up because they've got a place where they feel relatively secure. We are weakened financially and our military is strained to the breaking point as a consequence of our incursions into Iraq. We've neglected some of the homeland security investments that we could have made here. "Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding." Obama was making two points about the Guard: First, that the strain on the Guard from fighting two foreign wars hampered its response to the June Midwest flooding; second, that the number of helicopters overseas at the time supports that conclusion. We didn't find evidence that either of these points were true. Three states affected by the flooding said his math is incorrect on the number of helicopters available to work flooding missions. Only one state had more helicopters slotted for overseas work than domestic missions. The Obama campaign didn't specify what region the candidate was referring to or where he got his information, but it acknowledged that the helicopter figure was wrong. • In Iowa, the state worst hit by the flooding, all 21 of its helicopters were stateside and available to help with the flooding. The figures for manpower show the Iowa National Guard was ready to respond as well. At the time of the flooding, about 850 service men and women were overseas. That's less than one-tenth of the state's total forces of 9,400. "We had what we needed to get the job done," said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood, a Guard spokesman. "If we needed more people we had more to call up." Before and during the flooding, service members returned from Iraq. Now, Iowa has about 560 serving on active duty, and the majority of those aren't involved in the war on terrorism. About 330 are on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, about 140 are in Iraq and 90 on the Sinai Peninsula, Hapgood said. • Missouri National Guard spokeswoman Capt. Tammy Spicer said the Missouri Guard has 10 Black Hawk helicopters that are on their way to Iraq. That leaves them with eight choppers to work the flooding. "Every request for aviation support that has been passed to the Missouri National Guard for this particular disaster has been met," Spicer said. Kansas had offered aviation support, but Missouri didn't need it. For personnel, the Missouri Guard has 11,500 soldiers and airmen, about 1,800 of which are mobilized for the war on terrorism. The largest number, about 1,000, are in Kosovo, followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. • Mike Chrisman, spokesman for the Illinois National Guard, said eight of the state's eighteen helicopters are overseas in Kosovo. They've been using only three of the available helicopters for flooding missions. And the helicopters that are overseas aren't even in Iraq. "We've had the assets," Chrisman said. "We would have had more had they asked for more." Illinois has about 13,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen, with about 800 in Iraq and Afghanistan. Later this year, about 2,700 National Guard soldiers will deploy to Afghanistan, the state's biggest overseas deployment since World War II. Still, the flooding required only about 1,400 soldiers. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama, conceded in an e-mail that the 15 out of 17 figure on helicopters was inaccurate, but he did not provide more specifics on where the information came from. "The exact data point on helicopters that was relayed to Senator Obama was off, but the sentiment behind his statement was correct – that the Iraq war is overstretching our national guard," Vietor wrote. We're not sure exactly what "region" Obama was referring to, but the numbers for the states affected by flooding don't match up at all. We understand Obama's larger point, and explore it in this story about the readiness of the National Guard. But he chose a terrible example in the Midwest floods to illustrate that larger point. The fact is his facts wrong, so we say False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-07-09T00:00:00	2008-06-25	['Midwestern_United_States', 'National_Guard_of_the_United_States']
pomt-01922	When asked by a reporter whether he’s at the center of a "criminal scheme" to violate campaign laws, Gov. Scott Walker nodded yes.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-video-ad-scott-walker-nods-yes-wh/	Five days after an unsealed legal brief spelled out John Doe prosecutors’ suspicions that Gov. Scott Walker helped run a "criminal scheme" to violate campaign laws, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin posted a web video. The video, "Wisconsin Deserves Better," ends with a question-and-answer segment in which Walker appears to acknowledge guilt. That sequence starts with audio of part of a question asked of Walker by reporter Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. He was among a group of reporters seeking Walker’s reaction on June 19, 2014, after the legal brief came out as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group under investigation in the Doe probe. Benson, not shown at first, is heard saying to Walker: "...that you are the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?" Abruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face. "Our State Deserves Better" appears on the screen as the video ends without any verbal evidence of Walker’s response to Benson. The video is on the party’s YouTube channel, and was promoted on its Facebook page and state party’s website. Tale of the tape At the bottom of the screen during the sequence with Benson and Walker, the video credit appears to be WEAU-TV, the NBC affiliate in Eau Claire. The station picked up the feed from WTMJ and aired it June 20. But the report originally aired on WTMJ, so we looked at the station’s segment regarding the release of the prosecution’s brief and Walker’s reaction. We examined the relevant parts of the TMJ interview, and the Dem video, and created our own video with those clips back to back. In the WTMJ segment, anchors introduce the story and then go to Benson, who says, "Well, the new documents are public after conservative groups sued in Federal Court to stop the investigation. Prosecutors allege a criminal scheme. Walker says the allegations from a partisan Milwaukee D.A. are false." After showing some highlights of the prosecution’s theory of the case, the segment cuts to Benson questioning Walker. It’s the complete version of the sequence truncated by the Dems in their video. The first tipoff to the fact that the Dem video is manipulated: In the WTMJ segment, unlike in the Dem video, Benson is on screen when he asks Walker: "Prosecutors in the John Doe investigation allege that you are at the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?" "No," Walker says immediately, shaking his head side to side. The WTMJ segments cuts away at that point, back to Benson, who says: "Walker says no laws were broken, and the case was rejected by two judges who have reviewed the allegations." Finally, WTMJ cuts back to the reporters interviewing Walker, who is shown saying, "And I asked people to look at the facts, and the facts are pretty clear. A judge at the state and the federal level made it clear that they didn’t buy into this argument. They said to move on." It doesn’t take a degree in YouTube to see that Walker actually bobbed his head "yes" during Benson’s question, not in response to Benson. (As those who follow Walker know, he uses the head bob frequently when listening to people as he campaigns or when taking in reporters’ questions.) We asked Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate about the discrepancy between the two videos. Tate referred us to party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, who acknowledged that it appears Walker shakes his head yes in the party’s video. It wasn’t intentional or an attempt to mislead, Baldauff said. The party was trying to "layer together clips" of news coverage of the Doe issue and about the jobs reports that came out the same week, she said. Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson wasn’t buying that explanation Friday. "This Democrat Party propaganda is another attempt to mislead the voters from the facts and distract from Mary Burke's failed record as Jim Doyle's commerce secretary," Evenson said, referring to Walker’s leading Democratic Party challenger in the fall governor’s race. WTMJ news director Janet Hundley and WEAU general manager Terry McHugh assisted PolitiFact in locating video of the Walker segment. Neither wanted to comment on the Dem video. Our rating A Democratic Party web video making the rounds on social media shows a grim-faced Gov. Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporter’s question about whether he was at the center of a "criminal scheme" to evade campaign finance laws. In real life, the governor answered an emphatic "no" -- not surprising given he’s been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation. The Dem video, in its editing of the WTMJ clip, leaves the viewer with the misleading and ridiculous impression that Walker is somehow admitting guilt in the case. That’s the definition of Pants on Fire.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2014-06-27T17:39:00	2014-06-24	['None']
pomt-14631	Neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters "knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/28/chris-christie/christie-says-neighbors-san-bernardino-shooters-kn/	The threat to the United States from Islamic terrorists was a lead-off topic in the Republican debate in Iowa, and the December shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., was a prime example of how real that threat can be. Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about the reluctance of the shooters’ neighbors to report suspicious activity by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. They didn't want to be seen as using ethnic profiling. Christie said what the neighbors saw had nothing to do with profiling. "These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it," Christie said. "That's not profiling, that's law enforcement." Kelly interjected, "They didn't know they were going to attack the country." "They knew they were talking about attacking people," Christie shot back. We looked for any reports of the neighbors saying they had an inkling of any plans for an attack. We didn’t find any. We did find second-hand reports that weren’t well sourced, and these were repeated primarily on right-leaning news websites. This excerpt from the conservative website Daily Caller was typical: "A neighbor of Farook’s mother in Redland — said that another neighbor told him "they had I guess been receiving packages — quite a few packages within a short amount of time, and they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage." "She was kind of suspicious and wanted to report it," Elswick explained, "but she said she didn’t want to profile." There were many articles of this sort. All of them sourced back to a local ABC news affiliate broadcast and all of them had pretty much the same details. None of these accounts supports Christie’s assertion. First, they talk about what the neighbors of Farook’s mother saw, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. The mother lived in Redlands, not San Bernardino. We should also note that this account comes from a neighbor saying what he learned from another neighbor, not what he saw himself. Second, no one was reported as saying that they thought an attack was being planned. Soon after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that neighbors and friends described the couple as "quiet, religious people who didn’t attract attention or suspicion." Our ruling Christie said that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country. The most that was reported is that a neighbor of a neighbor of one of the shooter’s mother said there was suspicious activity. There was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned. Christie jumbled the details in the news. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18d28985-9171-4758-ba6d-6f150b004517	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2016-01-28T23:07:14	2016-01-28	['San_Bernardino,_California']
pomt-10934	Says Sen. Joe Donnelly’s "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/26/senate-leadership-fund/did-donnelly-profit-his-familys-outsourcing/	A super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is attacking incumbent Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly in a new ad, referring to the vulnerable Democrat as "Mexico Joe." The Senate Leadership Fund ad accuses Donnelly of padding his congressional salary with money from a family company. Donnelly’s "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000." The ad concludes, "Outsourcing jobs to Mexico. American jobs at risk. Joe Donnelly profits." We decided to investigate the ad’s statement about Donnelly earning $80,000 from his family after they were "caught outsourcing." Here’s what happened Donnelly is running for re-election in 2018 against Republican businessman Mike Braun. Republicans see Donnelly’s seat as a potential pickup given that Indiana voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. The company at the center of the ad is Stewart Superior Corporation, which sells scrapbooking and paper crafting supplies, such as stamps and ink pads, and is owned by Donnelly’s brother, Jack. Stewart Superior is based in California, with an office in England and a manufacturing plant in Indiana. In 2011, the company opened an additional manufacturing plant in Mexico, according to import records from trade date company Panjiva. Jack Donnelly’s company operated without much noteriety from 2011 to 2017. Meanwhile, his brother Sen. Joe Donnelly often spoke publicly about stopping the practice of outsourcing jobs. He even proposed the End Outsourcing Act in January 2017. If passed, the measure would require businesses to publicly announce if layoffs were due to outsourcing and to offer tax incentives to businesses who maintain U.S. production. Things came to a head in July 2017, when the Associated Press reported that Donnelly, vocal critic of outsourcing, owned stock in his brother’s company, which operated a manufacturing plant in Mexico. Critics have used his involvement with Stewart Superior, which is capitalizing on the labor practices that Donnelly criticized, as proof of his hypocrisy. Donnelly has not been listed as an officer of the company in Indiana business entity reports since 2005. According to a 2006 interview with the South Bend Tribune, Donnelly has not had an active role in the company since 1997. He had previously served as a corporate officer and general counsel for Stewart Superior, and started his own small business, Marking Solutions, Inc. A month after the AP report, Donnelly sold his stock for $17,410, according to a report by the Indianapolis Business Journal. Will Baskin-Gerwitz, a spokesman for the Donnelly Senate campaign, said Donnelly did not know the company had opened a factory in Mexico until the AP reported it in July. In a July 2017 radio interview, published after the AP story, Donnelly claimed that his brother had "never outsourced a single job" — meaning Stewart Superior did not lay off workers in the United States to replace them with cheaper labor in Mexico. The Senate Leadership Fund told us that Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not it laid off workers in the United States. Outsourcing U.S. jobs, or expanding? When an American company has layoffs of at least 500 employees or at least 33 percent of the workforce, the employer must issue a notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. These notifications are filed with the state. In both California and Indiana, the two states where Stewart Superior has American employees, there are no WARN notices on record. Workers who lose their job to outsourcing are also eligible to petition to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance Program benefits. No one from Stewart Superior has petitioned since 1998, when a single case was rejected. What does that suggest? If Stewart Superior did lay off employees when it opened its manufacturing plant in Mexico, the layoffs affected fewer than 33 percent of jobs and none of the workers applied for government assistance. However, it is still possible that some number of workers were laid off. Stewart Superior would not respond to questions. Bottom line: Stewart Superior certainly hired workers in Mexico, but it’s unclear if it was part of an expansion or at the expense of workers in the United States. And if so, how many. $80,000 profit unsubstantiated The second part of the Senate Leadership Fund claim is that Donnelly Mexico profited up to $80,000 on outsourcing jobs to Mexico. The reality is the Senate Leadership Fund is referring to money Donnelly made in stock dividends he owned in his brother’s company. Between 2011 and 2017, Donnelly submitted yearly financial disclosure reports. These show his earnings from dividends, which are annual cuts of a company’s profits given to certain shareholders. In 2014 and 2015, Donnelly reported earning between $5,000 and $15,000 in dividends from his stock in Stewart Superior. In 2016, he reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000. Donnelly had also owned stock prior to 2013, but it had been valued below reporting thresholds. The Senate Leadership Fund reaches $80,000 by taking the maximum figure in the range each year: $15,000 in 2014 and 2015, and $50,000 in 2016. If he had been earning the minimum value in the range, he would have made $25,000. To make $80,000, Donnelly’s earnings would have had to jump from $15,000 in 2015 to $50,000 in 2016. Experts say that is improbable based on the $17,400 the Indianapolis Business Journal reported he sold his stock for. According to Louisiana State University finance professor Don Chance, annual dividends are generally only worth a small percentage of the stock. Publicly traded companies will give stockholders an annual dividend worth between 0.5 percent to 4 percent of their stock. Stocks in Home Depot worth $17,000, for instance, would earn just $347 per year in dividends. So, how is it possible that Donnelly’s stock in Stewart Superior, which was worth $17,000 when he sold it, made somewhere between $25,000 and $80,000 over three years? The stock’s value may have fluctuated over time, but we know that it was worth no more than $50,000, based on Donnelly’s financial disclosures. Because Stewart Superior is not a publicly traded company, very little information is available about its investors or financial status. If his stocks were truly worth $17,000 and Donnelly earned only $25,000 from them, he would have received a dividend return of nearly 50 percent. Even if his stocks were valued at the highest possible amount within the range, $50,000, his return rate would have been about 16 percent, which is incredibly high. "The $25,000 number is ridiculously out of line," Chance said. "And the $80,000 even more so." Donnelly’s campaign was uncertain why the return rate for his dividends was so high. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Joe Donnelly's "family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000." The ad also says "American jobs at risk." A company owned by Donnelly’s brother, Stewart Superior, opened a manufacturing plant in Mexico in 2011. It is not clear if U.S. jobs were lost as a result. Donnelly's connection to the company in 2011 appears to be that he held stock. As far as Donnelly's profits, the Senate Leadership Fund is highlighting only the high-end of the range he reported as earning in stock dividends. It would be accurate to say he earned between $25,000 and $80,000 by holding stock in his brother's company. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. UPDATE (July 26): After we published this fact-check, the Senate Leadership Fund said it believed Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not U.S. workers were laid off. We have updated the story to better reflect their position. Notwithstanding how you define outsourcing in the context of the ad, or what it means when the ad says "American jobs at risk," the claim by the Senate Leadership Fund overplays Donnelly's connection to Stewart Superior and cherrypicks the high-end estimate of what Donnelly earned from his stock in the company.

"We need to build momentum with an across-the-board tax cut to boost the recovery and give New Jersey a competitive advantage in attracting new jobs to our state," DeCroce wrote in an April 8 column in the Gloucester County Times. "While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010. If states without an income tax added jobs during the Great Recession, imagine how many more jobs New Jersey can grow by reducing taxes during the recovery. The next job created could be yours," she said. With several tax cut plans swirling around Trenton, DeCroce’s claim caught our attention. Have states with no personal income tax fared better than the nation on job growth? The nation lost more than two million jobs from 2001 to 2010, according to federal labor data. On average states without a personal income tax experienced job growth, but two of those states lost jobs. And the connection between income taxes and job growth is murky. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not levy a personal income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend income. Greg Volpe, a spokesman for the Assembly Republicans, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article from February about governors pushing to cut or abolish their state’s personal income tax and a report from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group based in Washington, D.C. The group’s 2012 report found that on average the nine states without personal income taxes experienced employment growth of 5.36 percent during the last decade. But New Hampshire and Tennessee actually lost jobs during the same time frame. And other states the report identified as having high personal income tax rates, such as Hawaii and Maryland, gained jobs from 2001 to 2010. DeCroce called those states "statistical outliers" and said in a written statement they "do not change the fact that states with no personal income tax were more successful in creating jobs than high-tax states during the last decade." But Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, "you can’t bury bad news with good news. You have to take those as contradictions. Right away it shows you it’s not uniform. There’s more going on than just whether there’s an income tax or not." Pomp noted population growth and natural resources as other factors. Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail that grouping states without a personal income tax is "OK if one wants a summary measure of growth in those states, but the exercise of trying to explain growth differences using just one factor doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when one is considering a relatively short period of time." DeCroce said although others "may have different economic opinions, I still believe the best way to grow jobs in New Jersey is by reducing government spending and cutting income taxes." Our ruling DeCroce said in an opinion column: "While the country’s economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010." A conservative group found that on average states that don’t levy personal income taxes had more job growth during the past decade than the national average. But the absence of an income tax isn’t the only factor driving growth. In fact, two of the nine states without personal income taxes lost jobs between 2001 and 2010. And two states the conservative group points out as having high personal income tax rates gained jobs during the same decade. We rate this claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10605	"I was fighting against those (Republican) ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/22/hillary-clinton/a-fragment-of-truth-distorted/	In one of the most heated exchanges of the Democratic debates, Hillary Clinton on Monday night fired off this pointed attack on Barack Obama: "I was fighting against those (Republican) ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago." Asked later to respond, Obama said, "Here's what happened: I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project." The man in question here is Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a Chicago real estate developer and fast food magnate now under federal indictment. He's also a longtime friend of Obama who over the years did a good amount of fundraising for him. In April 2007, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Obama did some legal work between 1995 and 1998 on a series of troubled low-income housing deals involving Rezmar Corp., owned by Rezko. Reporter Tim Novak reported that Obama was an associate attorney with the small Chicago law firm, Davis Miner Barnhill & Galland, that helped Rezmar and not-for-profit community groups secure more than $43-million in government funding to rehab 15 apartment buildings for the poor. Four ended up in foreclosure. In all, Novak reported, Rezmar rehabbed 30 buildings, a third of which were in the Illinois Senate district Obama represented between 1997 and 2004. Many of the buildings fell into squalid disrepair and financial straits while Obama was state senator, prompting the city to repeatedly sue over problems, including no heat. Obama's campaign staff told the Sun-Times that Obama worked on some of the deals, but that his Rezmar-related work amounted to just five hours. "The senator, relatively inexperienced in this kind of work, was assigned to tasks appropriate for a junior lawyer,'' according to an e-mail from Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs. "These tasks would have included reviewing documents, collecting corporate organizational documents, and drafting corporate resolutions.'' In fact, Gibbs wrote, "Senator Obama does not remember having conversations with Tony (Rezko) about properties that he owned or any specific issues related to those properties.'' Obama told the Sun-Times that he often got complaints as a state senator about housing problems but, "As far as I can tell, we were never contacted by (Rezko) tenants." It was the latest in a string of embarrassing stories that linked Obama to Rezko, who was indicted in the fall of 2006 on unrelated federal charges that accuse him of fraud, attempted extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors say Rezko's scheme was to get campaign money and payoffs from investment companies seeking to do business with two Illinois state boards. His trial could begin as early as February 2008. In November 2006, the Chicago Tribune detailed a 2005 real estate deal in which Obama bought a sliver of vacant land adjacent to his home from Rezko's wife. Although he paid fair market price for the land, Obama later called the deal "boneheaded" on his part, as it came at a time when Rezko was widely known to be under federal investigation. Rezko also has been a longtime, key fundraiser for Obama, dating back to Obama's campaigns to become an Illinois senator. In 2003, Rezko even hosted a cocktail party fundraiser for Obama. In an effort to create distance, the Obama campaign has pledged that any money from Rezko or donors linked to him will go to charity. "Mr. Rezko gave me campaign contributions,'' Obama told the Chicago Sun-Times. "While I was a state senator, he had buildings in my district that apparently were not managed properly. I had no knowledge of that at the time.'' Bottom line, Clinton's claim is Barely True. Obama, by his own admission, did some, albeit very little, legal work that helped Rezko's company obtain properties that would later be neglected. But the allegations that Rezko was a slumlord did not arise, at least not publicly, until years after Obama performed that work. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05432	The Wisconsin law repealed by Republicans, which allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, "was kind of a gravy train" for lawyers.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/scott-walker/recall-target-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-work/	When PolitiFact Wisconsin first wrote about an attempt by Republicans to repeal a law that allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, we found a surprising statistic: The law had been in effect for nearly three years, but no such lawsuits had been filed. And yet a month later, days after signing a repeal of the law, GOP Gov. Scott Walker suggested the law had been a financial windfall for attorneys. "In the past, it was kind of a gravy train for the trial bar," the governor told the Wisconsin Radio Network on April 10, 2012. He added: "The only change (the repeal) really makes is it no longer includes the benefit that was in place before for lawyers." We know Walker stopped the high-speed trains that were headed to Wisconsin. But had there also been a "gravy train" running cash to plaintiffs’ attorneys? Walker’s claim relates to the "war on women" that Democrats say Walker and the GOP are waging in the run-up to the June 2012 gubernatorial recall election. So we decided to take a look. First, two points of background. -- In March 2012, we gave a Mostly False to state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, for saying the old law, approved in June 2009 when Democrats controlled Madison, ensured that women could not be paid less than men for doing the same job. Act 20 allowed discriminated workers -- after proving discrimination to a state agency -- to sue their employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. Previously, they could sue only in federal court. -- On the same day of Walker’s radio interview, we gave Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk a False for saying the GOP repeal of the old law meant women "can’t do something about" pay discrimination. Discriminated workers can still seek "make whole" remedies from state as well as federal agencies. And for most types of discrimination, employees who work for an employer who has 15 or more employees can sue for larger damages in federal court. Now to Walker’s claim. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie acknowledged that no state court lawsuits were filed while the old law was in effect. So, clearly lawyers weren’t getting paid based on their clients winning discrimination cases in state court. But Werwie argued that the law was still a "kind of a gravy train" for lawyers because they could extract settlements from employers by threatening to sue in state court. Some attorneys who represent workers say the system for suing in state court under the old law was easier and less expensive than suing in federal court, plus it applied to more types of discrimination, so that law gave workers some advantages. Employers would pay settlements, Werwie said, to avoid perhaps years’ worth of legal fees and the chance of having to pay up to $300,000 (for large employers) in damages if they lost at trial. (The same limits on damages apply to suits filed in federal court.) Werwie made three points: 1. Old law led to costly settlements At an October 2011 Senate committee hearing on the Republicans’ repeal legislation -- Act 219 -- Wisconsin Restaurant Association lobbyist Pete Hanson said that shortly after the old law took effect, one restaurant agreed to pay a roughly $50,000 settlement on a claim that typically would have been settled for a fraction of that because of the potential cost of a lawsuit. He said the case had been working its way through the state agency system when the 2009 law took effect. However, that example does not quite fit the facts. When the law was passed, it said it could only be applied to future cases -- not those already in the pipeline. 2. Lawyers wanted old law Werwie cited 2009 testimony in support of the old law by Madison attorney Paul Kinne, who represented the Wisconsin Association for Justice, formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers. Kinne argued that workers needed the ability to sue in state court in order to fully pursue their discrimination cases. "Limited damages make it very difficult to bring discrimination cases," Kinne wrote. "Attorneys turn down dozens of cases because damages are limited and most people cannot afford to pay hourly fees." Like Werwie’s first point, this one does not provide hard evidence that the law was a financial boon for lawyers. But both points suggest a more favorable scenario for lawyers under the old law: The threat of a state lawsuit gave plaintiffs more options in bringing a discrimination case against an employer. 3. Lawyers, unions backed old law Werwie noted that, of six organizations that lobbied for the 2009 law, one was the trial lawyers group and four were unions. But that, too, does not support the "gravy train" statement. The interest of the unions, presumably, was their members who might be discriminated against. And, as was noted from the start, the law did not produce any lawsuits in nearly three years. Our rating Walker said a law that allowed workplace discrimination lawsuits to be filed in state court, which he and the Legislature repealed, was "kind of a gravy train" for lawyers. His statement contains some element of truth, in that the old law gave another legal option to lawyers who represent workers claiming discrimination. But Walker’s claim ignores critical facts -- or, put another way, lacks critical facts -- that would support his claim of a big financial gain for lawyers. After all, not a single lawsuit was filed in state court since the law took effect. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12483	"General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-michael-flynn-got-security-clear/	President Donald Trump says that when Michael Flynn joined his campaign, President Barack Obama’s administration had already given him a once-over. In an April 30 interview on CBS, Trump framed this detail as an inconvenient fact that the media is ignoring in order to prop up their "phony" storyline about Trump associates’ ties to Russia. "In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration," he said. "And when he went to Russia, I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015, and he was on the Obama clearance." Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, was ousted from his Trump administration role as national security adviser after it came to light that Flynn had lied about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Now he’s the focus of a tangential controversy, complete with an investigation by the Pentagon’s watchdog, over payments he received from foreign governments, including Russia. We were interested in Trump’s statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance, especially given that he was forced out of his Obama-era role in 2014. We found that Trump has it right. But that doesn’t affect the main allegation against Flynn: that he didn’t properly disclose payments he received from Russia, as required by law and Pentagon policy. Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role. Flynn’s foreign affairs Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army, serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for U.S. Central Command, among other posts. Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in April 2012. Flynn retired from the agency in August 2014; news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style. Since his departure, he has said he was fired for "calling our enemies radical jihadis." In 2015, Flynn received more than $56,000 from three Russian entities — $33,750 from state-backed media outlet RT, $11,250 from an air cargo company, and $11,250 from a cybersecurity firm — according to documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In 2016, during the election, Flynn’s consulting firm earned more than $500,000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government. This became public knowledge in March 2017, when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent. Several months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014, he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and can’t do as an Army retiree. The letter, which Flynn himself requested, says "foreign compensation requires advance approval," per the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Despite the letter, Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities, according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. An April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency "did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynn’s receipt of money from a foreign source" nor "any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source." Flynn’s lawyer responded, saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event. But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments. Here’s how Trump’s claim about Flynn’s security clearances fits in. Retired military officials can keep their security clearances, with periodic background checks. Flynn’s last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration, in June 2010 and January 2016, according to the April 7 DIA letter. Cummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didn’t report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application. (The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynn’s completed form, but the pages haven’t been made public.) The security clearance application asks extensively about applicants’ foreign contacts, activities, business and travel. The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison. The evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance. Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings, the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicant’s judgment or loyalty to the United States, said Andrew Kent, a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser. Democrats, like Cummings and Obama-era National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Spicer’s critique is unfair. They said Flynn’s security clearance re-evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House, and besides, Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself. Kent said that if those evaluating Flynn’s 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities, they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more details. Because Flynn’s relationship with RT was public knowledge months before Trump was putting his White House team together, the transition team was "in a different position than the security clearance investigators." Our ruling Trump said, "General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration." The last two times Flynn applied for a security clearance, in 2010 and 2016, Obama was president. Lawmakers allege Flynn omitted important information about payments received from Russia on his 2016 application to renew his clearance. But that doesn’t change the fact that Trump’s statement is literally accurate. We rate Trump’s claim True.

pomt-05629	Says only seven percent of 2009’s stimulus bill went toward transportation projects, yet they created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/23/peter-defazio/did-transportation-projects-create-more-one-third-/	U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio didn’t care for President Barack Obama’s stimulus package in 2009 -- he said it contained too many tax cuts -- but Oregon’s 4th District congressman likes what it did for transportation. Or rather, what transportation did for the stimulus. In a guest column posted on The Hill’s Congress Blog, DeFazio wrote that if more stimulus money had gone to transportation, more Americans would have jobs: "Even 2009’s stimulus legislation was proof that transportation investment, no matter how minimal, creates jobs. Only seven percent of that bill was dedicated toward transportation projects, yet it created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs." A relatively small investment yields more than a third of jobs? That’s a compelling argument, and we wanted to know if DeFazio was right. We had two facts to verify: Did transportation take up a mere 7 percent of the stimulus package and, more importantly, did it provide one-third of the jobs created by that package? Congress approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February of that year. It distributed $787 billion through a mix of tax cuts and benefits; money for federal contracts; and money to states. Last year, the $787 billion estimate was increased to $840 billion. The stimulus is so ripe for fact checks that PolitiFact has nine pages devoted to stimulus-related statements. Here’s a great one from House Speaker John Boehner from July 2009: "In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon. They've got great burgers, but no new jobs." (That earned a Mostly False.) The U.S. Department of Transportation received $48 billion of the money, or roughly 6 percent. That’s lower than the 7 percent DeFazio cited so we find it close enough to be accurate. Jobs created or sustained is trickier. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that it’s not accurate to say that no jobs were created by the stimulus, but that it’s not entirely fair for politicians to count as fact the high end of job estimates put out by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. PolitiFact Oregon checked five sources to see if any backed up DeFazio’s claim that transportation projects resulted in more than one-third of the jobs: Recovery.gov: The recovery act’s website tracks stimulus spending and breaks it down by agency and subject. Every quarter it reports on self-reported jobs funded by the stimulus for that time period, but it doesn’t track the total number of jobs created. What we can do is pick a snapshot in time to see how many of jobs came from Transportation. In the fourth quarter of 2011, for example, Transportation accounted for 26,000 of 204,000 full-time-equivalent jobs funded. That’s 13 percent, not anywhere close to one-third. In fact, we checked every quarter and found transportation agency projects accounted for anywhere from 5 percent of jobs reported for that period, to a high of 13 percent. This does not back up DeFazio’s claim. Congressional Budget Office: The nonpartisan office issues a quarterly report on the broader effects of the stimulus on employment and economic output, but it doesn’t filter by agency. Its latest report issued last month shows the stimulus in the last quarter of 2011 increased the number of people employed by between 300,000 and 2.0 million. This, too, does not validate DeFazio’s claim. U.S. Department of Transportation: You’d think that the agency itself would have jobs figures related to stimulus spending and how it compares. It does not. U.S. Government Accountability Office: The office audits numbers as reported to the Recovery Act. A June 201 report on transportation infrastructure finds transportation projects supported between 31,460 and 65,110 full-time-equivalent positions each quarter from October 2009 through March 2011. But again, that’s not a cumulative figure. It’s just a snapshot of each quarter, as we did above. The White House Council of Economic Advisers: Also every quarter, the council issues a report on the effect of the stimulus. It’s most recent report "estimates that as of the second quarter of 2011, the ARRA has raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.2 and 4.2 million." Still, there’s no breakdown by agency so no evidence for DeFazio’s jobs claim. Just how does DeFazio back up his claim? Two ways. First, his office points to various reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers that the stimulus has created about 3 million jobs. (Readers should take those figures with caveats, but there are private studies to back up the magnitude of 3 million, as included in the latest CEA report.) Second, his office provided a link to a report prepared by House Democratic Transportation staff in which they used a multiplier to conclude that $64 billion of transportation and infrastructure investment "will create or sustain more than 1.8 million jobs." How did they get that figure? By using a 2007 Federal Highway Administration formula that links every $1 billion in federal spending to 34,779 jobs, direct and indirect. We’re not even going to get into the fact that DeFazio lumped together transportation and infrastructure spending. He’s pulled a multiplier projection and attached that to a high-end jobs estimate to conclude that transportation and infrastructure jobs account for one-third of all stimulus jobs. Using this methodology, you could just as easily claim that the projects accounted for two-thirds of all jobs. We find no other authority to back up the claim that transportation stimulus spending "created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs." Not the U.S. Department of Transportation, Congressional Budget Office, White House Council of Economic Advisers, Government Accountability Office or the people who tally the job reports for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We won’t even get into the argument of jobs created or sustained. Asked to respond to our findings, DeFazio provided a statement saying that unemployment would have been lower had more of the stimulus focused on transportation and infrastructure projects. "My point is pretty clear in the op-ed. Transportation investments have a proven high rate of return when it comes to job creation. The stimulus highlighted the difference between transportation infrastructure investments and consumptive tax cuts." We will grant the statement contains a smidgen of truth -- he has a report that projects 1.8 million jobs created or sustained, using a multiplier -- but it ignores critical facts that show otherwise. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2012-03-23T17:09:32	2012-02-22	['None']

pomt-04897	Says his plan to end the toll on Ga. 400 fulfills his campaign promise to commuters.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/06/nathan-deal/deal-claim-he-fulfilled-toll-promise-needs-major-r/	Gov. Nathan Deal is trying to turn the Ga. 400 toll from a symbol of broken promises to one of promises kept. Commuters fumed in 2010 when state officials reneged on a pledge to end the 50-cent toll by the following year. Instead, they extended it to 2020. Some blame this move for sealing the fate of the failed bid to raise taxes to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta. Deal, then vying for the governor’s seat, seized on the issue. He promised voters he’d tear down the toll by the end of 2011. The tollbooths still stand, but now Deal’s recent announcement that the toll will come down during his term has him crowing that he kept his campaign pledge. "Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year," Deal’s office announced in a news release July 19. This perplexed us. Late last year, Deal earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter for failing to meet the 2011 deadline. Did we miss something? We put Deal’s claim that he fulfilled his promise on the Truth-O-Meter. First, let’s review Deal’s original pledge. On June 22, 2010, his campaign issued a news release that said "he'll move quickly as governor to bring down the Georgia 400 toll before the end of 2011." "The state has collected more than enough money to pay for the bonds for the highway," Deal said in the statement. "We are now using the tolls of Georgia 400 drivers to pay for other road projects. That’s not fair to the commuters in north Fulton and Forsyth counties. They’ve carried more than their fair share." Deal’s resolve waned in the coming months. By the time Deal took office in January 2011, the State Road and Tollway Authority Board had already sold $40 million in bonds based on the revenue expected from the newly extended toll. Ending the toll "would be an abrogation of a contract," the governor’s spokesman, Brian Robinson, told PolitiFact Georgia in 2011. Robinson did not return repeated requests for comment on this article. The feud over the Ga. 400 toll became a flash point during the run-up to Tuesday’s unsuccessful referendum on a regional penny-per-dollar sales tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s traffic-snarled transportation system. Deal backed the tax, which would have expired in 10 years or less. But tax foes said that the Ga. 400 flap was proof that the government couldn’t be trusted with transportation dollars. Polls showed the tax measure flagging in the polls. Twelve days before the election, Deal announced that the state would pay off the $40 million in new bonds by Dec. 1, 2013. The tollbooths would come down soon afterward. "When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn’t forever," his recent news release said. "If we don’t keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people." Deal’s gambit did little for the transportation tax. More than 60 percent of voters in the Atlanta region rejected it Tuesday, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. Did Deal really fulfill his promise to commuters on Ga. 400? When Deal promised to bring down the toll, he gave himself a deadline: "before the end of 2011," as a campaign news release stated. This new plan misses the original deadline by a full two years. That means Ga. 400 motorists will still be paying tolls much longer than they were originally promised. Deal failed to meet a date of his own making. But he has come up with a plan to eliminate the tolls, albeit on a deadline not addressed in his original campaign promise. Deal earns a Mostly False on this one.

pomt-14897	"Most Americans are ready to put it [marijuana prohibition] behind us and move on."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/08/mason-tvert/clearing-air-over-marijuana-support/	Gallup pollsters took the nation’s pulse on marijuana legalization in October and the findings led supporters of legal pot use to declare victory. "It’s pretty clear which direction our nation is heading on this issue," Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a news release. "The status quo has shifted. Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on." We started our fact checking with Gallup’s recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report — "In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. Just the title of the report — "In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. "Americans’ support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent," the report concludes. "Younger generations of Americans," Gallup says, "have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today’s young adults support legalization." The 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered "Yes," when they were asked, "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?" The percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. "Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013," says the report. The poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization. Clinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that she didn’t smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now. Clinton said "No" when she was asked if she is ready "to take a position" on legalization. But she said she’s interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use. For his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government’s list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post. The same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the "most likely" of "political groups" to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it. Late last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post. This was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn’t drink or smoke tobacco. Two of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use. And Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person’s late twenties. "So why would we even think about it?" he asked. "This should be completely off the table." Our ruling Gallup’s survey has found that a "majority" of Americans support marijuana legalization. It’s been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns. Tvert got it right. The statement is True.

pomt-04848	Sherrod Brown "sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/13/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-says-us-sen-sherrod-bro/	Federal spending is a major issue in the U.S. Senate campaign of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Mandel says spending is wasteful and unsustainable, and he names Brown as a reason. Among several claims in Mandel's TV ad "Change," which accuses Brown of trying to hide his record, is one that says "Brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries." PolitiFact Ohio can't say if spending is wasteful, and we don't have a crystal ball to judge if it is sustainable. But we can assess if Brown is "hiding" (as the ad states) that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas. The ad's claim is spoken by an announcer and appears on screen next to a photo of Brown. In the background is a blended collage of the flags of Panama, China and South Korea. The source cited in the ad for the claim is an article that appeared Sept. 9, 2010 in the Washington Times. The article said the Department of Energy had acknowledged that "as much as 80 percent of some green (energy) programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States." The story also referred to a report by American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop, in February 2010, that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms. The report noted, however, that the grant money was distributed under a program administered by the Energy Department and Treasury, and not by Congress. In some instances, it said, the money went to the American subsidiaries of foreign companies. The Washington Times story goes on to say that the Investigative Reporting Workshop report "raised alarms in Congress. Leading Democrats insisted that the money be spent at home, but restrictions on the funds proved impossible without the specter of a trade war." Brown, who is not mentioned in the Washington Times article, was actually one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program indefinitely "until the law can be fixed so that funds only flow to projects that will create jobs in the United States." Co-sponsoring legislation to make that a requirement, Brown said, "Taxpayers expect the government to use their dollars to support American jobs." PolitiFact Ohio looked at the wind project with the Chinese connection earlier this year and found it never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was "zero," Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us. Our friends at FactCheck.org, who also examined the Mandel ad's claim, found it to be "highly misleading" and not true. Because the citation in the ad did not support the claim, we asked Mandel's campaign if it had additional sources. "The charge in the ad is also supported by Sen. Brown's votes relative to foreign aid appropriations," spokesman Travis Considine said, citing a story from Politico as "the most recent example of a vote held on the Appropriations Committee Sen. Brown sits on that approved $52.1 billion in foreign aid." He also provided a voting record to show that Brown "has voted for at least $257.9 billion in foreign operations funding since he came to Washington in 1993." The list included votes on omnibus appropriations bills, which cover many areas of spending and often enjoy wide bipartisan support. The $52.1 billion figure in the Politico story refers to the State Department and foreign operations budget. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that budget funds U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, and "has been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years." Included in the budget are the cost of building, staffing and protecting embassies and consular activities; funding for the war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which were exceeded by Israel as the top U.S. foreign aid recipients; foreign economic and security assistance, and contributions to international organizations and missions and multilateral financial institutions. "U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities," the Congressional Research Service said in its report on the budget. The CRS also summed up debate about the budget: "International affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1.5 percent of the total federal budget. While some foreign policy and defense experts view that share as a small price to pay for a robust foreign affairs budget that they believe is essential to meeting national security and foreign policy objectives, others see international affairs spending, particularly foreign aid, as an attractive target for significant spending cuts in order to reduce deficit spending." How much could spending practically be cut? Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, is a fiscal conservative who has been called "the Senate's chief waste-watcher." He released a $9 trillion deficit reduction plan last year that would trim "wasteful, duplicative and low-priority spending" from the Department of State and its foreign operations budget. He estimated the 10-year savings at $192 billion, which still would leave a multi-billion dollar foreign operations budget annually. As for the ad's flags of China, Panama and South Korea, we have previously found Brown to be one of the Senate's most ardent critics of U.S. foreign trade policies. He has voted against trade deals with China, Panama and South Korea -- and Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada. Let's bring it home. The ad claims Brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries. The information that the ad uses to back up that claim, that Brown voted for the stimulus bill, has been proven false. Brown did not make decisions on how that money would be spent, and he was one of the senators who called for its suspension after the foreign grants were reported. When confronted with those facts, the Mandel campaign offered as support for its claim that Brown votes for appropriations for U.S. foreign operations. That's the money for embassies, war-related spending to help establish new governments and the U.S. portions of international missions. That's a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies, which is that Brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries. We have a rating for statements that are both false and ridiculous. It's Pants on Fire.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-08-13T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']

pomt-13652	"Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/05/national-border-patrol-council/interior-deportations-down-9-year-low/	The National Border Patrol Council is speaking out against Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan, arguing it’s dangerous for all American families. The group says her stance on immigration expands policies under President Barack Obama that have created an "era of no consequences." Obama’s policies have decimated border security, the council says. "For seven years, the president’s marketers sold him as the ‘Deporter in Chief.’ There was no truth behind that marketing campaign," the group said in a statement published July 28, coinciding with the last day of the Democratic National Convention. "The truth is that those living in the U.S. illegally were less likely to be deported than under any previous administration. Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." The line about interior deportations under Obama sliding 40 percent and reaching nine-year lows piqued our interest. The National Border Patrol Council did not respond to our requests for information on the data behind that statement. Donald Trump’s campaign posted on its website the council’s statement, but they did not respond for comments either. The National Border Patrol Council identifies as the official group representing 16,500 border patrol agents. It endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, saying it was the first time ever it endorsed a presidential candidate in the primaries. ICE immigration removals declining The Department of Homeland Security agencies include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles naturalization and permanent residency applications, among other things. ICE guided us to the agency’s most recent statistical report on immigration removals. ICE says that in fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015) the agency began implementing the Obama administration’s "clearer and more refined" civil immigration enforcement priorities, with emphasis on the removal of convicted felons over non-criminals. As a result, there were fewer removals in fiscal 2015 (235,413) than in fiscal 2014 (315,943), ICE said. That’s a single-year decrease of 25.5 percent. ‘Down 40 percent and at a nine-year low’ The National Border Patrol Council’s statement said "interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." ICE’s fiscal 2015 immigration removals report distinguishes between interior and border removals. Interior removals account for individuals "identified or apprehended in the United States by an ICE officer or agent." These can include apprehensions from jails or elsewhere inside the country, immigration experts say. Border removals, meanwhile, refers to individuals removed by ICE who were "apprehended by a CBP officer or agent while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry." ICE says those individuals are also referred to as recent border crossers. These CBP apprehensions at or between ports of entry are then handled by ICE. Interior removals declined about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, based on ICE data. And interior removals in fiscal 2015 were the lowest over the eight fiscal years noted in the ICE report. We don’t have data before fiscal year 2008, according to Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank founded by Democratic and Republican senators that has researched the removal data. So it’s difficult to determine if interior deportations are at a 9-year low. But certainly interior deportations have dropped significantly. Immigration policy analysts have told us that interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s priority on border apprehensions and on removing undocumented immigrants who pose threats to public safety. Our ruling The National Border Patrol Council said in a statement that "interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low." The group did not return requests for comment, but we found ICE data that references "interior" and "border" removals. Using that data, there isn’t a 40 percent drop -- actually it's about 71 percent. Reports say interior or border removal data wasn’t broken down that way before fiscal 2008, so there isn’t a way to measure the 9-year low, though fiscal 2015 interior removals do represent an 8-year low.

pomt-09896	On a single-payer health care system.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/	President Barack Obama has been prodding Congress to follow his principles on health care reform. He's advocating the same principles he supported during the campaign: Keeping employer-provided insurance in place, making it easier for people to shop for private insurance through a regulated exchange, expanding programs to help low-income people, and requiring large employers to offer insurance or contribute to a health care fund. But at almost every town hall he's held, though — five since March 26, 2009 — Obama has been asked a variation of this question: Why won't you support a single-payer health care system? "It seems to me," said a questioner at one of the town halls, "that we would take that same scenario and increase it outward for the entire country, and that is why I still support single-payer. And I know that at one point you did." We've gotten similar messages from readers pointing us to a YouTube video as evidence that Obama once supported a single-payer plan, which the readers say indicates he has flip-flopped. For those who haven't followed the details of health care reform, a single-payer health care system would mean the government pays hospitals and doctors directly for every person's health care. It's not socialized medicine, like in the United Kingdom, where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are government employees. In essence, it's Medicare, the government-sponsored health care plan for seniors, with no age restrictions. The YouTube video , which isn't the greatest quality, shows Obama speaking in a meeting room to an audience that interrupts him from time to time with applause. A sign on the podium says "AFL-CIO Civil, Human and Women's Rights Conference," and Obama sounds like he's giving a campaign speech: "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House." Reports on the Internet date this statement as June 30, 2003. (We'll address the alleged date more in just a bit.) That was a long time ago, but there's no statute of limitations for the Flip-O-Meter. The possibility that Obama may have flipped on the issue is relevant because Obama's conservative opponents sometimes claim that the public option — health insurance run by government that acts as insurer of last resort — is a stalking horse for a single-payer health care system. According to their theory, private insurance will wither in the face of a public option and Obama will get the single-payer system he secretly wants. We reviewed Obama's public remarks and statements, and found no statements that quite match that video. To give you the context, in 2003, Obama was a second-term state senator and beginning a campaign to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. The Democratic field was crowded — there were candidates both better known and better funded than Obama — and he was considered a long-shot at best. He ultimately won, but at the time, nobody was paying much attention to him. In other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers. In February 2004, about a month before the primary election in the U.S. Senate race, the Associated Press reported the stance of all the candidates on universal health care. "Obama says he supports the idea of universal health care but does not think a single-payer government system is feasible. He says the government should be the health care provider of last resort for the uninsured." In a rundown of all the candidates' positions, the Associated Press summarized Obama's position as "Support, but 'probably not at this stage,' a single-payer government system." In his book The Audacity of Hope , published in October 2006 when he was a U.S. senator, Obama described single-payer as the hope of the left, while those on the right wanted a market-based approach. "It's time we broke this impasse by acknowledging a few simple truths," Obama wrote, suggesting a system much like the one he supports today. In April 2007, a few months after he declared his candidacy for presidency, the Chicago Tribune reported, "Obama has pledged that, if elected, all Americans would have health-care coverage by the end of his first term. He has said he is reluctant to switch to a 'single-payer' national health insurance system because of the difficulty in making a quick transition from the employer-based private system." At his town halls as president, he routinely answers questions about single-payer by saying he would favor it if he were starting a system "from scratch." But he consistently adds that's not the goal of the current reform. "For us to transition completely from an employer-based system of private insurance to a single-payer system could be hugely disruptive, and my attitude has been that we should be able to find a way to create a uniquely American solution to this problem that controls costs but preserves the innovation that is introduced in part with a free-market system," Obama said in Annandale, Va., on July 1, 2009. But the video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above. To find out more about the video, we tracked down some of the people who worked on health care reform with Obama when he was a state senator in Illinois. Dr. Quentin Young said he has followed Obama's career since Obama first decided to run for state senator in 1995; he lives in Obama's Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago. A longtime activist in health care matters, Young left his medical practice a few years ago to volunteer full time for Physicians for a National Health Program, a Chicago-based advocacy group for single-payer. The group features Obama as part of its Web site. Young is an ardent supporter for single-payer, he said, because private insurers have an incentive to deprive people of care. "They do what they're supposed to do, which is maximize revenue, so they can pay their investors and their executives. Their profits are breathtaking and obscene" he said. "And you wonder why the health system is so costly." Single-payer makes sense, he said, and Obama used to believe that, too. "It isn't as though this is an import from Europe or Canada. We have had 45 years of experience with Medicare," Young said. Young believes he was in the room when the YouTube video was made, and if he wasn't, it's only because he heard Obama speak often in favor of a single-payer plan during 2003 and earlier, he said. "As I recall, this was his categorical response, that he thinks single-payer is the way to go," Young said. "Over the years, there's been ever more edging on his part, to the point where what he has now is a multitiered program, but it ain't single-payer." Young said the "Jim" Obama refers to in the video is Jim Duffett, director of the Illinois advocacy group Campaign for Better Health Care. It's true, Duffett said, when we contacted him. He's the "Jim" in the video and was at the AFL-CIO speech. He remembered it as having been in December 2003, but it's possible it was in June, he said. Yes, Obama did support single-payer, but Duffett said Obama also talked about the need to be strategic and work within political limitations, which he attributed to Obama's background as a community organizer. "You have to figure out who's with you, who's against you, how you divide and conquer and move that football down the field," Duffett said. "It just can't be the same little group of liberals who have health insurance and sit around the table and verbalize their great policy ideas. You have to have more people than that." Duffett said if the entire video were aired, it would show Obama making statements about the need to be practical, much like his later public statements. "I've never felt that his core principles for accessible, guaranteed health care for everyone were ever compromised. He's an organizer, and you have to figure out as strategically as you can how to win," he said. Duffett urges his supporters to strongly support the public option, the details of which are still in the works. If the public option gets passed and operates well, he said, perhaps it will lead to a single-payer system. "We truly believe a public health option will work to lessen those negative fallacies of what the role of the government can be," he said. Young, on the other hand, calls the public option "wimpy" and part of "a really deceitful set of reforms" pushed by the health care industry to make sure they don't lose any of their profits, even if reform passes. "I don't think they'll even let a watered-down public option go forward. And if it does, they'll use their political clout to weaken it," he said. Both Duffett and Young served on the Adequate Health Care Task Force, a 29-member state board created by the Illinois General Assembly in 2004 to research and recommend a health plan for the state. The legislation that created the board was the Health Care Justice Act, and its chief Senate sponsor was Barack Obama. The chair of the board was Dr. Wayne Lerner, who holds a doctorate in public health policy and a master's degree in hospital administration. Lerner is currently the president of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago. We asked Lerner if Obama was a single-payer supporter when Obama was a state senator. Lerner said he didn't know what Obama's opinion was on the best health care model, though he definitely felt the task force had the freedom to explore all options. "I never felt constrained one way or the other," Lerner said. "You're not going to find a smoking gun in the act or the task force that there was support for a single-payer system from Obama." Lerner said he, like many others in Illinois, noticed that Obama moved more to the center on several issues during his run for president, and Lerner was pleased by that. "There has to be compromise if we're going to have health care reform," he said. But back to our ruling: Did Obama flip on support of single-payer, as the woman at the town hall implied? The video shows he plainly said, "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. ... A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House." Well, Democrats now have the White House, and the Senate and the House. And Obama still doesn't support a single-payer system. We also have at least one eyewitness — the "Jim" mentioned in the video — who says the 54-second snippet shown on YouTube isn't a full accounting of Obama's more nuanced position. And we have a single-payer supporter, Dr. Quentin Young, who said Obama definitely was for single-payer and switched. So let's put this to the Flip-O-Meter. Opponents of Obama's health plan who watch the video see a stark flip (and possibly hints of what they believe he's wanted all along). Indeed, his comments seem quite clear that he supported a single-payer plan. But a full examination of his comments then and now reveals they have not changed that drastically. Yes, when he was trying to appeal to the Democratic base, he was a bigger supporter of the single-payer plan. But as we note, he still says that he'd prefer such a plan if he was starting from scratch. So what we see here is a candidate who in 2003 was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate and today has moderated his comments to appeal to a broader national audience. That's a Half Flip in our view.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-16T15:39:01	2009-07-01	['None']

pomt-13413	"My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/22/leslie-geissler-munger/munger-says-mendoza-double-dipped-pension-salary/	As Illinois grapples with more than $111 billion in unfunded pension debt, Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger has sought to tie her opponent, Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza, to the problems that have contributed to the state’s pension crisis. During a Chicago Sun-Times editorial debate on Sept. 15, Munger said: "My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years." Mendoza fired back, saying the statement was Munger’s "latest false allegation" and one that previously has been disproven. But the Munger campaign since has doubled down on its "double-dipping" claim that Mendoza took two government salaries and paid into two public pension systems, and now is calling on the Chicago Democrat to forgo one of her pensions. With Munger making Mendoza’s pensions and city/state salaries prominent issues in the comptroller race, we wanted to find out if her allegation of double-dipping is true. Mendoza’s pensions In 1998, Mendoza began working for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development as a project coordinator. Two years later, she was elected to the General Assembly, where she served as a member of the Illinois House from 2001-2011, before winning the election for Chicago City Clerk in February 2011. To support Munger’s claim, Phillip Rodriguez, Munger’s campaign manager, provided documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests that show Mendoza’s pension contributions into the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and the General Assembly Retirement System. According to these records, Mendoza contributed $66,035 into the state pension fund and $34,943 into the city pension fund between 2001 and 2010 -- the time she served as a state representative while also working for the city. As of Aug. 15, 2016, Mendoza’s contributions into the city pension fund totaled $101,736. Mendoza contributed 9.5 percent of her lawmaker salary and 8.5 percent of her city salary, meeting employee contribution requirements for both retirement systems. In 2010, Mendoza’s legislative salary was $67,836 and her base city planner salary was $75,036, or a monthly rate of $6,253. Double dipping? While Mendoza has acknowledged collecting paychecks from both the city and state and paying into the two public pension systems, she has produced documents that challenge the allegation she was double dipping on taxpayer-funded salaries. In a Jan. 8, 2002, memo to the planning department, Mendoza provided her legislative schedule and requested she not be paid by the city of Chicago on days the Illinois House was in session. "As you are aware, it is extremely important that during the days that I am in session, I not be paid by the City as well," Mendoza wrote. "It is of utmost importance to me that my records be perfectly clear regarding this matter." Mendoza listed a total of 44 days between January and May 2002 to reflect her legislative schedule. This 2002 memo is the only such documentation in which Mendoza explicitly asked not to be paid on days when the General Assembly was in session, but her pension contributions into MEABF also show hours were docked over her entire legislative tenure. While it’s difficult to discern from the MEABF document exactly how many hours were docked, it does show deductions in both wage earnings and pension contributions during her entire time in the House. Stacey Ruffolo, a spokesman for MEABF, noted unless requested, employees usually have their hours docked for disciplinary reasons. In defending her pensions during the editorial board debate, Mendoza said her city pension will be less because she wasn’t paid for the days she was in session. Mendoza also said she will fold her two pensions into one as GARS and MEABF are reciprocal retirement systems, though records show she has not yet applied for reciprocity. "I also chose to not take the more lucrative pension that I could have taken when I was elected city clerk; I just went ahead and continued to be in the regular Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund pension instead of the Cadillac plan pension," Mendoza said during the debate. Our ruling Munger said: "My opponent… was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years." Although Mendoza did request not to be paid by the city on days the House was in session, records from both GARS and MEABF show she still paid the full required rate for employees into both retirement systems. In addition to the 2002 memo that identifies the days she would be in session, the document from MEABF reflects deductions in earnings, hours and pension contributions, which coincide with the General Assembly’s normal legislative schedule. Munger is correct when she claims Mendoza was on both the state and city payroll, and that she fully funded two different pensions, but she is incorrect in saying Mendoza collected her full salary from the city. Records show a deduction in earnings during her tenure as a state lawmaker. For these reasons, we rate Munger’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee7f0cba-9c86-4fd2-8203-84d28bb4a361	None	Leslie Geissler Munger	None	None	None	2016-09-22T16:20:17	2016-09-15	['Chicago', 'Illinois']

pomt-03957	Says 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/17/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-more-minorities-born-2012-racial-/	The growing diversity of America’s melting pot just may have made history, according to Cory Booker. Newark’s mayor described the milestone during a Feb. 1 appearance on the "Bill Maher Overtime" show, where he was a guest panelist. Booker claimed that 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority." It’s clear that the United States is a more diverse country than in the past, but Booker’s claim of history being made in 2012 is inaccurate. Let’s first look at data from the U.S. Census Bureau and then the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. It’s important to note that each agency tracks data differently: the Census Bureau tracks population by race, but not births by race. The National Center for Health Statistics tracks births in whole numbers and percentages, and breaks down those numbers in multiple categories, including race. In May 2012, the Census Bureau confirmed the milestone Booker referenced, but for the year 2011 -- not 2012. "Last year we said (in a news release) 50.4 percent of our nation’s population younger than age 1 were minorities as of July 1, 2011," Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us. "This is up from 49.5 percent from the 2010 census taken April 1, 2010. But in the news release we didn’t … look at the period any time before 2010, so we can’t confirm with 100 percent certainty that this is the first time ever so it may very well be true, that statement, but we can’t confirm that based on our written publication." Population and birth data for 2012 from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics won’t be available for several months, spokespeople for both agencies said. Next, let’s look at birth data by race for the majority race of non-Hispanic whites and these minority groups: non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic. We looked at Vital Statistics Reports birth data going back to 2000 and found that the highest number of minority births – 2,005,890 – occurred in 2007. But that wasn’t more than the number of non-Hispanic whites that year: 2,310,333. After 2007, the four years with the highest number of minority births, in order, occurred in 2008, 2006, 2009 and 2005, according to the data. Births of non-Hispanic whites, however, were still higher than minority births in each of those years. We contacted Booker’s press office three times and asked for the source of his data, and we also shared our findings in an e-mail with his press office. We received no response, other than two e-mails acknowledging our requests for comment. Our ruling Booker claimed on "Bill Maher Overtime" that 2012 was the "first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority." Since 2000, the highest number of minorities born in the United States was in 2007, at 2,005,890 – but there were 2,310,333 non-Hispanic whites also born that year. After reviewing 11 years worth of data, there was no other year in which the number of minority births was higher than that of the majority, non-Hispanic whites. Looking strictly at population breakdowns by race, the Census Bureau said 2011 was the first time a majority of people in the United States younger than age 1 were minorities. Booker’s claim referenced that milestone, but with the wrong year. The mayor said it happened in 2012, but the Census Bureau said it occurred in 2011. Since Booker’s statistic was partially correct we rate his statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01274	"We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/	The rise of the Islamic State group and its strategic use of grisly beheadings has stirred a heated debate in this country about the nature of Islam. Some critics say core Muslim beliefs invite violence. Defenders of religious tolerance say extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims. Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro jumped in to say the nature of Islam is irrelevant. More important, according to Shapiro, is what its followers believe, "because that’s what they act upon." Through this lens, Shapiro painted a disturbing picture of the religious wellspring for people who fly planes into towers and behead their prisoners. Shapiro is an editor-at-large with the conservative website Breitbart.com and cofounded a conservative media analysis group, TruthRevolt. In a video, Shapiro blended survey data and population statistics for 15 countries. A good example of his thesis about Islam is in the way he talked about Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation. "It’s got almost 205 million Muslims," Shapiro said. "According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it’s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We’re just getting started." To get to 143 million "radicalized" Muslims, Shapiro took the 70 percent of Indonesia’s Muslims who blamed someone other than al-Qaida for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shapiro then made similar extrapolations using polling data for a number of other countries, often measuring support for Sharia law -- codes of behavior in Islam. Then Shapiro summed up and applied the percentage of "radicalized Muslims" from the 15 nations to a number of other Muslim-majority countries and, with 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, reached a shocking conclusion. "We’re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth," Shapiro said. "That’s not a minority. That’s now a majority." Shapiro spoke with great self-assurance, but as we looked at his claim that most Muslims are radicals, we were left scratching our heads. In the first place, Shapiro consistently used the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with the "radical" label. Secondly, he used a broad definition of radical. To choose one main example, there are many varieties of how people interpret Sharia law and support for it says little about a person’s specific beliefs. Other numbers tell a different story Shapiro cited the work of the Pew Research Center in some of his analysis and much of our work relies on the same source. We tried to reach Shapiro and were unsuccessful. In about half of the countries he assessed, Shapiro focused on support for Sharia law. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, "Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings." It is a moral code that covers marriage, crime and business. Different branches of Islam use different versions of the law. Some elements are widely accepted, such as the immorality of fraud. But for countries and sects that follow the harshest versions in which thieves have their hands cut off and unfaithful women are stoned to death, the opposition from the West, and parts of the Muslim world as well, is strong and visceral. For Shapiro, support for any form of Sharia law means one thing -- the believer is a radical. Accordingly, Shapiro looks at a place like Pakistan and says that 76 percent of Muslims want Sharia law in all Muslim countries. Pakistan has 179 million Muslims, therefore, "that is another 135.4 million radicals." But looking at a 2013 Pew report on Muslims, we found that the picture is more complicated. Pew reported that 84 percent of Pakistani Muslims wanted Sharia law, but of those, nearly two-thirds said it should only apply to Muslims. Run those numbers through and you get about 54 million Muslims who think all Pakistanis should be subject to Sharia law. That’s about 60 percent fewer than Shapiro said. We are not saying that Pakistan has 54 million radical Muslims. Our point is that more detailed polling data changes the results a great deal. Shapiro chose one yardstick. Other analysts could with at least as much justification choose another. The impact of which question is used becomes even clearer if we look at support for suicide bombings against civilian targets. Shapiro said actual terrorists draw "moral, financial and religious support from those who are not terrorists themselves." Even if you believe Shapiro, it doesn’t mean that attitudes towards terrorism are irrelevant. Pew asked Muslims if they supported suicide bombings against civilians. In Pakistan, 13 percent of Muslims said such attacks in defense of Islam could often or sometimes be justified. If that’s your definition of radicals, then Pakistan has about 23 million of them. Hardly a small number, but it’s a far cry from the 135 million Shapiro counted. The following table shows how using reasonable alternative measures of radicalism, Shapiro’s majority can become a distinct minority. You can see how Shapiro reached his totals by watching the video. Country Population (millions) Radical total (Shapiro, millions) Alternative pct. Alternative total (millions) Indonesia 205 143 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 14.4 Egypt 80 55.2 Pew: 29% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.2 Pakistan 179 135.4 Pew: 13% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.3 Bangladesh 149 121.9 Pew: 26% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 38.7 Nigeria 75.7 53.7 Pew: 22% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 16.7 Iran 74.8 62.1 ICP/Charney: 47% would abolish the morality police. 35.2 Turkey 74.7 23.9 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 11.2 Morocco 32.4 24.6 Pew: 9% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.9 Iraq 31.1 24.3 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.2 Afghanistan 24 24 Pew: 39% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 9.4 Jordan 6.4 3.8 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1 Palestinian areas 4.3 3.83 Pew: 40% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1.7 France 4.7 1.6 No alternate used 1.6 Great Britain 2.8 2.2 Manchester Policy: 2% expressed some support for terrorism. 0.06 United States 2.6 0.5 Pew: In 2009, 8% said suicide bombings could sometimes be justified. 0.2 Total 946.5 680.03 181.76 Percent of total 72% 19% To be clear, we’re not saying there are 181 million radical Muslims. We’re simply saying by applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, you can reach a vastly different result. Sharia ≠ radical Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts. According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably. "The key takeaway is that Muslims differ in what they mean by Sharia and how they want it applied," Bell said. Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy advocacy group for Arab Americans, said most Muslims don’t think about every element of sharia. "It indicates a degree of nominal faithfulness," Zogby said. If I say I support the law in the abstract, it doesn’t commit me to supporting various and assorted aspects." In two countries, Shapiro focused on support for honor killings. Zogby said that as cruel as honor killings are, they are not tied to beliefs that underlie beheadings and suicide bombings. "One has nothing to do with the other," Zogby said. Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in quantitative methods and politics at the University of Manchester, England, studied polls in that country in the wake of the 2005 bus and subway bombings. Sobolewska found enormous variation in Muslim responses depending on small changes in the wording of questions. "What we receive as a true picture of what Muslims think is mostly an artifact of what they get asked," Sobolewska wrote. We should note that we found no solid estimate of the number of radical Muslims worldwide. For example, a 2014 report on jihadist terrorism from the Bipartisan Policy Center did not quantify the size of the jihadist population. Our ruling Shapiro said that a majority of Muslims are radicals. To make his numbers work, he had to cherry-pick certain results from public opinion surveys. Given the choice between two possible percentages, he chose the higher one. Shapiro also relied heavily on the idea that anyone who supported sharia law is a radical. Some of the best polling work shows that Muslim beliefs are much more nuanced. Some countries where high percentages of Muslims support Sharia law show low support for suicide attacks on civilians. Large fractions of Muslims that endorse sharia law do not want it imposed on others. The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation. Shapiro’s definition of radical is so thin as to be practically meaningless and so too are the numbers he brings to bear. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06204	"[Former Georgia congressman] Bob Barr voted ... to raise his own pay."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/09/club-growth/group-attacks-barr-voting-record/	Former Georgia congressman Bob Barr -- considered a hard-line conservative in his days on Capitol Hill -- got socked last week with a pre-emptive strike from the right. Four conservative-leaning groups urged Barr, who is thinking about a return to Congress, to butt out of a race against U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a North Georgia Republican in his first full term in Congress. One of those groups, the Club for Growth, made a claim against Barr that the others didn’t. "Bob Barr’s record has significant flaws," said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola. "Bob Barr voted for No Child Left Behind, to raise the debt limit and to raise his own pay." We were curious about whether Barr, who served four terms in the House of Representatives, voted to raise his own pay. Longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said it’s not surprising to see such charges as campaigns conduct more intensive opposition research. Bullock found the specific criticism about congressional raises interesting, since the claims are about something that happened about a decade ago. Still, Bullock said it could resonate with some Georgia voters as the state and nation suffer through high unemployment. Bullock speculated some voters may conclude "here’s a guy who is in a position to do more for himself and he does it." Congress gets an automatic cost-of-living increase each year unless it passes legislation stopping the raise the year before it takes effect. The increase is part of the Ethics Reform Act, which became law in 1992. Barr served in Congress from 1995 to 2003. Congress received salary bumps five times during that time, in 1998 and from 2000 through 2003, according to the Congressional Research Service. The increases ranged from 2.3 percent to nearly 3.4 percent. Barr’s salary was $154,700 in his last year in Congress. Members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000. Congress passed legislation to stop the pay increases for the years of 1995, 1996 and 1997, according to the CRS. In September 1997, Barr voted against a bill that would have helped Congress to get a raise. Barr said an increase was "inappropriate at this time," according to a Rome News Tribune account. Later that month, Barr voted against an appropriations bill that had the increase provision intact, The Washington Post reported. The bill still passed. In 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, Barr voted in favor of "consideration" motions in the House of Representatives that allowed legislation to move forward that included salary increases for Congress, congressional records show. Most members of the Georgia House delegation also voted in favor of those measures, records show. Those members included Republicans such as Johnny Isakson, now U.S. senator from Georgia, John Linder, Charlie Norwood and Nathan Deal, who is now Georgia’s governor. Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller believes those measures are proof that Barr voted for an increase in his pay. "It’s a motion on the previous question," Keller told us. "He could have voted to prevent the pay raise." We reached out to Barr to talk about the Club for Growth’s claim and received a call back from Bill Crane, a veteran media strategist and political analyst in the area. Crane argued on Barr’s behalf that his vote for a motion should not be construed as support for any increase in pay. The New York Times noted in a July 2000 article that the appropriations bill does not have language specifying congressional cost-of-living increases. The funds are drawn from general reserves. In those final appropriation bills, which included financing for much of the federal government’s operating budget, Barr was the only member of the Georgia delegation who voted against the legislation in each year, congressional records show. Keller maintained his position. "[Barr] knew what it was," he said, referring to the procedural measures. "He could had voted no. He voted yes." And what about Barr’s vote in 1997 against the raise? "That’s typical of a career politician to wave around a shiny object to distract voters from his record," Keller said. "He’s not being honest with Georgia voters." Politicians sometimes defend their votes for some controversial measures by saying they had no choice because it was part of a larger piece of legislation that they were compelled to support. For that reason, it’s often difficult to decipher votes on precise items, especially when it comes to federal spending. Barr did vote in favor of motions that allowed several bills to move forward that gave members of Congress a pay increase. However, these were bills that were part of much larger appropriations bills, and Barr voted against the final version of those bills. The Club for Growth’s claim is technically accurate, but it needs more context that could give readers a full impression of this issue. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03441	"We have one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/23/john-loughlin/john-loughlin-says-rhode-islands-general-assembly-/	Everybody wants lower taxes and one way to get them is to have the government spend less. One suggestion for cutting the Rhode Island budget was made June 7, when Republican John Loughlin, a former state representative from Tiverton and unsuccessful candidate for Congress, was a guest host on WPRO talk radio. "We have one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country," he said. "In fact, we're right behind Alaska. And the reason Alaska is so expensive is 'cause those guys have to fly in airplanes to attend General Assembly meetings. But we pay per capita more than the state of New York [and] more than the state of California per capita for their General Assemblies." On the air, he invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to check his assertion that Rhode Island's General Assembly is one of the most expensive and, because it sounded interesting, we gave him a call to ask for his evidence. Loughlin sent us a one-page chart that gave a state-by-state breakdown of legislative expenses and state budgets for the 2010-2011 fiscal year, along with U.S. Census data needed for a per capita calculation. According to that chart, which was developed in March by the National Conference of State Legislatures based on Census data, Rhode Island doesn't just have ONE of the most expensive legislatures. It was the second-most expensive, behind Alaska. While most Americans spent, on average, $9.13 per person on the legislative branch of their state governments, Rhode Islanders spent nearly three times as much -- $26.00 per capita. Alaska ranked first, at $71.27; Pennsylvania was third, at $23.67; Hawaii was fourth, at $22.46; and North Dakota was fifth, at $19.83. New York, which Loughlin also mentioned, was 20th at $11.41 per person and California was 32nd at $8.53 per capita. Connecticut, which ranked seventh, had the second-most expensive legislature in New England. Its per-capita cost was $15.91, 39 percent less than Rhode Island's. The cost in Massachusetts, which has a full time legislature instead of a part-time body like Rhode Island's, was $8.57 per person; the Bay State ranked 31st. Why is Rhode Island's ranking so high? Larry Berman, the spokesman for House Speaker Gordon Fox, said, "When it comes to state legislatures, it is very difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison because of so many variables." He noted that Montana ranks sixth even though it meets for only 90 days every other year and North Dakota, ranked fifth, meets for no more than 80 days during odd-numbered years. Also, Rhode Island's legislative budget includes some expenses that other states list under other categories, Berman said. In 2011, Berman said, "$4,634,000 of the General Assembly’s budget was earmarked that year for the auditor general’s office . . . [which has] 44 employees [who] work independently of the legislature to evaluate programs throughout state government." Other states don't include audit expenses in the legislative budget, he said. Also, "the budget that year contained $1,298,000 for the operation of our own Capitol Television channel. In other states, the television production may be operated by public television or contained within another part of the state budget," he said. In addition, Berman said the 2011 fiscal year was the year the budget "included $1.5 million for the once-every-10-year function of redistricting. While every state is mandated federally to conduct this process, it does significantly increase our state’s legislative budget for that year only." But when we looked at rankings for the previous five years, when redistricting wasn't done, Rhode Island again ranked second in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It dropped to third place, behind Pennsylvania, in 2009 and 2010. In all six years, per capita costs ranged from $25.01 to $26.78. The expenses cited by Fox's office amounted to about $7.4 million. That's out of a total budget of $27.3 million. Even when we pulled out that money, Rhode Island still ranked near the top, with $19.03 spent by the Assembly for every man, woman and child, putting us in fifth place instead of second. And if you look at what percent of the total state budget goes to the legislature when these expenses are subtracted, instead of 0.43 percent, the ratio dropped to 0.31 percent, putting us in a three-way tie for fourth place. John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, said because of its smaller size -- only seven other states have fewer people -- Rhode Island doesn't have as many people to share the basic costs of government. "Anytime you're in the top 10 it's a cause for concern, but then when you look at the size of Rhode Island and the economies of scale, most of the smaller-population states are higher ranked" than average, he said. Our ruling John Loughlin said Rhode Island has "one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country." The National Conference of State Legislatures has consistently ranked Rhode Island as second or third in the United States. The amount paid to run the legislature -- more than $27 million in the 2011 fiscal year -- translates to $26.00 per resident. Even if you remove more than $7 million in expenses that, according to House Speaker Gordon Fox's office, aren't usually in a legislative budget, Rhode Island's ranking only drops to about fifth. Because that still makes Rhode Island's legislative budget "one of the most expensive," we rate Loughlin's statement as True.

pomt-12426	An "abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/may/17/mary-gonzalez/mary-gonzalez-says-abortions-safer-vasectomies/	A Democrat opposed to an abortion-related measure suggested that a snip exclusive to men has proved less safe than an abortion. Rep. Mary González of Clint asked the proposal’s author, Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, in May 2017 floor debate: "First and foremost, did you know that an abortion procedure is actually... safer than a vasectomy?" Capriglione, R-Southlake, replied that he hadn’t researched complications from procedures other than abortion and he also doesn’t believe all outcomes of abortion procedures in Texas are currently reported. His House Bill 2962 requires hospitals to submit reports to the state on abortion complications. Capriglione added: "Not all medical procedures are equally important." Maybe not. Still, are abortions safer than vasectomies? Representative cites Texas figures, Kentucky story A González aide, Andrea Chevalier, said by email the legislator based her abortion-vasectomy safety claim on figures in a Texas Tribune news story and a Kentucky report. The cited June 2016 news story says that according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complication to the woman. The story says the overall number of abortions in Texas had dropped to 54,902 from 63,849 in 2013 in the wake of changes in law, advanced by Republicans, expected to drive down the number of abortions by imposing hospital-level safety standards for clinics and requiring physician-providers to hold admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Chevalier said that according to a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians, the incidence of complications such as infection and bleeding from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent. The article, published in American Family Physician, includes a chart indicating that how a man’s scrotum is penetrated to begin a vasectomy can result in different complication rates. "No-scalpel vasectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of complications (i.e., bleeding and infection) compared with the incision technique," the article says. The chart, citing three studies published from 1990 through 2002, shows varied complication rates of 0.2 percent to 15.9 percent--and also wide variations in the results: SOURCE: Study, "Vasectomy: An Update," American Family Physician, Dec. 15, 2016 (accessed May 15, 2017) We tried to reach the lead author of the update, Tennessee physician Paul Dassow, and didn’t hear back. We turned next to our own research. Abortion complications When we queried DSHS officials about complications due to abortions or vasectomies, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email the state doesn’t track fall-out from vasectomies. Van Deusen otherwise pointed us to agency-posted counts indicating that 54,310 Texas residents had abortions in the state in 2015. A separate chart says 52,938 abortion procedures led to no reported complications with 25 procedures resulting in complications, including 10 hemorrhages--which breaks out to a complication rate of less than one-tenth of 1 percent: ^^ Abortions that took place outside of Texas. SOURCE: Chart on web page, "Selected Characteristics of Induced Terminations of Pregnancy, Texas Residence, 2015," Texas Department of State Health Services, last updated March 22, 2017 (accessed May 15, 2017) For national perspective, we emailed Rebecca Wind of the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit. Wind answered by pointing out the institute’s January 2017 "fact sheet," which states a first-trimester abortion carries a risk of less than 0.05 percent of "major complications that might need hospital care." A footnote notes a California study, published in 2013, that tallied a total of six major complications after 11,487 abortions. The study said complications of any kind--mostly minor--occurred 1.3 percent of the time. Also to our email inquiry, Barbara Tims of the Texas Medical Association pointed out a 2015 review of 57 studies of abortion complications published from 1980 through April 2015. With few exceptions, the review said, 1 percent or fewer first-trimester abortions resulted in "cervical laceration needing sutures or hemorrhage that required medical management." Also, the report said, physicians who provided antibiotics to women after an abortion said that less than 2 percent of the patients developed infections. The researchers wrote: "Major complications following first-trimester aspiration abortion were very rare. Unanticipated abdominal procedures and hemorrhage requiring transfusion occurred in ≤0.1% of abortions, and the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization to treat major complications was less than <0.5% in most studies reviewed. Vasectomy complications Wind said the institute doesn’t have expertise on vasectomy complications. But she helped us track down a 2005 analysis of available worldwide evidence for a British medical journal that said: "Vasectomy, though safe and relatively simple, requires a high level of expertise to minimize complications." An accompanying chart indicates a 2 percent chance of hematoma, meaning swelling due to blood clotting. "The incidence of hematoma formation," the article states, "seems to correlate with the surgical experience. The hematoma rate was 4.6% for those performing 1–10 vasectomies per year, as against 1.6% for those performing 11–50 vasectomies a year," the article states, footnoting a U.S. study published in 1987. On the high end, the chart shows an average 3.4 percent chance of infection which the article says includes wound, urinary and epididymal infection. Separately, Tims of the TMA pointed out a July 2016 article from the Canadian Urological Association, footnoted to studies from 1984 through 2007, describing varied complication rates from vasectomies. The article states: "Men must be informed about wound care and the potential for early complications: infection (0.2‒1.5%), bleeding or hematoma (4‒20%), and primary surgical failure (0.2‒5%). Men should also be made aware of late complications: chronic scrotal pain (1‒14%) and delayed vasectomy failure (0.05‒1%)." We also queried the American Urological Association; by email, spokesman Brandon Corbett guided us to its "Guideline" for physicians, last amended in 2015, which states: "The rates of surgical complications" from vasectomies "such as symptomatic hematoma and infection are 1-2%. These rates vary with the surgeon's experience and the criteria used to diagnose these conditions." Our ruling González said an "abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy." Both procedures rarely have complications, a clarification missing from this declaration. That said, abortion procedures appear to have lower complication rates. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07916	"Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/31/barack-obama/president-obama-says-veterans-can-now-access-their/	State of the Union addresses often seem interminably long. But with so much ground to cover and so many members of the public tuned in -- not to mention intense media scrutiny -- economic use of words is crucial. And so, after interest groups hear what's in the speech for them, they are often left to parse the meaning and import of just a few sentences. There is often a balancing act between brevity and full accuracy. We'll deal with just such a conflict here. In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama boasted that his administration has made "great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste." And he used the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as a prime example. "Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse," Obama said. Two days later, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) posted a response on their website accusing Obama of "mischaracterizing" the VA electronic medical records system. "This is not true," stated IAVA Founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff. "Contrary to the president’s comment, the only thing a veteran can download from the VA’s system are pharmaceutical records and personal health information that he or she has self-entered. This is a critical distinction. "The president’s comments are misleading to service members, veterans and the American public, who now think that this system is in place and functional, while it is clearly not. In the last 24 hours, IAVA has heard from hundreds of members, who have expressed surprise and outrage that the president could get something so wrong in arguably the most important speech of the year." In October, the administration formally launched something called the "VA Blue Button" which allows veterans to download and view some medical information online. Primarily, it allows veterans to access self-entered health metrics such as blood pressure, weight and heart rate as well as emergency contact information, test results, family health history, military health history and other health-related information. Using data from the patient’s Veterans Health Administration’s Electronic Health Records (VistA), it also allows vets to access information about their VA prescription histories, wellness reminders and VA appointments (both past and future). Can a vet get all of his or her medical records via the Blue Button? No. You still can't yet get medical records such as doctors' notes or X-rays. But more and more medical information will become available via the Blue Button over time, said Peter L. Levin, chief technology officer at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the co-creator of the Blue Button. "The things they can download today are generally the kinds of things you'd fill in on a clipboard when you go to see a specialist," Levin said. In March, the VA plans to add information on allergies, he said. And soon, the Blue Button will offer access to lab results, including chemistry and hematology. "We are on a steady path, capturing more and more information from VistA and putting it into MyHealthyVet," Levin said. And vets' requests will drive the information that will be added in the future, he said. "This is actually a monumental VA initiative," said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. "You have to give the VA some credit." Perhaps, he said, President Obama should have said medical "information" rather than "medical records" are now available to vets online, because the phrase implies things like doctors' notes and medical test results are online. "Maybe he didn't get it exactly right," Sullivan said. "It could come down to word choice. Some of your medical records are online. Some, but not all." Joe Davis, a spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars, also praised the VA's Blue Button as a "unique" feature that puts the VA out front on technology. But when Obama said, "Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse," was he accurate? "Yes, kinda, sorta," Davis said. "They can download a part. 'Some' would have been more accurate. It all depends on your interpretation." Davis also said the VFW hasn't gotten any calls from veterans confused by the president's statement. Probably, he said, most realize that in a State of the Union address, every word takes up time, and so the president used a bit of short-hand. In rating this comment, we weighed the fact that many veterans groups have praised the Blue Button as a major step forward. The medical information now available to veterans is an undeniably valuable technological tool and a praiseworthy advance. But Obama's claim that vets "can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse" suggests much more availability than exists. One could reasonably assume he meant a vet could access all of his or her medical records online. In fact, most of the information now available to vets is information they self-entered. Vets can't yet get a lot of medical records though the Blue Button (though more and more information is being added in the near future). So we rate Obama's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12011	"Ronald Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/21/kevin-nicholson/reagan-democrat-50s/	President Ronald W. Reagan is regarded by many as the founder of the modern conservative movement, and experts cite his continuing influence on generations of Republicans. "Without a doubt, he is the most influential American conservative of the 20th and yes, even into the 21st century," said Craig Shirley, a historian and author of four books on Reagan and the first Reagan Scholar at Eureka College (Reagan’s alma mater), where he taught a course titled "Reagan 101." Reagan was elected in 1980 and left office in January of 1989. That means about 38% of the people in the United States were born after Reagan’s time in office ended, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. They and others may not know the finer points in the history of "The Gipper," who was a movie star, president of the Screen Actors Guild and governor of California before ascending to the White House. That led us to take a look at a claim made by U.S. Senate hopeful Kevin Nicholson. Nicholson, a Delafield businessman and U.S. Marine veteran, was the first announced Republican challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the 2018 election. On Sept. 7, 2017, state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield also entered the GOP race. Nicholson was once president of the College Democrats of America and spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He referenced his own political conversion -- and that of Reagan -- in an Aug. 6, 2017, interview on "UpFront with Mike Gousha," the WISN-TV public affairs program. "Ronald Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s, I think, potentially his late 50s," Nicholson told Gousha. "It was the experiences that he saw, the things that he lived, things that he did that ended up making him the most influential conservative voice of modern America because he had seen the other side." Let’s take a look at Nicholson’s claim about when Reagan switched parties. The Reagan library Reagan’s career in the public eye began in 1932, when he graduated from Eureka College and worked as a sports announcer for regional radio. He moved to Hollywood in 1937, where he starred in several films, including "Knute Rockne, All American," "Kings Row" and "Bedtime for Bonzo." He had a long career with the Screen Actors Guild, the labor union for actors, serving as a board member and president in the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, he was an active Democrat, as evidenced by a 1948 radio broadcast of Reagan supporting Democrat Harry Truman for president and Hubert Humphrey for Minnesota senator posted on YouTube. Reagan was born Feb. 6, 1911, making him about 37 years old at the time of the broadcast. An Encyclopedia Britannica biography of Reagan mentions the 1948 radio broadcast on behalf of Democrats, but notes that his politics were gradually growing more conservative. After initially supporting Democratic senatorial candidate Helen Douglas in 1950, he switched his allegiance to Republican Richard Nixon midway through the campaign. Reagan supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956, and in 1960 he delivered 200 speeches in support of Nixon’s campaign for president against Democrat John F. Kennedy. He officially changed his party registration to Republican in 1962. He would have been 51 at the time. "Reagan became a conservative, though, before he re-registered as a Republican," said Shirley. The foreword of Shirley's book "Reagan Rising, The Decisive Years, 1976-1980" notes the Reagan movement quickly spread, championed by emerging conservative leaders and influential think tanks. It’s worth noting that Nicholson is not the only Democrat-turned-Republican who has cited Reagan’s switch as a basis for his own. In August 2015, Donald Trump discussed Reagan's political history in a TV interview. "It’s sort of easy to explain — now one of the things I always start with -- Ronald Reagan was a Democrat, and he was sort of liberal," Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News’ "Hannity" program. "And I knew him. I didn’t know him then, quite, but I knew him. And I knew him well. He liked me, I liked him. He was like this great guy. "And he was a Democrat with a liberal bent, and he became a great conservative, in my opinion," he said. "And a great president and a great leader. He had something very special. But if you think of it, he was a little less conservative, actually, than people think." Our rating Nicholson said "Reagan was a verified Democrat until his mid-50s." The 40th president’s past an entertainer, labor union leader and politician is known to historians as well as many Americans of the baby boomer generation. His transition from Democrat to Republican is also well documented, with the formal party switch coming at age 51. (Though experts note he was becoming conservative before that point.)

pomt-00848	"Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-worlds-fire-not-last-17-years/	The world’s on fire, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- but it’s not because of global warming. On Late Night with Seth Meyers March 17, host Meyers brought up an incident that had happened several days earlier -- in which Cruz seemed to frighten a 3-year-old girl when he said "Your world is on fire." (He was talking about foreign policy.) "At first I got excited because I thought maybe you were coming around on global warming, but that’s not the case," Meyers said. "Because I think the world’s on fire -- literally." Cruz responded, "My view actually is simple. Debates on this should follow science and should follow data. Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming. None whatsoever. It’s why -- you remember how it used to be called 'global warming' and then magically the theory changed to 'climate change'? The reason is it wasn’t warming, but the computer models still say it is, except the satellites show it’s not." We’ve fact-checked statements like Cruz’s before -- that global warming has stopped over the past 17 years, and that’s reason to be skeptical of accepted science about global warming -- and found the claims lacking. (Here’s the head of a human-caused climate change skepticism organization, as well as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and environmentalist-turned-skeptic Patrick Moore.) Cruz does have a point: There hasn’t been any significant warming over the past 17 years. However, the scientific mainstream counters that it’s misleading for climate change skeptics to assume this flat trend line will continue indefinitely, or that it negates the long-term likelihood of global warming. Cherry picking NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index -- that is, how much the temperature deviates from the long-term average: As the chart shows, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures accelerated their increase in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998 and have plateaued at similarly high levels ever since. Scientists say it’s worth noting that 1998 was an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. El Nino refers to an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally by releasing heat into the atmosphere. So global temperatures have not changed much since 1998, aside from minor fluctuations. The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since that peak in 1998, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By starting his 17-year count with 1998 -- an abnormally hot year because of the El Nino -- Cruz exaggerated the nature of the pause. "Looking at the last 17 years is cherry picking," said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-affiliated organization that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has specifically addressed claims about the period since 1998. The panel argues that short-term trends are likely a result of natural climate variability and are not representative of the long-term climate outlook. The panel attributes the recent temperature plateau to changes in volcanic and solar activity. Data always fluctuates somewhat, scientists say. "The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise," but superimposed on this general trend are "periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling," said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, "the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming." And many scientists fully expect warming to pick up again, though there is less agreement on exactly when that will start. The United Kingdom’s weather office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Climate scientists are still trying to understand the pause, said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University. However, he said he would be willing to make a bet with Cruz that "globally, the next 10 years will be warmer than any previous 10-year period since recordkeeping began." Cruz’s response Cruz Spokesman Phil Novack said the senator was not intending to cast doubt on climate change science. He said Cruz recently voted to affirm that climate change is real (though the statement voted on did not attribute those changes to human activity, a key point for climate-change activists who say changes to human activity will be required to keep the environmental impact from worsening). Rather, Novack said, Cruz was trying to emphasize the fact that "the computer models that climate scientists rely on predicted the Earth should be significantly warmer than it is now" based on satellite measurements. What Cruz is casting doubt on is the idea that we should make major policy decisions affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the name of theoretical conclusions that in fact cannot currently be drawn from science or data," he added. For support, Novack pointed to a blog by physicist Carl Mears, vice president of satellite data company Remote Sensing Systems. In the blog, Mears noted that the company’s satellite-collected data shows that there has been little warming in the past 17 years, and that the observed temperatures were less than what had been predicted by many computer simulations. However, Mears also cautioned that the discrepancy between the model and observation should not be reason to doubt the climate’s sensitivity to human-caused activity. Many factors other than scientific modeling errors, he said, could explain the discrepancy between the models and the observations -- including satellite measurement errors, factors external to the climate (such as volcanic activity), or random climate fluctuations. Jackson of Stanford added that while computer prediction models aren’t always perfect, there are other ways to confirm scientists’ general predictions about the rate of global warming and future climate change. For example, even though the global temperature has stayed relatively stagnant since 1998, this winter saw a record-low of Arctic sea ice, and ocean temperatures are rising rapidly. The fact that the past 17 years since 1998 have been so warm even without a strong El Nino of the sort that occurred in 1998 might in itself be an indication of an overall warming trend and climate change, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Reilly also cautioned that models are reasonably good at measuring long-term trends, but their ability to predict specific years or decades (such as Cruz’s 17-year time period) is "limited." "The models are unable to capture some of the exact aspects of how the heat accumulation is being allocated between atmosphere and ocean," Reilly said. "But the fundamental idea that greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm is not undermined." "A temporary slowdown does not negate 200 years of climate research," Jackson added. Our ruling Cruz said, "Satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there's been zero warming." Cruz does have a point: There’s been little global temperature change since 1998, and the temperatures measured are lower than what many computer models had predicted. However, focusing on that period essentially means cherry-picking a timeframe that starts at an extremely warm year and ignores that the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been stable -- has been the warmest on record. While scientists don’t deny that there’s been a recent "pause" in warming, they expect it to be a temporary trend. Not only is one anomalous period not enough to undercut longer-term projections, but other types of measurements do show evidence of continued global warming over the past two decades, including rising ocean temperatures and shrinking sea ice. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04682	Under President Barack Obama’s leadership, "since June 2009, (the auto) industry has added a quarter of a million jobs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bob-king/uaw-president-bob-king-says-auto-industry-has-gain/	One of the big themes of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., has been a celebration of what President Barack Obama did to help the automobile industry when it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse in early 2009. Bob King -- president of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, better known as the UAW -- emphasized that point in his speech to the convention on Sept. 5, 2012. "President Obama took action, putting together a rescue team, demanding real change and real sacrifice from everyone involved — from management, from labor, from suppliers, from debt-holders, from dealers, from everybody involved," King said. "It was not universally popular, but it was absolutely right. President Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs, and the auto industry is thriving again. These are good, middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics and steel—jobs making things for an economy built to last." With Detroit’s comeback such a big topic at the convention, we thought it was worth checking to see if that was accurate. We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. There are two categories relevant to this analysis. One is "motor vehicles and parts manufacturing." Since June 2009, seasonally adjusted employment in this sector has increased by 165,100 jobs. The second category is "motor vehicle and parts dealers." Over the same period, employment in that sector increased by 84,500. Add these two figures together and you get 249,600 jobs -- almost exactly a quarter million. With statements such as these, PolitiFact considers not just whether the statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question deserves the credit or blame attributed to it. In this case, determining Obama’s precise role in aiding the auto industry is more a matter of opinion than fact, but experts have told us for other articles that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans. So we think it’s reasonable to credit Obama’s "strong leadership" with a role in producing these numbers. Our ruling The data will change once new jobs figures are released on Sept. 7, 2012. But at the time King made the statement, his data was correct. We rate his statement True.	None	Bob King	None	None	None	2012-09-06T17:25:58	2012-09-05	['None']

pomt-11096	"Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweets-about-canadas-2/	In the run-up to a stormy meeting of the G-7 group of advanced industrial nations, President Donald Trump zeroed in on a specific trade policy by the meeting’s host, Canada. In fact, he tweeted about it four times over four days, culminating in a rant about "fool trade." The target: Canadian trade barriers on imported milk. On June 8, Trump tweeted, "Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!" (Here are the three other tweets.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He has a point, though he’s left out some important context. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Canada’s sizable dairy tariffs For decades, Canada has protected its dairy industry, erecting trade barriers that diminish foreign competition and result in higher prices for Canadian consumers. While this has prompted longstanding complaints by the United States and other exporters, the tariffs have survived, thanks in part to a strong dairy lobby that Canadian politicians have been loath to oppose. After a small fixed quota of U.S. exports is reached, Canada imposes a tariff on any dairy products brought into the country, with the level varying a bit depending on the specific product. For instance, fluid milk is 241 percent, cheese is 245.5 percent, ice cream is 277 percent, cream is 292.5 percent, and butter is 298.5 percent. Experts said Trump’s tweet is a reasonable mid-range estimate, and given the scale of these tariffs, "Trump's complaints have some basis in fact," said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. Not that this is news, said Dan Trefler, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. "Has the tariff risen over time or otherwise become more restrictive over the last few decades? No," Trefler said. Reasons the United States’ angst may be overstated First, not all the news has been grim for the United States on the Canadian dairy front. In recent years, United States dairy producers have used technological advances to exploit a lucrative loophole in Canadian trade law. They have begun separating milk into its component parts, creating what’s called "ultrafiltered milk." These are high in protein and are easier to use for making cheese and yogurt. Since this product didn’t exist when the most recent negotiations were completed, it falls outside the list of products with high tariffs. So in recent years, U.S. producers have sold a substantial amount of ultrafiltered milk to Canada, duty free. Canada ranks as the second-biggest market for U.S. dairy exports after Mexico. Between 2013 and 2016, United States exports of "milk protein substances" to Canada grew from $78 million in Canadian dollars to $129 million. The United States accounted for two-thirds of all of Canada’s imports of this type. Thanks to these exports, the United States has actually posted a large trade surplus with Canada in dairy products in recent years. In 2016, the United States exported $631.6 million in dairy products to Canada, compared to just $113 million in Canadian dairy exports to the United States (these figures are in U.S. dollars). Part of the reason for low levels of Canadian dairy exports is that the World Trade Organization ruled that Canada is effectively subsidizing its dairy producers, making exports harder. This trade surplus for the United States "has certainly helped balance whatever pain Canada's overall dairy exemptions may have caused," Eagles said. Despite the complaints, the United States has long accepted Canada’s high dairy tariffs as the price of wider access to the Canadian market. The U.S. has similarly protected certain goods that it produces for export. "In the last multilateral negotiations, Canada agreed to set its tariffs on dairy and poultry at high, but agreed, levels, as did the U.S. on products such as peanuts, tobacco, and sugar," said Michael Hart, a trade policy specialist at Carleton University in Canada. "As good as these agreements are, the level of protection on some agriculture products remains obscene, but legal. If Trump wants to lower them, he needs to negotiate." A recent change in Canadian policy That said, Canadian dairy interests have fought back with a policy that promotes using domestic sources of milk for high-protein substances. In 2017, U.S. exports of milk protein substances to Canada fell by about half. The change of Canadian policy on ultrafiltered milk "is a legitimate concern for U.S. dairy exporters," said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Ultimately, neither side has entirely clean hands on this issue. "Given the domestic political concerns and the power of agricultural lobbies in Canada and the U.S., there's no such thing as pure-as-snow free trade in agriculture," said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "Each country can point to the other's protection if they wish." Our rulings Trump tweeted, "Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!" That number is a reasonable estimate of Canada’s dairy tariffs, which are high by any standard. That said, the United States has recently run a sizable trade surplus with Canada in dairy products, driven by a strong business in a milk product that was unaffected by the high tariffs. Trump also glosses over the fact that the United States imposes its own trade barriers on certain American-made products. The statement is basically accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05771	"Since President Obama took full control of Washington … every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-says-1500-jobs-lost-daily-barack-obama-too/	A recent ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- offers a flurry of statistics to argue that President Barack Obama doesn’t deserve a second term. "What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington?" the narrator says. "A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured. … This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America?" There’s a lot to digest here, but we’re going to look at two claims from the ad. The one we’re looking at in this item is, "Since President Obama took full control of Washington … every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost." As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? First, the numbers. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We first looked at total, nonfarm employment between January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, until December 2011, the most recent month available at the time the ad was released. We also used the figure that would have been available at the time the ad was released. Often BLS adjusts numbers upwards or downwards in the succeeding month, based on additional information. Using the preliminary numbers, a net 1,661,000 jobs were lost nationwide. Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then 1,517 net jobs were lost per day during that period. So, using that measurement, the ad is correct. (Using the revised numbers released after the ad came out, the daily number dropped significantly -- to 1,274 -- due to stronger-than-expected job growth.) But that’s if you start the count in January 2009. Since Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office -- and using the February numbers makes a big difference. Starting with February 2009, the net number of jobs lost was 937,000, which produces a daily job loss of 856, or 43 percent lower than the amount claimed in the ad. (If you look only at private-sector jobs, the daily job loss was even smaller -- 303 jobs, a number that shrunk to just 74 once revised figures appeared.) The difference between starting in January or February is so big because the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included months with some of the most rapid job losses of the entire recession, which began in December 2007. In just the one month from January 2009 to February 2009, for instance, the economy lost a net 725,000 jobs. Even spread over three years, adding just that one extra month to the calculation means adding 660 additional job losses per day. Next, does Obama deserve the blame? We’ve consistently ruled in the past that the economy is too complex to assign full blame (or credit) for job gains or losses to a president or a governor. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office. Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office." Of special note here is that this ad uses the formulation, "since President Obama took full control of Washington." Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. And we can rule out the possibility that the numbers were calculated based on just the two years when Obama had an entirely Democratic Congress, since the NRCC web page linking to the ad states, "This video shows the daily economic pain endured by American workers and families due to President Obama and Washington Democrats' failed policies averaged over every day of the last three years." Our ruling Using the numbers available at the time -- which subsequently have been revised to be more favorable to the president -- and starting the count in January 2009, the ad is correct about the 1,500 jobs lost per day. But starting the count with Obama’s first full month in office, which we think is an equally plausible way of doing it, reduces that number significantly, to 43 percent lower than what the ad claims. Meanwhile, economists tell us that the causes of these job losses are multiple, so it is also incorrect to attribute the blame solely to Obama. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-11158	A recent spending bill had at least "$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/24/nancy-pelosi/did-congress-recently-approve-16-billon-school-saf/	It isn’t often that President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., use a similar talking point. But it happened recently with regard to funding for school safety — and neither Trump nor Pelosi was accurate. In remarks to the National Rifle Association on May 4, Trump said, "I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health." Two weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence repeated that $2 billion figure in a speech in Indianapolis. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded these comments Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Pelosi, however, used much the same logic during a CNN town hall on May 23. She touted new funding for school security, using a somewhat smaller figure of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Here’s the exchange with host Chris Cuomo: Cuomo: "The building we're in now, the building that you work in, the point of entry there is secure. You don't walk in with a trench coat with a shotgun underneath your jacket and get in. It doesn't happen. You know this. Why can't that be part of the equation? Talk about universal background checks, fine. Talk about mental health, how to identify them. The money for treatment. But why either/or? Why not make the schools safer? I know it's a state issue, but they're going to ask for money…" Pelosi: "It is a state issue." Cuomo: "And that's where the federal government comes in. … You could offer them money to make schools so that when you go there as a guest, and you walk in, of course, they'll have multiple points of egress for emergencies. But you're going to be looked at when you go in that school and you're not going to walk in with a gun under your coat." Pelosi: "In our omnibus bill that we passed just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion — in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them. And those schools have to make those decisions." So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion. However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny. First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion. Pelosi "misspoke on the specific amount," said spokesman Drew Hammill. What does the program do? It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security. Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing "all students with access to a well-rounded education," improving "school conditions for student learning," and improving "the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students." School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents. However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are: • Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas. • The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs. • Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in "rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science." The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants "can be utilized for a wide range of uses." While the uses mentioned in the explanation included "school-based violence prevention strategies," the explanation emphasized that the bill "encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line." And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that "programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education." So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about. Ultimately, "school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds," said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. "With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to." What counts as school safety? Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure. The grants, he said, promote " ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education." While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly. Our ruling Responding to a question about preventing gun violence in schools, Pelosi said that a recent spending bill had at least "$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them." Her office acknowledged to PolitiFact that she should have said $1.1 billion, the amount devoted to a federal grant program for schools that was funded in the bill. Still, even that figure is likely exaggerated. When the Education Department distributes $1.1 billion in grants under the program she was referencing, school security will have to fight for that money against such items as STEM education and digital education.

pomt-11028	"There are a lot of private charters. And in fact, (Tony Evers) sought and received the largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration to start new charter schools in Wisconsin."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/03/kelda-helen-roys/did-wisconsins-schools-chief-receive-largest-chart/	"We need to fully fund and support our schools. Public schools," said Kelda Roys, one of the many Democrats hoping to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November 2018 election. The comment came during a May 28, 2018 interview with Kai Brito on the WORT 8 O’Clock Buzz. In it, Roys took a jab at rival Democratic candidate Tony Evers regarding some of the charter-school initiatives he has pursued as state superintendent of public instruction. Brito brought up U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos before asking Roys’ stance on education policy. DeVos, a controversial appointee of President Donald Trump, is an outspoken proponent of education reform through school choice and charter school programs. Her critics are quick to point out her absence of experience working in, or even sending her children to, public schools which educate 90% of children in America. Roys’ attack on Evers came in a statement that was a bit of a jumble, but emphasized her criticism of public money being taken away from public schools: "And, you know, frankly, the voucher schools that have proliferated in places like Milwaukee and Racine — and now we’ve got statewide voucher expansion — are a problem, but we also have to address charter schools because there are a lot of private charters. And in fact, our current superintendent of public instruction sought and received the largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration to start new charter schools in Wisconsin. "And I think that we need to stop privatization because that money comes right off the top and it’s only what’s left over after the charters have gotten their money that goes to our public schools. That’s wrong." Roys brought up a laundry-list of education issues in her statement. So before we go on, it’s worth defining a few terms. Voucher schools Voucher schools are private schools. Most are faith-based. The voucher school program, or "school choice," uses public funds to pay the tuition of a student at a private school. More than 36,000 students across Wisconsin attended private schools through the voucher program in the 2017-18 school year. Charter schools Charter schools, on the other hand, are public schools. Every charter school is entirely publicly funded, open to any student, and free for any student. In the 2017-18 school year, Wisconsin charter schools served more than 42,000 students. There are two main types of charter schools in Wisconsin. Of the 234 charters currently operating across the state, 211 are run within existing public school districts. That includes Milwaukee Public Schools, which oversees 21 charter schools. The other 23 -- all in the greater Milwaukee area -- are "independent" charters, which operate with the most autonomy because they do not answer to a school district and do not employ unionized teachers. These schools are authorized by other public entities: the City of Milwaukee, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, or the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. The schools are operated by nonprofit companies that have a charter, or contract, with the Milwaukee Common Council or one of the two universities. The agreement offers charter schools some flexibility from state rules governing traditional public schools in exchange for meeting performance targets specified in the contract. "Private charters?" The phrase "private charters" is technically incorrect since all charter schools are public schools. But it is sometimes used -- particularly by critics -- as shorthand to refer to the independent charters run by non-profit groups. Proponents of public schools often talk about "privatization" to refer to any public funds given to schools outside of traditional districts. So, did Evers seek and receive the largest federal grant for charter schools and can some of that money go to "private" charter schools? The charter school grant In 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction won a $95 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Innovation and Improvement. Tom McCarthy, communications director for the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI), told us in an email that since winning its first grant in 1997, the state has won five of these charter school grants. The new grant, part of the Expanding Opportunities Through Quality Charter Schools Program, was the largest awarded in 2017. It is the fourth largest in the last decade of the program’s history, following California ($254 million in 2010), New York ($113 million in 2011), and Florida ($104 million in 2011). Wisconsin submitted the grant application on May 15, 2017 — three months after DeVos assumed her position — and the award was announced in the fall. Because 2018 grants have not yet been awarded, this confirms that this is indeed the "largest charter school grant in the country from the Trump-DeVos administration." Evers, as state superintendent of public instruction and the leader of the DPI, is certainly responsible for this grant -- though McCarthy said that Evers’ "blessing" was about the extent of his involvement in the initiative. Does the grant increase ‘private’ charters? In a June 25, 2018 email Roys spokesman Brian Evans said: "The question becomes, will this grant increase the number of independent charters? To which the answer is certainly yes. In the $95 million grant Kelda was referring to, nothing specifies that this grant money is for public instrumentality charter schools rather than the more private independent charters. In fact, on page 33 of the PDF of DPI's application for the grant, DPI touts recent changes to Wisconsin laws that ‘expanded the reach of independent charter schools and expanded access to these schools across the state.’ They go on to state that ‘the number of independent charter schools will likely increase during this grant period.’ As we previously established, the use of this grant to increase or expand independent charters will very clearly result in an increase in privatization, even if some public charters are also created." Well, only public charters will be created, since all charters are public. But yes, some independent charters will be created under the new grant. Awards from the new grant were announced June 28, 2018, after Roy’s statement. Of the $17.4 million awarded for the first year of the grant, about $4 million will go toward six new independent charter schools. The rest will go to 20 new or existing school district charters. "Over the life cycle of all grants dating back to 1997," added McCarthy from DPI, "the vast majority of the money has gone to schools managed by public school districts." Will the grant result in money losses to public schools? Technically, no. Since charter schools are public schools, an increase in charters -- and any subsequent increase in students who choose to attend them over traditional public schools -- does not change the amount of total public school funding. However, school-level funding follows the students. To fund most of the independent charters (called "2R", a reference to their section in the Wisconsin charter school law), a little bit of funding is trimmed from every public school district across the state. For instance, during the 2017-18 school year, general state aid was reduced by about 1.4% to fund the $65.9 million needed to pay for students to attend these schools. Three of the upcoming independent charters (called "2X") that have been funded by the new grant will instead pull a per-pupil amount from the local school district that the students would otherwise attend. For in-district charters -- which comprise the majority of charters in the state -- school-level funding isn’t an issue. In-district charters are often housed in the same building as the traditional school, their staff are hired under contract from the school district, and in general moving funds from "traditional" to "charter" doesn’t affect resources for the students. Our rating Criticizing "privatization" of the public school system, Roys said Evers sought and received the largest federal grant for charter schools. The grant is the largest awarded under Trump, though it’s one of several received by the state since 1997. Although private entities (non-profits) -- if authorized -- can apply for the grant money and use it to run charter schools, technically, all charter schools are public schools.

pomt-07360	The study that states that more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/may/07/john-lee/did-oregonian-debunk-10-year-old-study-sellwood-br/	PolitiFact Oregon loves to see The Oregonian cited in arguments for and against ballot measures. It makes us feel useful. So we were initially pleased to read in the arguments against a new vehicle registration fee for the Sellwood Bridge this comment from Clackamas County GOP Chairman John Lee: "The study that states that >70% of the traffic on the bridge is to/from Clackamas is over 10 years old and has been thoroughly debunked by the Oregonian." Measure 3-372, for those who don’t follow Clackamas County news, would increase the state’s motor vehicle registration by $5 a year for county residents. The money, about $22 million, would go toward replacing the dilapidated Sellwood Bridge that is in neighboring Multnomah County but used by Clackamas County residents. Just how much of the bridge is used by those residents has played a central role in the campaign. Proponents like to cite Metro’s May 1999 South Willamette River Crossing Study,which shows that about 70 percentof the 30,000 trips across the bridge each day originate or end inClackamas County. Opponents of the measure argue that the study is dated and in fact says no such thing. This is where PolitiFact Oregon comes in. First, we dug up the study and on page 5 we found the relevant pie chart. The pie shows that 50 percent of trips over the bridge are between Clackamas County and Portland; 13 percent of trips are between Clackamas and Washington counties; and 7 percent of trips are between east and west Clackamas County. That adds up to 70 percent of trips either end or begin in Clackamas County. But wait, here’s the rest of the pie: 17 percent of trips are between the east and west sides of Portland, and 13 percent of trips are between Portland and Washington County. So the pie chart also states that 80 percent of the trips end or begin in Portland. Both percentages were included in a Feb. 16 story by Yuxing Zheng, The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter. So it turns out she added some context from the study -- but it’s a pretty far stretch to say that The Oregonian "debunked" anything. "We have not debunked it at all," she said, "because it is factually correct." Now we acknowledge that the 1999 study is old, with traffic figures based on 1994 travel. So we poked around for newer figures and found this: a 2006 semi-update of the 1999 study with 2030 traffic projections. This version projected 76 percent of trips starting or ending in Clackamas County, with 9 percent of trips solely within the county. Trips ending or starting in Multnomah County would account for 79 percent of trips. (This totals more that 100 percent because trips can begin or end in either county.) We talked to Lee about this, and were rather impressed with his candor in a follow-up email. "My statement that the Oregonian "debunked" the study rather than the >70% Clackamas traffic may have been worded better," he wrote, adding that he was really bristling at previous media reports that characterized Clackamas County residents as making 70 percent of bridge trips, which is not completely accurate. For example, The Oregonian published an editorial and a news story in February 2010 about a Portland City Club report, which inaccurately stated that Clackamas County drivers would account for three times the number of trips across the Sellwood Bridge as Multnomah County drivers. The Oregonian corrected that figure in a March story when City Club issued a correction; the March story also stated that 79 percent of traffic would start or end in Multnomah County, and 76 percent would start or end in Clackamas County. "The impression given to voters has been that Clackamas residents use the Sellwood bridge MUCH more than anyone else so they should pay for it to be replaced," Lee wrote. We feel for the GOP county chairman. It’s frustrating when statistics are short-handed to the point of being inaccurate. But we have to object to his claim that The Oregonian debunked a study that claimed "more than 70 percent of trips ends or starts in Clackamas County." The March 2010 story simply corrected one figure -- which was retracted by City Club itself -- and added context. We rate the statement False. Comment on this item.

pomt-06569	Says U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown "promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the Brent Spence Bridge."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-promised-ohio-river/	Everyone, it seems, wants to sell you a bridge. Don’t buy their promises. One particular bridge spanning the Ohio River comes with a claim of a broken promise that Josh Mandel’s camp is pressing as an election issue. "Sherrod Brown promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the Brent Spence Bridge … and now he is embarrassed to stand there with the president after both of them broke their promise," Mandel’s campaign said in a news release. Mandel, currently Ohio’s treasurer, is a Republican who wants to oust Brown, a Democrat, from his U.S. Senate seat in the 2012 election. The news release, distributed Sept. 28,2011, by Mandel campaign spokesman Joe Aquilino, criticized Brown on several fronts. The reference to the Brent Spence Bridge, which carries traffic for Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River, refers both the federal stimulus package Congress approved two years ago and to a recent visit President Barack Obama made to promote a second stimulus bill. Brown was not present, saying he had congressional business to attend to in Washington. Before Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known simply as the stimulus act, lawmakers across the country were discussing whether the federal government should funnel billions of dollars into bridge, road and sewer projects. Brown believed so, saying that by funding "shovel-ready projects," the government could begin filling the country’s extensive infrastructure needs while putting Americans back to work. Among Browns comments then was one that referred to the Brent Spence Bridge. Transportation planners say the 48-year-old bridge needs to be replaced. It is cramped, has poor visibility and carries more than twice the 80,000 vehicles a day it was designed for, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. But coming up with the estimated $2.4 billion is a problem that has has dogged local and state governments in Ohio and Kentucky. Enter Brown. In an appearance on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program on Jan. 28, 2009, Brown said that "we do need to do direct spending on job creation. That means shovel-ready projects for water and sewer systems, whether it's the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati that will put a lot of people to work and help with economic development, or whether it's a water and sewer system in Defiance, Ohio or in Nashville. It's pretty clear to me that we need direct spending on projects that are ready to go, particularly, green projects that put people to work immediately but also help longer term and economic development." Did you hear a promise in there? Mandel did. It is beyond question that Brown cited the Brent Spence Bridge in 2009 as an example of a project the first stimulus bill could fund, just as Obama used it as an example recently. Obama went further than Brown, using his speech to also send a message to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker John Boehner of southwest Ohio. "Mr. Boehner, Mr. McConnell, help us rebuild this bridge," Obama said, standing in the bridge’s shadow on Sept. 22. It is also beyond question that this is not a shovel-ready project. Had PolitiFact Ohio been around then, Brown’s inclusion of the Brent Spence Bridge as a shovel-ready project might have rated False on the Truth-O-Meter. While there have been preliminary studies, more extensive engineering and planning are required. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported recently that "in a best case scenario, the earliest that workers would be hired would be in 2013, but more likely 2015." Facing questions about the bridge, a White House spokesman stressed the same day as Obama’s speech that the Brent Spence project is merely "an example" of the kind of project that could get funding in Obama’s new $447 billion stimulus proposal. Many details remain to be worked out, including how a particular component, a $10 billion infrastructure bank, would work. It is not clear whether this -- or a bigger infrastructure bank that Brown proposes -- could be used toward the eventual Brent Spence project. So let’s stipulate: Brown said in 2009 that the Brent Spence Bridge was the kind of project the first stimulus could pay for, using it as an example of a shovel-ready project. He clearly suggested that the bridge could be built with stimulus money. It didn’t happen. And the project was not shovel-ready. Does this make it a broken promise? PolitiFact Ohio discussed this with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, whose spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, says that Brown certainly made a strong suggestion that a casual listener might equate to a promise. We agree. That’s an element of truth that that factors into why we are not ruling Mandel’s claim about a broken promise to be entirely False. But Mandel used a strong word: promise. He did not say Brown broke his suggestion. He said Brown broke a promise. Brown never made a promise, which is a critical difference. It is why Mandel’s claim gets a rating of Mostly False.

pomt-15073	"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-recessions-more-frequent-under-rep/	Recently, Hillary Clinton has been making the ultimate pocketbook argument for her candidacy: When there’s a Democrat in the White House, she says, the economy does better. Earlier in this campaign season, she said the stock market does better under Democrats. In a speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Sept. 19, Clinton went even further. "I know it’s inconvenient for our Republican friends, but the facts do speak for themselves," the former secretary of state said. "Economic growth is stronger under Democratic presidents. Unemployment is lower. The stock market rises faster. Businesses do better, and deficits are smaller. And one of my favorite inconvenient facts is under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats." In this fact-check, we decided to focus the claim that recessions are four times as likely under Republicans as they are under Democrats. A look at the numbers The primary research on this question -- and the source cited by the Clinton campaign when we asked -- comes from a paper written by two Princeton University economists, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The paper, published in July 2014, found that the economy tends to do better under Democratic presidents by numerous measures. The authors looked at quarterly economic data from 1947 through mid 2013 and the National Bureau of Economic Research’s official list of recessions and found that Clinton’s claim is pretty much on point. Since 1947, there have been 11 official recessions, totaling 49 recessionary quarters. Of those 49 quarters, just eight occurred under Democratic presidents, compared to 41 under Republicans. So, over the past 65 years, quarters in recession were about five times more common under a Republican president than under a Democratic president. "Sec. Clinton is correct in her claim," Watson, one of the paper’s authors, told PolitiFact. Looking at how many recessions started under Republicans, the difference is even more stark, noted Blinder, the co-author. Of the 11 recessions since 1947, nine under Republicans, compared to just two under Democrats. The paper also looked further back in history to 1875 and found that the trend held, though it was less pronounced. But what does this mean? Economists emphasize, however, that Clinton’s claim needs some additional context. Clinton presumably wants listeners to believe that Republican policies don’t work for the economy. But the research doesn’t necessarily support this contention. There are far too many factors that contribute to the country’s economic health. "Democrats would no doubt like to attribute the large (Democratic/Republican) growth gap to macroeconomic policy choices, but the data do not support such a claim," the Blinder-Watson paper says. In short, the paper found that half of the Democrats’ economic advantage is a result of factors outside the control of the White House, Congress or the Federal Reserve. The other half "remains a mystery," Watson said. "It seems we must look instead to several variables that are mostly ‘good luck,’ with perhaps a touch of ‘good policy,’" the report says. One section of the paper (it’s on page 14) gives an overview of booms and busts since World War II. It concludes that it’s difficult to draw a direct line from a president’s fiscal policy positions to economic cycles. For example, defense spending led to prosperity during the Korean War under Democratic President Harry Truman. His successor, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, ended the war, and thus the prosperity turned into recession. Energy price shocks are another important factor, since they can produce economic downturns. Unfortunately for the Republicans, shocks hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. The authors add that Democratic presidents have benefited from higher "total factor productivity," which is essentially a measure of technological growth and dynamism. A clear example is the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. The authors acknowledge that it’s unclear why this has been the case under Democratic presidents. And sometimes the fiscal policy of a previous administration bleeds into the next one -- so just because a recession happened when one president was in office, the prior administration might bear some of the responsibility. While Democratic President Lyndon Johnson saw no recessions, for instance, his administration had to implement anti-inflation policies near the end of his tenure. Those policies contributed to a recession early on in Nixon’s term. Because of all the factors at play, assigning credit for economic results is tricky, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor and chief economist for the job site Indeed.com. In fact, it’s possible that causation actually runs the other way. "It's possible that the public votes in response to economic conditions," she added, "meaning political cycles can follow economic cycles." Our ruling Clinton said that "under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats." The numbers back up Clinton’s claim since World War II: Of the 49 quarters in recession since 1947, eight occurred under Democrats, while 41 occurred under Republicans. It’s important to note, however, that many factors contribute to general well-being of the economy, so one shouldn’t treat Clinton’s implication -- that Democratic presidencies are better for the economy -- with irrational exuberance. Clinton is right on the numbers, but her claim needs additional information to put its implication into the proper context. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14105	"For the first time in over 40 years, Republicans don’t hold a single statewide office" in Virginia.	true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/12/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-gop-shut-out-va-statewide-office/	Ed Gillespie says he’s convinced that the Republican philosophy of "limited, effective" government is just what Virginia needs. But there’s a hitch. "To enact those policies, we must first win elections because for the first time in over 40 years, Republicans don’t hold a single statewide office," Gillespie, who plans to run for governor next year, said in an April 30 speech at the GOP state convention. We wondered if this really is the first time in more than four decades that no Republican holds any of Virginia’s five statewide offices. The 2013 sweep in statewide elections for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general by Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam and Mark Herring, respectively, left Democrats in full control of Virginia’s executive posts. Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, meanwhile, hold Virginia’s two U.S. Senate seats. If you’re a political junkie, stop here for a minute. Try to figure out the last full year - before 2014 - that Democrats had such a lock. Now, let’s go back in time together. From 2010 through 2013, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli - all of them Republicans - held the state’s top three positions. Actually, the GOP had at least one of those three offices every year since the early 1990s, when Democrats held them all under Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer and Attorney General Mary Sue Terry. But even with no Republicans holding an executive post in state government, the GOP back then had John Warner, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 until 2009. You have to go back to 1969 to find the last full year when Democrats held all five statewide posts. That year, Gov. Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. Fred Pollard and Attorney General Robert Button were in office along with U.S. Sens. Harry F. Byrd Jr. and William B. Spong Jr. Later that year, Linwood Holton became the first Republican elected governor in Virginia. He was inaugurated Jan. 17, 1970. Byrd and Godwin, like many Southerners, abandoned the Democratic Party in the early 1970s as it moved to the left. Byrd became an independent in 1971 and, two years later, Godwin was re-elected governor as a Republican. Why is the GOP now frozen out of statewide seats? A key reason is demographics, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. Much of Virginia’s population growth in recent decades has been in urban and suburban areas that tend to vote Democratic, such as Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and greater Richmond, as well as in university towns, Sabato said. "This really started in the 1960s, in a big way," he said. Voters in rural parts of the state remain receptive to socially conservative ideas that Republicans embrace, but "that’s not where the people are," Sabato said. Our ruling Gillespie said this is the first time in more than 40 years that a Republican doesn’t hold a single statewide office. Actually, you have to go back almost 47 years to find the last time the GOP didn’t hold at least one statewide seat. We rate Gillespie’s claim True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91c7a5d7-7b70-4e32-907d-2e45b471f42b	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2016-05-12T08:29:20	2016-04-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Virginia']

FODMAPs are a recently identified category of sugars found in many foods, so although hard to find in the supermarket, they actually do exist. Experts say that the evidence on the existence and effects of FODMAPs is accepted internationally. According to research, FODMAPs can exacerbate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, a medically recognised and painful condition with symptoms that go beyond what Mr Baxter refers to as "the human condition". On the issue of how many Australians might be affected, Mr Baxter was right to trust his gut. The research team behind the low FODMAP diet say the number of people with irritable bowel syndrome is closer to 15 per cent of the population.

A website called As American as Apple Pie posted this headline on Sept. 7: "Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead." The item cited Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton who allegedly said, "Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter." There is not a whisper of truth to this piece. For starters, there is no Peachton, Ga. A website named Salatomatic lists mosques around the country. There is no Ramazala Mosque in Georgia. The article urges readers to "call the Ramazala Mosque at (330) 366-6476 and give them a piece of your mind." The 330 area code covers Akron, Ohio. The number is the same number as the one listed on the As American as Apple Pie Facebook page. That Facebook page describes the website as an entertainment website launched in 2024.

pomt-06872	Medicaid is the primary source of health insurance for 41.7 percent of Hispanic children in Georgia.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/01/la-raza/nearly-half-hispanic-children-georgia-rely-medicai/	In a recent broadcast, WABE-FM (90.1) led into a story on the impact of proposed deficit-cutting measures with a shocking number. "Forty-one point seven percent of Latino children in Georgia rely on Medicaid programs for health care," the reporter said, before cutting to tape of Jennifer Ng’andu, deputy director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. Ng’andu said a Republican-led proposal in Congress to cut the deficit, in part with $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years, would have disproportionate effect on Hispanics because they are more likely to rely on taxpayer-funded health care. That figure – 41.7 percent – is eye-popping. We wondered if it was accurate. The number comes from La Raza’s report "The Meaning of Medicaid: A State-by-State Breakdown," recently released as a rebuttal to the GOP plan. It turns out the nexus here is between race or ethnicity and poverty. More than a quarter of Hispanics in the United States live in poverty, according to the U.S. census. The poverty rate has gotten worse in recent years for everybody, but Hispanics and blacks have the higher percentages of their ranks among the poor. The census figures do not delve into immigration status -- whether someone is here legally or illegally. Some critics of illegal immigration contend that U.S. taxpayers should not be liable for the medical costs of anyone in the country illegally. This fact-check makes no attempt to wade into that controversy. Children – defined by the census as people under 18 – also are more likely to be in poverty than any other age category. The most recent figures indicate 20.7 percent of young people meet the federal definition of poverty. Census figures tie together poverty and a lack of insurance. The percentage of all people without insurance rose from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 16.7 percent in 2009, according to a report released late last year. That’s 50.7 million people without insurance. Broken down by race or ethnicity, the census calculates that 32.4 percent of Hispanics are uninsured. That’s significantly higher than blacks (21 percent), Asians (17.2 percent) or whites (12 percent). Not surprisingly, income affects insurance rates. Nearly 27 percent of people making $25,000 a year or less are uninsured, according to the census. So, the poor are more likely to be uninsured and Latinos are more likely to be uninsured. But is the number correct? We contacted the Kaiser Family Foundation, which acts as a clearinghouse for health-related data, to see if the figure quoted for Georgia is correct. According to foundation spokesman Chris Lee, it checks out – or comes very close. Lee said the figure they came up with is 41 percent even, using a three-year average of census data. Ng’andu said La Raza used the same source to get its figure. In terms of raw numbers, that’s about 120,000 Latino children in the state relying on Medicaid for health care. Medicaid is a federal program administered -- and jointly funded -- by the states that provides medical care to low-income people and the disabled, although eligibility varies by state. It covers a wide range of health-related costs, from doctor’s visits to nursing home care. Nationally, the states and federal government put about $339 billion into Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 57 percent of the total cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The program costs Georgia $1.7 billion, and that figure is expected to climb with a planned federal expansion of the program that would add an estimated 650,000 people in 2014. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the additional costs to be around $714 million, while the governor’s office has projected the cost of the expansion at $2.5 billion over the next decade. Currently, about one in six Georgia residents is enrolled in Medicaid, and most of those are children. La Raza is highlighting the high percentage of Latino children on the Medicaid rolls as an argument against cutting the program to lower the federal deficit. That’s a subject for political debate, not PolitiFact. For the purposes of this fact-check, the number in the WABE broadcast appears to be on target. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07110	Says former Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez and current mayoral candidate Carlos Gimenez both drove fancy European cars at taxpayer expense.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/20/accountability-project/miami-mayors-race-third-party-group-tries-tie-carl/	The two candidates for Miami-Dade mayor -- Carlos Gimenez and Julio Robaina -- share much in common. Both are Republicans. Both are Cuban-Americans. Both have served in government before -- Gimenez as fire chief, Miami city manager and Miami-Dade county commissioner and Robaina as the mayor of Hialeah. And both need to cast themselves as thrifty reformers as they compete to replace Carlos Alvarez, recalled in March by voters angry about the county doling out raises to most employees amid property tax hikes for homeowners. Any suggestion that a candidate shares traits in common with Alvarez -- particularly his willingness to spend lavishly on high-level county officials including himself -- could doom a candidate in the June 28 nonpartisan election. Now comes an ad from a third-party group, The Accountability Project, trying to portray Alvarez and Gimenez as one and the same. What they share -- according to this ad -- are taxpayer-funded luxury cars. The ad starts with an unflattering photo of a grumpy looking Alvarez next to a photo of car keys in the ignition as an ominous voice says: "Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." "Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." "Carlos Alvarez: a BMW that we paid for." "Carlos Gimenez: a Mercedes-Benz that we paid for." "Tens of thousands of tax dollars spent on luxury cars." "Alvarez was the mayor. Gimenez wants to be mayor. Carlos Alvarez and Carlos Gimenez: They can't be part of the solution because both are part of the problem." The ad's message -- complete with images of luxury cars and a TV popping out of a car dashboard -- is clear: Alvarez and Gimenez both wasted taxpayer dollars on luxury cars. Alvarez=Gimenez. The only difference is one drove a BMW and the other, a Mercedes-Benz. Or is that the only difference? PolitiFact Florida wanted to take a look under the hood of the car deals for Alvarez and Gimenez. And, since it's relevant, we also decided to examine Robaina's use of city cars when he was Hialeah's mayor. Our ultimate goal is to decide whether the ad fairly compares the political figures based on their taxpayer-funded luxury cars. First, some background about The Accountability Project. The Electioneering Communication Organization is registered to political consultant Keith Donner who told us in an e-mail June 16 that his ECO is not connected to any campaign but that he is "absolutely supporting Robaina." Donner referred us to Herald articles to obtain details about car allowances. A breakdown man by man, car by car We did our own research about Alvarez, Gimenez and Robaina and their use of government cars or car allowances. We contacted the Gimenez and Robaina campaigns and officials in Miami-Dade County and Hialeah to attempt to pull together information about the officials' past car allowances. But first, a general word about making such comparisons. Car allowances -- or the use of city-owned cars -- is one piece of an official's compensation package that may include salary, expenses, health insurance and pensions. We are not providing a full comparison here of every part of the officials' compensation -- but we think its worth looking at the benefit of the car allowance within the context of their salaries and expense accounts. The Miami-Dade Mayor's job is considered full time -- the Herald wrote in 2010 that the mayor earns $233,123, the county commissioner job pays $6,000 a year. The mayor's position in Hialeah is unusual because the mayor, who earns around $155,000 a year, is essentially also the city manager. Let's look at each official: Carlos Gimenez Gimenez was a county commissioner between 2004 and 2011 when he stepped down to run for mayor. In his final year he was earning an annual salary of $6,000 plus about $55,000 in benefits, including the car allowance. J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign and a former state legislator, told us in an e-mail that Gimenez was entitled to the same car allowances as all the commissioners. For the last year and a half, Gimenez drove a Mercedes-Benz ML and prior to that a Mercedes-Benz E320. Gimenez said in a June 16 interview that his most recent car, the Mercedes-Benz ML, was silver, and he thought it was a 2009 car. He said it was $2.44 above the $800 monthly car allowance and that he paid for that out of his own pocket. The Mercedes Benz website lists the 2011 ML at $46,490 (before options are added) and describes its "unparalleled ride quality" this way: the car "offers stylish proof that utility and safety can coexist enthusiastically with performance and luxury. Ruggedly capable, truly versatile and every inch a Mercedes-Benz, it's a vehicle that feels at home anywhere you go." (We're not certain if the features changed from 2009 but the Kelley Blue Book listed a similar price for the 2009 car.) Gimenez doesn't dispute that he had a car allowance -- but he said that Alvarez had access to more cars and drivers. "Here is the difference between me and Alvarez," Gimenez said. "Alvarez had a personal car -- $800 a month. But he also had two SUVs and a set of drivers." Gimenez said he drove himself the majority of the time and estimated he used a driver fewer than 10 times in six years. "Unlike the city of Hialeah where the mayor gets a substantial salary in excess of pretty much any city of the county, county commissioners basically make nothing," Planas said. "Their salary is their benefits -- one of which is their car allowance. They receive the benefit because their salary is so puny." Julio Robaina Robaina was the mayor of Hialeah between 2005 and 2011 when he resigned to run for mayor. His campaign spokeswoman, Ana Carbonell, said in an e-mail that while mayor, Robaina did not receive a car allowance but drove a city-issued 2004 Chevy Tahoe and later a 2009 Chevy Suburban. His last annual salary was $154,655 and he had an expense account of $116,175. During the 2010-11 year, he took a 7 percent insurance contribution deduction, according to Hialeah Acting City Clerk David Concepcion. Concepcion confirmed that Robaina didn't get a car allowance. Robaina drove a Chevy Tahoe starting in December 2005 through 2007 and then a Chevy Suburban from 2007 until May 2011, Concepcion said in an e-mail. Though Carbonell, Robaina's spokeswoman, said Robaina had nothing to do with The Accountability Project, we asked her if she thought the ad comparing the car allowances of Alvarez and Gimenez was fair since it omits that Robaina had city-issued cars. "The issue is the luxury vehicle in economic times the county is facing," she said. "Is it appropriate for county commissioners to drive a luxury vehicle? That's what the ad points to." Carlos Alvarez The Herald has written extensively about the luxury car perks of Miami-Dade county officials. On May 23, 2010 the Herald wrote that the mayor and commissioners were keeping the perk of taxpayer-subsidized luxury cars although they were slashing more than $400 million in spending. Among those cars were Gimenez's 2009 Mercedes Benz ML 350, and Alvarez's BMW 550i Gran Turismo. That was in addition, the Herald reported, to two county-owned Chevy Suburbans and two drivers Alvarez had access to. BMW's website lists the price of the BMW at $64,400. The Herald wrote that the specifications for the bid for a BMW for Alvarez included: "black sapphire metallic exterior, ivory white and black Nappa leather interiors, ash grain wood trim and 20-inch double spoke wheels." The Herald included a list of various commissioners' car allowances: the politicians generally chose 2010 cars including a Lexus, Cadillac, Sawgrass Infiniti, Toyota Prius and a Ford Taurus. Some chose the $800 monthly stipend instead of leasing or renting a car. Starting this fiscal year in October 2010, the benefit was scaled back to $600 a month for the mayor but remained $800 month for commissioners. After Alvarez was recalled in March, the county returned his leased car early but the county still had to pay most of the tab, the Herald reported April 6, 2011. The county paid the full lease cost up front: $41,849. When the county turned the car in 10 months into a 30-month lease, South Motors BMW gave $4,000 back. Gimenez told us -- and Miami-Dade County spokeswoman Vanessa Santana-Penate confirmed -- he took over his lease when he left his commissioner job. To be clear, car allowances for elected officials aren't unusual in South Florida. Some government entities provide elected officials with a specified car allowance -- like in Broward County and the City of Miami Beach -- while others provide a more general allowance that can be used toward a car. Our ruling Let's revisit the claim in the ad from the group attacking Gimenez. "Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense. Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense." No one disputes that Alvarez and Gimenez both drove luxury cars paid for by taxpayers. But the ad omits several key facts: • Taxpayer-funded car deals for elected officials are common. The perk was available to all the Miami-Dade county commissioners. Even Gimenez's opponent Robaina was given cars by the city to drive while he was mayor of Hialeah. While the cars driven by Robaina, a Chevy Tahoe and a Chevy Suburban aren't "fancy European" cars, they are nice cars. • Alvarez and Gimenez did not have identical car deals. Alvarez went shopping for a BMW on the county dime even though he already had access to two Chevys and two police officers to drive him. When Gimenez left the county he said he took over the lease -- unlike Alvarez who left the county on the hook. • Comparing the car allowances of Gimenez and Alvarez without looking at other pieces of their compensation package provides an incomplete picture of two different jobs. Alvarez earned about 39 times more than Gimenez in salary -- though to be fair Alvarez likely logged many more hours. It's true that both Alvarez and Gimenez used their county-paid car allowances to drive luxury cars -- either one could have refused the benefit or not used it in full. But the Truth-O-Meter isn't about merely evaluating whether a statement is technically true -- context and telling the full story matters. This ad fails to do that. We rate the claim Half True.

"You have to compare apples to apples." It’s been well-publicized that Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining law increased state employees’ health care costs. And Milwaukee -- while not under Act 10’s health care mandates -- got its workers to pick up a greater share of such costs in the wake of the law. But are county workers paying "much more" than state and city employees? It’s an interesting question, given the prominence of the health care issue in the 2012 county budget tussle between the County Board and County Executive Chris Abele, who again had sought larger cost-sharing from employees. First, a few words of caution. While there are credible ways to compare health insurance plans, it’s a complicated exercise because costs can vary significantly depending on employees’ health and the intricacies of each plan’s design. For simplicity’s sake, our analysis is based on insurance costs for current employees, not for retirees. The figures discussed here apply to most, but not all, employees of the three governments. We examined reports that Dimitrijevic says she relied on in making her claim, and spoke with city, county and state officials about their health plan offerings for 2013. We’ll start with two key measures: Plan design State employees have no annual deductible, receive 90 percent co-insurance and have comparatively low limits on yearly out-of-pocket costs (ranging from $500 for single coverage to $1,000 for families). That gives them a clear advantage over city and county workers. Most City of Milwaukee workers chose a plan with deductibles of $500 to $1,000 and out-of-pocket caps of $1,000 per person/$2,000 family. The co-insurance picks up 90 percent. The city plan does not charge co-pays for office visits. County workers face the highest deductibles ($800-$1,850) and by far the highest out-of-pocket limits ($2,500 per person to $5,000 per family). Office and prescription co-pays do not count toward that maximum. Their co-insurance pays less than at the city and state -- 80 percent. But for 2013, the County Board, over Abele’s objection, funded a county contribution to employees to reimburse them for eligible health care expenditures such as co-pays, deductibles, co-insurance, dental care, or vision care. The county contribution to these "flexible spending accounts" ranges from $600 for a single employee to $1,800 for a family. So that can offset most of an employee’s costs up to the deductible. And county officials say it brings those county employees who use very little health care into rough parity with city employees. Still, county workers face higher out-of-pocket payments than city workers if their medical costs mount. And the difference could amount to several hundred dollars, or a couple thousand dollars in a bad health year, so it’s significant. It’s not clear how many people fall into the higher-use group, though after 10 months of 2012 about 35 percent had met their deductible. That includes retirees, but the figure for active workers would be comparable, said the county’s benefits administrator, Matthew Hanchek. Monthly Premiums County workers pay the highest premiums, and they can’t use that county contribution towards them. City employees are on the low end with premiums ranging from $54 monthly to $173 in the most popular plan. Most state workers will pay $85 to $211. By contrast, county workers will pay $100 to $225 a month, putting another gap between them and the rest. Let’s try to tally it up: It’s clear that state employees have the lowest costs. That leaves county vs. city. We asked the county’s Hanchek about the city vs. county comparison. He said the flexible spending contribution brings the county plan close to parity with the city’s when you consider all active members. There’s some support for that by another measure: the collective employee share of their employer’s total health care bill. At the county, that figure is a projected 23 percent to 27 percent for 2013, depending on which measure from several county sources you prefer. The city is in the 23 percent to 25 percent range, said Michael Brady, city employee benefits director. To the extent those figures are apples-to-apples, they suggest there isn’t much difference between the plans as a whole. Benefits officials caution that these aggregate figures don’t necessarily reflect a typical employee’s experience. Hanchek did note that the city’s premium costs are a bit lower than the county’s, which he attributed mainly to demographic factors. County Comptroller Scott Manske looked at the situation a different way and drew this conclusion: At higher usage levels, county workers likely face much higher out-of-pocket costs, compared with city workers. At average usage levels, it’s a wash or the county worker could pay a little more, he said. We’ll give the final word to Richard Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48, the labor organization that represents many city and county employees. Both employee groups have been asked to pay more for health benefits in recent years, Abelson said. The bottom line, in Abelson’s view, is that city workers pay a little bit less than their county counterparts, even when the county’s flexible spending account is considered. One final note. We found that city workers earn $50,476 on average, slightly more than state ($49,534) and county workers ($50,188), so at least in a rough sense city employees may have a bit more ability to pay. Our rating Dimitrijevic said Milwaukee County government employees are paying "much more" for health insurance than their counterparts at the City of Milwaukee and in state government. There’s mixed evidence, but we think a fair reading of the numbers is that some county employees will pay more. The precise number is hard to judge. And those people could pay out "much more" if you think hundreds of dollars a year or more is a big deal. But there’s an important detail here that undercuts Dimitrijevic’s claim: the county’s contribution to workers’ flexible spending accounts. Because of that, some city and county employees ultimately may pay similar amounts when you factor in that taxpayer-funded contribution. We rate Dimitrijevic’s statement Half True.

pomt-12414	California Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed "diverting 30 percent of the funding" from the state’s gas tax increase "to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/may/19/melissa-melendez/jerry-brown-proposing-divert-30-percent-new-gas-ta/	Drivers in California will start paying a higher gas tax this fall, as part of a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown to raise money for the state’s deteriorating roads and bridges. But when that tax hike kicks in, how much revenue will go to road projects? Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez claimed in a press release and on Twitter on May 11, 2017 that a large chunk will be siphoned off for anything but roads. "Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects," she said in the press release. "In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. That’s money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion." The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Brown in April 2017. In common speech, some politicians simply call this "the gas tax." It includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase that starts in November; a diesel tax hike; and a new "transportation improvement fee" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote about how this new tax will affect the state's already high gas tax rate here and gas prices here. It passed the Legislature with the help of Democrats and one Republican state senator. Melendez, who represents Riverside County, strongly opposed it. There’s no doubt roads are the main focus of the funding package. The measure was even called The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. We decided to examine two key parts of Melendez’s claim: Did Brown’s budget ‘divert’ 30 percent of the transportation funding? And was this money being siphoned off for ‘non-road’ related projects? We buckled up for a fact check. Our research Melendez’s spokesman Sam Spencer showed us a chart in the governor’s revised May budget that he said backs up the claim. It shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year on various programs. Local streets and roads would get $445 million; bridges and culverts would receive $400 million and congested corridors would get $250 million. Spencer highlighted other categories he said "are clearly not programs intended to fix our crumbling roads." Those, Spencer said, include rail, transit, active transportation such as bikeways and pedestrian paths, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research and workforce development programs. Brown’s budget calls for spending $818.7 million on those. That’s about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package. It just about matches Melendez’s claim that 30 percent of the new revenue is being set aside for what appear to be non-road projects. Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's office said this chart from the governor's May budget backs up the claim. Response from Brown Administration We asked the governor’s staff about Melendez’s claim and about the categories that seem to have little to do with roads. Malcolm Dougherty, director of the California Department of Transportation, took issue with Melendez’s characterization that the budget "diverts" any money from its intended purpose. "The dollars are being used exactly the way SB 1 presented them," Dougherty said, referring to the number of the Senate transportation funding bill that was signed into law. "The funding package was always intended to include transit and rail." Transit, rail and active transportation programs represent about one-quarter of the proposed new spending. Paul Golaszewski, who researches transportation funding at the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst’s Office, agreed the governor’s budget "adheres to SB1." He also noted that in future years, the share of money devoted purely to road projects, increases under the state’s funding plans. Why parks and job training? But that still leaves the question of why parks, universities, workforce and farm programs are getting any gas tax money. And whether those categories have anything to do with road projects. Dougherty, the Caltrans director, said that before SB1 was signed, existing laws required some gas tax revenue go to state parks and food and agriculture programs. Parks collect a portion of the tax on gasoline sales for off-road vehicles using the parks. Likewise, Dougherty said, food and agriculture programs get a slice of gas tax revenue when farmers purchase fuel for their vehicles, also under an existing law. Both laws remain in place after SB1. Dougherty added that the revenue for the parks and workforce training, the two categories cited by Melendez in her statement, represent less than 3 percent of the transportation revenue. The University of California and California State University systems will get a combined $7 million of the new revenue for what Dougherty called "transportation related research." Finally, he said, the state’s workforce development board will get $5 million to prepare workers for jobs created by the transportation spending. Melendez’s spokesman pointed to a state workforce board budget document that proposes using that money for "pre-apprenticeship training programs, focused on formerly incarcerated, women and minorities." SB 1 calls for the workforce board to create those programs. It also authorized the money for the universities. Our ruling California state Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget is "diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons." There’s some truth to her claim: The governor’s May budget shows about 30 percent of the revenue from this transportation measure goes to categories that won’t directly improve roads for cars and trucks, as dictated by the law Brown signed in April. Most of that 30 percent goes to bicycle, transit and rail projects. Melendez, however, cherry-picked two programs -- parks and workforce training -- that represent less than 3 percent of the overall funding. Melendez’s statement also ignores the fact that roads will see an increased share of the overall funding in future years. Additionally, it’s misleading and simply not accurate for Melendez to say this money is being ‘diverted’ when Brown’s budget proposes to spend the money exactly as outlined in the bill he signed and the Legislature passed a month earlier. There should be no surprise, at this point, that the measure required funding for transit programs, railways and bicycle and pedestrian paths. The smaller spending on parks, universities and workforce development may raise eyebrows, but was also authorized by SB 1. Melendez’s overall statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-02326	"I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/mar/27/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-he-was-most-bipartisan-senator/	Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown began his fledgling campaign the same way he ended his last one: touting his bipartisan credentials. Brown, who served three years in the Senate before being ousted by Massachusetts voters in 2012, formed an exploratory committee in March 2014 to consider a run against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Brown embarked on a listening tour soon after, and during a visit to Portsmouth, a familiar claim of bipartisanship resurfaced. "I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate," Brown said, according to a report published in The Portsmouth Herald. "I voted 50-50. So I worked with everybody. And here's the problem, I was the most bipartisan senator." Brown made the exact same claim during a visit to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Nashua on April 4, 2013, where he added, "That’s, I think, what people want." But does Brown really have the strongest record of bipartisanship? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to look into the question. Bipartisanship can be measured a number of ways, according to political analysts and researchers alike. Endorsements, group memberships and bill sponsorships can be telling about a lawmakers’ willingness to reach across the aisle. But measurements of party unity or opposition votes – that is, the rate at which a lawmaker sides with or against members of his or her own party – is the gold standard measure of bipartisanship, experts said. So, for the purposes of this check, we’ll stick to that. Brown pointed to four sources, including a "Best and Worst" list from Washington Magazine labelling him as the "Least Partisan" senator of 2012. Brown also cited research from Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, which he said deemed him the country’s second most bipartisan senator in 2011. Each year, Congressional Quarterly prints a report detailing senators’ party unity and opposition votes, defined as votes cast either with or against a majority from their party. According to the data, Brown, who took office in February 2010, sided with a Democratic majority on 22 percent of votes in his first year, ranking him seventh among all senators. The next year, he voted with Democrats 46 percent of the time, trailing only Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. In 2012, he rose to the top of the list, siding with a Democratic majority close to 62 percent of the time, according to the annual report, which was printed in the January 21, 2013 issue of CQ Weekly. In recent years, Congressional Quarterly has been joined by other media vote-counters. As part of their Congress Votes Database, Washington Post researchers track votes using a similar methodology, looking at votes in which a majority of senators took a side on an issue. The numbers differed slightly, but the Post researchers came to a similar conclusion after analyzing Brown’s voting records. Over his final two years in the Senate, Brown’s cooperation with Democrats increased. He and Collins were in a virtual dead-heat, differing with the Republican party more frequently than other Senators in 2011 and 2012, according to the Washington Post list. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Government, a subsidiary of the media service that focuses on government information, studied unity votes as well, excluding some types of votes such as nominations and treaty votes. This research, covering Brown’s final two years in office, showed he voted with a Democratic majority 53 percent of the time. Several media outlets reported this figure as being second highest in the country, trailing only Collins. Collins and Olympia Snowe, another Maine Republican who retired in 2012, are widely considered two of the nation’s most bipartisan senators. Ryan Kelly, a senior researcher at Congressional Quarterly, cautioned that in certain cases, party unity votes don’t necessarily reflect true bipartisan cooperation. But he said that for Brown, Collins and Snowe, the votes do signal bipartisan cooperation. "Sens. Collins, Brown and Snowe -- they’re not extremists or anything. They probably broke to the side of their Democratic colleagues more often than people in the House, like the tea partiers," he said. Brown "was more bipartisan than most of his colleagues," agreed Patrick Griffin, a professor of government at American University in Washington, D.C. "It may have been a function of the state he represented and probably anticipating what kind of race he might have (for re-election in Massachusetts in 2012). But there’s no doubt he showed a willingness to reach across the aisle." Our ruling Judging by votes alone, Brown was not always the most bipartisan senator during his time in office, but he was No. 1 for a time, and was close for the rest of the time. We rate Brown’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Brown	None	None	None	2014-03-27T11:31:28	2014-03-18	['United_States_Senate']

pomt-09717	A new federal program provides subsidized "Obama phones" with 70 free minutes of cell phone service every month.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/28/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-handing-out-free-cell-ph/	A reader recently sent us a chain e-mail about a cell phone deal. "Receive (1) a FREE new phone and (2) approx 70 minutes of FREE minutes every month," the e-mail said. The catch? They're only available to welfare recipients. "I had a former employee call me earlier today inquiring about a job, and at the end of the conversation he gave me his phone number," the e-mail said. "I asked the former employee if this was a new cell phone number and he told me yes this was his 'Obama phone'... TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES." The chain e-mail — we've received copies from several readers — calls them "Obama phones," which suggests the program is new. It says the cell phone program threatens "the very foundations that this country was built on," and "the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work." A federal program offering 70 minutes a month sounded unusual to us, so we decided to look into it. The e-mail included a link to the TracPhone Web site, a prepaid cell phone company, and its SafeLink Wireless program to help low-income people get cellular coverage. Depending on where participants live, free phones and free minutes are available; participants in Washington, D.C., for example, can get 55 free minutes per month, while consumers in Florida can get 68 free minutes a month. AT&T and Verizon provide similar services. All those perks are the result of Federal Communications Commission programs to help low-income people get phone service. Specifically, Lifeline, which TracPhone participates in, provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, and Link-Up America helps those who qualify get telephone service by paying one-half of the startup fee, according to the FCC Web site. Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. We spoke with Rosemary Kimball, an FCC spokeswoman, to get more details. She said consumers can qualify for a cell phone plan if they don't have access to a land-line. Though the exact details of the benefit vary from state to state, cell phone providers typically provide low-income consumers with some form of a monthly discount, whether it be free minutes or a reduced rate, she said. And here's a key detail: The program is more than decade old. Kimball said it comes from the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 to require low-income assistance. The law required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on our phone bills (we checked our bill and found we kicked in $2.80 last month) and redistributed to the low-income service programs as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools. And the LifeLine program has been around even longer — since 1985. It's a matter of opinion whether this program threatens the very foundations this country was built on. But the e-mail is correct that tax dollars are being used to support the cell phone program. Still, it mischaracterizes the program by making it seem as if it was created by the Obama administration. In fact, Lifeline and Link-Up have been around for nearly 14 years. These are not "Obama phones." (Maybe we should call them "Clinton phones.") So we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14099	Says Arizona, Missouri and Texas residents have a two-pet limit, so the public must "surrender their third pet to the Humane Society."	pants on fire!	/arizona/statements/2016/may/13/blog-posting/popular-internet-story-claims-arizona-missouri-and/	Do not fret, the pug or feline in your life won’t be given to the Humane Society. A popular May 6 story from a website called "Associated Media Coverage" claims that Arizona, Missouri and Texas recently passed two-pet limit laws. "According to state representatives, pet owners within Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are expected to be in compliance with the new ordinance by September 2016. All pet owners are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2-pet maximum’ to their local Humane Society shelter by the compliance date of September 3rd 2016," the story reads. We reached out to Associated Media Coverage and did not hear back. Nonetheless, experts quickly dismissed this claim. Not a ‘hare’ of truth "This is, in fact, a hoax, and The Humane Society of the United States would never support such an ordinance," Humane Society spokeswoman Cheylin Parker said. Locally, we also reached out to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s office. "This couldn’t be further from the truth," said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Ducey. "There’s no such law in Arizona, and as a huge animal lover himself, Governor Ducey encourages animal adoption all across our state." Others have debunked this story, too. The Snopes website debunked the claim and noted that the Associated Media Coverage website appears to have been registered in February 2016. Our ruling Associated Media Coverage said, "pet owners within Texas, Arizona and Missouri...are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2-pet maximum’ to their local Humane Society." That’s a ridiculous and unfounded claim.

pomt-00446	"Ashley Moody was a lifelong Democrat." ​	false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/21/frank-white/ashley-moody-republican-candidate-florida-ag-wasnt/	Once a Democrat, always a Democrat? That’s how a Republican candidate for Florida attorney general attacked his primary opponent in an ad weeks before the Aug. 28 primary. Frank White, a member of the Florida House since 2016, is challenging Ashley Moody, who was a Florida circuit court judge for 10 years before she resigned to run for attorney general. "Ashley Moody sued Donald Trump for fraud," said an ad from White, referencing when Moody was a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning Trump’s involvement in the development of the unfinished Trump Tower Tampa. "Now she wants to be our Republican attorney general. How could we ever trust her?" Then the ad goes even further: "Ashley Moody was a lifelong Democrat." That would be an interesting development in a Republican primary, if it were true. But it is not. Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but has been a registered Republican for the last 20. "Lifelong" ≠ 1993 to 1998 Under law, Florida voter registrations are public records and can be released to any person upon request. So we acquired Moody’s records from the supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County, where Moody currently lives, as well as elections supervisors in other counties where she had previously lived. We found that Moody first registered to vote in 1993, when she was 18. At that time, she registered as a Democrat in Hillsborough County. Moody later moved to Alachua County to attend the University of Florida. On Jan. 6, 1998, she updated her voter registration and switched her party affiliation to Republican. Moody then moved back to Hillsborough County and registered again to vote there in 2002. She then switched her registration so that she was registered in Duval County on June 30, 2004, said Katrell McKenzie of the Duval County Supervisor of Elections Office. In June 2006, Moody switched to being registered in Hillsborough County once more. She has been registered as a Republican in Hillsborough since 2006. So Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but for the last 20 years, she’s been a registered Republican. Asked how this qualifies Moody as a "lifelong Democrat," a spokeswoman for Frank’s campaign gave an interesting response. Erin Isaac pointed out that "the ad does not say she IS a lifelong Dem." "Ashley Moody WAS a lifelong Democrat. Moody first registered as a Democrat and maintained that registration continually before reregistering, by continuing to act like a liberal. So she was a lifelong Democrat before she switched and continued liberal actions," Isaac explained. But most viewers of the ad aren’t paying attention to the small detail of whether White decided to call Moody a "lifelong Democrat" in the past or present tense. The Moody campaign website points out that Moody is not the only Republican politician to have started out by registering as a Democrat. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who has endorsed Moody in the race) were all previously registered Democrats. (Pence, regarded as a stalwart Republican who hosted a conservative talk radio show, was a youth coordinator for his county’s Democratic Party.) Our ruling White claimed Moody "was a lifelong Democrat." Voter registration records show Moody did register as a Democrat in 1993, when she was 18. But she switched her party affiliation in 1998 to Republican, and has remained registered as a Republican ever since then. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14739	The 9/11 terrorists' friends, family, girlfriends in the United States "were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home, and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/donald-trump/trump-repeats-flights-home-911-hijackers-wives-gir/	In the confrontation with ISIS, Donald Trump has staked out perhaps the hardest of the hard lines among the Republican presidential field. He has called for blocking virtually all non-American Muslims from entering the country. He said America should "take out" the families of terrorists. During the Republican debate in Las Vegas on CNN, the moderator used a question from the public to press Trump on this policy. "How would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?" asked Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Trump did not repeat his call to "take out" family members but insisted the country has to be much tougher on family members because of what they know. "When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia," Trump said. "They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television." We reached out to the Trump campaign about the 9/11 terrorists’ close friends and family members leaving before the attacks and did not hear back. Trump has said this before, sometimes saying specifically that they were sent home a few days before the attack. He told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly "They take the wives, they put ‘em on planes, they send ‘em home. ‘Let’s go home and let’s watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center.' " In North Carolina, Trump told his supporters "the people, the animals that did that, they sent their wives and their families back to Saudi Arabia. Most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. Those wives knew what their husbands were going to do." The statement lacks any support. The 9/11 hijackers Trump needs two pieces to back up his statement. First, at least some of the hijackers needed to be married or have a girlfriend, and second, those people, or some family member, needed to be in the United States. According to the 9/11 Commission report, not a single hijacker had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the country in the days and months before the terrorists executed their plan. Only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend. Ziad Jarrah had a girlfriend in Germany, and hijackers Marwan al-Shehhi and Abdul Aziz al-Omari were married. Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told us that while the commision didn't learn the exact whereabouts of the wives, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen or elsewhere in the Middle East, one thing is certain. "They sure weren’t living in the United States," Zelikow said. If no one was in America, there could be no flying home to "watch their boyfriends on television." The commission found no evidence that any of these women knew about the plot in advance. The commission reported that most of the terrorists had "broken off regular contact with their families." The one clear exception was Jarrah, who traveled to Lebanon to see his father and vacationed with his girlfriend in Florida about eight months before the attack. Jarrah called her in Germany shortly before he boarded United Airlines flight 93, the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Jarrah’s girlfriend was extensively interviewed by investigators who concluded she knew nothing. To be complete, we turn to one episode that could be linked to Trump’s statement. Bin Laden family members Trump’s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden’s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack. Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is one of 52 children of a man who built enormous wealth building roads and palaces. That gave him a large extended and affluent family. The 9/11 Commission report said that the FBI dug into the backgrounds of every Saudi national who flew home soon after the attacks. "They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion," the report said. "Our own independent review of the Saudi national involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights." Our ruling Trump said that people close to the 9/11 hijackers -- friends, wives and girlfriends -- had knowledge of the pending attacks and were flown back to the Middle East so that they could "watch their boyfriends on television." Trump provided no evidence. The 9/11 Commission investigation found that 13 of the 19 attackers were unmarried. Only two had wives, a third had a girlfriend, and none of those women were in the United States immediately before the attack. The commission further found evidence that the hijackers had cut ties with their families. There is no substance behind the statement. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13706	"The Koch network (is) spending more money (in a Senate race) in Ohio than anywhere else in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/28/sherrod-brown/are-koch-backed-groups-spending-most-ohio-senate-r/	Voters in Ohio are enduring a deluge of fundraising emails from political groups ahead of the November election, like one from Friends of Sherrod Brown. The senator, in the middle of his second term, is hoping to garner support for fellow Democrat Ted Strickland. "Outside special interests like to spend money in Ohio," Brown’s email said. "Back in 2012, they spent $40 million trying to buy my seat in the Senate. … Right now, the special interests are up to $30 million spent against Ted -- with the Koch network spending more money in Ohio than anywhere else in the country." Strickland, the former Ohio governor, is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman in one of the tightest races in the country. The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, of Koch Industries, are tied as the sixth-richest people in the world, each worth an estimated $42 billion. As political and policy influencers advancing a free-market agenda, their network includes the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity and the super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund The Kochs can usually be counted on to fund conservative causes, but they have recoiled from the 2016 presidential race. Is down-ballot spending in Ohio the Koch’s biggest imprint so far in the 2016 elections? We turned first to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for its tallies of outside contributions. The Koch brothers, through their political action network, have spent approximately $8 million in the senate race in Ohio, with almost $2 million from Americans for Prosperity and a little over $6 million from Freedom Partners Action Fund. That is more than the Koch-backed groups have spent in any other race in the country, according to OpenSecrets records. The Koch network’s next-largest spending, by comparison, is in North Carolina, where Americans for Prosperity has spent a mere $200,000 against Rep. Renee Ellmers, and in Pennsylvania, where Freedom Partners Action Fund has spent almost $3 million in opposition to Katie McGinty. In opposition spending by Freedom Partners, Strickland has "taken the most punishment" in 2016 to date, the Center for Responsive Politics reported. So the Koch network is contributing substantially to help Portman keep his seat. But where did Brown get the "$30 million spent against Ted"? Here are the numbers for outside spending contributions in the Ohio senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org: If you add the total outside spending for Portman, and the spending against Strickland, you get $19,232,784. (We’re leaving out the primary race spending for the other Democratic candidate, P.G. Sittenfeld, who Strickland beat -- that’s the difference between our total and the $19,990,270 above.) Where does the other $10 million come from? Strickland spokesman David Bergstein told PolitiFact Ohio that, in tracking money spent against the candidate, the campaign monitors announcements of advertising purchases, some of which come from 501(c)(4) organizations that don’t have to report to the Federal Election Commission. Those dollars, therefore, don’t appear on sites like OpenSecrets.org. Counting announcements of spending from these nonprofits, the conservative estimate is closer to $30 million, the campaign said. Bergstein provided a spreadsheet confirming that figure. Strickland’s campaign isn’t suffering from a lack of outside spending as much as Brown’s email might suggest. Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC dedicated to putting Democrats in Senate seats, has spent $8.4 million against Portman and $1.8 million for Strickland. We shared our analysis with Freedom Partners Action PAC, and the group did not dispute our findings. Our ruling A fundraising email in support of Strickland said that the billionaire-backed Koch network has devoted the most money to oppose the Ohio senate candidate than in any other race in the country. Americans for Prosperity and the Freedom Partners Action Fund have spent about $8 million to oppose Strickland, which is more than they’ve dropped in any other race this election season to date. Strickland’s campaign, while hardly immune to special interests, is the Koch network’s biggest target in an election year that has seen conservative benefactors steer clear of the main ticket.

pomt-13966	"Only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/jun/14/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-right-about-how-many-murder-get-solved-st-/	Missouri gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway -- eager to showcase her law enforcement chops and touch on the trust issues of police simmering in the wake of Ferguson -- presented what she called a shocking statistic at a recent GOP governor’s debate. Hanaway, who was the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Missouri from 2005 to 2009, discussed restoring trust between police and the communities and addressed crime during a governor’s debate June 6. "I was shocked when I became U.S. attorney to learn that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved," Hanaway said. Is that true? Hanaway’s policy director, Will Scharf, told us that Hanaway was speaking from "personal recollection." But FBI Uniformed Crime Report data largely supports Hanaway’s claim. We sorted the data using the Murder Accountability Project, which mines the FBI data. The most recent data is from 2014. There were 1,470 homicides reported in St. Louis from 2004-14. Of those, 795 were "cleared." A cleared offense occurs when at least one person is "arrested, charged with commission the arrest, and turned over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or police notice)," according to the FBI’s website. All three of those requirements must be met for an offense to be considered cleared. Basically, a little over 54 percent of homicides were "cleared" in St. Louis between 2004 and 2014. That’s in line with what Hanaway said. We'll note two caveats. First, there is a technical difference between homicide and murder. James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University said that murder is more restrictive term, and homicide includes any killing of a person, even an execution by the state. With murder, there is intent to cause bodily harm, however he said the terms are used interchangeably. Taking this into account, the number Hanaway is touting may be a little different from the data, but David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said using the word murder in place of homicide is "completely mainstream." "These terms are used so interchangeably that often the formal authorities don’t even make the distinction." Kennedy said. Second, Kennedy also said the rate of unsolved criminal homicides is "shockingly high" in many cities, so the situation in St. Louis is not all that unique. Our ruling Hanaway said "only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved." That’s basically accurate looking at FBI data from 2004-14. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac	None	Catherine Hanaway	None	None	None	2016-06-14T16:05:57	2016-06-06	['St._Louis']
pomt-09287	Links jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff to Rep. C.W. Bill Young.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/apr/26/charlie-justice/bill-young-jack-abramoff-charlie-justice/	In a new web ad, state Sen. Charlie Justice comes armed with ominous music and some sloppy Photoshop work to link opponent Rep. Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. But does Justice, who is seeking to unseat the 20-term Pinellas County Republican, have any facts? The ad describes "Abramoff, Inc." versus "Young, Inc.," and spends two minutes drawing parallels between Young and the disgraced lobbyist now serving almost six years in prison on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and conspiracy to corrupt public officials. The video uses Abramoff's famous fedora as a metaphor for the ties between the two men. A copy of the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. Words on the screen says that Abramoff "used his money for, among other things, luxury cars." The hat lands on Young as the screen says, "Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car" appears shortly thereafter. The ad says Abramoff was convicted of defrauding clients of "tens of millions of dollars," while Young "just this year" put earmarks in the federal budget totaling $128 million. Separately, we've rated two of the ad's claims -- about Young's use of a luxury car, and whether he accepted $737,000 "from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks." In this item we wanted to zero in on the linkage between Young and Abramoff. Several other lawmakers, including former U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney of Florida, got tangled in the Abramoff scandal in one way or another. But there's never been a solid link to Young that we were aware of. We checked Nexis, a pay service that aggregates news articles from across the country, and found a few stories from 2006 did mention the two together -- all centering around $1,000 Young received in 2002 from an Abramoff client, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. But there is nothing to directly links Abramoff and Young. Indeed, Think Progress, a website run by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund has a section on Abramoff's links to Congress. Many members were mentioned, including Alaska Rep. Don Young (no relation), but Florida's C.W. Bill Young isn't discussed at all. We also checked Abramoff's federal charging document. Young isn't mentioned. The document does refer to an anonymous "Representative #1" but that turned out to be former Ohio Congressman Bob Ney, who resigned from office and pleaded guilty to corruption charges as part of the Abramoff imbroglio. "Mr. Young never met him," Young spokesman Harry Glenn told PolitiFact Florida. "He wouldn't be able to pick him out if the two passed on the sidewalk. To try to link them is ridiculous." We find that Justice's claim about Abramoff is an attempt at sleight of hand. The ad doesn't say Abramoff bought Young the car, but with its ominous music and flying hat, it suggests a connection when there isn't one. The only connection is a tenuous one, that one of Abramoff's clients contributed $1,000 to Young in 2002. There's no evidence that Abramoff himself contributed to Young, nor that Young ever sought earmarks for Abramoff, nor that they even actually met. That's not enough to hang a hat -- or a fedora -- on. Pants on Fire!	None	Charlie Justice	None	None	None	2010-04-26T18:42:45	2010-04-14	['Jack_Abramoff']
pomt-14973	"Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/18/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-gop-leadership-took-lead-confirming-/	Since his election to the U.S. Senate in 2012, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has been a thorn in the side of fellow Republicans in the chamber for his no-compromise positions on key votes. On the Oct. 18, 2015, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Cruz, who's running for president, defended his approach to host Chuck Todd. "What the Republican majorities have done -- we came back right after the last election, passed a trillion-dollar ‘cromnibus’ bill filled with corporate welfare," he said. "Republican leadership joined with (Senate Democratic leader) Harry Reid and the Democrats to do that. Then (the Republican) leadership voted to fund Obamacare. Then they voted to fund amnesty. Then they voted to fund Planned Parenthood. And then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general. Now Chuck, which one of those decisions is one iota different than what would happened under Harry Reid and the Democrats? ... They've passed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could." We decided to take a closer look at one of the claims Cruz made -- that the "Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general." Lynch -- the designated successor to President Barack Obama’s first attorney general, Eric Holder -- was confirmed by the Senate on a 56-43 vote on April 23, 2015. Before she was elevated to the post, Cruz made his opposition clear, urging his colleagues to block her confirmation unless Obama reversed his decision to defer deportation for certain undocumented immigrants, an executive action Obama had implemented over the criticism of many Republicans in Congress. Cruz’s main point, which he made to the media at the time, was that the Republican leadership was supporting Lynch’s nomination by simply putting the confirmation vote on the calendar -- which was its responsibility given that the GOP had won back control of the chamber during the 2014 midterm elections. Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, said that because Republicans controlled the Senate during Loretta Lynch's confirmation hearings, GOP leaders had the power to stop her from becoming attorney general but did not do so. He pointed to a Politico op-ed during the confirmation fight in which Cruz wrote, "Senate Republicans have the power to stop this nomination. And we have a choice. We can honor our oaths to the Constitution—we can defend liberty and the rule of law—or we can confirm an attorney general who has candidly admitted she will impose no limits on the President whatsoever." What Cruz left out is that because of the efforts of GOP leaders Lynch’s path to confirmation was, by the standards of recent attorney general nominees, long and torturous. As Lynch was waiting to be confirmed, Democrats complained that the GOP majority was letting her nomination lag for a historically long time. When Obama, a few days before Lynch was finally confirmed, said that her nomination had been "sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined," we rated that Mostly True. From Nov. 13, when Lynch was first nominated, until her confirmation, she saw her appointment stuck in limbo for 161 days. By comparison, the longest confirmation wait for an attorney general nominee going back to Ronald Reagan’s presidency was 30 days. The shortest was just three days. While some members of the Senate Republican Conference, including Cruz, expressed concern about Lynch’s policy views, the direct reason for Lynch’s delay was that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insisted on passing a pending human-trafficking bill before taking up Lynch’s nomination. On the whole, the anti-trafficking bill was uncontroversial, but it had become a bone of contention between the parties due to a battle over some of its language about abortion. After weeks of stalemate, senators reached a compromise on the abortion issue and, on April 22, passed the measure by a 99-0 vote. That cleared the way for the chamber to take up Lynch’s nomination. After senators passed a procedural vote by a 66-34 margin, they took up the nomination itself and it passed, 56-43. Ten Republican senators voted in favor of Lynch’s confirmation -- Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Ililnois, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- and McConnell. Senate experts said this chain of events falls well short of GOP leaders "taking the lead" to confirm Lynch. "McConnell acted like a conservative leader of a fairly conservative party in the Senate, getting as much as he could before grudgingly allowing the nomination to go forward," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist and longtime Senate observer. Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and a Senate specialist, agreed that Cruz’s claim is problematic. "It was Democrats who demanded action on the the Lynch nomination, not McConnell," Smith said. "McConnell removed obstacles to the consideration of the nomination, but that is far from taking the lead or championing the effort to confirm Lynch." A postscript: After voting against proceeding to the nomination in the preliminary vote, Cruz became the only senator who wasn’t present for the official confirmation, reportedly because he was traveling back to Texas for a fundraiser for his presidential campaign. "The cloture vote was the vote that mattered, I voted ‘no,’ and she was confirmed because Republican leadership chose to confirm her," Cruz told reporters at the time. "I disagree with that decision." Our ruling Cruz said the Senate’s "Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general." As the leadership of the majority party in the Senate, McConnell and his lieutenants had the obligation of having the chamber hold a vote on Lynch’s nomination, and McConnell, along with several other Republicans, did personally vote for Lynch’s confirmation. However, Cruz’s claim glosses over the fact that Democrats were the driving force in pushing for a confirmation vote, and that McConnell delayed the nomination for longer than any similar nominee in recent history. This contrasts sharply with the impression Cruz leaves -- that GOP leaders were gung-ho about getting Lynch into office expeditiously. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. UPDATE, Oct. 19, 2015: After we published this story, Cruz’s staff responded to our inquiry. Their comments have been incorporated into the article.

pomt-11463	"Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/07/donald-trump/are-democrats-nowhere-be-found-daca-donald-trump-c/	A deadline imposed by President Donald Trump for a legislative solution for so-called Dreamers has come and gone, yielding no solution. Trump blames Democrats, saying they have been absent from and uninterested in a deal. "It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA," Trump tweeted March 5. "Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Trump administration in September began phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That’s the Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who arrived when they were children, often called Dreamers. On March 5, a federal judge in Maryland said the Trump administration had the authority to rescind DACA. In a separate case, a federal judge in California in January ordered the administration to resume accepting DACA renewal applications and to keep the program on the same terms and conditions in effect, pending a final court judgment. The question in this fact-check is have Democrats been on the sidelines, as Trump claimed? We found Trump’s tweet ignores Democratic and bipartisan efforts to find a solution. And it also downplays the president’s own posturing that has impeded a deal. The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to our queries. Efforts to advance legislation for Dreamers Meetings with Trump: Trump and several lawmakers, including Democrats, met Jan. 9 to discuss a permanent law to benefit Dreamers, funding for the border wall and additional changes to the country’s legal immigration system. In the televised meeting, Trump expressed a willingness to work with Democrats and even to help the broader population of millions of immigrants in the country illegally. "What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure?" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Trump, since there is broad support for DACA but not for other immigration measures. "I would like to do that. Go ahead. I think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first," Trump said. Republican lawmakers, however, rejected that idea, saying border security had to be part of the deal and not come at a later date. Toward the end of the meeting, Trump said he’d rely on the people at the meeting and approve their future proposal. "I have a lot of respect for the people on both sides. What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with," Trump said. "I have great confidence in the people. If they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it because I respect them." Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and other Republican lawmakers met again with Trump on Jan. 11 to continue DACA talks. But negotiations took a step back after reports that Trump used disparaging language to describe some countries. Durbin told reporters that Trump "said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist." Trump tweeted that Durbin "totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting" and that "Durbin blew DACA." Legislative attempts: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Feb. 28 sent a letter to Trump listing several bipartisan bills they said Trump has rejected. "You have thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief to Dreamers and instead have attempted to force a deeply unpopular, anti-immigrant agenda through Congress," the letter said. "We cannot expect Congress to make any headway on protecting Dreamers until the White House and Republicans, who control every branch of government, choose to work with Democrats on a bipartisan DACA fix." Two Senate bills dealing with Dreamers failed to get 60 votes. Both proposals included Democratic support. One proposal was sponsored by Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the other by Sens. Mike Rounds, R-N.D., and Angus King, I-Maine, (most Democrats voted for it). The Trump administration opposed both proposals. On Jan. 11, a group of six senators — three Republicans and three Democrats — said they had reached a bipartisan agreement on immigration that addressed border security, the diversity visa lottery, "chain migration" and Dreamers. Trump also opposed that deal. "The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime....." Trump tweeted Jan. 12. A proposal from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, supported by Trump, was the least popular of four proposals voted on in mid-February, failing 39-60. Bipartisan groups of House lawmakers have also looked at ways to help Dreamers, including the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act introduced in January and referred to a subcommittee. A tweeting contradiction Despite repeated Twitter claims that Democrats are absent from efforts to help Dreamers, Trump has also acknowledged their involvement. "While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!" Trump tweeted Feb. 15. The next day, he tweeted that it was only Republicans working and that Democrats had abandoned DACA recipients. Democrats willing to discuss border wall Willing to compromise on the wall: A major sticking point in the debates has been Trump’s demand for a border wall in exchange for a DACA deal. Some Democrats, in order to get a DACA deal, said they would discuss the border wall. "The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!" Trump tweeted Dec. 29. On Jan. 23, he tweeted again that "if there is no Wall, there is no DACA." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in January said he had "reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion" in exchange for strong DACA protections, but later rescinded that offer. Also in January, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said that while the border wall was "a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money," he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. Action or politics? January government shutdown: In January, Senate Democrats demanded a solution for the Dreamers in exchange for their votes on a bill that would keep the government running. When the Senate took up a House measure that excluded a deal for Dreamers, many Democrats rejected it. With a failed bill, the government on Jan. 20 entered its first shutdown since 2013. (Democrats received criticism for supporting a previous short-term spending bill in December that did not address Dreamers.) As the January shutdown loomed, Trump bashed Democrats for withholding votes because of DACA. "Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!" Trump tweeted Jan. 12. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s hours-long speech: Pelosi spoke for more than eight hours on the House Floor on Feb. 7, sharing stories about Dreamers and demanding a Republican commitment to vote on an immigration bill. Pelosi’s hours-long speech came as Republicans sought to pass another short-term government funding bill, opposed by Pelosi because it did not include protections for Dreamers. Congress eventually passed a budget deal after a few hours of a government shutdown. "Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!" Trump tweeted on Feb. 9. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA." This fact-check isn't about assigning blame to a political party for the lack of a DACA deal. In reality, both political parties likely bear some responsibility. But Trump underplays and ignores the efforts of Democrats to reach a solution to help Dreamers, including meetings with Trump, bipartisan proposals, and a stated willingness to discuss border wall funding.

The body also known as the state ethics commission was rocked when commission executive secretary Stacey Kalberman, and her deputy, Sherilyn Streicker, announced in June their departures from the agency. The reasons behind their exits were tied up with the drama over a politically charged investigation into the election campaign of Gov. Nathan Deal. Kalberman claimed orders to eliminate Streicker’s position and cut her own $125,000 salary by a third were politically motivated, while commission Chairman Patrick Millsaps and other commission members said cuts to the commission’s budget meant it could no longer afford the executives’ salaries. The salary talks came as Kalberman was preparing to serve subpoenas on the governor, his chief of staff and associates for campaign spending documents as part of an ethics investigation. The subpoenas never were served, and the commission has asked Deal’s lawyer to voluntarily turn the papers over. Some have said the General Assembly’s slashing of the commission budget has weakened its ability to investigate irregularities. But when Deal was asked about it in a Q&A in the current edition of Georgia Trend magazine, he said the commission was not cut more than any other part of state government, including his own office. "They took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies," he said. "When you’re making up a $1.4 billion [deficit], we had to continue to cut. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range – same as the governor’s office." Deal is the right man to talk to about the state budget since the General Assembly largely followed his blueprint to craft the $18.3 billion spending plan for the new state fiscal year, which began July 1. Did he get it right? Long story short, the answer is yes. But it turns out that when dealing with the state budget, getting there isn’t half the fun. From the start, Brian Robinson laid the groundwork by saying his boss was speaking off the cuff. "What the governor knew was that he ordered the governor’s office to have as big a cut as any agency," he said. "Obviously, not all agencies or departments got cuts. Education, for example, got more money than before." With help from the state Office of Planning and Budget, we find there is some math to wade through before we get our answer. On July 1, the ethics commission started out with a budget of $1,084,145, compared with last year’s original allocation of $1,131,121. That’s actually a 4.2 percent cut. By comparison, the governor’s office began fiscal 2011 with $6,276,732 and started this year with $5,914,065. That’s a 5.8 percent cut, which would indicate the governor was more than right in that the governor’s office took an even larger percentage cut to its budget than the ethics commission. But inside every agency’s budget is what the budget office refers to as "adjustments." Adjustments are essentially pass-through funds given to pay for things such as health insurance and workers’ compensation and are not considered part of the agency’s operating budget. Take those adjustments out, and using the baseline of the original fiscal 2011 appropriation, the cut to the ethics commission’s new budget is 7.6 percent. And, using the same calculation, the cut to the governor’s office is 7.2 percent. Robinson said the budget numbers reflect a promise kept. "Facing a budget deficit, Gov. Deal led the way he promised Georgians he would. He cut spending," Robinson said. "He set the example by cutting the governor's office budget by 7 percent, as much as any state agency or department." The governor appoints three of the five board members to the ethics commission; the General Assembly appoints the other two. It was up to the commissioners to figure out how to spend their smaller budget. The contemplated cut to Kalberman’s salary and the elimination of Streicker’s position accomplished that. For sake of context, the ethics commission’s budget has been slashed 42 percent since fiscal 2008, but the new governor had no say in it until this year. While this likely does little to settle questions over the staffing changes at the ethics commission, it does verify Deal’s statement to Georgia Trend, which we rate True.

pomt-09990	"Some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/13/john-boehner/boehner-says-some-want-scrap-401ks/	In a press release touting a Republican plan to help restore savings lost in the plummeting stock market, House Republican Leader John Boehner suggests some Democrats want to wipe out 401(k)s in favor of government-run retirement savings program. "Recent polling suggests that Americans’ concerns about their savings even trumps concerns about losing their jobs," Boehner said in a statement on March 24, 2009. "Unfortunately, Washington Democrats have done nothing to address this savings crisis. In fact, Washington is pursuing policies that are causing Americans’ savings to evaporate more quickly, and some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts. That’s unacceptable and not the solution Americans need at a time when they want to rebuild their retirement, college, and personal savings." So who are the "some" advocating such a dramatic overhaul of the American retirement savings system? According to a spokesman for Boehner, he's referring to a professor who spoke before the House Education and Labor Committee on Oct. 7. In a presentation on "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Workers' Retirement Security," Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economic policy at New York's New School for Social Research, said America's "30-year experiment with 401(k) accounts has failed." About half of workers will not have enough in retirement to replace 70 percent of their preretirement income, she said, which is largely caused by a "fundamentally flawed" 401(k) program that has little regulation. She recommended Congress end tax subsidies for 401(k) plans in favor of "guaranteed retirement accounts" into which workers would be required to contribute 5 percent of their pay. The government would guarantee a 3 percent inflation-indexed return. And Uncle Sam would contribute $600 per worker, every year to those accounts. Her idea doesn't have any significant support in Congress that we could find. About the closest to support that we heard was from George Miller, the California Democrat who chairs the committee. He is interested in some kind of major long-term reform to the retirement savings system, but has stopped short of calling for the elimination of the 401(k) system. Two months ago, his committee held a hearing on strengthening worker retirement security. In his opening statement, Miller said "the current economic crisis has exposed deep flaws in our nation's retirement system. For too many Americans, 401(k) plans have become little more than a high-stakes crapshoot," Miller said. Miller did not discuss any specific changes, but over the long term, he said, we "should ask ourselves whether our current system gives workers the ability to ensure a safe and secure retirement." He emphasized the need to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s but also said the Congress must consider additional retirement options. "In the short term, Congress must address ways to improve defined contribution plans," Miller said. "The 401(k) needs to be more transparent, fair, and operated on behalf of the account holder, not Wall Street firms. But, we must also ask the difficult questions about the state of our nation's retirement system as a whole and look to see whether we need to create a new leg of retirement security." The Wall Street Journal blasted Ghilarducci's plan in a Nov. 14, 2008, editorial and criticized Miller for even entertaining her ideas. Conservative blogs also criticized the possibility that 401(k) plans be replaced by a government-run savings plan. Miller fired back, accusing the Wall Street Journal of misrepresenting his efforts and "needlessly creating fear among Americans rightly worried about their retirement security." "I do not support 'abolishing' 401(k)s, moving these plans, or changing their tax status, plain and simple," said Miller. "The truth is that Democrats in Congress are working to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s." Still, Miller's use of the phrase "short term" in February "piqued the curiosity" of Ed Ferrigno, vice president of Washington affairs for the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an association that represents employers that sponsor 401(k) plans. "He (Miller) made it clear that his support of 401(k)s is qualified," Ferrigno said. "I don't know what to read into that. It certainly could create a foundation for a system to overtake 401(k) plans." But there's been no support in Congress or the White House for the kind of wholesale change that Boehner mentioned, according to Ferrigno and our review of legislation and statements. To the contrary, Democrats have spoken of protecting 401(k)s. In a speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to enact rules to "protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k)." Yes, there are "some" in Washington who are tossing around the prospect of moving to a government-run system, and some of them may even want to scrap 401(k)s. But they are not elected officials and not in the Obama administration. Our problem with Boehner's statement is that it seems to suggest the idea has gained traction with Democratic lawmakers and administration officials. Use of the word "some" may provide Boehner some wiggle room here ? he could probably safely say that "some" people in Washington may be advocating darn near anything ? but the context suggests Democrats are behind it. We haven't found any, so Boehner's claim comes off sounding more like a scare tactic. And so we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04574	Says Obama adviser David Plouffe took "large piles of cash" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/25/secure-america-now/super-pac-claims-obama-adviser-took-money-company-/	There’s the guilt-by-association attack ad -- and then there’s the recent TV ad from Secure America Now, a super PAC that ties President Barack Obama to his adviser David Plouffe’s association with a company with ties to Iran. Got that? Over darkened photographs of Obama and Plouffe, a narrator intones: "Barack Obama's most trusted adviser, ‘whose desk is just steps from the Oval Office,’ took 'large piles of cash' from a joint venture partner with Irancell, described by the U.S. Government as ' "fully owned" by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.' He got 'very rich' off 'the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House.' If this is who Obama trusts, can you trust Obama?" We’ll leave the question of trust to you. But we figured we would get to the bottom of the ad’s central claim, whether Plouffe took money from a "joint venture partner" of an Iranian cellular company. ‘Large piles of cash’ Plouffe, who famously managed Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, gave paid speeches around the world before he joined the White House as a senior adviser after the 2010 midterm elections. Secure America Now is the political arm of a similarly named nonprofit that says it supports "policies that will protect our nation against terrorist infiltration, attack, and capitulation to our enemies." It has previously accused Obama of softness on Iran, a nation under U.S. sanctions for supporting terrorism and attempting to develop nuclear weapons. We reached out to the group, but didn’t hear back. But the ad itself cites sources. The text relies heavily on the words of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian columnist who used to write for progressive news site Salon. Greenwald wrote in reaction to an Aug. 5, 2012, Washington Post story. The Post piece detailed how Plouffe’s 2011 financial disclosure showed he had been paid $100,000 by MTN Nigeria. The White House explained to the Post that Plouffe traveled to Lagos, Nigeria, for two speeches in December 2010, just before he joined the Obama administration as a senior adviser. The Nigerian cell phone service provider is part of South African conglomerate MTN Group, which also owns 49 percent of an Iranian subsidiary, MTN Irancell. The South African company offers cell service through subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East. Greenwald argued the scandal of the speaking fees wasn’t that they were "tainted by virtue of a connection to the Evil Persian Regime," something that he found "frivolous and cynical, just part of the ongoing Washington fear-mongering orgy over Iran." Rather, he saw them as an example of utterly typical — though deplorable — Washington influence-peddling. "David Plouffe — who has spent his entire career working in Washington as a political operative — has become a very rich man by converting into large piles of cash the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House and the Democratic Party," he wrote. Sound familiar? We asked Greenwald whether he thought the ad accurately characterized his work. "I think the parts about Plouffe are completely accurate," he said. "I think $100,000 for a couple of short speeches is a ‘large pile of cash’ in anyone's eyes." But he told us he’s not an expert on the MTN Group "or what it and its subsidiaries are doing with Iran." (And, in fact, for that claim the ad relied on a different source.) Greenwald said he relied on the government sources quoted in the Post article. The Post reported that a Treasury undersecretary had told Turkish officials in 2006 that Irancell was "fully owned" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. That wasn’t public knowledge until an infamous release of State Department cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-11. White House response White House spokesman Eric Schultz called the ad "a complete distortion of the facts." He argued, among other things: • Plouffe didn’t directly profit from a "joint venture partner" of an Iranian company, as the ad said, but from its Nigerian subsidiary. • It was misleading to say that the U.S. government described Irancell as "fully owned" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps., because that detail was in an as-yet unreleased State Department cable. Meanwhile, prominent advocacy groups hadn’t directly taken up the issue of MTN Group’s involvement in Iran when Plouffe spoke. That started in 2012. It’s fair to note that the ad makes it sound as though Plouffe was paid by MTN Group, when he in fact spoke for MTN Nigeria. But about the Revolutionary Guard relationship, we wondered: What could Plouffe (or the lawyer he’s said to have consulted) have learned about MTN Nigeria and its parent company in 2010? Plenty, as it turns out. We spent a few minutes with subscription news database Nexis. Searching just for "MTN Group" for articles published before December 2010, we quickly found a description of the company that mentioned Iran in a November 2010 news release: Launched in 1994, the MTN Group is a multinational telecommunications group, operating in 21 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The MTN Group is listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa under the share code: MTN. As of 30 September 2010 , MTN recorded 134.4 million subscribers across its operations in Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, Cyprus, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Republic, Iran, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo (Congo Brazzaville), Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia. With the same search, we turned up a Business Process Management Journal article describing MTN Irancell’s ownership as "comprised of two shareholders who are the Iran Electronic Development Company (IEDC) and MTN International (Mauritius) Limited. IEDC currently has two key shareholders: Iran Electronic Industries, known as SAIRAN and Mostazafan Foundation, known as Bonyad." If Plouffe or his lawyer had run those names through a publicly searchable Treasury database, they would have found that Iran Electronic Industries was under U.S. sanctions for being a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, known for its role in Iran’s missile program. A Treasury news release in 2008 said it offered "a diversified range of military products including electro-optics and lasers, communication equipment, telecommunication security equipment, electronic warfare equipment, new and refurbished radar tubes, and missile launchers." So, an MTN Irancell investor had already been labeled — that’s right — a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The Iran connection in hand, a Google search turned up more, such as this 2008 New York Times article about MTN Group’s challenges with U.S. sanctions as it rapidly expanded its Iranian business. In other words, quick searches turned up red flags aplenty, well in advance of WikiLeaks’ release or advocacy groups’ publicity. We should note these are political, more than legal, red flags — transactions are prohibited between Americans and blocked companies, but Plouffe wouldn’t run afoul of the law taking money from a separate subsidiary of a company with an Iranian connection. But a political issue is precisely what this ad suggests. And even White House press briefings from the summer before Plouffe’s speeches would have tipped him off to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s use of front companies and expanding reach into Iran’s economy. As the administration announced new Iran sanctions in June 2010, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Stuart Levey noted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had "taken over broad portions of the Iranian economy." Meanwhile, he expected Iran would "scramble to identify workarounds, hiding behind front companies, doctoring wire transfers, falsifying shipping documents." Our ruling Secure America Now’s ad claims that Plouffe took "large piles of cash" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In reality, he took $100,000 for two speeches from a Nigerian subsidiary of that "joint venture partner," and the Iranian company’s ownership wasn’t yet crystal clear. But there were plenty of red flags, if Plouffe had looked for them, that his speaking trip in retrospect might not look so politically savvy. For example, a key Irancell shareholder was already labeled a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14533	North Korea’s missiles are "not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon."	true	/arizona/statements/2016/feb/16/john-mccain/could-north-korea-missile-strike-united-states/	North Korea’s Feb. 7 rocket launch scared some folks. Weapons experts saw it as a test for a potential missile strike on the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that it threatened "not only the security of the Korean peninsula, but that of the region and the United States as well." However, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, was more measured in his remarks on the rocket launch during the Fox News program Outnumbered on Feb. 8. "China controls North Korea’s destiny, we should have some sanctions against, not just North Korea, but Chinese that do business with North Korea. And by the way, they’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will," McCain said when asked about what the United States should do in response to the launch. We wondered just how close North Korea is to reaching the United States via missile, so we put McCain’s statement through a fact-check. The technology is there The day after McCain made his claim, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Clapper said North Korea is "committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States," but he also noted that the system has not been "flight-tested." A January 2016 Congressional Research Service report on U.S.-North Korea relations also stated that North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear weapon on their KN-08, an intercontinental ballistic missile, "and shoot it at the homeland." McCain press aide Julie Tarallo pointed us to this when we asked about his comments. However, the report also notes that until North Korea tests the device, its nuclear capabilities will "remain uncertain." Missile experts we spoke with held largely the same views. Melissa Hanham is a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studies North Korean weapons. She agreed with McCain’s statement and said Americans shouldn’t be fearful because it takes North Korea days to prepare for a rocket launch. The estimated range of their rockets, at 10,000 km, puts Alaska, Hawaii and the western United States in range. But, they have never demonstrated all the capabilities needed to turn their present technology into a missile. "Regardless, they are working toward this goal, and unless there is some appropriate intervention, they will achieve it," Hanham said. Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said McCain’s claim is "generally accurate." "The imminence of the North Korean threat has been hyped for a long time; that being said, one successful KN-08 test would revolutionize perceptions of North Korea’s capabilities," Snyder said. As far as a timeline, Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, estimates that North Korea will not be able to reach the United States by missile until at least 2020 -- assuming a lack of intervention. Our ruling McCain said of North Korea’s missile program, "They’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will." His statement is a bit of a generalization, but he’s right. North Korea may have the missile technology -- and range -- to strike the United States, but it hasn’t been tested. Experts on missile technology agreed with McCain. We rate McCain’s claim as True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2016-02-16T11:14:22	2016-02-08	['United_States']
pomt-10932	"I don’t think it’s been proven that the game of football causes CTE."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jul/26/larry-fedora/unc-football-coach-says-its-not-proven-football-ca/	Football is under attack. That’s what Larry Fedora, head coach of the UNC football team, told reporters during an ACC media event on July 18. Without naming anyone, Fedora said "people twist the data" on football-related injuries to argue that the game isn’t safe. Football is safer than it has ever been, he said, adding that reports of the game’s ties to head injuries are overblown. "I don’t think it’s been proven that the game of football causes CTE," Fedora said. CTE is short for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive degenerative brain disease linked to head trauma. "Now we do know, from my understanding, that repeated blows to the head causes it," Fedora said. "So I’m assuming, every sport that you have, football included, could be a problem with that. As long as you’ve got any kind of contact, you can have that." Fedora is right about CTE being caused by blows to the head. But is he right that researchers haven’t "proven" that football causes CTE? Through a spokeswoman, he declined PolitiFact’s request to elaborate on his claim. But PolitiFact found that Fedora’s point is somewhat valid. Scientists have suspected a link between football and brain problems for decades. However, research into the whether the sport consistently causes CTE hasn’t gotten very far. 110 of 111 brains CTE cannot be diagnosed in someone until they die, so it’s impossible at this point for doctors and scientists to measure football’s effect on the human brain on a year-to-year basis. The most illuminating information emerged in 2017. That year, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the work of researchers who studied the brains of deceased football players who played at various levels, from high school to college to semi-pro and the NFL. In total, nearly 88 percent of the brains — 177 of 202 — submitted for the research tested positive for CTE. But the rate of CTE was lower in younger players. (NPR summarized the research.) ▪ Of the 14 players who played only in high school, just three had CTE. ▪ Of the 53 players who stopped playing after college, 48 had CTE. ▪ Of the 22 players who played in the Canadian Football League or a semi-pro league, 16 had CTE. ▪ Of the 111 players who played in the NFL, 110 had CTE. (An NFL player may have a higher risk of CTE if he began playing as a child. A separate study, published in 2014, found that former NFL players who started playing football before age 12 fared worse on cognitive assessments than players who started in their teens, as Vox explained this year.) Dr. Ann McKee, one of the researchers who conducted the 2017 study published in JAMA, said those results show a link between football and CTE. "We’re seeing this (CTE) in a very large number that participated in football for many years. So while we don’t know the exact risk and we don’t know the exact number, we know this is a problem in football," she told NPR. But each of the brains was donated, leaving some researchers divided on how to characterize football’s ties to CTE. Sampling bias Dr. Peter Cummings, forensic pathologist and a neuropathologist at Boston University School of Medicine, wrote in a 2017 Yahoo Sports column that McKee’s study doesn’t definitively prove a link between football and CTE. He noted the brains were donated by families who likely suspected the player had developed neurological problems. "Because of this sampling bias, we cannot estimate the prevalence or incidence of CTE (meaning the total number of cases and the number of new cases expected each year in football players); nor can we establish risk or a cause-effect relationship between head injury and development of CTE," Cummings wrote. "To do that you need a randomly selected population comprised of people with the disease and people without the disease," he said. "In other words, we do not have a complete picture of what causes CTE, how common CTE is, or what the chance of getting CTE may be for anyone, or even what symptoms, if any, CTE causes." Another recent Yahoo Sports column quotes Cummings defending Fedora, saying that "association is not causation." The same column refers to CTE researchers in Canada, who warn that the most commonly cited studies on the disease "do not allow for the collection of any epidemiological data and are not representative of the general population." The studies are "limited by methodological biases, pathological inconsistencies, insufficient clinical data, and a reliance on inherently biased postmortem data," their abstract says. The burden of proof Lewis Margolis, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, said he generally agrees with Cummings and others that the scientific proof has yet to be determined. "Has there been a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where some boys are exposed to brain trauma and other boys are not and then later examined for CTE? The answer is no," Margolis said in an email. "Such a trial would not be ethical." UNC has a research center dedicated to studying the link between contact sports and head injuries. Its research shows a clear relationship between football and brain trauma, Margolis said. "The implication of the statement by Fedora is that because we do not have the definitive (randomized controlled trial) for CTE we cannot say that football causes CTE. To me this misses that point that football increases the risk of head trauma/concussions with known consequences, even if there is not a definitive link (yet) to CTE," he said. Margolis has warned that players or parents who are waiting for definitive, scientific proof could be putting themselves or their kids at risk. "The tobacco industry used to say that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer was ‘merely’ a statistical association, similar to saying that there is not proof that football causes CTE," Margolis said. "The weight of the evidence against tobacco eventually tipped the scales, absent randomized trials, and I think the weight of the evidence of the harms of football is similar, even without a definitive link to CTE." NFL acknowledgment Back to Cummings and the lack of a valid scientific study proving that football causes CTE. The NFL, which has been accused of suppressing information about how the sport affects players’ long-term health, could use the same argument. And, for a while, it did. ("Frontline" in 2013 published a timeline showing key events and research dating back to 1994.) In 2013, while admitting no wrongdoing, the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with former players after 4,500 of them sued the NFL on the basis that the league minimized the risk of concussions. (Amid a challenge, the settlement was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.) Then in March 2016, for the first time, the NFL publicly acknowledged a link between football and CTE. The statement came while Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and safety policy, was part of a round-table discussion with the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Miller pointed to McKee’s work as evidence. And the NFL released a statement the day after Miller’s claim, saying his comments "accurately reflect the view of the NFL." Our rating Fedora said it hasn’t been "proven that the game of football causes CTE." He’s right that there hasn’t been a controlled study showing, conclusively, that playing football directly causes CTE. However, studies have shown CTE in the brains of more than 100 former football players, and the NFL has acknowledged a link between football and CTE. There’s enough evidence to show a connection between football and CTE. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Larry Fedora	None	None	None	2018-07-26T14:56:44	2018-07-18	['None']
pomt-13970	On his support for Donald Trump.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/14/scott-walker/scott-walkers-support-donald-trump-some-inconsiste/	On the same day chatter surfaced about how Scott Walker could still become the Republican presidential nominee, the Wisconsin governor made comments that raised questions about his support of the party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Walker’s comments on June 8, 2016 prompted headlines such as these: Politico: "Walker backs away from endorsing Trump" Wall Street Journal: "Scott Walker withholds Donald Trump endorsement" So, barely a month before the GOP nominates its candidate for president, has Walker changed his position on Trump? Cue the Flip-O-Meter, which determines whether a politician has changed positions on an issue. The backdrop Talk among Republicans about replacing Trump grew in the wake of racial remarks Trump made about a Hispanic federal judge in California who is handling two lawsuits filed in against Trump University. Yahoo reported that Walker "has been increasingly mentioned as a possible replacement." And the conservative website RedState said there were rumors of Walker being open to accepting the nomination at the convention. Walker dismissed the talk. But the new reports on Walker’s viability as a Trump replacement were fueled by Walker’s own comments the same day. So, let’s look at where Walker has been on Trump, starting with when Walker himself was still in the race. Walker’s early comments Walker launched his presidential bid in July 2015 and was quickly considered a frontrunner, even in the crowded GOP field. The next month, he was on stage with Trump and eight other hopefuls for the first GOP debate, held in Cleveland. The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would not pledge to back the party's nominee and swear off an independent run. Trump was the only one to raise his hand. In other words, Walker pledged he would back the GOP nominee. Of course, at that stage, Walker himself hoped to be his party’s choice, and it would be months before Trump became the presumptive nominee. Walker ended his presidential bid in September 2015, amid campaign cash-flow problems and a drop in the polls, Ahead of Wisconsin’s primary in April 2016, Trump was harshly critical of Walker, who endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Soon questions turned to whether Walker would back Trump. April 20, 2016: Walker told reporters: "I will support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton in the fall -- whoever that is." Asked if he would do so even if Trump were the nominee, he said: "Yeah. To me, I think it's preferable to have a Republican nominee over Hillary Clinton." May 4, 2016: Alluding to the first GOP debate, Walker told reporters the day after Cruz dropped out: "I stood on the stage in Cleveland and said that I would support the nominee. I’ve said it repeatedly since then and I’ll be supporting the Republican nominee once that’s officially set at the convention against Hillary Clinton." June 6, 2016: The Post-Crescent in Appleton reported that Walker said he would have no problem supporting Trump even though "he wasn't my first choice." He said in the interview: "There are issues, not the least of which lately with his statements about the judge he commented on, which I just fundamentally disagree with him on, so just saying that I'll support him over Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I embrace all the things that he says or all the ways that he says it." So, Walker initially declared he would support the Republican nominee. Then, months later, as it became clear that Trump was closing in on the nomination, Walker repeatedly said he would support Trump -- though on at least one occasion he said his support once the GOP nomination becomes "officially set." Now to the Walker comments that made national headlines. Walker’s latest comments June 7, 2016: The Wall Street Journal headline about Walker withholding a Trump endorsement was based on comments Walker made to reporters that were highlighted in a report by WKOW-TV in Madison. Walker denounced Trump’s comments about the judge and said he wanted Trump himself to renounce them, according to a reporter’s recording of Walker’s remarks. A reporter then asked: "Would that influence your decision at all on whether or not to back him as the nominee?" Walker said: "Again, we’ll watch and see what happens. We’ll be watching closely. There’s still quite some time until he’s even the nominee, so we’ll have to wait and see." Asked what would cause him not to support Trump, Walker said: "Well, again, he’s not yet the nominee. Officially that won't happen until the middle of July, and so for me that's kind of the time frame on that. In particular, I want to make sure that he renounces what he says -- at least in regards to this judge." Walker added: "I think for a lot of us, not just Republicans in general, we want to see what he’s going to do between now and the time the convention comes. The sad fact is -- it’s just sad in American that we have such poor choices right now." June 8, 2016: After another question-and-answer session with reporters, the Associated Press reported, that Walker was wavering in his support of Trump and that he dodged a question on the issue. Walker was asked, according to a reporter's recording of that exchange: "Do you still support him (Trump) as the nominee?" Walker began his response by saying: "Well, right now I'm focused on calling out, as I have the last couple days, the fact that I believe what he said about the judge is wrong -- not as a Republican, not as a political person, but I think it's just wrong as an American." Walker went on at some length criticizing Trump’s remarks, ending by saying: "He needs to make it abundantly clear to the American people that he does not embrace those ideas. And I think it’s particularly important between now and the convention that he does that." Our rating Dating back to August 2015, when he himself was a candidate for president, Walker said he would support the Republican presidential nominee. And several times over the next 10 months, Walker repeated that pledge -- including as it was becoming clear that Trump would be the presumptive nominee. But on two consecutive days in June 2016, Walker shifted somewhat. Questioned about Trump by reporters, Walker would not state his support as he had in the past. Instead, while criticizing Trump, he emphasized that Trump is not yet the nominee. Our definition of Half Flip is a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That fits here.

pomt-02717	"The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2013/dec/22/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-3-lanes-george-washington-br/	Hardly a day passes where vicious snarls don’t somehow tie up the George Washington Bridge. But those snarls aren’t limited to traffic. More and more, daily questions are arising from the September closure of some local-access lanes on the span. To date, they have resulted in the resignation of two high-ranking transportation officials and calls for a federal investigation into what’s become known as ‘Bridgegate.’ And none of the questions are going away quietly. Among the latest claims to enter the fray? One by Gov. Chris Christie, who complained earlier this month about the local-access lanes for Fort Lee, where the bridge is located. "The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced," Christie said Dec. 2 in response to Democratic lawmakers subpoenaing the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the bridge -- to appear before a state Assembly committee about the lane closures from Sept. 9-13. The closures caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, leaving some drivers stranded for hours. Three lanes of a 29-lane span (12 lanes on the upper level, 10 on the lower level and seven from the Palisades Parkway) dedicated to a relatively small borough in Bergen County? The governor isn't even close to correct. Let’s look at some numbers here. The 2012 census notes that Fort Lee’s land area is 2.54 square miles and the borough’s population that year was 35,732. And not all of those people are drivers or even users of the bridge connecting upper Manhattan with the borough. So why the hullabaloo about bridge lanes and Fort Lee? It goes to the September closures, when two of three local-access lanes were closed, purportedly for a traffic study, according to Port Authority officials questioned about the closures. Some Democrats have questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month.. And the matter has continued to heat up. Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee, and an outspoken critic of the Port Authority, has convened hearings on the matter and issued subpoenas to Port Authority officials to testify about what happened. David Wildstein, the Port Authority’s director of interstate capital projects, who ordered the bridge’s general manager to carry out the closures, and agency Executive Director Bill Baroni have since resigned. On Dec. 10 the Port Authority’s inspector general launched an investigation into the closures and now U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, has asked the federal transportation secretary to investigate. Both Wisniewski and Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) are dumbfounded by Christie’s claim that the local access lanes are dedicated to Fort Lee. "These lanes are open to the general public," Wisniewski said. "They’re physically located in Fort Lee but they’re not dedicated to Fort Lee. "I think it’s the word ‘dedicated’ to Fort Lee that creates the problem here," Wisniewski added. "There’s an access point at Fort Lee that people (who live there) use and that many other people use." Wisniewski explained that use of the access lanes in Fort Lee is similar to drivers using the New Jersey Turnpike Extension, for example, to get to the Holland Tunnel connecting Manhattan and Jersey City. It’s one way of using the tunnel, but not the only way. And Weinberg, who lives near the bridge, noted that there is no residency requirement for the people of Fort Lee or anyone else to use the bridge. "There are no specific dedicated lanes," she said. "There are lanes that come from local streets in Fort Lee, but all lanes come through Fort Lee because the bridge is there. There are some local streets where you don’t have to get on the main highway." Since neither Christie’s spokespeople, Port Authority spokespeople or even the Fort Lee Police Department would respond to requests for comment on the matter, the Truth-O-Meter went on the road last week to check out the local access lanes. We found that Wisniewski’s and Weinberg’s assessments are correct: there are lanes from local Fort Lee streets but none are dedicated specifically to the borough. Anyone can use them -- or not. Our ruling Earlier this month, in response to subpoenas being issued in the so-called ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, Christie said, "The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced." Christie is way off here. Never mind that his claim makes it seem as if a significant part of the bridge’s total number of lanes are dedicated to a borough with a land area only 2.5 square miles in size, with approximately 35,000 residents. The facts are that the George Washington Bridge is physically in Fort Lee and there are local access lanes from the bridge. But none of the lanes are dedicated for use only in or by the borough. All motorists are able to use them as an entry point to the span. Know what gets the Truth-O-Meter sauced, governor? Ridiculously false claims. Pants on Fire! To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03566	The IRS is going to be "in charge" of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-decries-huge-national-database-ru/	During a recent interview with Fox News, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., raised the specter of the Internal Revenue Service -- an agency currently under fire for appearing to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- collecting a database full of "intimate" details about Americans. Referring to an inspector general’s report on IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible." We’ve already rated two of her claims from this exchange, which came during a May 15, 2013, interview on the Fox News show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. We gave Bachmann a False for saying that the IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care," and we gave her a Mostly False for her claim that "The IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s correct to say that the IRS is going to be in charge of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets." After the interview with Van Susteren aired, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, told PolitiFact that she stands by her charge. As evidence, he cited a passage from a Wall Street Journal editorial published one day before her television appearance. The editorial described a Federal Data Services hub that is taking "the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). The data hub will be used as the verification system for ObamaCare's complex subsidy formula. ... "Good luck in advance to anyone who gets caught in this system's gears, assuming it even works. Centralizing so much personal information in one place is another invitation for the IRS wigglers in some regional office—or maybe higher up—to make political decisions about enforcement." We see four key questions for fact-checking Bachmann’s claim. First, is the government constructing a database? Second, will the IRS be "in charge" of it? Third, would it include "personal" or "intimate" details? And fourth, would it affect all, or most, Americans? We’ll take these issues in order. Is the government constructing a database? Not by the traditional definition of "database." The "hub" the government is creating is a mechanism for extracting data from a variety of databases that exist at other agencies. The hub doesn’t collect, centralize and store data; it is designed to allow real-time access to data that resides on the servers of other agencies in order to verify transactions related to the health insurance exchanges created under Obama’s law. In an April 22, 2013, release, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of HHS, said that it has completed the hub’s technical design and is in the midst of testing it. "The hub will not store consumer information, but will securely transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information," the center said in the statement. HHS pledges "strict privacy controls to safeguard personal information," added Brian Cook, a spokesman for the department. "This is not a huge national database of health records," said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. Will the IRS be "in charge" of the hub? No. It’s being built by HHS, specifically by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To ensure compatibility, the IRS needs to cooperate with HHS on the effort, but the IRS has only a supporting role in building the system, and the IRS will not be able to use the hub to view information in the other agencies’ databases. Will the hub include "personal" or "intimate" details? The hub is not designed to access, much less store, information like body mass index, or whether you have a serious illness or ingrown toenails. The hub will be able to tell if someone has insurance or not, but it will not access records about their health. It could access other "personal" details beyond health status, including adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but those already exist in federal databases, so the hub wouldn’t represent an expansion of federal data collection. Would the hub affect all, or most Americans? No. The data won’t be accessed by the hub unless an individual logs on to the new insurance exchanges in order to purchase insurance. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for health insurance subsidies on the exchange in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. So the numbers of Americans who might eventually interact with the hub aren’t trivial -- but it’s important to note that even if everyone who’s eligible takes the opportunity to use the exchanges, they would represent a small fraction of all Americans. People who have employer-provided insurance or are on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care or most other forms of government-provided insurance should have no need to interact with the hub at all. Our ruling Bachmann said the IRS is going to be "in charge" of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets." The congresswoman chooses to believe that the IRS and the rest of the government intend to delve ever-further into Americans’ personal lives. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but as best we can tell now, she has mischaracterized the intent and limitations of the hub. It’s not a "database." The IRS isn’t running it. It won’t include "intimate" health data. And most Americans won’t need to interact with it at all. We rate her comment Pants on Fire.

pomt-01592	"We cut our deficits by more than half."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/05/barack-obama/obama-says-he-has-cut-national-deficit-half/	In 2012, PolitiFact twice rated True claims that President Barack Obama failed to keep a promise to cut federal deficits in half by the end of his first term. At that point, the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and Republican congressmen called out Obama because the deficit had been reduced by just 15 percent. But there was the president at Laborfest 2014 in Milwaukee proclaiming "we cut our deficits by more than half." In his Sept. 1, 2014 speech, the president ticked off for union supporters a list of major policy decisions he contends helped boost the economy and improve the government’s bottom line. We can’t cover all of those here, but the deficit claim grabbed our attention. Has it really been cut in half? The White House Office of Management and Budget pointed us to a chart prepared by that office in 2013 as proof of Obama's claim. It compares the yearly deficits under Obama, expressed -- as they often are -- as a share of the nation’s entire economy, which is measured by the Gross Domestic Product. At the start of Obama’s term, the chart showed, the figure was 9.2 percent. The latest figure was 4.1 percent. That appears to back Obama's statement. But let's examine this in detail. To do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts. The baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year. The most recent complete fiscal year is 2013. Those are the same years Obama's chart showed. Our analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate. As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013. Obama’s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%. That’s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the Great Recession. That resulting figure is what Obama calls the deficit he "inherited" from Bush. But no matter which figure is used, the deficit as a share of the economy still fell by more than half. Show me the money There's another way to look at this. That is, in raw dollars -- the way attendees at the union event probably would. Indeed, deficits are often expressed that way as well. The White House and CBO figures each show that in 2009 the deficit reached $1.4 trillion. As a share of GDP, it easily topped any year since World War II, said Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. By the end of fiscal year 2013, the deficit figure had fallen to $679.5 billion in dollars unadjusted for inflation. That’s a 52 percent drop. Here’s the year-by-year trend in 2009 dollars: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as share of GDP 2009 1,412,688,000,000 9.8 percent 2010 1,294,373,000,000 8.8 percent 2011 1,299,593,000,000 8.4 percent 2012 1,086,963,000,000 6.8 percent 2013 679,502,000,000 4.1 percent There is one wrinkle. When you use Obama's methodology to compare the deficit Obama inherited -- the 2009 result minus the stimulus package to that in 2013 -- the drop in the deficit is slightly under half, at 48%. Ellis and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, both included an additional year, the 2014 fiscal year, which is just a month from completion. The Aug. 27, 2014 CBO estimate for this year’s budget, fiscal year 2014, is a continued shrinking of the deficit to $506 billion, or 2.9 percent of GDP. Those figures would put Obama's claim over the top no matter the number-crunching method. Looking ahead Ellis cautioned that talking about deficit amounts in raw dollars doesn’t really give a good sense of the scale: "A $400 billion deficit in a $10 trillion economy is a lot bigger than a $400 billion deficit in $17 trillion economy." And he and Goldwein emphasized that while the deficit has been halved, it’s been halved from a skyscraping peak. In the decade before deficits exploded in 2008 and 2009, they averaged just over 1 percent of GDP, including three years of surpluses, we calculated. As of 2013, that figure was at 4.1 percent. The growth in the deficit from 2007 to 2009 was due mainly to factors related to the Great Recession, said Goldwein. Tax collections fell as people lost jobs and corporate profits dropped; spending on food stamps and other aid programs rose with increased need; stimulus and tax break legislation passed, as did bailouts of financial firms. "The economic recovery, wind-down of stimulus, reversal of TARP/Fannie transactions, and lower interest rates are really what has caused our deficit to fall so much," Goldwein told us. He mentioned cuts in discretionary spending as well. Looking ahead, the CBO warns that later in the next decade deficits as a share of the economy will grow and federal debt will climb without changes in current policies. But Obama, it’s fair to say, was speaking of the change during his presidency. And his claim dovetails with one PolitiFact National checked in July 2013, rating True Obama’s claim that the deficit is falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. Our rating At a union rally on Labor Day, Obama declared "We cut our deficits by more than half." The numbers back up Obama’s claim: Thanks to income tax revenues rising and spending on emergency assistance dropping, America’s deficit has fallen by more than 50 percent from its highest point since World War II to a level $733 billion lower. We rate the claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-09-05T05:00:00	2014-09-01	['None']
pomt-04600	"I am going to be on the ballot in all 50 states. There is no other third-party candidate that’s going to come close to achieving that."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/20/gary-johnson/libertarian-gary-johnson-says-hell-be-presidential/	Former two-term New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, says he has a shot at upsetting the major-party nominees in November provided he’s included in the nationally televised presidential debates. "You know, I don’t want to peak too early," Johnson said, seemingly jokingly, in an August 2012 interview for KLRU-TV’s "Overheard." Host Evan Smith asked if some states could prove opportunities for Johnson, who replied: "I am going to argue that I might be a factor everywhere, not just in certain states," though he said he needs to be in the debates to have that chance. "It’s important to point out that I am going to be on the ballot in all 50 states," Johnson said. "There is no other third-party candidate that’s going to come close to achieving that." Are both parts of that so? The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant White House run was Texan Ross Perot in 1992, as noted in a Sept. 12, 2012, CNN news article. Perot also was the last third-party hopeful to be invited to the debates. CNN said Johnson, who initially announced his candidacy as a Republican, has not raised much money, nor does he have a big campaign staff. Still, he told CNN: "No other third party is going to come close to this 50-ballot access." We tried to pin down how many states’ ballots will include Johnson, ultimately realizing that court battles have delayed final decisions in a few states. Libertarian Party spokeswoman Carla Howell said by phone that Johnson will be on the ballot in 47 states while litigation has tied up his standing in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Depending on legal outcomes, then, he could end up on the ballot in 49 to 50 states, she said. Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Hunter also put the number at 47 states, with the other states tied up in legal challenges. For an independent count, we turned to Richard Winger, editor of the California-based Ballot Access News. As of mid-September, he said, Johnson appears likely to be on the ballot in 48 or 49 states, depending on how courts rule, with the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, on nearly 40 ballots. Winger said his counts are based on printing off candidate lists from the web pages of state election officials. He said all or parts of five states had yet to finalize November ballots, he said, because of outstanding issues. He specified Connecticut, Michigan, Kansas, Colorado and New York. Winger pointed us to a Politics1.com chart that he described as generally up to date on the presidential hopefuls set to appear on each ballot. As of Sept. 18, 2012, the chart indicated that Johnson will appear on the ballot in every state except Oklahoma and possibly Pennsylvania and Michigan, which had question marks showing. The chart indicates Stein will be on the ballot in 38 states including Texas, while she has qualified as a write-in hopeful in five others. Nominees of other third parties are listed as making fewer ballots. Ron Gunzburger, Politics1.com’s publisher and editor, told us by phone that the chart’s notations are based on news accounts, information from state election officials and reports by Ballot Access News. And why is Johnson appearing on most state ballots? "The Libertarian Party works hard on ballot access all the time," Winger said, and has more members with greater income to pay for such efforts than the Green Party. Broadly, Winger said, the Libertarian Party was positioned to have its nominee on ballots in 29 states by the start of 2012, thanks to sufficient voter signatures being collected in the states or because past candidates had drawn enough votes to qualify its 2012 nominees for the ballot. By the same time, he said, the Green Party was positioned to be on the ballot in 16 states. "They just don’t have as much money" to pay individuals who collect voter signatures, Winger said. "These things get done by hiring paid circulators. It’s really very sad. What we have in effect is enormous filing fees for third parties." Looking back, Winger said, the Libertarian presidential nominee appeared on every state ballot in 1980, 1992 and 1996. Perot made every ballot in 1992 and 1996, and U.S. Rep. John Anderson made every state ballot in 1980. Winger said Lenora Fulani, nominee of the New Alliance Party, made every ballot in 1988. Our ruling Johnson said he’s going to be on the ballot in every state and no other third-party nominee will come close. He’s poised to be on the ballot in at least 47 states compared to about 40 states for Stein, the Green Party choice. We rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-07861	Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-fox-news-said-new-black-panther/	In an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman, Rachel Maddow said there's a big difference in the approaches of MSNBC and Fox: MSNBC, the network that carries her nightly show, is concerned with accuracy. Fox is not. "I of course think that we (MSNBC) are much more true than Fox is true," Maddow said in the Dec. 15, 2010, interview. "The problem that I think is reasonable to assert about Fox and its coverage is that they make up stories out of whole cloth and then make a big deal out of them." She continued, "For example, they said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama. They ran dozens and dozens and dozens of stories about the New Black Panther Party, which was one guy who braided his beard in Philadelphia and who didn’t have an organization, yelling on a street corner. They represented that story as if that is the guy who decided the election. That was fake." A few weeks after that appearance, a PolitiFact reader wrote us to ask if we could fact-check Maddow’s statement that Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama." So we will. First, some background on the controversy Maddow referenced. We addressed it in some detail in a previous item, but here’s a summary: In mid 2010, Fox News pundits hammered the Obama administration for its handling of a voter intimidation case involving the New Black Panther Party (which is not related to the original Black Panthers), specifically, that the Obama administration backed off the case because it is afraid of prosecuting minorities for civil rights violations. At issue was an incident on Nov. 4, 2008 -- the day of the presidential election -- when New Black Panther Party members Jerry Jackson and King Samir Shabazz stood outside a Philadelphia polling place dressed in black military-style uniforms. Shabazz held a nightstick, and the two men were accused of making intimidating remarks to both white and black voters. (You can see it on YouTube here.) On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the Department of Justice filed a civil action accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, of engaging in voter intimidation. Although none of the defendants responded to the complaint, the department later dropped its case against all but King Samir Shabazz, the one with the nightstick. The department asked for, and got, an injunction prohibiting Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location until 2012. Many Fox News commentators criticized the government's position as outrageously lenient and saw it as evidence of an Obama administration double-standard on race issues. But Maddow’s comment to Letterman framed Fox’s coverage of the issue in political, rather than legal, terms. Was she correct that Fox News had claimed that "the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama"? We looked at dozens of Fox transcripts between June 30, 2010, and July 14, 2010, because those dates coincide with the span of coverage that Media Matters for America, a liberal group that tracks media coverage, analyzed in a blog post on July 16, 2010. Maddow referenced the Media Matters post in her blog’s item on the Letterman appearance, so we thought it would be appropriate to use that study’s parameters as the basis for checking her statement on the Late Show. When we contacted Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Media Matters, she told us that her group had chosen that time frame because Fox News’ coverage of the controversy during that period had been especially extensive. The transcripts showed that indeed there was lots of coverage on Fox. However, the discussions focused on the legal side of the story and the question of whether other media outlets were derelict in not giving it enough attention. Here are some examples of Fox News’ coverage: • On June 30, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly appeared on Hannity to talk about the Justice Department’s dismissal of the case. "The law says that's voter intimidation -- that if you intimidate voters from not going in the polling station or you attempt to intimidate voters. And there was testimony by one person who was trying to vote that the one guy held up his arms and physically blocked him from going that the polling station. Now, I mean, you tell me: is that or is that not voter intimidation?" • On July 9, Fox covered a statement by the New Black Panther Party attacking Fox host Glenn Beck. Beck appeared on the O’Reilly Factor to discuss the matter. "I wonder if anyone on any other network would talk about his hate speech or talk about his inciting violence or talk about the fact that the New Black Panther Party is a -- is a hate group." • On July 12, Fox host Bill O’Reilly aired a segment about the "mainstream media" ignoring the New Black Panther Party story. In it, he said that Attorney General Eric Holder was "getting away with this because the liberal print press and the network news (is) pretty much ignoring the story." • On July 14, Fox covered the NAACP passage of a resolution condemning "racist elements" of the tea party. In one segment, Sean Hannity claimed that there was a double standard on racism. Speaking to conservative activist and media figure Andrew Breitbart, Hannity said, "I haven't heard any Democrats talk about the New Black Panther Party standing outside the polling place, Andrew." But in all the coverage we examined, we couldn't find a single case in which the discussion revolved around the political impact of the incident, including whether the New Black Panther Party had helped put the Obama campaign over the top in 2008. (Needless to say, since Obama won by more than 8 million votes, it's not like one guy with a nightstick at a single polling place swung the election.) When we reached out to Maddow, a spokeswoman pointed us to a commentary segment she did on her MSNBC show on July 21, 2010, that provided the full context of her criticism of Fox’s New Black Panther Party coverage. Maddow argued that coverage of that story -- combined with its criticism of African American administration figures such as Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod -- amounted to a manufactured theme of "black people are coming for you." She suggested that it was the most recent iteration of race-baiting techniques that date to the segregation era. "For normal news outlets," Maddow said, the New Black Panther case simply "wasn’t a story" -- and rightfully so. That's an opinion, but it doesn't support her allegation that Fox said the New Black Panther Party "decided the election" for Obama. Maddow would have been correct if she had simply said that Fox's coverage was more extensive and hyperbolic than other networks. But her claim that Fox News "said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama" is not supported by the transcripts we reviewed. In reality, Fox’s coverage focused on legal, racial and media-related issues, rather than the electoral impact on Obama. So we find her claim False.

He’s not a candidate, but he is campaigning for Democrats. And some detractors are reviving an old dig against the former president. "One day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people," reads a quote in an image that was posted to Facebook on Nov. 4. It’s attributed to Clint Eastwood and appears next to a picture of the actor sitting on a stool. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Eastwood isn’t sitting on the stool—the empty one he talked to during the 2012 Republican National Convention, pretending Obama was seated next to him on stage. He considered the appearance a success, and he said so to the Carmel Pine Cone a few days later. The newspaper covers Eastwood’s hometown, where he was elected mayor in 1986. A story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: "That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who’s not doing a good job." "President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people," the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. "(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that’s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle." That’s not quite what the Facebook post said. Eastwood was talking about Obama, the person, not his presidency. And he called the then-president a hoax, not a fraud. Still, the quote is close to the spirit of Eastwood’s comments. One person who did get it right? Donald Trump. Three days after the story ran, he tweeted: "‘President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.’ --Clint Eastwood" We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14770	"We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/09/joe-donald/us-incarcerates-more-people-china-or-russia-state-/	China has nearly 1.4 billion people -- four times as many as the United States’ 321 million. So, does the U.S. really incarcerate more people than China (and Russia, too)? That is the claim from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is challenging recently appointed state Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley in the spring 2016 election. State appeals court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who was a candidate for the high court in 2011, and Madison attorney Claude Covelli are also running. In a Dec. 2, 2015 interview on "The Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show in Madison, Donald was asked about racial justice being part of his platform. Donald, who would be the first African-American elected to the state’s high court (former Justice Louis Butler was appointed, then lost an election), said he supports alternatives to jail and prison. "It isn't all about simply retribution and punishment," he said. "That if you treat the underlying issues, then in essence you transform that person's life, you rehabilitate them, they are able to be productive citizens and they're able to be strong advocates for their families. "And by strengthening families, in my opinion, you actually reduce crime. And so I'm a huge proponent of trying to address that issue. You know, we lock up close to 2.4 million in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia." We'll see from a recent fact check that Donald's statement is essentially on target, though available figures for China are to some extent understated. The numbers In October 2015, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. He said: "Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth." The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics’ latest figures showed there were more than 2.22 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons in 2013. We found that other estimates -- which can vary based on the time they were made and the definition of incarceration -- are similar. The University of London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research also uses 2.22 million. And an estimate from the Massachusetts-based Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, was slightly higher, at 2.4 million. Those figures put the United States at No. 1 in the world in terms of incarcerating people. (A key reason, Prison Policy Initiative legal director Aleks Kajstura told us, is that U.S. policies were changed in the 1980s to put more offenders in prison or jail, partly because of the war on drugs.) It’s a little harder to get rock-solid numbers internationally. China is second, with 1.66 million prisoners, and Russia is third, with 642,470, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. But China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid-2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China. In terms of rate -- the number of people incarcerated compared to the entire population -- the United States is also well above Russia and China. The U.S. incarceration rate is 698 per 100,000 people, far outpacing Russia (445) and China (119), according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. That is second in the world behind tiny Seychelles (799), an Indian Ocean nation of 115 islands. Our rating Donald said: "We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia." The best estimates are that the United States incarcerates 2.2 million to 2.4 people, far ahead of available figures for both China and Russia. But it’s possible the China numbers are under counted. We rate Donald’s statement Mostly True. More on incarceration Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points." Mostly False. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee: Scott Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." Mostly False.

pomt-10257	McCain's energy plan is a "single-answer proposition" — new domestic oil drilling.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/brian-schweitzer/mccain-energy-plan-not-just-more-drilling/	In a spirited oratory during the second night of the Democratic National Convention, Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer — the animated guy wearing the bolo tie — attacked Sen. John McCain's energy plan as reliant on more domestic oil drilling. "We can't simply drill our way to energy independence," Schweitzer said. "That single-answer proposition is a dry well. And here's why: America consumes 25 percent of the oil but has less than 3 percent of the reserves. You don't need a $2 calculator to figure that one out. There just isn't enough oil in America — on land or offshore — to meet America's full energy needs." It is true that in recent months McCain has become a cheerleader for opening up new areas to offshore drilling. But to summarize McCain's energy plan as a "single-answer proposition" based on more domestic oil production is inaccurate. McCain's "all of the above" catch-phrase is a staple of speeches, meant to highlight that his energy plan calls not just for more domestic oil production, but also more nuclear power, coal and alternative energy exploration. Even as he delivered a speech from an oil rig platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 19, 2008, McCain stressed that more domestic oil drilling is only part of his energy plan. "Solving our energy crisis requires an 'all of the above' approach," McCain said. "It will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind, solar, tidal and biofuels. It also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal, nuclear power, and offshore drilling like that done on this rig." Among McCain's proposals to achieve "strategic" energy independence by 2025: • $5,000 tax credit to those who buy a zero carbon emission car. • $300-million prize (one dollar for every person in the United States) for the development of a battery package "that has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars." • Tougher enforcement of federal standards on mileage requirements that automobile manufacturers' cars must meet. • $2-billion annually to advance clean coal technology sources. • 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030. • Tax credits to encourage the market for alternative, low-carbon fuels such as wind, hydro and solar power "until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers' dollars." Obama has countered that despite his campaign platitudes, McCain as a U.S. senator has "voted against renewable sources of energy, against biofuels, against solar power, against wind power, against an energy bill that — while far from perfect — represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country." We looked at that Aug. 5 statement and ruled it Mostly True. In 2005, McCain voted against a series of amendments to an energy bill that set higher goals for the use of renewable energy. One proposal required refineries to use 8-billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 and another required 10 percent of electricity sold by utilities by 2020 be produced by renewable energy. Both passed and were included in the final bill, which McCain voted against. The Obama campaign cites McCain's vote against the 2005 energy bill, which was signed into law by President Bush, as evidence of him voting against wind power. McCain did vote against the measure, in part because he thought a federal tax credit for alternative energy production was too generous and not cost-effective. But McCain voted in favor of a 1992 energy law that required some government agencies to begin using vehicles that ran on alternative fuels and authorized more than $500-million in Energy Department research on renewable energy. And in 2002, McCain and Democratic Sen. John Kerry pushed a plan to raise mileage standards for cars. The effort failed. Some may argue that McCain's plan doesn't do enough to develop alternative fuels, or that his plan for new domestic oil drilling perpetuates the country's dependence on oil, but that doesn't mean McCain's energy plan is "a single-answer proposition" built around new oil drilling. It clearly is not. In fact, McCain's energy plan includes many provisions that have nothing to do with drilling. Schweitzer's claim isn't just false, it's ridiculously so.

pomt-14270	"There are no rules governing" the 2016 Republican convention, "the rules have not been set."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/08/john-kasich/no-rules-place-picking-gop-presidential-nominee-go/	Tell John Kasich he should drop out because he can’t amass enough delegates in the primaries and caucuses to win the Republican nomination for president, and he has a ready response. The Ohio governor will tell you he’s the GOP candidate best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton, should she be the Democratic nominee. So, the Kasich campaign forges on, with this hope: Neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz will earn the required 1,237 delegates prior to the party’s convention in July 2016 to win the nomination outright. That scenario would mean an "open" or "contested" convention in Cleveland, with Kasich aiming to persuade delegates to make him the nominee. On April 3, 2016, two days before he failed to win any delegates in Wisconsin’s primary, Kasich made a claim on ABC’s "This Week" that, if true, could bolster his chances to be the nominee. It was made during this exchange with host George Stephanopoulos: Stephanopoulos: You still have won only one state, however it is. You know under the current rules of the Republican National Committee, your only hope is to get to a contested convention. But under the current rules, you wouldn't even be eligible for the nomination, because you haven't picked up a majority of delegates in eight states. It doesn't appear that you're going to be able to do that. So how do you intend to get that rule changed? Kasich: Well, first of all, George, I'm not going to spend time on process. I have some of the best process people, you know, whether it's John Weaver or Charlie Black or Stu Spencer. But there are no rules governing the next convention. The rules have not been set. And we'll see what a rules committee decides to do. But I expect that we're going to be gaining momentum, picking up delegates and heading into the convention. What we found is Kasich is mostly on target. The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But then the rules can be changed. The process If all this sounds rather nerdy, consider that Google searches for "Republican convention rules" shot up by a factor of 100 in March 2016. As PolitiFact National explained in a primer on delegates, here’s what happens: On the Republican convention’s first ballot, nearly all of the 2,472 delegates are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their district or state. But if no candidate nabs the 1,237 votes needed on the first ballot, most delegates are released to support whomever they want on subsequent votes. Then there’s the 112 members of the rules committee. They determine convention guidelines, and they have the power to change rules at the convention. Should Trump (the GOP front runner, in terms of delegates) fail to nab the majority of delegates on the first ballot — and at this point, that looks entirely possible — the race becomes a fight for the support of those on the convention floor. Josh Putnam, one of the experts quoted in the primer, filled in a few more of the blanks for us. Putnam, who is a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia and founder of Frontloading HQ blog, which tracks the presidential primary calendar, said: The convention writes, tweaks and adopts its own rules. (But) the standard procedure is that the convention rules from one convention carry over to the next. There may be some subtle changes, but they largely carry over. So while there are only temporary rules now, they can serve as the baseline set of rules for this convention. As for the possibility of changing Rule 40 (b) -- Stephanopoulos’ reference to the requirement that a GOP candidate win eight states to be eligible for the nomination -- that has already been discussed. Politico reported in March 2016 that according to current and former Republican National Committee rules committee members, a Republican presidential candidate likely won’t have to abide by that rule. No number is in effect for the Cleveland convention, according to former Republican National Committee lawyer Ben Ginsberg, whom the article described as the party's preeminent election law expert. He said: "The 2016 convention and its rules committee has to make that decision. So there is no eight-state rule in effect right now for the next convention. The 2016 convention can make that number one, eight, 18, 28 or 58, if it wishes." Curly Haugland, a member of the convention’s rules committee from North Dakota, told Politico that rules 26 through 42 stood for the 2012 convention but are only temporary until the rules committee and order of business reports are adopted at the 2016 convention. In other words, those rules could remain, or they could be changed. Moreover, it’s still to be determined who will serve on the rules committee in Cleveland. Each state and territory delegation chooses two delegates to serve on the rules committee. Lest there be any debate about the potential for rules to be changed, the Republican National Committee itself says: A week before the convention, the 2016 Convention Rules Committee must convene to put together a package of rules to recommend for consideration by all delegates. The committee, after debate and discussion, adopts by majority vote a package of recommended rules that moves to the convention floor. Once a majority of the convention delegates adopt the report, the rules become the permanent rules governing that Convention. Our rating Kasich said "there are no rules governing" the 2016 Republican convention, "the rules have not been set." The 2016 convention will essentially start with the same rules that were in place for the 2012 convention. But the new rules committee for the 2016 convention can change any of the rules.

pomt-12688	The House Republican health care "plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/14/mick-mulvaney/mick-mulvaneys-misleading-claim-house-gop-health-c/	More than 10 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage because of expansions to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program that primarily serves low-income Americans. If Congress repeals the law known as Obamacare and replaces it with the leading Republican proposal, there could be as many as 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, compared to projections under current law, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, says the CBO analysis is wrong. "The CBO score assumes that if you are on Medicaid today that you choose to get off Medicaid after the mandate goes away," Mulvaney said to reporters March 13, speaking of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that most individuals purchase insurance. "Does that make sense to anybody? That you are on a free program — because the plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion." We decided to fact-check Mulvaney’s claim that the leading House Republican proposal — the American Health Care Act — "doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion." We found his claim misleading. While the legislation doesn’t explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, it reduces federal funding for the program to the point that many states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. How the Republican proposal stifles Medicaid expansion Individual states administer their own Medicaid programs, with financial assistance from the federal government, and each state sets its own specific parameters for Medicaid eligibility. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, 31 states and the District of Columbia opted to expand those parameters to include all people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line. On average, the federal government matches 57 percent of each state’s Medicaid expenditures. But it pays at least 90 percent for additional Medicaid enrollees who were made eligible by the expansion. The House Republican health care proposal says states can keep their expanded eligibility parameters. However, starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer pay extra for new Medicaid enrollees who are eligible because of the expansion — doing away with a vital component of the policy, the money. That means Medicaid costs would go way up for state governments that opted to continue their expanded programs. In order to maintain their current level of coverage, it would cost states an additional $253 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, the CBO and independent experts anticipate that states will decide to pull back from the Medicaid expansion, and states that were considering expanding their eligibility requirements in the coming years will decide against it. "States don't have the wherewithal to pick up all of the substantially increased burden — especially when the next recession comes," said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Further, in seven states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington — state law requires ending Medicaid expansion if the federal government lowers its funding rate, or if the state has to take action to keep its own Medicaid costs from going up, according to Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Michael Cannon, health policy studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute, presented a different outcome in a blog post criticizing the House proposal as "Obamacare lite — or worse." Cannon predicted that by allowing the expansion to continue until 2020, voters, state officials and special interests will resist eliminating it. The House proposal says the federal government would pay the enhanced rate for Medicaid expansion enrollees who got into the program prior to 2020, as long as they maintain continuous coverage. However, changes in income and family situation, and thus Medicaid eligibility, happen frequently among low-income adults. Experts anticipate few individuals enrolled before 2020 will be able to maintain continuous coverage — especially given that the law would add more stringent requirements for coverage renewal. "While this may seem like a reasonable way to protect coverage for those who already have it, in practice this means that the Medicaid expansion would wither on the vine and could shrink to nearly nothing in just a few short years," wrote Harvard University health policy professor Benjamin Sommers in the Washington Post. Our ruling Mulvaney said the House Republican health care "plan doesn't get rid of Medicaid expansion." The House Republican health care proposal does not explicitly repeal the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. But by wringing out the funding that supports the expansion starting in 2020, experts predict states will have little choice but to abandon some or all of the expansion. In seven states, it’s actually required by state law. Mulvaney’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

We’ve seen them win big mayor’s races in New Hampshire. Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected." We wanted to know whether Democrats gained 50 seats formerly held by Republicans since Trump’s election. The bulk of Lewandowski’s count is backed up by legislative races. The trend even played out in the very district Lewandowski was trying to keep red, with Good beating out Buchanan for the Sarasota seat on Feb. 13. However, we could not verify Lewandowski’s exact figure because he is counting small municipal elections, which can be hard to track. We could not reach him for this fact-check. We documented 39 Democratic takeaways Many experts we spoke to referred us to an analysis by Daily Kos Elections, which shows that Democrats took 36 seats, as of Feb. 11, 2018. (The Daily Kos is liberal political website. We verified the races on the spreadsheet.) The total includes special election victories, such as Democrat Doug Jones’ win over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama and the special election for a state Senate seat in Wisconsin’s 10th District. It also includes regular elections. For example, Democrats picked up 15 seats in the Virginia statehouse and a few more seats in New Jersey on Election Day in 2017. The Daily Kos list, however, doesn’t include Democrat Phil Murphy’s win over Republican Kim Guadagno in the general election to succeed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor’s race brings the initial total to 37 Democratic gains. We found a slightly lower total from Geoffrey Skelley, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley found that Democrats have gained 33 seats on net in special elections for state and federal legislature and elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Unlike the Daily Kos, Skelley’s net total reflects that Republicans took three seats away from Democrats in special elections and one seat away in New Jersey. From here, we tried to find examples of municipal races where Democrats won seats from Republicans — not an easy task. There is no database of smaller municipal elections nationwide. Further, municipal elections are often nonpartisan races, so candidates aren’t officially latched to one party or the other. With those limitations, we searched news stories. An article by the Huffington Post about "historic victories" by Democrats on Nov. 7, 2017, includes two clear-cut examples of Democratic mayoral candidates beating Republican incumbents, including the Manchester, N.H., mayor’s race that Lewandowski mentioned in his speech. Adding those races to the highest number of state-level wins brings our verified total to at least 39 flipped seats for Democrats. The big picture Regardless of the exact number, there’s no denying Lewandowski’s point: Democrats have won a significant number of elections since Trump won the presidency. "Bottom line is that President Trump is energizing the Democratic Party," said Nathan Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for Congress, governorships and president. Skelley said that the shift "reflects the pendulum-swing nature of politics." "Given the fact that Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama’s time in office, including a multitude of losses in his first midterm cycle in 2010, I don’t think Democratic gains in the early days of Trump’s presidency are unprecedented," Skelley said. Our ruling Lewandowski said, "Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected." We found evidence of almost 40 seats that flipped from Republican to Democratic control since Trump took office. The bulk happened at the state legislative level. However, Lewandowski is also counting small municipal elections, which are harder to track. We found a couple of examples of Democratic mayors beating Republican incumbents. Beyond mayor’s races, it’s hard to say a seat flipped when some local elections are nonpartisan. We could not reach Lewandowski to explain how he got to 50. Given that we couldn’t duplicate Lewandowski’s total but he’s right about the trend, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06194	Says the paperback edition of Mitt Romney's book deleted line that Massachusetts' individual mandate "should be the model for the country"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romneys-book-deleted-line-mas/	Rick Perry was smart to say he's not in the betting business. Mitt Romney's $10,000 health care wager at a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 10, 2011 had pundits declaring him "rich, elite, and out of touch." ("Romney bombed with a bet"!) But was he right on the merits? The subject of bet-worthy disagreement was well-worn territory: The Texas governor declared that Romney's book No Apology called his Massachusetts health care law "the model for the country," including its individual mandate that people buy health insurance. That is, until the line was deleted from a later version of the book, Perry said. Perry kept up the familiar refrain on the next day's Fox News Sunday: "The issue of individual mandates is still at the center here, and Mitt can deny this as many times as he wants, but in his first book, hardcover, of No Apologies, he clearly stated that individual mandate should be the model for this country. And then he took that out of the book, in the paperback, and that's the fact, and even a $10,000 bet is not gonna cover that." PolitiFact has peeked into Perry's book claims before, so we were ready to rule on this one. The exchange In a September debate, Perry accused Romney of removing a line that the Massachusetts health care law was exactly what the American people needed. We found that claim Mostly False. In this debate, Perry focused his rhetoric on the "individual mandate" — a controversial requirement of President Barack Obama's federal health care law that everyone buy health insurance. It was also part of Romney's state health care law. Perry said that both Romney and Newt Gingrich "have been for the individual mandate." Romney fired back that "as (House) speaker, Gingrich said that he was for a federal individual mandate. That's something I've always opposed. What we did in our state was designed by the people in our state for the needs of our state. You believe in the 10th Amendment. I believe in the 10th Amendment." Soon, the wager war broke out: PERRY: "Well, I'm listening to you, Mitt, and I'm hearing you say all the right things. But I read your first book, and it said in there that your mandate in Massachusetts, which should be the model for the country -- and I know it came out of the reprint of the book, but, you know, I'm just saying, you were for individual mandates, my friend." ROMNEY: "You know what, you've raised that before, Rick. And you're simply wrong." PERRY: "It was true then ..." ROMNEY: "No, no ..." PERRY: "And it's true now." ROMNEY: "Rick, I'll tell you what ..." (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: "... 10,000 bucks? $10,000 bet?" PERRY: "I'm not in the betting business ..." ROMNEY: "Oh, okay." PERRY: "... but I'll show you the" ROMNEY: "I wrote the ..." PERRY: "I'll show you the book." ROMNEY: "I've got the book and ..." (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: "And I wrote the book. And I have it. And Chapter 7, there's a section called "The Massachusetts Model," and I say as close, as I can quote, I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens. "And then I go on to talk about the states being the laboratories of democracy, and we can learn from one another. I have not said in that book, first edition or the latest edition, anything about our plan being a national model imposed on the nation. The right course for America -- and I've said this during the debates last time around; I'll say it now and time again -- is to let individual states -- this is a remarkable nation. This idea of federalism is so extraordinary. Let states craft their own solutions. Don't have ObamaCare put on us by the federal government." Who got it right, Perry or Romney? What the books say Perry's grievance is with differences between hardcover and paperback editions of Romney's book. We've combed through Chapter 7 of both. Romney's changes to the book have been explored before, by Boston political journalist David S. Bernstein. He noted in February 2011 that Romney had added harsher language on the national health care law as passed: "Obamacare will not work and should be repealed," and, "Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states." Romney more clearly explained ways that he disagreed with implementation of the Massachusetts law. He also changed this line, which came after a paragraph touting the success of the Massachusetts health plan: Hardcover: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." To: Paperback: "And it was done without government taking over health care." The deleted 11 words, "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country" are the crux of Perry's argument. His campaign sent e-mail the day after the debate with a link highlighting precisely that change. It looks suspicious, right? Perhaps Romney did extol every piece of his Massachusetts plan, individual mandate and all, for every state in the union. But here's the original quote with full context from Page 177 of the hardcover: "My own preference would be to let each state fashion its own program to meet the distinct needs of its citizens. States could follow the Massachusetts model of they choose, or they could develop plans of their own. These plans, tested in the state 'laboratories of democracy' could be evaluated, compared, improved upon, and adopted by others. But the creation of a national plan is the direction in which Washington is currently moving. If a national approach is ultimately adopted, we should permit individuals to purchase insurance from companies in other states in order to expand choice and competition. "What we accomplished surprised us: 440,000 people who previously had no health insurance became insured, many paying their own way. We made it possible for each newly insured person to have better care, and ultimately healthier and longer lives. From now on, no one in Massachusetts has to worry about losing his or her health insurance if there is a job change or a loss in income; everyone is insured and pays only what he or she can afford. It's portable, affordable health insurance — something people have been talking about for decades. We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." Romney's not really saying the Massachusetts law "should be the model for the country," the way that Perry describes it. He's in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice. It's like a shout-out to other state leaders: Hey, you can have what Massachusetts has! And it's consistent with what Romney fired back at Perry in the Sept. 22, 2011 debate: "This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan." And with how he characterized his own book in the most recent debate: "I say, in my view, each state should be able to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens." Romney did support Massachusetts' individual mandate. But we don't see evidence in his hardcover book that he supported a federal one, much less that he removed such a reference from later editions. Our ruling Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence. But that line was preceded by an argument for state-level solutions, exactly the argument Romney extends now. That's not how Perry characterized it. So he did win that bet — by not betting. We rule his claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-12-11T13:10:37	2011-12-10	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-05918	"The Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/31/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-would-impo/	Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a "war against religion." Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said. "Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration," he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012. What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops of a Jan. 20 decision that "ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans," according to the group. The bishops said "almost every employer and insurer." We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration "would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance"? 'The Obamacare standard' The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care. We should mention: There's not a clear "Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance." The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover "essential health benefits." They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states. The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include "all FDA-approved forms of contraception." So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services. Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptions Notice we said that "most" health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said "almost every employer and insurer." Gingrich said, "every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution." But the rule provides an exemption for "certain non-profit religious employers" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. It's that definition of "religious employer" that has prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups. That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ella can be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA. The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them. The decision already faces legal challenges from Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University. Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a "Catholic institution," or a synagogue to be a "Jewish institution," Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services. Our ruling Gingrich said that "the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance." He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket "Obamacare standard" for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans. Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would "impose on every ... institution" inaccurate and misleading.

Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on allegations of false marketing by Trump University. It wasn’t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states. The university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was "great." "They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks," Trump said on Meet the Press on Feb. 28, 2016. And he added, "We have an A from the Better Business Bureau." HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER We went to the Better Business Bureau website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, "This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business." Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, "When the school was operational it was rated A." We asked Hicks to document that rating and didn’t hear back. Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don’t provide any ratings from previous years. But the organization issued a statement that "Over the years, the company’s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-." We don’t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade, but based on the Internet Archive, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus. That assessment showed up in plenty of news articles. That year, the New York Daily News reported that "the Better Business Bureau in January slapped a D-minus rating on Trump U., a rating now under review after Trump U. objected." CBS News said the same thing in an April 21, 2010, article. And in May, 2011, the New York Times wrote "The Better Business Bureau gave the school a D-minus for 2010, its second-lowest grade, after receiving 23 complaints." The Washington Post had the same information in May 2011 when it reported that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the Trump Entrepreneur Institute. The Attorney General’s Office did file charges but stumbled on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed. The matter is under appeal. Under the new name Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, ratings ranged from C to B between 2012 and 2014. We found no ratings at all for the past two years. Our ruling Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that "we have an ‘A’ from the Better Business Bureau." Literally speaking, that is inaccurate. The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because it’s no longer a going concern. Trump University had an A at some point. The Better Business Bureau doesn't release details of its past ratings, but it did say Trump's program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D-. What we do know, from several published reports and archived Web pages, is that the university had a D in 2010 and under its new name, had ratings ranging from C to B, with no ratings after March 2014. Trump’s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the university’s lower Better Business Bureau scores. We rate it False.

pomt-05607	Says Mitt Romney said "we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/28/rick-santorum/santorum-accuses-romney-favoring-high-gas-prices-m/	How is Mitt Romney similar to Barack Obama? He likes high gas prices, according to rival Rick Santorum. Campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of the state primary, Santorum spoke to a crowd in Racine on March 25, 2012. In this video clip, he skewers Romney’s past statements on gasoline prices and what to do about them. "Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney," Santorum said. We decided to check whether that’s a fair paraphrase of Romney’s words. Romney’s words then Santorum’s campaign spokesman, Hogan Gidley, pointed us to a post on the conservative blog Poor Richard’s News from March 22, 2012. The blog post, as well as others in the Washington Post and the New Republic, unearthed a story from 2006 when Romney was governor of Massachusetts. Gas prices had risen that spring, and Romney and Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey were asked at a press conference about possible remedies. The two disagreed over suspending the state’s 23 ½ cent per gallon gas tax -- Healey favored it, while Romney said a tax break would only encourage more consumption. "I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not sure there will be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline," Romney said, according to the Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass. Romney said he preferred to press for more fuel-efficient vehicles rather than reduce prices, the story said, and quoted Romney, "I’m very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay." An Associated Press story from the same press conference provided a longer quote from Romney: "I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation," the AP wrote. Santorum’s words now Santorum attributed three different ideas to Romney: * Americans are going to have to live with high gas prices. * That's a good thing because it will reduce consumption. * America shouldn’t produce any more gasoline. The first is an accurate paraphrase. Romney said high prices are "probably here to stay." In the second one, Santorum is misstating what Romney said. Romney's statement wasn't a value judgment that high prices were beneficial. It was a practical argument in favor of finding ways to deal with high prices. In the third idea he attributed to Romney, that America shouldn't produce any more gasoline, Santorum veered off the path completely. Nowhere in the Patriot Ledger or Associated Press coverage does Romney (or anyone else) mention gasoline production or drilling. Our ruling Santorum said: "Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney." In 2006, during another fuel price spike, Romney said he believed high prices were "here to stay," and he struck a practical tone, suggesting that should lead to greater conservation and efficiency. He said there may never be a right time to push for more gas use. Those are points fairly summed up in Santorum’s remarks. But Romney didn't make a value judgment that high gas prices a "good thing." And he completely misrepresented Romney’s position when he said the former Massachusetts governor opposed increasing production. In the situation in 2006, Romney simply didn’t address that topic. On balance, we rate Santorum’s claim Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-28T12:08:58	2012-03-25	['None']

pomt-08579	"The size of our federal government has more than doubled since the year 2000."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/27/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-federal-spending-has-doubled-2000/	Like many Republican candidates this year, Scott Bruun is hoping to beat Democratic incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader by taking aim at government spending. Bruun says the country is awash in debt, weighed down by taxes, and spending money in a way that "insults drunken sailors." He also says this: "The size of our federal government has more than doubled since the year 2000.’’ First, it’s important to note that Bruun was referring to total spending. He made his comment in a statement on his campaign’s website in a longer discussion about federal spending. At first glance, it appears he is right. His campaign cited numbers from the federal Office of Management and Budget that show total federal spending in 2000 was $1.78 trillion. By 2009, spending increased to $3.5 trillion. So that’s about double in unadjusted dollars. But if you account for inflation, the spending total is $1.78 trillion in 2000 and goes to $2.29 trillion in 2009. That’s only a 29 percent increase. And other ways of measuring the size of the federal government also come up far short of "double." Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an independent think tank that studies federal spending and budgets, says the more accurate way to judge the government’s fiscal posture is to consider spending relative to the country’s gross domestic product, or GDP. That way, you’re getting a more holistic view since the calculation compares spending to the size of the overall economy. Using that approach, government spending as part of GDP went from 18.2 percent in 2000 to 24.7 percent in 2009. That increase is also far short of the doubling that Bruun claimed. Contrast those numbers to those hit during the peak of World War II -- 43.6 percent of GDP in both 1943 and 1944. It’s also worth looking at the size of the federal workforce, which has increased only slightly. The total federal personnel, which includes the military, has grown from 4.1 million in 2000 to 4.4 million in 2009. So that, too, is not close to double. So it’s quite a stretch for Bruun to make that claim. When you adjust the number for inflation, measure it as a percentage of GDP and check the size of the federal workforce, it is far short of double. We find his claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

abbc-00251	As the debate around the Australian Marriage Law Survey rolls on, there has been plenty of talk on both sides about rights and consequences.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-03/fact-check-same-sex-marriage-equality-lgbt-tony-abbott/8992846	Mr Abbott's claim is exaggerated. On paper, same-sex couples in a settled relationship do have the same broad set of rights as opposite-sex couples who are married. This is because, over more than a decade, federal, state and territory governments have made real efforts to standardise the rights of same-sex, de facto and married couples. At a federal level, the Rudd government introduced significant reforms over a broad range of policy areas in 2008. And all states (except WA) and the ACT allow same-sex couples to obtain official registration of their relationship. This makes it easier for them to prove their relationship when asked. Meanwhile, IVF treatment is open to same-sex couples Australia-wide, and same-sex couples (outside of the NT) can adopt children. But on a practical basis, same-sex couples have to deal with administrative hassle and uncertainty that opposite-sex married couples never have to face. Those who have not (or cannot) register their relationship may have to prove their de facto status when dealing with hospitals, Centrelink and other areas of government. This can lead to same-sex couples having to disclose personal information to strangers or faceless government officials, which can be invasive and traumatic, particularly during a partner's illness or if some branches of the family do not get along. By contrast, married people can simply use their marriage certificate as proof of their relationship. Same-sex couples also must hope that government officials in health, welfare or other areas understand the complexities of the law around de facto relationships and will apply it correctly. A married couple knows their relationship will be recognised even in the most shambolic of bureaucratic systems.

pomt-06058	Says the state tax burden per citizen in New York is twice as high as in Florida.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/scott-says-new-yorkers-pay-twice-much-floridians-s/	Gov. Rick Scott, Florida's CEO in chief, often talks about making cold calls to companies in chilly cities as part of his effort to lure them here and create Florida jobs. In his second State of the State address, he called out the state of New York by name. "And I should add, to all of our friends in New York, come on down!" he said in the Jan. 10, 2012, speech, adding an unscripted shout-out to Illinois, too. "Our temperature outdoors is about twice as high as yours, and your (state) tax burden per citizen is about twice as high as ours. Those are good numbers for us." A clever play on words. But is he right? The U.S. Census Bureau keeps tabs on state tax collections each year. In 2010, New York's state taxes were $63.5 billion. Florida's state collections were half as low at $31.5 billion. Scott brought up the state's tax burden per citizen, which represents total tax collections divided by population. In 2010, New York's figure was $3,278, and Florida's was $1,675. State tax collection per capita in New York is very close to double, at about 97 percent more than Florida's, at least in 2010. By the way, part of the disparity between New York and Florida's tax collections is New York's personal income tax. Florida is one of seven states without one. Scott is right about the statistic, but the figure doesn't tell the whole story. For one, his measure does not factor in local taxes. That's important because Florida ranks highest in the country for its reliance on local taxes, which include property taxes. Using this measure, and 2009 figures, New York's tax collections would be about 90 percent more than Florida's, not 97 percent, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research. There are also different ways economists measure tax burden. Some use the per capita method, as cited by Scott, but others cite what portion of your income goes to pay taxes. That rate was 9.3 percent for state and local taxes in Florida in 2009 and 14.3 percent in New York, according to figures from TaxWatch, a business-backed policy group. The disparity is smaller using this method. A lower tax burden isn't the only way to measure the state of a state, though. As economists from the New York-based, left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute pointed out, New York produced the country's second-fastest growth in gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2010. Florida trailed at 40th place. A similar dynamic played out in personal income growth: New York ranked second while Florida ranked 46th, according to a report generated by the Fiscal Policy Institute. "This raises the question about what relative tax burdens really mean: Does a lower tax burden mean a less dynamic, robust economy?" wrote James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist. "2010 data could suggest that." There are other factors to consider, too. Unemployment remains higher in Florida (10 percent as of November 2011) than New York (7.9 percent as of November 2011). Wages for the average working family are more in New York than in Florida by about $6,000, according to a 2009 study. And you could argue New Yorkers get more for their tax dollars in areas such as mass transit. Still, low taxes are attractive to many. "If people believe that Florida provides services to them that are as good as New York, or at least acceptable, than a lower tax burden could be attractive," said Mark Robyn, Tax Foundation economist. Our ruling Scott correctly cites that New York's state tax burden per person is twice as much as it is in Florida, and no doubt this fact could be attractive to businesses thinking of moving to Florida. But businesses likely consider more than just tax burden when thinking of where to locate their businesses, and some states with higher tax rates have more robust economies. Still, if you want to count Florida's positives for business, a low tax burden is surely one of them. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-03881	Of $60 billion Congress approved in response to Hurricane Sandy, "only 10 percent was for disaster relief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/06/al-cardenas/al-cardenas-says-60b-congress-approved-after-hurri/	In the weeks since Congress approved aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, conservatives have explained their opposition by saying the bill was loaded with political pork. Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida who now heads the American Conservative Union, said the vast majority of the bill went beyond disaster relief. "Congress just adopted a $60 billion stimulus package, of which only 10 percent was for disaster relief. Now, I can't for the life of me understand why a good conservative would want to promote the $60 billion pork barrel bill, when in reality all we needed to do was approve a $10 billion disaster relief bill," Cardenas told MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March 1, 2013. Is it true that of the $60 billion, just 10 percent was for disaster relief? 10 percent Sandy, a hurricane so sprawling it's often called a "superstorm," hit the United States in late October, devastating parts of the Atlantic coast, particularly New York and New Jersey. A company that models risk for insurance companies estimated a few days after the storm insured losses of $10 billion to $20 billion and economic damage of $30 billion to $50 billion. The governors of New York and New Jersey requested billions in federal aid. But an emergency spending package died in the House in December 2012 in the breathless last hours of the 112th Congress, as lawmakers passed a deal to avert the fiscal cliff. Christie blamed House Speaker John Boehner. On Jan. 4, Congress passed a bill to increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency by $9.7 billion to process flood claims. On Jan. 28, it passed H.R. 152, a separate $50.5 billion package. Of that $50.5 billion, $17 billion went toward immediate Sandy aid, while $33.5 billion was for "near- and long-term assistance and mitigation," according to a Congressional Quarterly analysis. Nearly all the money was handled as emergency spending — conveniently allowing lawmakers to ignore caps on discretionary spending. It’s less clear, however, exactly how much of it was ultimately for "disaster relief" — a definition that changes depending on whom you ask. Still, potential spending for flood insurance alone — nearly $10 billion — was more than the 10 percent (or $6 billion) that Cardenas claimed. Add in the $17 billion that House Republicans called "immediate support to the victims and communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy" — aid such as emergency food assistance, Army Corps of Engineers repairs, disaster loans, small business grants, and training and employment services — and it totals at least 40 percent without even considering longer-term aid in the bill. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Jan. 29. We asked the American Conservative Union about Cardenas' comments. The 10 percent? "He misspoke," said Larry Hart, ACU’s director of government relations. "You can see in the next sentence, which uses the figure of $10 billion," Hart said. But our calculations show that number is also wrong. Did he mean the appropriations for flood insurance? Some part of the $17 billion package? "He was saying that the estimate was that there was about $10 billion in emergency aid needed," Hart said. "He was not doing a legal budget analysis of the bill." We pointed out that Cardenas had made similar comments in an email to Politico, saying the "$60-plus billion pork barrel bill" contained "only $9 billion in disaster assistance." We didn’t get any further explanation of the number. Instead, Hart maintained that "the exact figure is not the issue" and cited spending in the full $60.2 billion package that wasn’t "immediate disaster relief," such as: • $3.5 billion for the Corps of Engineers for future mitigation efforts to protect against climate change. • $17 billion in Community Development Block Grants for any states with disaster declarations since 2011, because of their history as "a political slush fund," especially since $2 billion was "to mitigate future risks, not existing damage." • $2 billion for U.S. Housing and Urban Development to be used for "long-term recovery … and economic revitalization." • $200 million for Health and Human Services "to be used at the discretion of the secretary." • $5.3 billion in transportation money that can be used for projects "related to reducing risk of damage from future disasters." Of course, on MSNBC, Cardenas didn’t specify "immediate" disaster relief. Still, Taxpayers for Common Sense identified billions in H.R. 152 that wasn’t Sandy-related, including $2 billion for the federal highway system and $25 million to improve weather forecasting. Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan budget group, pointed out that it’s hard to say what percentage of the emergency spending package will ultimately go for disaster relief. "I can't tell you what percent is disaster relief until I see where it gets spent," he said. A big portion of the $17 billion in "immediate" assistance, more than $5 billion, went to replenish FEMA’s disaster relief fund, which may fund relief from future disasters, Ellis said. It’s not yet clear where funding for some other agencies, such as Housing and Urban Development and the Army Corps of Engineers, will go. Meanwhile, of the $9.7 billion to authorize additional borrowing for FEMA’s flood insurance program, some could go toward relief from future disasters, he said. Still, Cardenas suggested just $6 billion of Congress’ aid package "was for disaster relief." But just the very narrow appropriations for FEMA’s disaster relief fund and flood insurance program more than double that number, even if it may not all go to Sandy victims. Our ruling Cardenas was specific with his numbers, but his own organization says he misspoke. Our math shows that the $15 billion for FEMA disaster relief and flood insurance alone are more than double what Cardenas claimed. And while Ellis raises some valid questions about how much of the $60 billion package will ultimately go to disaster relief, we find it will be significantly more than Cardenas said. We rate his statement False.	None	Al Cardenas	None	None	None	2013-03-06T16:44:05	2013-03-01	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-01464	The non-profit group Feeding America is lying when it claims "that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily" in the United States.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/01/william-benson-huber/ny-post-op-ed-rebuts-starving-children-claim-was-n/	September was an unusual month for the people who focus on whether Americans are getting enough food to keep them healthy. Early in the month, a Wall Street Journal contributor took the federal government to task for "distorting" the numbers on food insecurity. At the end of September, the New York Post carried an op-ed with the headline, Feeding America: ‘Public service' lies. Feeding America is a large nonprofit that raises money and secures food donations on behalf of food banks nationwide. The Post op-ed written by William Benson Huber zeroed in on the organization’s message in its public service announcements. Huber opened his op-ed with a quote from a radio ad, "People say I’m a pretty good kid. Why, in a country as rich as America, should I have to go to bed hungry?" The ads, writes Huber, "inform us of a horror we’d otherwise think impossible: America has so failed its children that 17 million — one in five — don’t have enough to eat. Except that, enjoyable as all this self-loathing might seem, it’s simply a fairy tale." Huber, who is a marketing consultant and not a full-time Post employee, then challenged Feeding America’s "nonsensical claim that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily." "The only basis for Feeding America’s claim comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys in which heads of households were asked if at any time during a calendar year their children were a) unable to eat what they wanted; b) unable to eat in whatever quantity they wanted; c) forced to eat cheaper brands, or d) afraid their food supply might run out on any single day." In this fact-check, we focus on Huber’s statement that Feeding America misled the public when it said that "one in five kids is fighting starvation daily." As it turns out, we can find no evidence that Feeding America ever made that claim. We asked Huber, and he backed away from it. "The words they use about going to bed hungry seems to me to be starving," Huber said. "I applied that word to their language." Feeding America spokesman Ross Fraser told PunditFact that his organization is very careful with its language, and it never speaks of kids starving. "We say ‘facing hunger,’ or ‘at risk of hunger,’ or ‘on the precipice of hunger,’ " Fraser said. "Because the federal government’s data is not about hunger. It’s about food insecurity." We’ll get into the federal data in just a bit, but beyond denying that Feeding America speaks of starvation, Fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry. "We don’t have any public service announcements that use that," Fraser said. Ellyn Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Ad Council, the corporate-backed nonprofit that distributes the announcements, was equally emphatic. "I have confirmed that we have never used the line you are referring to in a PSA," Fisher said. The radio and video segments we found on the Ad Council website did not contain the language Huber cited. Huber said he wrote it down but he was not able to provide any further proof. Our search of the Internet Archive, a massive compendium of audio, video and text posted on the Internet, also came up empty. Huber also named two celebrity spokeswomen for Feeding America, Paula Deen and Beyonce, that the organization said had not been part of its public service efforts. Huber later told us that Deen had done some work for New York food banks, but that, "strictly speaking I don't know if she had an audio PSA." Further, Huber acknowledged that in order to shorten the piece, he paraphrased the questions he drew from the Agriculture Department’s survey. Here are the actual statements and questions put to families: 1. "We relied on only a few kinds of low-cost food to feed our children because we were running out of money to buy food." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 2. "We couldn’t feed our children a balanced meal, because we couldn’t afford that." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 3. "The children were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food." Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 4. In the last 12 months, did you ever cut the size of any of the children’s meals because there wasn’t enough money for food? 5. In the last 12 months, were the children ever hungry but you just couldn’t afford more food? 6. In the last 12 months, did any of the children ever skip a meal because there wasn’t enough money for food? 7. (If yes to question 6) How often did this happen—almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only 1 or 2 months? 8. In the last 12 months did any of the children ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food? Number of children facing hunger To the casual reader, Feeding America’s claim that one in five children faces hunger might sound as though one in five kids actually goes hungry. The organization provides a more nuanced view on its website, and we wanted to lay out the numbers here. The summaries all go back to those USDA questions. The Agriculture Department staff told us that they order these questions by the severity of the situation they describe. The fifth question, about the children being hungry because of a lack of money, triggers the department's most worrisome category of "very low food security." In the latest survey, about 765,000, or 1 percent of all children, lived in families where the answer was "yes." The government uses the less severe category, "low food security," for children who live in families where, at the very least, a lack of money meant the kids couldn’t get a balanced meal during the last 12 months. The number of children in that group, plus the very low security group, is about 8.5 million, or about 11.7 percent of all children. The most commonly heard statistic, that one in five children live in food insecure households, refers to the 15.7 million kids that live in families in which, at the very least, anyone in the household of any age couldn’t afford a balanced meal at some point during the year. This includes adults and children. Deborah Frank, a pediatrician at the Boston University School of Medicine and member of the National Commission on Hunger, said many studies show that simply living in a low food security household is enough to undercut a child’s well being. "The hurt can be lasting, Frank said. "If it cuts into how much kids learn, if it makes them less healthy, and how healthy a baby they have, these are all ways that children are hurt by not having enough of the right kinds of food." Frank and Feeding America noted that the problem in America is less about children having enough calories, and more about the nutritional quality of the food they eat. Our ruling Huber said that Feeding America was lying when it said kids were starving in America. Huber acknowledged that "starving" was his word, not the nonprofit’s. The sentence about children "going to bed hungry" was essential to Huber’s argument, but we could find no evidence that Feeding America ever used that phrase. Feeding America also denied using that phrase. While Huber insisted it was accurate, he was unable to provide any evidence. One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. Huber has none. As such, we rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	William Benson Huber	None	None	None	2014-10-01T14:49:27	2014-09-28	['United_States']
pomt-09026	"Crime is down in Arizona."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/07/al-hunt/bloombergs-al-hunt-says-crime-down-arizona/	The debate about immigration often involves discussions about whether illegal immigrants cause more crime. The topic came up on ABC's This Week on July 4, 2010, when Al Hunt, the executive editor in Washington for Bloomberg News, criticized John McCain for the Republican senator's comments about crime in Arizona. McCain had explained his shift on immigration by saying, "The violence is incredibly high. The human smuggling and drug cartels are at a level of violence where 25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have been murdered in the last few years, 5,000 already this year. There's a level of violence which has increased to a significant degree, which makes the situation far different than it was in 2007" when the Senate last considered immigration reform. He added, "But I invite the president to come to the border, and he can see for himself the absolute necessity of getting our border secure before more violence spills over onto our side of the border... It is not the same as it was in 2007. And the people deserve not to have our ranchers murdered, not to have a deputy shot by a drug smuggler with an AK-47 in Pinal County. The situation has dramatically changed, and the statistics absolutely back that up." During the roundtable discussion on This Week, Hunt told host Jake Tapper: "I must say, John McCain, in his interview with you, Jake, that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's talking about Mexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic study that's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes." It is unclear whether McCain was suggesting that crime in Arizona was up because of illegal immigrants, but we were curious about Hunt's claim that crime in Arizona -- a state that ranks 6th for the estimated population of illegal immigrants -- was down. Because Hunt did not specify the types of crime, we'll examine all types. We checked the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports as well as data from Arizona's Department of Public Safety and found Hunt is correct that crime is down. From 2004 to 2008, data from Arizona's DPS shows a 23 percent drop in the overall crime rate, while the FBI's statistics on Arizona show a 19 percent drop. Although the FBI has not released all of the data on 2009, Arizona's statistics show the crime rate in 2009 dropped an additional 12 percent. "Crime has been going down, overall, in Arizona," said Tony LaRose, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Tampa, but he noted it has been a national trend for the past almost three decades." The trend holds even if you only measure violent crime, which James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said is the type of crime people think of when discussing crime and illegal immigrants. The violent crime rate fell 11 percent from 2004 to 2008 in Arizona. Whether or not Hunt was correctly interpreting McCain's comments is outside of the scope of the claim, but he is right about Arizona crime going down. So we rate Hunt's claim True.

pomt-08769	On running a "civil and polite" campaign.	half flip	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/25/roy-barnes/georgia-gubernatorial-hopeful-roy-barnes-says-its-/	Former and would-be governor Roy Barnes declared recently that it's possible to do what few politicians dare try: run a "civil and polite" campaign. At the end of a Republican runoff rife with name-calling and false accusations, Barnes, a Democrat, gave morning anchors at Channel 2 Action News a homily on political civility "I think that you can show differences without being mean," Barnes said Aug. 11. "You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names. "But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that." Barnes has worked to live by his words, his campaign spokesman Emil Runge said. So Barnes thinks it's possible to run a respectful campaign. Has he run one? AJC PolitiFact Georgia pulled out its Flip-O-Meter, which we keep on our desk next to our Truth-O-Meter. Politicians commonly shift their positions over time, sometimes for good reasons. The Flip-O-Meter determines whether such a shift has taken place. In an earlier item, PolitiFact Georgia ruled a claim by Barnes that he ran an all-positive TV ad campaign during the Democratic primary as Mostly True. His eight commercials generally took on a positive tone. They did not single out or criticize specific primary opponents, although he did take jabs at the state Legislature. At the time, Barnes didn't have to go negative. He polled way ahead of his challengers, and it was to his advantage to keep his party unified while Republicans squabbled. Times have changed. Recent polls put Barnes either behind Republican nominee Nathan Deal or in a dead heat. And when candidates are behind, they tend to run negative commercials, political experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Those experts agree with Barnes that it's important for a candidate to demonstrate how he differs from the competition. That's the whole point of campaigning. And if one candidate has serious, legitimate problems, his opposition should mention it. So what's negative campaigning? And how do you avoid it? It's hard to say, said Richard Lau, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has studied political messages for decades. "Negative" is often in the eye of the beholder, Lau said. The candidate making the unflattering accusations thinks he's telling the truth. His rival thinks he's the victim of a negative attack. Deal does. Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said Barnes has run a "100 percent" negative television ad campaign since Deal clinched his party's nomination this month. Barnes' camp, however, thinks Georgians deserve to know about the issues the ads raise, Runge said. Further complicating things is that much of political rhetoric, even the milder stuff, is way out of line in everyday life. You'd think twice about telling a fellow parishioner at a church picnic that he has ethical problems. "You wouldn't say this face to face to a friend or acquaintance," said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. So AJC PolitiFact Georgia's yardstick is the etiquette of political discussion, not a church picnic. And we acknowledge there is a spectrum of ads that can be perceived as "negative" that includes outrageous, vicious lies on one end and legitimate comparisons at the other. Barnes' campaign has released three new TV commercials since the day of the runoff. In this item, we'll see whether he stays on the right side of the line. "The Newspaper Says" Barnes' first post-primary ad, "The Newspaper Says," came out Aug. 10, the day of the Republican gubernatorial runoff. "This great state is falling behind," an announcer begins. A finger clicks through what appear to be newspaper articles on a touch-screen tablet computer about mortgage foreclosures, an ethics investigation and job losses. The headlines come from actual articles. "Do we continue down the same path, with the same team that gave us ethics violations, teacher furloughs, tax breaks to special interests, homes foreclosed and misplaced priorities? Or do we work our way back?" the announcer asks. The ad is critical of "the same team" and "more of the same," but the announcer doesn't portray any individual or government body in a negative light. All the issues it raises are real and stated accurately. "Newspapers Deal" Barnes' second ad, released Aug. 13, is much like the first one. The finger's there. So's the touch-screen. It opens with the same words: "This great state is falling behind." But this one calls out Deal by name, accusing him of being "distracted" with "ethical charges" as the state suffers. The ad closes with "Nathan Deal: just more of the same." Deal's name appears on a rusty real estate-type 'For Sale' sign, which breaks and tumbles to the ground. This ad raises ethics accusations against Deal that are well established by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news organizations. The headlines it uses come from actual articles. The description of the complaints is mindful of the fact that while a congressional ethics investigation found that Deal possibly violated U.S. House rules, he resigned from Congress in March before any formal accusation was made. The ad's finale strays from an everyday definition of "polite," but overall, the ad is well-sourced and carefully worded. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel called Deal far worse in the Republican runoff. "Hiding" Barnes' "Hiding," released Aug. 18, is his most aggressive so far. It gives Deal a loopy sound effect: a slide whistle. "Roy Barnes released 25 years of tax returns. Online," it says. "Nathan Deal refuses to disclose his income taxes." A cutout of Deal's head appears. His eyes and nose peer over the words: "What is he hiding this time?" That slide whistle blows, and the rusty real estate sign breaks apart once more. Then comes the unflattering slogan from the last commercial: "Nathan Deal. Just more of the same." Deal declined to release his tax returns but may in the future. The ad also appears on a website PolitiFact Georgia found Friday, www.whatisdealhiding.com. It asks, "Did his backroom deals as a Congressman break the law as has been charged? We have a right to know." And it offers readers the chance to sign a petition. There are a couple of problems with this. "What is he hiding?" is insinuation. And the site treats accusations of "backroom deals" as fact. So is Barnes running a "polite" and "civil" campaign? All of Barnes' ads, even his most aggressive one, "Hiding," raise legitimate issues such as ethics accusations against Deal. For the most part, they portray those issues accurately. But as time has passed, the imagery and language show Barnes' campaign has changed in tone. Consider the slide whistle and the cutout of Deal's head and the "backroom deals" accusation. Our experts agreed that "The Newspaper Says" isn't negative. "Newspapers Deal" might be considered negative by Deal's camp, but it stuck to legitimate issues. "Hiding," however, is different. "That is verging on what I think most people would be calling a negative ad," Lau said. Barnes' ads are not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff, but with each new TV commercial he has moved further from "civil and polite" territory.

pomt-11532	"Breaking: four million Democrat votes just declared fraudulent."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/15/politico-news/no-four-million-democrat-votes-were-not-declared-f/	There is no evidence that millions of votes by Democrats were tossed due to faulty voting machines, despite what a headline said on Facebook. "Breaking: four million Democrat votes just declared fraudulent," stated a Feb. 7 headline on The Politico News, a fake news website with a similar name to Politico, a real news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story provides no evidence and repeats the same story posted by the satirical fake news website Reagan was Right, adding in a screenshot of Fox News’ Lou Dobbs. Several fake stories during the past couple of years have alleged voter fraud to the benefit of Democrats or involving undocumented immigrants following an election cycle in which Donald Trump repeatedly made ridiculous statements about voter fraud. After being sworn into office, Trump continued to falsely claim substantial evidence of voter fraud. Voter fraud does happen, but not to the widespread amount that Trump has alleged. The Politico News story said that voting machines in 11 states have been declared "compromised" as a result of a software glitch — and as a result, the story says, "17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned." The story said that the company that owns the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, is owned by a group of Democrats including George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, and the estate of John Kennedy. According to LinkedIn, Novus Ordo Seclorum was a Delaware consulting firm formed in 2010 to help identify strengths and weaknesses in businesses. Its profile makes no mention of voting machines. It’s unclear if the company still exists; the website was a dead link and the voicemail for the phone number was full. Not surprisingly for a made-up story, we found no evidence that the company is owned by the high-profile Democrats it mentioned. Brenda Bowser Soder, U.S. Election Assistance Commission spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Novus Ordo Seclorum doesn’t make voting machines and that the story is inaccurate. There is no evidence that 4 million Democratic votes were "just declared fraudulent." We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-11636	California is 41st in the nation in per pupil K-12 spending, but "No. 1 in per prisoner" spending.	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/jan/17/delaine-eastin/does-california-rank-41st-student-spending-no-1-pr/	Democratic candidate for governor Delaine Eastin wants to reduce California’s high poverty and incarceration by investing more in students. Eastin, a former state legislator and superintendent of public instruction, recently said California doesn’t spend enough on students at its K-12 schools but spends more than any state in the nation on its inmates. "Ladies and gentlemen, you are living in the most expensive state in the union, but you are 41st in per pupil spending," Eastin claimed at a Los Angeles town hall for six gubernatorial candidates on Jan. 13, 2018. "You should be in the top 10 not the bottom 10," she added. "But guess what, you’re No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure. That’s a disgrace. Budgets are statements of values. And to look at our budget, you’d think prisons were more important than education." Eastin makes her claim at about the 46:00 minute mark in the town hall. Was Eastin right about those rankings? We decided to fact check her per student vs. per prisoner spending comparison. 41st in per student spending? To support the first part of the statement, Eastin’s campaign pointed to a January 2017 report by the California Budget and Policy Center. The nonprofit, which is described in some media reports as left-leaning, analyzes how budget and tax policies affect low- and middle-income Californians. Its report found "California ranked 41st among all states in spending per K-12 student after adjusting for differences in the cost of living in each state." It used data from the 2015-16 fiscal year. California schools spent $10,291 per K-12 student that year, or about $1,900 less than the $12,252 per student spent by the nation as a whole, the report said. Notably, California’s per student spending was up about $2,000 from the 2012-13 fiscal year, when the state ranked 50th in the nation. Jonathan Kaplan, the report’s author and a senior policy analyst at the center, told us the report applies a wage-based index to account for California’s high teacher salaries. This adjustment, he said, allows for a valid spending comparison between states that pay employees much less. Clarifications missing Eastin’s statement does not clarify that the 41st in the nation ranking includes an adjustment for cost-of-living. Nor does she mention that California’s per pupil spending has moved up the rankings in recent years. The budget center is not the only group that ranks per pupil spending. EdWeek, a publication that covers K-12 education, ranked California 46th in per student spending, also using a cost of living adjustment. It’s most recent ranking, however, uses older data, from 2013-14, that doesn’t account for recent state spending increases. By contrast, the National Education Association conducts a straight spending comparison. It placed California’s per pupil spending at 22nd for 2015-16. In February 2017, EdSource.org published an in-depth look at the ways California’s per pupil spending has been ranked by different groups. It summarized its findings this way: "Since 2011-12, the low point in funding following the 2007-08 recession, California has increased K-12 funding by more than $20 billion. As a result, its average per-student spending has significantly increased, and its ranking among the states has improved in the three most frequently cited studies. But there’s a big variation in the state’s ranking among the three because they use different methods and different data. California has moved up some but continues to be in the bottom fifth of states, according to Education Week and the California Budget and Policy Center, while the National Education Association places California near the middle." Per prisoner spending To support Eastin’s claim that California is "No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure," her campaign directed us to a June 2017 Associated Press article that describes those costs as "the nation’s highest." It said California’s per-inmate cost was expected to climb to $75,560 in the next year. "Since 2015, California’s per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000," the AP reported. In August 2017, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True Sen. Kamala Harris’ claim "it costs $75,000 per year" to lock up an inmate in the state, based in part on the AP article and state budget estimates. We found several reasons for the dramatic cost increase. Most notable is California’s sharp drop in inmates combined with higher corrections spending, resulting from greater state contributions to prison employee pensions. The inmate drop is driven by a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. California’s prison population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. Meanwhile, there’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate number have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. "So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Prisoner cost to keep climbing Looking ahead, the per inmate cost is expected to go up again -- to $80,729 -- under Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposed 2018-19 budget released this month. PolitiFact California could not immediately obtain current per prisoner cost estimates for the state of New York. Various rankings have listed New York as No. 1 for per prisoner costs, including a Vera Institute of Justice report using the earlier 2015 data. Christian Henrichson, research director at the Vera Institute, told us by email that California and New York "are neck and neck on this measure, and the answer may depend on the year studied." California’s continued per prisoner cost spike "would place CA in the top spot," Jon Murchinson, Eastin’s campaign spokesman, asserted in an email. While we don’t have all the exact figures, that’s a fairly safe bet. Though per capita inmate costs continue to climb, that doesn’t mean California spends more on prisons than K-12 education, as some might take from Eastin’s claim. The reverse is correct: Gov. Jerry Brown’s current general fund budget projects spending 42 percent, or $55 billion, on the K-12 system. Meanwhile, it proposes spending 9 percent, or about $12 billion, on the prison system. Our ruling Candidate for governor Delaine Eastin recently claimed California ranks 41st in per pupil K-12 spending but is "No. 1 in per prisoner" spending. She relied on a January 2017 policy center report that backs up the per pupil spending ranking, after adjusting for cost of living. Another ranking that makes a straight spending comparison puts California at 22nd for per pupil spending. Eastin did not make this clear in her statement nor did she note that California’s per student spending has increased in recent years. Eastin’s claim that California is No. 1 for per prisoner costs is backed up by a 2017 Associated Press report, which listed New York a distant second. While we could not immediately find current figures for New York, we discovered that California’s per prisoner costs are expected to again rise -- to more than $80,000 -- in the next fiscal year, several thousand dollars higher than in recent years. Overall, Eastin’s comparison is supported by recent studies. But her statement could use clarifying information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After publication, we added additional context noting the U.S. Supreme Court order prevents California from automatically closing prisons even as its inmate population is reduced.

pomt-05854	"Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely. But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/13/joseph-kyrillos/gop-challenger-joseph-kyrillos-blames-us-sen-rober/	U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez is one of hundreds of federal officials responsible for spending taxpayer dollars, but state Sen. Joseph Kyrillos is pinning blame for the nation’s rising annual deficits on the Democratic incumbent. Kyrillos, a Republican representing part of Monmouth County, made that accusation during a Feb. 1 speech announcing his plans to seek the GOP nomination and challenge Menendez, who is seeking re-election. "Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely," Kyrillos told the crowd at the Lincroft Inn. "But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch." For this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is tackling two related claims made by Kyrillos. The first claim concerns the specific budgetary figures that he cited, and the second claim deals with whether it’s fair to blame Menendez for those deficits. We found that Menendez bears some responsibility for the increased deficits, but Kyrillos’ numbers are slightly off and his argument ignores the impact of the recession on federal coffers. First, let’s talk about the deficit figures. Kyrillos spokesman Chapin Fay claimed that the annual deficit increased from about $250 billion in fiscal year 2006 -- when Menendez joined the Senate -- to about $1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2011, which ended in September 2011. The number for fiscal year 2006 is accurate, but the fiscal year 2011 figure cited by Kyrillos is not. Federal officials had estimated an annual deficit of $1.645 trillion for fiscal year 2011, but the actual deficit turned out to be slightly under $1.3 trillion. During Menendez’s tenure in the Senate, the annual deficit reached its highest level in fiscal year 2009, at about $1.4 trillion. Now, let’s turn to the larger question: how much did Menendez have to do with the rising deficits? With regard to the spending increase in fiscal year 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed to three major factors: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus); the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP; and payments to mortgage guarantee agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Following its inception, TARP provided federal dollars to financial institutions and automakers. Menendez voted for the three bills that led to increased spending under those measures. But two professors with expertise in federal budgeting also pointed to another major factor behind the rising deficits: the recession. The economic downturn caused a steep drop in revenues at a time when more people were seeking unemployment benefits. "But I think it is silly to blame an individual Senator for changes that were fundamentally driven by the worst recession since the 1930s," Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also said Kyrillos was giving Menendez "too much blame." Menendez deserves some blame, but members of both parties contributed to the increased deficits. "It’s been a bipartisan problem with all of them going along with it," Mitchell told us. Fay said Kyrillos believes both parties contributed to the deficit, but maintained that Menendez’s voting record was a significant factor. "The deficit has risen dramatically during Sen. Menendez's time in office - and as you cited yourself, he has taken an extraordinary number of votes during that time to increase spending," Fay said in an email. A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment. Our ruling During his campaign announcement, Kyrillos criticized Menendez by saying "our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch." His numbers are slightly off, because the highest annual deficit during Menendez’s tenure in the Senate was about $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009. Menendez bears some responsibility for the large deficits by supporting various measures such as the stimulus and TARP. But experts told us the recession largely contributed to the deficits, and both parties are to blame for increased spending. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06563	Says she helped lead the launch of curbside recycling.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/01/mary-nolan/should-mary-nolan-get-credit-curbside-recycling-po/	Before Mary Nolan was a state legislator running for Portland City Council, she worked many years for the city of Portland. While there, she was in charge of two departments: sewers and public works maintenance. Nolan is not shy about bringing up the municipal part of her resume. The following is listed on her campaign website and on her Facebook campaign page: "As the head of the Bureau of Environmental Services and earlier as Director of Public Works Maintenance, she helped lead landmark improvements in protecting the Willamette River and environment, launching curbside recycling, repairing Portland roads and bridges, and managing public resources to save millions of dollars while bringing projects in on-time and on-budget." That’s a lot of landmark public deeds to absorb. So we’ll focus on just one of her cited accomplishments: Did Nolan help lead the launch of curbside recycling? Portland residents started recycling from their homes in the late 1980s, back before Nolan entered the recycling scene. In 1983, the state mandated that cities offer the service to residential customers. Portland adopted a system effective June 1, 1987. But it was a free-market system with multiple haulers servicing the same blocks and recycling results were scattered. The companies picked up newspapers weekly and metal, glass and cardboard monthly. In short, the initial system wasn’t very effective. In February 1992, the city rolled out a new residential recycling program. Households received two bins for recyclables. Milk jugs and magazines were added to mix. But here’s the critical difference: Haulers were allocated their own section of the city, and they were required to collect recycling every week, the same day as trash collection. "The overhaul that was instituted in 1992, it was game changing. It was a fundamental shift," says Bruce Walker, the city’s solid waste and recycling manager who was back then part of a small team charged with making the change happen. His boss at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which managed recycling at the time, was Sue Keil. Keil said she had been tapped by then-Commissioner Earl Blumenauer to oversee the new recycling system. Nolan, tapped to lead the bureau in mid-1990, was Keil’s boss. "Certainly Mary was not, as you say, involved in the day-to-day decision making, but I was talking to her about it, and it was on her watch," Keil said. "It’s entirely fair to say this happened on her watch and with her support." In a similar PolitiFact, we gave Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales a True for saying that he led on the issue of racially diversifying the Fire Bureau in the early 1990s. As the elected commissioner in charge of the bureau, Hales hired a new fire chief to come to Portland and shake up the bureau. We found that Hales was correct to claim credit. Nolan, on the other hand, was not a commissioner in charge. She was a bureau director carrying out the order of a commissioner and city council. And on the flip side, Nolan wasn’t even the person directly responsible for revamping the recycling system. That person was Sue Keil. It’s hard for us to let Nolan take credit when she was neither an elected official or civic body giving the order, nor the person handling day-to-day duties. Let’s also remember that Portland had a curbside recycling system before Nolan. We know it was clumsy and disorganized and hardly resembled what we have today, but the word "launch" makes it sound as if she initiated curbside recycling. Nolan says she "helped lead landmark improvements in … launching curbside recycling." We find this statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15173	"Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia ...The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/25/glen-sturtevant/glen-sturtevant-says-virginia-had-zero-percent-gro/	Virginia needs a dose of Republican economic medicine to get out of a funk, says Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member who is running for the state Senate. "Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia -- zero percent," Sturtevant said during an Aug. 18 candidates forum, sponsored by WCVE Richmond Public Radio. "The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi." Sturtevant is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking reelection. Also running is Dan Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. We wondered whether Sturtevant’s dreary economic statistics were correct. A spokesman for his campaign said the information came from a June article in The Washington Post about preliminary state gross domestic product figures for 2014 that were released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce. GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced. Virginia’s GDP of about $427 billion last year was indeed flat -- there was 0.0 percent inflation-adjusted growth from 2013. Only two states trailed the Old Dominion in growth: Mississippi and Alaska, which saw their state economies shrink. Nationally, inflation-adjusted GDP expanded by 2.2 percent last year. These figures are preliminary, and Virginia’s position might improve slightly when the bureau releases its final report in September. Last year, for example, the preliminary report ranked Virginia 49th in economic growth in 2013; the final ranking pegged Virginia’s growth at 0.4 percent, 43rd among the states. The commonwealth’s economic growth has been lackluster for several years, spanning Democratic and Republican governors. In 2011, the state saw 0.6 percent GDP growth; in 2012, it saw 0.7 percent growth. Economists we spoke with said Virginia’s low numbers largely reflect a slow recovery from the Great Recession that has been exacerbated by its dependence on federal spending in an era of budget cuts. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the economy of Northern Virginia. The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that in 2013, federal spending was responsible for about 31 percent of Virginia’s economic activity. Only Mississippi was more dependent. Under the federal sequestration compromise, which kicked in at the start of 2013, Congress and the White House agreed to an automatic series of budget cuts to trim the national debt by $1 trillion over nine years. Half of the savings are coming from defense spending and half from domestic programs. A 2013 study by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University, said Virginia was "particularly vulnerable" to sequestration and predicted it would bite $15.4 billion a year out of the state’s economy. That was the second largest of any state. Fuller found California was projected to lose $16.7 billion. Texas was third, projected to lose $11.9 billion annually. Both of those states are seeing much greater growth than Virginia: Texas ranked second in the nation last year, with 5.2 percent growth; California ranked ninth with 2.8 percent growth. It should be noted, however, that both states have larger, more diverse economies than Virginia. California’s GDP was $2.1 trillion last year, Texas’ was $1.5 trillion, and Virginia’s was $427 billion, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. Maryland, where many federal employees live, ranked 36th in economic growth last year. Although Maryland also is home to many federal employees, it’s less dependent on federal spending than Virginia. According to Pew, Uncle Sam funds about 27.5 percent of the economic activity in Maryland. While federal cuts start the discussion about Virginia’s sluggish recovery from the recession, they’re not the whole conversation. The state has also been hurt by the sagging coal industry in Southwest Virginia and declining furniture manufacturing in Southside Virginia, according to Terry Terry Rephann, regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. Our ruling Sturtevant said that Virginia had zero percent economic growth last year, the third worst result in the nation. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12948	Says Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death.	false	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/parenting-blog-falsely-claims-vicks-vaporub-was-fa/	Here’s a scary story. A mother in Mexico thinks that her 2-year-old has a cold and puts Vicks VapoRub on his chest and under his nose. She lies down next to him and when she wakes, she finds the child dead. The tale began moving through the Web in November. Smag31.com, a website that targets young mothers, carried it on Nov. 25 with the headline, "Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies." But so far as anyone can tell, the story is untrue. Vicks VapoRub has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, but not to any deaths. The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Bruce Rubin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. In 2009, he published a peer-reviewed article based on a case he had encountered a few years before. The parents of an 18-month-old had put Vicks under the child’s nose and the child immediately stopped breathing. They quickly turned the child upside down, slapped it on the back and it coughed up a plug of mucus. Its breathing returned to normal. But Rubin told us that in the 10 years since that case, he’s seen no report of any deaths. On the other hand, episodes of breathing distress while rare, are not unheard of. "I understand that there have been about 30 such reports, all with Vicks under the nose of very small children," Rubin said. "Procter and Gamble (the maker of Vicks) specifically states never to use this directly under the nose at any age, and never use at all in children under the age of 2." To underscore, that is what the label says. Never under the nose. Never with kids under 2. A 2012 study looked at what happens when menthol, one of Vicks’ active ingredients, is inhaled. It found that the body responds by making more mucus, but again, the authors cited no example of a child actually dying. Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ environmental health council, said, "I have never heard, nor could I find a report of, a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub." Lowry said as a pediatric medical toxicologist, she has concerns about any product that contains camphor, as Vicks does. But her main worry is that parents will do exactly the wrong thing and have kids eat it. That’s very dangerous. Procter and Gamble spokeswoman Velvet Gogol Bennett said the company has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling Vicks VapoRub. "We have had no local health authority notification, no hospital notification, nor any doctor or any official news organization anywhere in the world has brought this case to our attention," Bennett said. "Despite all of our efforts to investigate this social media posting, there is no verifiable information in terms of city and name of the person concerned." The blog post about the alleged death said, "The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment." If such a medical report exists, no researcher we contacted seems to have ever seen it. We reached out to the author behind the blog and did not hear back. The myth-busting website Snopes also looked into this and found it lacked substance. A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products. Those situations sent children to the emergency room, but were not fatal. The one exception was in 1983 involving a child with pneumonia whose parents had given him a home remedy that contained camphor and alcohol. Rubin said if people follow instructions, Vicks is fine: "If you are an adult with a stuffy head cold, putting Vicks on your chest and drinking some hot tea with honey (and perhaps rum) is as good a medicine as it gets. Just keep the Vicks (and the rum) away from the under-2 crowd." Our ruling A blog post said that Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death in Mexico. While the product has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence that it has been fatal. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a56cc01f-fabc-4887-83e9-b9eb2a163b40	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-01-06T11:54:00	2016-11-25	['None']
pomt-14753	"Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misquotes-cia-official-makes-false-claim-/	Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz tore into President Barack Obama’s strategy against ISIS in an NPR interview. Cruz, who vowed to "utterly destroy ISIS" and "carpet bomb them into oblivion," said Obama is not serious about defeating the jihadists. The Texas senator brought up Obama’s former CIA deputy director, Mike Morell, to show how Obama has prioritized a green agenda instead. "Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming," Cruz said on Dec. 8’s Morning Edition. "This is nonsense." Is it true that Morell said the Obama administration refused to strike ISIS’ oil assets because of fears that emissions from oil fires will contribute to global warming, the term for increased temperatures believed to be linked to human activity? Not exactly. Cruz gets several details wrong, starting with what Morell said and where he said it. His overall point is misleading and, in the words of one expert, "completely nonsensical." Bombs and black gold We’ll start with an overview of ISIS’ oil assets and what’s been bombed. ISIS has hijacked the bulk of Syria’s oil, which has become a major cash cow for the terrorist group’s operations. (Other prominent sources of revenue include taxation and extortion, sales of looted property, bank robberies, kidnapping ransoms and state-run businesses.) With about a half-dozen oil fields under its control, ISIS churns out an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day and makes $1.5 million to $2 million daily from oil sales. U.S. and coalition military forces have been trying to get at this revenue source by periodically targeting oil assets for over a year. From the start of the operation against ISIS in August 2014 to Nov. 13, 2015, airstrikes have damaged or destroyed 260 oil infrastructure targets, according to the Defense Department. These strikes were initially aimed at easy targets like mobile refineries and storage depots, and not entirely successful, a Pentagon official admitted. So attacks were ramped up to focus on more sensitive targets like tanker trucks and wellheads. In October 2015, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched a second campaign specifically aimed to cut two-thirds of the terrorists’ oil revenue. By Dec. 1, military forces had destroyed wells, processing facilities and nearly 400 ISIS oil trucks, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. "We've seen the U.S. get a lot more creative and aggressive with its target list," said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consultant firm specializing in Middle East oil politics. "It has had to overcome a learning curve. It's still learning what to hit and where." Misquoting Morell? Did a top CIA official admit that these attacks were limited because of climate change concerns? The Cruz campaign didn't get back to us. Our search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance of Morell giving congressional testimony on this point. Cruz could be thinking of comments by Morell on PBS’ Charlie Rose on Nov. 23. Here’s what Morell said: Morell: "So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment — I don’t sit in the Sit. Room (sic) anymore — but there seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore. "And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells — actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure." Rose: "So we’re hitting oil on trucks." Morell: "So now we're hitting oil on trucks. And maybe you get to the point where you say we also have to hit oil wells. So those are the kind of tough decisions you have to make." Cruz flubs Morell’s comments in a few ways. First, Morell was talking about oil tankers and wells under ISIS’ control, not "oil fields." That term can refer to the underground reservoirs of petroleum or the broader oil infrastructure sitting atop (i.e. refineries, tanks and other collection and transportation equipment). As we noted, military forces have been hitting some oil assets. Second, Morell made no mention of global warming. Instead, he said the oil tankers and wells were spared out of concern for "environmental damage." Based on previous comments by Pentagon officials and experts we talked to, Morell was more likely referring to oil spills and destroying the local environment. That’s a far cry from climate change. Limitations and concerns The attacks on ISIS oil have been limited by many concerns. But based on statements by Pentagon officials and experts, the list doesn’t include global warming. The first attacks, for example, were aimed at damaging, not completely destroying, mobile refineries and other equipment in order to keep the infrastructure intact for an ISIS-less future, not out of environmental concerns. "We'd like to preserve the flexibility for those refineries to still contribute to a stable economy in what we hope will be a stable country when the Assad regime is not in control anymore," a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters in September 2014, adding that the attacks may have actually caused some oil fires. Oil wells and tanker trucks were initially off limits in order to avoid civilian casualties, according to news reports. Even when these became fair game in October 2015, permanent destruction still wasn’t the goal. "We have to be cognizant that there will be a time after the war -- the war will end," another Pentagon spokesperson said in November 2015. "So we don't want to completely and utterly destroy these facilities to where they’re irreparable." Experts told us this policy is humanitarian and tactical. Injuring or killing civilians or crippling the economy would be counterproductive to the goal of isolating the enemy from the local population, said Ben Bahney, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, a global policy think tank. "The Pentagon doesn't care about ISIS' carbon footprint," Reed of Foreign Reports said. "They do care about how airstrikes impact locals who are trapped inside ISIS territory. Because the potential for environmental and humanitarian disaster is so high, the U.S. uses precision strikes." That’s precisely why bombing the physical oil fields themselves would be a "terrible idea," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The ecological fallout, health hazards and permanently weakened economy would impact local people. "If it were just global warming, we would obviously bomb them," he said. "If you’re worried about climate change, you should be stopping oil production period. If you bomb the well heads, you prevent the oil from being extracted so that would actually help reduce emissions," Bahney said. "Cruz’s claim is completely nonsensical." The Cruz campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Cruz said, "Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming." We found no instances of Morell testifying before Congress on this point. He did talk about Obama’s ISIS strategy on PBS, but Cruz misquotes what he said. Morell said U.S. military forces spared oil tankers and wells — not "oil fields" — in order to avoid "environmental damage." Preserving the environment for the local population is quite different from global warming, which no officials have brought up as a deterrent from bombing ISIS. The U.S. military has been striking oil assets but it has limited those strikes out of concern for civilian casualties, destroying the oil infrastructure and doing damage to the local environment. If climate change was the Obama administration’s top priority, experts said, it would make more sense to bomb the oil fields. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-06499	"Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the 'stimulus.' "	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/13/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-promised-stimulus-would-ke/	After the U.S. Department of Labor released a report showing unemployment held steady at 9.1 percent in September, House Speaker John Boehner said it showed the need to "find common ground on common-sense solutions to create a better environment for private-sector job creation." The Ohio Republican also repeated a worn but sturdy talking point that his office used to headline his statement: "Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the 'stimulus,' " Boehner said. The claim that the White House "promised" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been popular among Republican critics of the stimulus. PolitiFact first checked it in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said: "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)." PolitiFact rated his claim Mostly False. Since the House speaker has raised it anew, PolitiFact Ohio thought a reprise of our reviews was worthwhile. The claim is rooted in a report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. It was issued on Jan. 9, 2009, before President Barack Obama took office. The report projected that Obama’s proposed stimulus plan would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also predicted unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. A chart in the report shows that without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. In fact, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and remains stuck above 9 percent. But do those projections from the administration in January 2009 constitute a promise? They certainly came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action." The administration acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized, losing 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. Bernstein maintained in that news conference that the stimulus was working, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse without it. Is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that, even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. Many independent economists agree with Obama that the stimulus created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). Obama warned upon taking office that if "dramatic action" were not taken, "the unemployment rate could reach double digits," with the recession lasting for years. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge that the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. When we asked Boehner's office what evidence he had, they provided a number of sources that confirmed the prediction. Those included a reference to Rep. Barney Frank -- a Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee -- saying that Obama and Democrats were saddled with a "false prediction" and that making the prediction "was a dumb thing to do." There is an element of truth in Boehner’s statement. A report prepared by the incoming Obama administration did project that the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. It has been above 8 percent since early in 2009. We think it's a big stretch to call an economic projection a "promise." The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." Those are critical facts that the speaker’s claim ignores. As we have ruled for others who have made this claim, we rate Boehner’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12764	"Studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/feb/24/kamala-harris/mostly-true-latinos-40-percent-less-likely-call-po/	In her first official speech on the U.S. Senate floor, Sen. Kamala Harris said President Trump’s executive actions "have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good hardworking people." The California Democrat went on to say that rather than making communities safe, Trump’s immigration raids and policies will make immigrants less likely to report crimes for fear they’ll be deported. "For this reason," Harris said in her Feb. 16, 2017 speech, "studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime." Harris makes her claim at about the 7:40 minute mark in the video above. With so much focus in California on Trump’s immigration orders, we decided to fact-check Harris’s claim. Our research As evidence, a spokesman for Harris pointed to a 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, called "Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration Enforcement." The study relied on a survey of 2,000 Hispanics, both documented and undocumented, in late 2012 in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. One of the survey questions asked respondents to agree or disagree with the following statement: "I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." Overall, 44 percent of respondents agreed with the statement. That’s just about what Harris said in her claim. "Basically on target," Nik Theodore, who authored the study and is a professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Urban Planning and Policy, told PolitiFact California. Here’s a breakdown of the share less likely to contact police by county and state surveyed: Chicago (Cook County) Illinois: 39 percent Houston (Harris County) Texas: 47 percent Los Angeles (Los Angeles County) California: 40 percent Phoenix (Maricopa County) Arizona: 50 percent Digging deeper, the study found overall 70 percent of undocumented Latinos and 28 percent of U.S.-born Latinos were hesitant to contact the police when they had been the victim of a crime. It also found that more than 40 percent of respondents were less likely to contact police about a crime they knew had taken place. The study did not report on the share of overall Americans hesitant to call police because it only surveyed Latino residents. While technically Harris says "studies" in her claim, indicating there are multiple reports that back this up, her spokesman said he could only find the single report from 2013 as evidence. 2009 Pew study Theodore told us there hasn’t been much research on Latino attitudes about police. We did find a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center that’s somewhat similar. It found 78 percent of Hispanics surveyed in 2008 said they would definitely contact police if they were the victim of a violent crime. An even higher percentage, 84 percent, said they would contact police if they were the victim of a property crime. That would indicate that, at least at that time, a smaller share than 40 percent of Latinos were hesitant to contact police when they were victims of a crime. Asked about this, Theodore said the two studies ask different questions and were completed four years apart. He added that his study "was done after an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement." Immigrant rights groups often cite Arizona’s passage of a broad new immigration enforcement measure, SB 1070 in 2010, as eroding trust between Hispanics and law enforcement in that state. The law, which faced numerous legal challenges, required Arizona state law enforcement officers to attempt to determine a person’s immigration status when there was reasonable suspicion that person was an illegal immigrant. When looking at the two studies, only the 2013 University of Chicago study asks whether respondents would be "less likely" to contact the police if they had been the victim of a crime "for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." The Pew study does not include the second part of that question. The Pew study did find that about 50 percent of respondents felt "just some or very little confidence that police will treat Hispanics fairly." John Thiella is a consultant with the Sacramento-based Latino Policy Coalition, which advocates for immigrant rights. He said Harris used "a fair statistic" in describing the percentage of Latinos hesitant to call police when they are victims of a crime. Thiella said there’s long been "a climate of fear and uncertainty" between Latinos and the police due to the lack of a clear path forward for undocumented residents. He said Trump’s hard-line immigration policies have deepened that fear. Obama Administration also contributed to the uncertainty by deporting more than 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any president in U.S. history. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent speech that "studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime." A 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, found 44 percent of respondents (all Hispanics) agreed with the following statement: "I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status." The study’s author called Harris’ claim "basically on target." Harris leaves the impression there are multiple reports to back up her claim when she uses the phrase "studies have shown" in her claim. Based on our research, and comments from her spokesman, there’s only a single report that backs this up. In 2009, the Pew Research Center produced a report that indicates a smaller share of Hispanics would be hesitant to contact police if they were victims of a crime. Unlike the 2013 report, the Pew study did not raise the issue of whether respondents would be concerned police would ask about their immigration status. It also took place before an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement around the country. In the end, Harris’ statement needs a couple clarifications but is backed up by the 2013 report. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebea8081-40ba-4fbd-85a4-f10c04656599	None	Kamala Harris	None	None	None	2017-02-24T06:00:00	2017-02-16	['None']

pomt-08630	Rhode Island gives undocumented pregnant women health insurance, plus a cash card "with $400 a month on it" and "$250 a month or $275 a month to spend on food."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/19/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-ri-gives-undocumented-pregnant-women-/	On the hot-button issue of immigration, there are few figures as outspoken about Rhode Island's policies as state Rep. Peter Palumbo, a Democrat from Cranston. Two years ago, Palumbo released a set of figures he compiled estimating what undocumented immigrants cost the state each year, how many murders they commit and the strain they put on our health care system. The report was never substantiated, but Palumbo continues to cite these and other similar figures. Palumbo and Republican state Rep. Joseph Trillo, of Warwick -- who also supports stricter enforcement of immigration laws -- went to Arizona earlier this month to see for themselves the problems that the state is having with illegal immigration. While there, they appeared together on Fox News' "On the Record With Greta Van Susteren" to discuss Rhode Island immigration policy. Criticizing the state's social service programs, Palumbo said: "We have something called the anchor embryos. We have such liberal programs where we take care of you. If you're an illegal woman you get to Rhode Island, you go to the Department of Human Services, they give you either Neighborhood Health [Plan], United[Health] or Blue Cross. They give you a card with $400 a month on it and allow you to spend it on anything but food because, sit tight, we're going to give you another $250 a month or $275 a month to spend on food." We asked Palumbo about his source for such exact dollar figures. He said he got each piece of information from Gary Alexander, the head of Rhode Island's Office of Health and Human Services, in a lengthy conversation they had about two years ago when Palumbo first became interested in the issue. Alexander told us he recalls briefly discussing the topic of benefits for undocumented pregnant women with Palumbo at some point, but he said he never cited any of the specific figures that Palumbo lists, nor would he, because they're just not accurate. "I don't even know how he would get totals like $400 or $250," Alexander said. Health care policy for undocumented pregnant women So what do state and federal policies say about benefits for pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally? First, they are eligible for health insurance under RIte Care, the state's health insurance program for low-income families, according to state officials. And federal law dictates that they must be given a choice between providers, Alexander said. Until just a few weeks ago, those choices included Neighborhood Health Plan, UnitedHealthCare, or Blue Cross & Blue Shield. In August, Blue Cross announced it would no longer participate in the program. Women who are pregnant are not required to declare their immigration status when enrolling in RIte Care, assuming they meet the income eligibility requirements. The way Alexander and federal officials explain it, the rationale is this: because the child will be born in the United States, he or she will be an American citizen and therefore eligible for health benefits. Prenatal care is considered an extension of those benefits. "It's not based on the mother, it's based on the child who will soon be a citizen. If we don't give [the mother] prenatal care, something could happen to the child," leading to even greater costs for the state, said Alexander, who was appointed by Governor Donald Carcieri, a Republican. Even if the DHS did not offer health benefits, state law would still require hospitals to provide emergency care to anyone, Alexander added. The mother's health benefits end three months after delivery. Palumbo is therefore correct on what he says about free health care. Cash assistance policy Next Palumbo says undocumented pregnant women get "a card with $400 a month on it" that they are "allow[ed] to spend [on] anything but food." Sounds a bit like a state gift certificate to us, but Palumbo says he was referring to cash assistance welfare benefits. Again, he said Alexander told him that every undocumented pregnant woman who seeks state help gets $400 a month. Not so, said the DHS secretary, who said he couldn't imagine where Palumbo could have gotten such specific figures. Pregnant women who are in Rhode Island illegally are not eligible for welfare benefits and even if they were, how much they get would depend on their income, said OHHS Associate Director David Burnett. Under the Bush-administration's Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, anyone seeking cash benefits or other federal assistance must provide identifying documentation proving their legal status, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It's important to note that, as with healthcare benefits, once the child is born, as a citizen, he or she will be eligible for welfare benefits, which would presumably be delivered to the mother on behalf of the child. But the mother herself does not qualify for any subsidy. So Palumbo is incorrect to say pregnant women get welfare benefits. Food stamps policy The same is true for the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, more commonly known as the food stamp program. Despite the figures Palumbo cites, undocumented pregnant women are not eligible for "$250 a month or $275 a month," or any other amount. Under the federal Deficit Reduction Act, without proof of citizenship, they can't receive the benefit. Once born, their children will qualify to enroll in the SNAP program. According to the University of Rhode Island's Feinstein Center for a Hunger Free America, the maximum is $200 a month per qualifying member. But the subsidy will not cover the mother. Again, Palumbo is wrong. Finally, there is a clear implication in Palumbo's statement that Rhode Island's benefits are more generous than those in other states. At one point in the Van Susteren interview, Palumbo suggested that undocumented pregnant women from elsewhere are "headed to our state" to take advantage of these programs. Federal law now dictates that undocumented people -- pregnant or otherwise -- are not eligible for either welfare assistance or food stamps here, or anywhere. By the same token, undocumented pregnant women in Rhode Island are eligible to receive health care benefits, but that is also true in some other states. While federal law won't cover undocumented people, in general, it gives states the option to use federal CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) to cover prenatal benefits. To imply that Rhode Island is the only state where this is the case is not correct. In all, two of the three facts Palumbo offered to Van Susteren were wrong. Worse, he cited as his source an official -- Gary Alexander -- who said he never said any of those specifics, in part because they are not true. Palumbo used very exact numbers on national television and he stated them with the kind of confidence that could lead viewers to believe he had done his homework and knew what he was talking about. He didn't and he doesn't, at least in two of three counts. We'll give him a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Peter Palumbo	None	None	None	2010-09-19T00:01:00	2010-09-09	['Rhode_Island']

pomt-04074	Says his elections proposal would allow "a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most we’ve ever had."	true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-plan-would-expand-early-voting/	Gov. Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers to revisit the 2011 elections overhaul, which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year’s presidential election. In an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history. "What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day," Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, "so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had." Scott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular "Souls to the Polls" events. Here we’ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting. Florida’s history with early voting is short. Former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start 15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours. Even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That’s 96 hours. In the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote early thanks to an emergency extension ordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read that executive order.) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116. In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here’s a related check on that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. The Legislature is poised to tweak the state’s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election. Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites. So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours). Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott’s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law. "Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting," said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick. A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott’s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county’s needs. "We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all," said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections. Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but "it’s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election." A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott’s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature’s 2011 law. "We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355," said public services director Mary Cooney in an email. Our ruling Scott said that his proposal would allow "a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had" for early voting. He’s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record. We should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law. But Scott was very careful with his wording, noting that 168 hours was the maximum and outlining the specific days and hours. A claim from his critics, Pink Slip Rick, said the law "only mandates 48 hours of early voting." We rated that Mostly True, because it didn't leave open the possibility of more hours. Scott's statement, on the other hand, specifically notes that the 168 hours are a maximum. Scott chose his words carefully and precisely. We rate his statement True.

pomt-07210	Says this month’s special session will cost the state $27,300 a day just for legislators’ daily living expenses.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/06/jason-isaac/state-rep-jason-isaac-says-diem-costs-taxpayers-27/	After a Democrat’s filibuster derailed legislation considered essential by the Republican-steered Legislature, state Rep. Jason Isaac said the gambit had a cost. "Back to work tomorrow. Per diem alone costs taxpayers $27,300/day," the Dripping Springs Republican tweeted May 30. Nearly $30,000 a day? As legislators started the 30-day special session immediately called by Gov. Rick Perry, Ellen Troxclair, Isaac’s chief of staff, told us Isaac based his figure on information from the Texas Ethics Commission. Some background: A provision in the Texas Constitution provides for each legislator and the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, to receive a $600 monthly salary, mileage reimbursements and the per diem, which is a stipend intended to ease lawmaker living expenses while they’re in Austin on state business each day during regular and special sessions. The commission, established in 1991, sets the per diem and also may recommend raises for legislators to voters, though that’s not happened. According to information on the commission’s website, the current legislative per diem is $150. So, counting the 150 Texas House members, 31 senators and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 182 lawmakers qualify for the payment each day lawmakers are in session. Total potential daily cost: $27,300. According to the Texas State Historical Association, the Constitution of 1876 set a legislator’s compensation at $5 per day for the first 60 days of a regular session and $2 for each day after. A 1930 constitutional amendment changed the per diem to $10 for the first 120 days of the session and $5 after. During special sessions, the per diem was $10. A 1954 amendment raised the per diem to no more than $25 for the first 120 days of the regular session, while a 1960 amendment greenlighted paying legislators an annual salary of up to $4,800 plus a $12 per diem during the first 120 days of each regular session and each day of the special session. Per diem amounts inched up in later years with the commission setting the rate at $168 in January 2009, according to a Nov. 12 2010, news story in the Austin American-Statesman. But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov. 29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending. Do lawmakers ever pass up the per diem? Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation. Steven Adrian, executive director of the House Business Office, told us no representatives have submitted a request to withhold or reduce per diem payments this session. Isaac’s statement adds up to True.	None	Jason Isaac	None	None	None	2011-06-06T06:00:00	2011-05-30	['None']

pomt-02341	On HealthCare.Gov, Texan Mark Sullivan "found a good" health insurance "plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/mar/24/kathleen-sebelius/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-understates-costs/	Urging Texans without health insurance to hop to shopping before a looming enrollment deadline, Kathleen Sebelius enthused about a Texan she described as landing a good deal via the HealthCare.gov website. Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an opinion column published in the March 18, 2014, Austin American-Statesman: "On a recent visit to the Lone Star State, I met Mark Sullivan, a 31-year-old software developer. Though he was eager to start his own business, the thought of fending for himself without his employer-based health coverage made him hesitate. "But then Mark researched his options on HealthCare.gov. You can imagine his excitement when he found a good plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month." That column touting Sullivan’s experience also appeared in the Dallas Morning News, San Antonio Express-News, El Paso Times and McAllen Monitor. We were curious about Sullivan’s experience on the Obamacare website, which often didn’t function at its launch. Did Sullivan, co-founder of an Austin-based company, snag an early health/dental bargain anyway? An account re-told Sullivan’s sign-up success has been a centerpiece for advocates at least since an Oct. 4, 2013, web post by Enroll America, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on maximizing the number of Americans enrolled in and retaining health coverage. Enroll America’s post said Sullivan overcame glitches on HealthCare.gov shortly after the site’s debut to line up affordable coverage for himself, effective in 2014. After comparing plans, Enroll America said, Sullivan "settled on a bronze option and added dental insurance. He will receive an $82 per month subsidy, which will halve the monthly premium he will pay down to $78." Sebelius’ oped column, distributed about five months later, made no mention of Sullivan’s subsidy. Enroll America’s write-up further noted that Sullivan’s subsidy might decrease: "While his new startup will require a lot of personal expense early on, if profits grow faster than he projects, his subsidy may end up being a bit lower by the end of the year. That’s no concern for Mark, since even without the tax credit, his total premium is still much more affordable than the private plans he had been able to find on the individual market." On Oct. 25, 2013, Sullivan joined an Austin press conference where Sebelius talked up the importance of residents complying with the mandate that Americans obtain coverage, as noted in news stories by outlets including the American-Statesman. (The next enrollment deadline is March 31, 2014.) Agency spokesman: Dental plan an added cost We asked a Washington, D.C.-based HHS spokesman, Fabien Levy, for backup related to Sebelius’ description of Sullivan’s shopping success. Levy largely deferred to Sullivan, though by email Levy said the described dental coverage has been costing Sullivan $15 a month in addition to the less than $80 for health and dental coverage celebrated by Sebelius. Hence, Levy said, the original column was being revised. A fresh version sent by the agency to the Statesman lacked any mention of Sullivan’s dental plan. Sullivan offers details Fortuitously, Sullivan elaborated on his experience on HealthCare.gov. By phone, Sullivan told us he pays $77.67 a month to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas to be in its Blue Advantage Bronze HMO plan. On a Blue Cross and Blue Shield web page, the plan is described as having an individual annual deductible of $6,000 along with maximum annual out-of-pocket costs to the purchaser. Notably, though, the purchaser must pay all medical costs up to that ceiling. Also, according to information on the web page, the plan covers 100 percent of prescription costs once the deductible is paid. By phone, Sullivan told us that in addition to the costs of his health policy, he chose to pay about $15 a month for a Starmount Life Insurance Co. dental plan. By email, Sullivan shared a computer screen shot of a Blue Cross Blue Shield web page showing that his health coverage, effective Jan. 1, 2014, would cost $159.67 without his $82 monthly subsidy; which was awarded based on his income, Sullivan said. The image shows that thanks to the subsidy, he’s been paying $77.67 a month. Sullivan said he appreciated the plan’s low monthly cost to him, its provision for a free annual check-up and its cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Notably, too, he said a medication he purchased in February that would have cost him more than $340 if he had no coverage ended up costing only $30 out of pocket. Looking back, Sullivan wrote that he had trouble logging on to HealthCare.gov the first three days of October, but by Oct. 4, he was browsing 76 available plans and, to his memory, signed up for his plan a day later. "Overall, the shopping experience was a good one," Sullivan wrote. In his view, he wrote,"the only thing slightly off" in Sebelius’ published statement "is that the dental coverage was separate from health insurance, which was an additional $15/month that I probably wouldn't have chosen without the subsidy." Our ruling On HealthCare.Gov, Sebelius wrote, Texan Mark Sullivan "found a good" health insurance "plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month." No doubt, Sullivan liked how things worked out for him. But Sebelius’ recap struck us as incomplete and misleading. The secretary incorrectly described what Sullivan pays as covering both medical and dental coverage; the latter costs him about $15 more a month. The article also didn’t acknowledge that Sullivan’s monthly charge was fueled by an $82-a-month subsidy. Also, there was no concession that purchasers including Sullivan must pay $6,000 a year for medical procedures before the plan pitches in on such. We rate this statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4 p.m., March 24, 2014: We removed an incorrect reference to "hidden" cost in our section explaining our ruling above and clarified that the oped column celebrating the low out-of-pocket cost of Texan Mark Sullivan's combined medical-dental plans didn't including the substantive detail that the Austin purchaser would still face a $6,000 annual deductible for his medical coverage.

pomt-05416	"Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/02/barbara-buono/chris-christie-campaign-scott-walker-new-jersey-st/	With Gov. Chris Christie heading west to campaign for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, state Sen. Barbara Buono took a moment this week to inform New Jerseyans that the Badger State is leading the nation -- in job losses. A little more than a year after signing a bill restricting collective bargaining rights for most public employees -- legislation that set off massive protests and attracted national media attention -- Walker is facing a recall election on June 5. The primary for the recall election is next Tuesday. As Christie prepared to visit Wisconsin the next day, Buono, a Democrat representing part of Middlesex County, issued a news release on Monday criticizing the two Republican governors. "Our governor seems more concerned with one man’s job in Wisconsin than the legions of unemployed constituents at home," Buono said in the news release. "It’s not as if Scott Walker has any advice to offer. Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Buono’s statistic is on target. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost more jobs than any other state, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s how the labor figures break down. We normally analyze job growth in both "net" terms -- the actual number of jobs lost or gained -- and "percentage" terms. By both measures, Wisconsin finished in last place for over-the-year employment changes -- driven in large part by the loss of government jobs. In March 2012, Wisconsin had 2,730,600 jobs, representing a loss of 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, since March 2011. The state’s net loss of jobs far surpassed the next highest amount of 3,500 jobs lost in Mississippi. The March 2012 figures are preliminary and subject to change. Nearly 75 percent of the jobs lost in Wisconsin during the past year occurred in the public sector, which accounted for 17,800 of the job losses. Steven Deller, a professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that the political dynamics in the state has negatively impacted the business climate. "In addition to the massive budget cuts at the state and local level the political dynamics has cast a black cloud over the business climate of the state," Deller told us in an e-mail. "People/businesses are starting to say ‘stop the political war and work together’. This is independent of party affiliation." In case you’re wondering how job growth in New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation, here are the Garden State’s statistics: From March 2011 to March 2012, New Jersey gained 38,300 jobs for an increase of 1 percent. That growth represents increases of 35,200 private-sector jobs and 3,100 public-sector jobs. For total employment changes among all 50 states, New Jersey ranked 15th in net terms and 24th in percentage terms. Our ruling In a news release issued Monday, Buono offered this statistic about the Badger State: "Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state." According to federal labor statistics, Buono’s claim is accurate. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, placing the state in last place for both measures.

pomt-02782	"At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans."	true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/06/debra-medina/texas-near-top-local-debt-capita/	In a Nov. 13, 2013, campaign press release, Debra Medina pledged that as Texas state comptroller she would "resist growth in government spending," saying, "At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans." An earlier version of the claim sent out via email said simply "greater debt burden," not "local"; the campaign posted an updated release online. We looked at state debt in a July 24, 2011, fact-check on Gov. Rick Perry, rating as Mostly True his claim that Texas had "the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states." How does debt shake out at the local level? Medina, a tea-party favorite from Wharton, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary against Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. The Medina campaign told us via email that her Texas-New York comparison was based on a Sept. 26, 2012, report, "Your Money and Local Debt," issued by the current state comptroller, Susan Combs. In 2009, Texas had $7,983 in local debt per capita, the report said, placing Texas second among the 10 most populous states. New York was first with $8,744 in local debt per capita; California was third with $6,469 per capita. Texas comptroller report, "Your Money and Local Debt," Sept. 26, 2012, based on 2009 data: The report relied on 2009 U.S. Census Bureau data, which Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us via email was drawn from the December 2011 annual report of the Texas Bond Review Board. That agency oversees the issuance of state bonds used to fund activities as varied as making housing loans to veterans and helping local governments finance water projects. "State and local debt" are defined in the bureau’s July 2013 summary of 2011 data as "all interest-bearing short-term credit obligations and all long-term obligations incurred in the name of the government and all its dependent agencies, whether used for public or private purposes." U.S. states divide local and state responsibilities in different ways. Texas spends little at the state level; local costs may be borne by hospital districts, school districts and the like in addition to city and county governments. The Census and Board both presented local debt estimates alongside state debt. We next looked for comparisons using more recent data and all 50 states. The Bond Review Board offers its own annual estimate of local debt in Texas. In the most recent report that was available when Medina’s release was sent out, published in December 2012, the agency said Texas’ local debt per capita was $7,507 in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. Board spokesman Robert Latsha told us by phone that, though he wasn’t certain exactly what the Census included in its figures, it’s likely the largest difference between the Census and board estimates comes from debt set up by quasi-governmental agencies such as local housing finance corporations or economic development corporations. Only debt from bonds and shorter-term securities issued by local governments is reported to the board, Latsha said. He said the board didn’t calculate comparisons with all 50 states. Census Bureau spokesman Joseph Dalaker told us by phone that the bureau didn’t either, but he helped us find data comparable to what the board probably used when comparing the 10 biggest states. Using those Census estimates of local debt and state population -- from the most recent data sets available when Medina spoke in November 2013 -- we found Texas was third among all 50 states and, again, second among the 10 most populous. Highest local debt per capita among all 50 states: New York $10,204 Nevada $8,520 Texas $8,431 California $7,075 Kansas $7,011 Colorado $6,911 Washington $6,660 Minnesota $6,295 Illinois $6,267 Kentucky $6,259 Sources: U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, July 12, 2012, and local debt estimates, Dec. 6, 2012 In the board’s December 2013 report, which came out after Medina made her statement, the state board updated local debt per capita in fiscal 2012 to $7,514 by its own estimation and $8,431 according to Census data, keeping Texas in second place among the 10 most populous states. Medina’s claim referred to the debt burden falling on "citizens." But state residents might not be directly on the hook for the whole amount. Dalaker told us, "You really have to tease out who’s paying." For example, taxes on tourists can help pay for projects, he said. Moody’s Investors Service spokesman David Jacobson told us by phone, "What’s more important is your ability to pay back that debt and how it is structured." Many Texas entities have good credit, he said. Our ruling Medina said, "At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans," but without mentioning that her comparison was based on the 10 most-populated states. Texas is second among the big states and third among all 50 in recent estimates. We rate her statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14591	Says Bernie Sanders advocated putting "Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/05/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-sanders-proposed-iranian-troops-syria/	In a heated debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sharpened the contrasts between them. Appearing on a stage at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Clinton targeted Sanders’ relative lack of national security experience. "A group of national security experts issued a very concerning statement about Sen. Sanders views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues," Clinton said. "Such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel." Last month, the Clinton campaign posted a critique of Sanders on precisely this point. The campaign said Sanders "has put forth proposals that indicate a lack of engagement and fundamental misunderstandings about the challenges before us." It cited Sanders’ own words. We found them on his Senate website and in the transcript of a November 2015 Democratic debate. In September 2014, Sanders issued a news release. It rejected any thought of sending American ground troops into Syria to fight ISIS. That level of fighting in Syria, he said, should be left to the Muslim nations. "The war against ISIS, a brutal and dangerous organization, cannot be won unless the Muslim nations which are most threatened -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey, Iran and Jordan -- become fully engaged, including the use of ground troops," Sanders said. "The U.S. and the international community should be fully supportive, but the leadership in this war must come from the Muslim world." During the Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 11, 2015, Sanders echoed that point. "Here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS." Warren Gunnels, policy adviser for the Sanders campaign, told us Sanders was promoting the idea of a broad Muslim coalition. "He has never advocated specifically for Iranian troops in Syria, but that there must be a coalition of nations with U.S. troops providing support," Gunnels said. "He certainly never advocated for Iranian troops on the Israeli border." It’s true that Sanders envisioned that the Iranian troops would be part of a much larger Muslim coalition that included Jordan and Turkey. While both nations might have significant disagreements with Israel, neither is an enemy of the Jewish state. Still, we can take it that Sanders did promote the presence of Iranian troops in Syria. Whether those troops themselves would be on the border with Israel is unknowable, but Syria of course shares a border with Israel. And Iran is no friend of Israel. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria. Sanders did advance that idea on two occasions. But Sanders’ comments were in the context of a multi-national Muslim fighting force that included nations largely friendly toward Israel. The statement is accurate but lacks some useful details. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-05T00:02:37	2016-02-04	['Syria', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-10576	"In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, got $500-million worth of pork barrel projects."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/john-mccain/clinton-brought-home-even-more-bacon-/	With polls showing he has a solid lead in most Super Tuesday states, Sen. John McCain took aim at Sen. Hillary Clinton while campaigning in Fairfield, Conn., on Feb. 3, 2008. McCain boasted that he never sought special projects for his state, while Clinton had sought too many. "In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, got $500-million worth of pork barrel projects. My friends, that kind of thing is going to stop," McCain said. We have previously found exceptions in McCain's claims about his own pork (we gave him a False in this item), but he's right that Clinton brought lots of federal money to New York. It's just that he dramatically understates how much pork she got. After she was elected in 2000, Clinton spent her first term focusing heavily on parochial issues. Often joining forces with the senior senator from New York, fellow Democrat Charles Schumer, Clinton issued a blizzard of news releases touting federal money such as $250,000 for "artspace" projects in Buffalo, $200,000 for the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum, $200,00 for the YWCA of Niagara and $69,036 for the golden nematode project at Cornell University (yeah, we had to look it up: the golden nematode is a pest that harms potatoes). The McCain campaign says it got the $500-million figure from two news stories — a Los Angeles Times, report from December 2007 that said "since taking office in 2001, Clinton has delivered $500-million worth of earmarks that have specifically benefited 59 corporations," and a report in The Hill , a Washington, D.C., political newspaper that said Clinton obtained at least $530-million in federal money from the first three of the 13 appropriations bills approved in 2007. But those reflect just a portion of Clinton's prolific pork production. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks congressional spending, has identified about $2.2-billion in Clinton projects in her seven years in the Senate. The group won't publish its final database for several weeks, but Keith Ashdown, an investigator for the group, said a preliminary analysis showed Clinton has brought home far more in federal money than the other senators in the presidential race, McCain and Barack Obama. Ashdown likened Clinton to Al D'Amato, the famous pothole politician who represented New York from 1981 to 1999. "She has used the power of the purse to take care of a lot of areas of New York," Ashdown said. So McCain is right that Clinton has brought truckloads of bacon to her New York constituents. McCain just dramatically understates the amount. (McCain's campaign said he was simply being "conservative" with his claim.) For our ruling, we find that while McCain's numbers are low, he's actually more correct than he realizes because she's brought so much pork to New York. We rate his attack Mostly True.

pomt-13429	"In the mid 1990s, in our state, (Florida was) No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds."	true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/19/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-was-no-1-violent-crime/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat. Crist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida’s pivotal I-4 corridor. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he’d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist’s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s. Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida’s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. "You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight," Jolly said to Crist. Jolly closed by asking, "Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?" Crist said "it was beneath" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time. "In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America," Crist said. "The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds," Crist added. In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly’s story about Crist’s visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist’s rebuttal. When it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics. Crist’s campaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states. The data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. To calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year. In 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot. The number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend. As for Crist’s other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade. The year 1993 marked Crist’s first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds. The figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995. In 1998, violent crimes were occurring every three minutes and 45 seconds — what Crist said. In 2015, violent crimes happened every five minutes and 37 seconds. Our ruling Crist said, "in the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds." Crist is correct on both factual claims. Florida led the nation in the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 population in the mid 1990s. And Florida did see a violent crime committed every three minutes and 45 seconds. In fact, for many years in the 1990s, a violent crime was committed even more often. We rate Crist’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95fa7bae-0471-4b13-aa94-917cbebbda9f	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2016-09-19T20:55:18	2016-09-19	['United_States', 'Florida']
pomt-15357	"President Obama in November of last year wiped away (a program) that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/08/harris-faulkner/fox-news-host-obama-ended-program-tracking-undocum/	When an undocumented immigrant from Mexico allegedly shot and killed a 32-year-old woman in San Francisco July 1, 2015, he triggered a round of finger pointing that variously laid blame on the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House. On Fox News, host Harris Faulkner connected the tragedy with a shift in administration policy last November. The Department of Homeland Security ended a program called Secure Communities that used fingerprints sent by local police departments to flag people who were in the country illegally. "President Obama in November of last year wiped away the Secure Communities program," Faulkner said on Outnumbered on July 6, 2015. "When you take away a program that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally ... you're tacitly saying we don't really care who we have in this country." Obama did end the Secure Communities program, but state and local law enforcement agencies still send the fingerprints of people they arrest to Washington. What has changed is how federal officials use that information. Secure Communities The Secure Communities program rolled out across the country from late 2008 through 2012. Basically, it had three parts. When state and local officials arrested someone, they would send their fingerprints to the FBI, and from there, those fingerprints would go to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE would look for matches in its files of people who had broken one immigration law or another, such as attempting to sneak across the border, overstaying a visa or some other violation. If it spotted someone, ICE would issue a detaining order. Local authorities would then hold the person so federal officers could pick him or her up for deportation. Secure Communities racked up big numbers. By 2013, the program had led to the deportations of about 300,000 people. Federal immigration officials using the program had identified about 1.5 million potential violators. But policy and legal setbacks quickly emerged. Many large cities and counties in states from Maryland to California began to refuse to honor the federal detaining orders. They complained that immigrants who were victims of crime were not telling police out of fear that they or people they knew would be caught in the program’s net. In 2014, an Oregon judge ruled that local officials had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment rights by keeping her without proper cause. In November 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson released a memo that replaced Secure Communities with a more targeted effort called the Priority Enforcement Program. What remained and what changed Specialists in immigration law and a spokesman for ICE explained that Secure Communities was actually a 3-step process. 1: Local and state police share the fingerprints of people they arrest. 2: ICE identifies matches in its database. 3: ICE issues a detaining order. Everything we learned said the first two steps remain in effect. Adam Cox is a researcher and law professor at the New York University School of Law. He and Thomas Miles at the University of Chicago School of Law got into the nuts and bolts of Secure Communities in the course of assessing its impact on crime. "The core technological innovation of mandatory, nationwide fingerprint screening, is unchanged and here to stay," Cox said. A spokesman for ICE, Pedro Ribeiro, confirmed that. Ribeiro explained that fingerprint sharing is standard procedure for just about every police department and sheriff’s office in the country. Some do it faster than others and some have better technology, but it is regular practice to send fingerprints to the National Crime Information Center at the FBI. Once the data is there, it is shared automatically with Homeland Security and other agencies. There’s nothing the locals can do to stop it. In 2014, the FBI’s center averaged 12 million data transactions each day. The system is a basic tool in fighting crime and countering terrorists, and when ICE gets the data, it helps track people in the country without authorization. The American Immigration Council advocates on behalf of immigrants. Mark Noferi tracks enforcement policy for the council and said that elements of Secure Communities shifted to other parts of Homeland Security. "By February 2014, the Criminal Alien Program was already responsible for the day-to-day management of Secure Communities fingerprint-sharing," Noferi said. "So, by Nov. 20, 2014, when Secretary Johnson ended ‘Secure Communities as we know it,’ DHS had already operationally combined Secure Communities with another ICE program." The part of the program that stopped in late 2014 was the practice of issuing detaining orders solely on the basis of breaking the country’s immigration laws. Enforcement was refocused on people convicted of a serious crime, participating in gang activity, selling drugs and so on. We heard from ICE that the process of identifying people who are in the country illegally continues, with database matches flowing to regional ICE centers. What happens to them there depends on the severity of the offense. Our ruling Faulkner said that Obama ended Secure Communities, a program that used fingerprint sharing to identify people in the country illegally. She is correct that Obama ended that program, but outside experts and ICE itself told us that the process of sharing fingerprints and identifying people who are not supposed to be in America continues. What ended was the deportation process that was at the center of Secure Communities. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. So we rate it Half True. Correction: Kathryn Steinle, the woman slain in San Francisco was in town to visit a sister-in-law who was expecting. The original report had that Steinle was expecting.

pomt-04629	Says "if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma."	true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/14/bill-hammond/bill-hammond-says-if-trends-hold-one-three-texas-w/	In an opinion piece published in Texas newspapers in August 2012, the chairman of the Texas Association of Business opened his call for funding successful preschool programs by suggesting potential among the state’s toddlers. "Our homes and preschools are filled with aspiring astronauts, firefighters, teachers and computer scientists," Bill Hammond wrote. "Unfortunately, if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma. That's not dreaming big, that's a Texas-sized nightmare. It's a formula for broken dreams, dead-end jobs and a strain on the state's economy." Are we on track for one of three adult Texans to lack even a high school diploma? That would be more than double the nearly 15 percent of the state’s 10.2 million workers aged 25 through 64 who had not graduated from high school as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Asked for his backup, Hammond pointed us toward Steven Murdock, the former state demographer who directs the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University. In a telephone interview, Murdock said Hammond was echoing a projection included in a 2003 book, "The New Texas Challenge," written by several authors led by Murdock. Murdock told us the projection, to be updated within the next year, was based on changes in the state’s racial and ethnic populations and assuming that people would continue to have the same levels of education in 2040 as 2000. Broadly, he said, generally highly-educated baby boomers have started retiring from the workforce and will continue to do so for the next 15 years. He said the baby boomers are being replaced with less-educated workers. "It’s a simple simulation," he said. "What we’re simply saying is that" the share of workers lacking a high school diploma "will absolutely be the case if we have the population growth we project and we do not have a change in the educational attainment of our different racial and ethnic groups." The relevant section of the book says that "in the absence of change in the educational characteristics of Blacks and Hispanics -- populations that are projected to grow more rapidly than the Anglo population -- the state’s labor force will be less well educated in the future than in 2000." A chart in the book shows that in 2000, nearly 19 percent of the state’s labor force lacked a high school diploma while 30.1 percent of the workforce will fit that category as of 2040. The projection, Murdock writes, is predicated on assuming that migration rates by age, sex and race-ethnicity remain what they were from 1990 to 2000. According to the chart, some 29 percent of the workforce will consist of high school graduates, about the same as in 2000, and about 24 percent of the workforce will have completed some college, compared to 29 percent in 2000. Finally, about 13 percent of the workforce will have a bachelor’s degree compared to 18 percent in 2000 while about 4 percent will have a graduate or professional degree compared to 5 percent in 2000. We asked Murdock if anything could knock his 30 percent projection askew. "A lot of things could," he replied, including whether some slowing in Hispanic immigration and/or a drop in Hispanic birth rates in the state prove permanent. Another factor, he said, would be state decisions to step up, or ratchet down, educational spending. Next, we asked an outside demographer, Elwood Carlson, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, if the methodology behind the projection seems solid. Carlson said the approach -- a cohort component survival projection model -- is a standard way of reaching such a forecast. Our ruling Hammond said "if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma." Murdock’s projection is that all factors staying the same, about 30 percent of workers will lack a high school diploma. We rate Hammond’s statement as True.

pomt-07748	Under former President George W. Bush’s administration "while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/26/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-jobs-increased-1-percent-under-geor/	Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine may not have given the crowd at the Feb. 19 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Richmond the scoop on whether he’s running for the U.S. Senate, but he made no secret of his disdain for former President George W. Bush’s record on job creation. Kaine said in a speech that during the Bush administration "while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent." We wondered if that was really the case. Alec Gerlach, a DNC spokesman, couldn’t identify the source on which the former Virginia governor based his claim. So we tried to find it on our own, comparing census records from January 2001 - the month Bush was sworn in - to January 2009, when Bush left office. That can be a bit tricky because the U.S. Census Bureau only does actual counts at the start of each decade, and that doesn’t exactly line up with Bush’s term, which ran from Jan. 20, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2009. Between each census, however, the bureau provides monthly estimates on the number of people in the country. The figures show that on Jan. 1, 2001, the U.S. population was 283.7 million. By Jan.1, 2009, that number had risen to 305.8 million. Those estimates show the population increasing by about 7.8 percent, below Kaine’s claim that the population jumped by 10 percent under Bush. What about the second half of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs only grew by 1 percent under Bush’s tenure? We turned to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that in the month that the former president took office, there were about 132.5 million non-farm employees in the U.S. In January 2008, the month after the official start of the Great Recession, the total number of non-farm workers peaked at 138 million. But as the economic downturn took hold, that number declined, and by the time Bush left office in January 2009 there were 133.6 million non-farm employees. So over the course of Bush Administration, the number of non-farm workers rose by about 1.1 million, or .83 percent. That’s just shy of Kaine’s claim that the number of jobs rose by 1 percent under Bush. While Kaine’s numbers are a little off on employment and census, he’s right in suggesting that that U.S. population grew 10 times faster that jobs during George W. Bush’s presidency. Even so, several economists told us comparing raw population growth and job numbers is not a preferred way to examine job creation versus demand. That’s because not all of the new people -- such as babies born during the Bush administration -- need jobs. We were told a more meaningful measure is labor force participation: the percentage of the population between 16 and 64 that is either employed or looking for work. According to BLS, participation was at 67.2 percent when Bush took office and 65.7 percent when he left. Here’s another thing to keep in mind: Economists have told us time and again -- on this claim and others -- that the policies of presidents and governors have only minor impact on economic cycles and job creation. "They get too much credit and too much blame," said Sylvia A. Allegretto, economist at the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Kaine’s comment didn’t address job growth in Virginia during the Bush administration. But it you’re curious, Virginia did better than the nation on Kaine’s scale. The number of nonfarm employees in the Virginia rose from 3.53 million in January 2001 to 3.7 million in January 2009 -- an increase of 4.8 percent. The U.S. Census estimate for Virginia that was closest to the start of Bush’s term was a July 1, 2001, figure showing the state had 7.19 million. A July 1, 2009, estimate shows the state’s population had grown to 7.88 million -- a 9.6 percent increase. To summarize, Kaine said that during former President George W. Bush’s administration, the U.S. population increased by 10 percent while the number of jobs went up only 1 percent. Estimates from the U.S. Census and the BLS show that during the Bush years, the population increased by 7.8 percent while the number of jobs rose by .83 percent. Kaine’s numbers are a little off his and spokesman doesn’t know where they came from. Even so, his suggestion that population growth outpaced job growth by a ratio of 10 to 1 is pretty much on the mark, so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14534	"The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)" is the "DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women."	false	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/16/centre-research-globalization/canadian-website-wrongly-links-whooping-cough-vacc/	There are many unanswered questions about the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a birth defect in which the baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Not every baby of an infected woman develops this syndrome, and the mechanism by which the virus might affect the fetus is uncertain. But moving around on the Internet is an entirely different take on the tie between Zika and microcephaly. It doesn’t exist, according to certain blogs, tweets and articles on conspiracy-leaning websites. The Canadian-based Centre for Research on Globalization, a group that advances ideas it feels the "mainstream press" ignores, had an article Feb. 4, 2016, from Dr. Gary Kohls that challenged the linkage theory and said the primary suspect is DTaP, a common vaccination to prevent whooping cough (along with tetanus and diphtheria). "In the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single ‘expert’ or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses," Kohls wrote. So is DTaP is the "most likely triggering cause" of microcephaly? Most of Kohls’ article describes why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pharmaceutical companies and researchers would care to blame the Zika virus rather than the vaccine, but its main point is the overlap of the microcephaly incidence and Brazil’s immunization campaign. Brazil did begin vaccinating pregnant women starting in late 2014. (Hat tip to Brazilian fact-checker Cristina Tardáguila at Lupa News.) However, according to the Brazilian Health Department press release, the vaccine they distributed was a version called Tdap. This was part of an international push to reduce whooping cough in infants. Inoculating mothers late in pregnancy allowed them to pass antibodies to their unborn children. For the rest of this fact-check, we look at Tdap. The Web article named the incorrect vaccine, but if there’s any merit to Kohls’ case -- and there isn’t -- it lies with the vaccine Brazil used. Kohl also wrote that "there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports." The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does show about that number of countries and territories where Zika has been found, but in 13 of those places, there are few cases. Either no instances of Zika have been found in the past two months, or the number of cases was less than 10. So it’s a bit misleading to suggest that the absence of microcephaly disproves the link between the birth defect and the Zika virus. If we find more detailed statistics on the number of cases of Zika and microcephaly, we’ll update this item, but there’s a much bigger problem with Kohls’ statement. Evidence on the safety of Tdap The weakest part of the argument that Tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that pregnant women in the United States, and elsewhere, have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly. Elyse Kharbanda is a top national researcher on vaccine safety at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis. "Our research has not shown any link between Tdap vaccination in pregnant women and microcephaly in their children," Kharbanda told us. Melissa Brower in the CDC press office reiterated that point. "Our safety monitoring is continuous," Brower said. "We have not observed any unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that would indicate a potential safety problem with maternal Tdap vaccination and microcephaly as a birth outcome." A 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association included over 29,000 pregnant women in six states. It found no problems of any birth defects for any woman who was vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. Another JAMA study looked at over 26,000 pregnant women in California and reached the same conclusion. Researchers at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program further affirm the safety of Tdap. Director and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases Buddy Creech said nothing shows any link between the vaccine and microcephaly or any other birth defect. Creech also noted that the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, between weeks 27 and 36. That timing is important. "Most organ development and structural changes are occurring in the first trimester," Creech said. "It’s after the period of most intense organ development, so it removes the question of whether a vaccine caused congenital heart disease, etc." However, the CDC says in some cases, microcephaly can occur after the first trimester, so in theory, a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly. But that doesn’t change the rest of the research pattern. The United Kingdom launched a vaccination program in 2012, making Tdap available to about 700,000 pregnant women. Researchers looked at the impact on about 20,000 of them and found no increase in pregnancy risks. On a related note, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that the Zika virus was found in the brain tissue of an aborted fetus suffering from microcephaly. While this says nothing about the role of Tdap, it does directly link the Zika virus to a particular birth defect. We contacted the editors at the Centre for Research on Globalization and they said they forwarded our questions to Kohls. If we hear back, we’ll update this item. Our ruling An online article on the website of the Centre for Research of Globalization said the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. More important, not a bit of evidence supports the assertion that either variety lies behind microcephaly. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly. In addition, administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood that it will interfere with fetal development. The statement is inaccurate in every respect including naming the wrong version of the vaccine used in Brazil. We rate it False.

pomt-14830	"If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/20/martin-omalley/gov-martin-omalley-says-immigration-reform-will-bo/	While presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks. In a Nov. 12, 2015 interview on "Overheard with Evan Smith," O’Malley discussed President Barack Obama’s executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. O’Malley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because it’s "something important for the economy of the United States." "If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household," he elaborated. "Why? Because you’re getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America." The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has hovered around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015. We don’t and can’t check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as O’Malley said. Long-term figure O’Malley’s campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House report, published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, "The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System," states that "in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity." The White House’s conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the economic impact of that bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. The $250 figure O’Malley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 – and doesn’t otherwise estimate year-by-year changes. As the White House report breaks it down: "CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In today’s terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household." Wages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades. A web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBO’s calculation. To reach its conclusion about immigration reform’s effect on wages, the CBO report uses a "positivity effect," a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas says, the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: "Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity." Other research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBO’s analysis. An August 2013 article from the Brookings Institution compared the bill’s potential effects to immigration’s historical impact on the economy, finding that "on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages." On the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income. Lower wages in the short term Even if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade. Comprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust. Wages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce. Brookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates. Other considerations Immigration reform’s effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, "Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures." In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population. Additionally, Wright says, immigration reform would create work through "demand-side channels." "Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others," Wright said. Increasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Immigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added. Our ruling O’Malley’s claim that immigration reform would "make wages go up on average $250 for the average household" would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly. O’Malley’s statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08326	"Of those 850,000 (new Texas) jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/29/bill-white/bill-white-says-most-texas-jobs-added-during-rick-/	Gov. Rick Perry frequently crows about the Texas economy, lately saying that in his near-decade as governor, Texas has gained more than 850,000 jobs. In an Oct. 15 interview, Perry's Democratic opponent didn't challenge that number. However, Bill White told the Texas Tribune: "Of those 850,000 jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs." Huh. We hadn't heard that. Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, later said that White thinks that being able to attract high-wage jobs is crucial to the state's long-term economic growth. Texas is a national leader in low-wage jobs, she said, sounding a down note that reminded us of Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Linda Chavez-Thompson's claim that Texas leads the nation in its share of minimum-wage employees, a statement we rated True in May. In 2009, 474,000 Texas workers — 8.5 percent of the hourly work force — earned the federal minimum wage or less, according to a March 11 news release from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest proportion of low-wage earners in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the release said. We wondered how many of those jobs were created on Perry's watch, per White's claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector. First, some background: The 850,000 figure touted by Perry and dissected by White reflects the net increase in nonfarm jobs in the state from January 2001, soon after Perry became governor, through June 2010 (actual gain = 853,400). In September, we rated True the statement in Perry's "Texas: Open for Business" TV ad that "we've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined." However, updated statistics show that through August, the net jobs gained had decreased to 818,500. We also noted that the Texas State Data Center has projected that the Texas population grew by about 4 million between 2001 and 2010. When asked to back up White's breakdown of the job gains, the White campaign provided a spreadsheet of calculations using bureau data to show the rise in both government-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs in Texas. The campaign looked at several time periods, including the one favored by the Perry campaign, January 2001 to June 2010, and others that incorporated the most recent data available, through August 2010. In an accompanying letter, Tom McCasland, a research analyst for White's campaign, said their calculations showed that government and minimum-wage jobs accounted for 62.8 percent to 69.5 percent of the total job gains. For the time period corresponding to the 850,000 figure (January 2001 to June 2010), the relevant portion of the job gains was 67.5 percent, according to McCasland's information. But in reviewing their math, we found several wrinkles: 1) The bureau's information on public sector and minimum-wage jobs come from different sources that gather data at different time intervals, said Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas. The employment information by sector is compiled monthly while the minimum-wage job situation is examined annually. In this case, that means the time periods for the two categories don't match exactly. 2) Our calculation of the increase in minimum-wage jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure (259,000) didn't match White's (267,000). Why the discrepancy? We used the bureau's most recent information to compare the number of minimum-wage jobs in Texas in 2001 and 2009. McCasland said he had used older bureau information and had compared 2002 with 2009. 3) Another issue: The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. During the years the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 (1998-2006), the number of Texas workers making at or below that amount actually declined slightly, except for a small uptick in 2003. From 2006 to 2009, Abbot said, "just over 300,000 more Texans" entered that low-paid category. However, "we have no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage," she said. That's a fair point, McCasland said. Then he made one of his own: "Because Gov. Perry continues to talk about net job creation, it is appropriate to look at how many of those net jobs end up as minimum-wage jobs, either because they were created as such or because they become minimum-wage jobs by failing to keep up with inflation." Lastly, we realized White's calculations assume that government jobs and minimum-wage jobs are entirely separate categories; what if there's overlap and White counted some jobs twice? Abbot told us that's possible but that there's no way to know because the bureau doesn't have data broken down that way. "The best I can tell you is that at the national level — which may or may not represent Texas at all — among all hourly-paid public sector workers, 2.3 percent were paid at or below the prevailing minimum wage" in 2009, Abbot said. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Ann Hatchitt told us the commission doesn't keep detailed information on minimum-wage workers in Texas, including how many are in the public sector. What we know: Texas added 853,400 jobs from January 2001 through June 2010. Of those, 308,800 were government jobs. That's about 36 percent. To prove White's statement that most (more than 50 percent) of the new jobs were public-sector and minimum wage, an additional 117,901 would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage. But we can't calculate that because the bureau's count of minimum-wage jobs doesn't discriminate between brand-new jobs and pre-existing ones that were swept into the count when the minimum wage went up. We asked experts including University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh and Bruce Kellison, associate director of UT's Bureau of Business Research, whether we could make a ballpark estimate of how many of the job gains under Perry were minimum wage. Each of them said nope, primarily because employment data doesn't break it out. Summing up: White's campaign presented raw numbers suggesting that about two-thirds of the jobs added on Perry's watch were either government-sector or minimum-wage. But that methodology lacks critical information that could easily lead to a different conclusion. That's why we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15033	"Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history."	true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/02/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-us-has-enjoyed-fastest-crude-oil-p/	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said in his recently released energy plan that the United States should take advantage of its resurgent status as "a global energy superpower." Thanks to new means of extracting oil such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, there’s been an unprecedented spike in domestic oil production, the former Florida governor said. "Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history," his plan read. Has oil production really seen the fastest increase in the nation’s history, topping 80 percent or higher since 2008? It sure has, reversing a decline that began back in 1986. We went to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which keeps monthly and annual statistics for crude oil production. They said that in 2008, the United States produced 5 million barrels per day, a figure that has jumped to more than 9 million per day in 2015. A Bush spokeswoman confirmed to us that was the same data they were using when drawing up the energy plan. As you can see, that’s a pretty steep spike in production over a seven-year period: The change is largely because of the reasons Bush gave, according to EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan. Better technology like fracking and horizontal drilling, which makes extraction from geological formations like layers of shale easier, has led to an overall increase in output. Relatively high oil prices (about $140 per barrel in 2008, as opposed to less than $50 recently) also helped lead to the ramp-up in production. You may recall that gas prices reached a single-day high in 2008, with a gallon costing $4.11 that July. The highest-ever nationwide annual average of $3.60 per gallon was in 2012. Mark Perry, a University of Michigan-Flint economics professor working with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that Bush’s take is accurate. He said based on EIA numbers through July, U.S. crude production has gone up 83 percent since 2008. That bumps up to 88 percent if you measure the current 2015 average of almost 9.4 million barrels per day. (We will note that 2008 includes a storm-related drop in September, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav churned through the Gulf of Mexico and production dropped to less than 4 million barrels per day.) "It’s pretty clear that the production increase from 2008-15 ... has been the largest production increase ever in U.S. history in such a short period of time," he said via email. From 2009 to 2014, the increase in oil production didn’t bring the price drop economists expected, Perry said. Now that oil prices have dropped so much recently, we’re just starting to see production back off. The latest EIA data showed production has dropped 144,000 barrels per day since July, with estimates saying it’s going to continue to decrease. "It took a while for the price to finally catch up to the increased U.S. production, and now we’re in an adjustment period," Perry said. He said the slowdown was temporary and "will likely be followed by another period of increased production in a year or two when oil prices go back up above $50 and stay there." Our ruling Bush said, "Since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80 percent, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history." That’s accurate, as high prices and new extraction methods have led to a significant increase in the amount of crude oil the country produces. Depending on how you calculate it, production has gone up 83 percent through July, or 88 percent if you use the current 2015 average. Production is currently dipping downward, but it’s easily the fastest increase in a seven-year span in U.S. history. We rate Bush’s statement True.

pomt-14016	Says "Obama wants to give (Iran) nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/jun/02/jon-keyser/keyser-says-obama-bennet-want-give-iran-nukes-deal/	In an attention-grabbing TV ad, Colorado Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser accuses President Barack Obama and Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of wanting to give nuclear weapons to Iran. The ad opens with a narrator highlighting Keyser’s role as a military intelligence officer in Iraq, where he "conducted capture and kill missions to remove high value targets in urban areas." "For us, Baghdad was the roughest. We weren’t fighting amateurs; we were fighting a vicious enemy armed by Iran," Keyser says. Then he pivots to the claim we’re fact-checking: "Now Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it." Keyser is among five Republicans vying to win the June 28 primary and the right to take on Bennet in the general election. He’s not the only Republican attacking a Democratic opponent this election season on the Iran deal, which the Obama administration and five other nations approved in 2015. Earlier this month, PolitiFact Florida issued a False rating when a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate said two Democratic opponents "supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." Those Democrats did support the deal, but the intention was clearly not to allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. When we rechecked the terms for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. Keyser’s ad goes a step further to say Obama and Bennet want Iran to produce such a weapon. That incendiary characterization is also not true. We contacted the Keyser campaign. A spokesman did not provide evidence to back up the claim. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact in recent months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s "breakout time" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. "It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material," Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. "It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days." Bennet was among a majority of Democrats who voted three times over 10 days in September to successfully block a Republican resolution to kill the Iran deal. According to the New York Times, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called multiple votes on the measure to reject the Iran accord. In part, he wanted to see if he could win a few votes needed to break the deadlock, the Times reported, but the votes also forced Democrats to repeatedly endorse a deal that they’d have to defend this election year. In a statement after his vote, Bennet said, "My conclusion is that the (Iran agreement) is more likely to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than the plausible alternatives." Bennet added that the deal "has flaws," and he has co-sponsored legislation to "clarify better how we will respond if Iran cheats on this deal." The legislation, which remains in committee, seeks to create a "strategy with our partners to ensure that Iran appreciates the consequences of its violations, for the next 15 years and beyond," he said in a separate statement. Our ruling Keyser said, "Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it." Keyser portrays the agreement as a plot to arm Iran with nukes when it’s designed to do exactly the opposite. The terms of the deal forbid Iran from pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must allow inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). It's ridiculous to say Obama and Bennet wanted this deal because they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon.

pomt-08492	Debbie Jackow "unlike her opponent ... WILL NOT de-fund the 20/20 land program."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/10/debbie-jackow/debbie-jackow-says-opponent-doesnt-support-land-pr/	Lab tech and political newcomer Debbie Jackow's campaign mailer touts what she is not. She is not her opponent, two-term incumbent Lee County Commissioner Tammy Hall. Jackow lists her bulleted campaign promises under the header, "Unlike her opponent Debbie WILL NOT..." • Be a tax and spend commissioner • Raise property taxes • Be owned by special interests • De-fund the 20/20 land program That last line about the county's Conservation 20/20 program caught our attention. We wondered, is that a fair accusation? Voters approved the 20/20 land program in a 1996 referendum to help the county buy up and exempt environmentally sensitive land from development. The program taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of assessed property value. In 14 years, Lee County taxpayers have spent $286.5 million to preserve 37 square miles of land. Hall has always voted to approve funding for the program. She voted for it again this year, and it's approved through 2011. We looked for evidence to support Jackow's claim that Hall planned in the future to pull funds from Conservation 20/20. We pulled footage from the July 6, 2010, commission meeting where commissioners voted to fund the program. This meeting and the media's coverage of it, Jackow said, were the basis of her accusation. Clerk of Court Charlie Green suggested at the start of the meeting that the commission divert $27 million from Conservation 20/20 this year ­to help fill the county's budget deficit. Hall's only response was to invite Green to stay at the meeting through the vote on the 14-year-old program. Two hours into the meeting, Hall thanked Commissioner Ray Judah for his support of Conservation 20/20. She then said, "I support, I have always supported the (Conservation) 20/20 program." She led a unanimous vote to continue funding the program. So where did Jackow's accusation come from? "It was in The News-Press," Jackow said. "(Hall) said she would consider touching the 20/20 money." A July 7 News-Press article said, "Commission Chairwoman Tammy Hall said the board should be looking ahead to further cost-cutting measures. She cited Clerk of Court Charlie Green's idea of putting a halt to the county's land conservation purchasing program and using its tax dollars to help plug the budget hole." A look at the meeting footage shows Hall suggesting the county continue to make cuts. Without expressing support for Green's idea, she also states, "The clerk has given us ideas on how to maybe put things on hold and transfer over, but that is our goal ... that the average citizen in Lee County does not see a tax increase." Hall offered no further comment on Green's suggestion during the meeting. Hall has supported Conservation 20/20 every year she's been in office, including the current year. To say Hall is considering de-funding the program would be a stretch. Saying she has de-funded the program is clearly incorrect. We rate this statement False.

pomt-11863	"We are spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/02/nancy-mcfarlane/mayor-says-raleigh-spending-more-housing-dix-park/	Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane’s opponent says the City Council isn’t doing enough to sustain and build affordable housing. Her opponent is Charles Francis, a Democrat who called for a runoff election after mayoral candidates failed to get the 50 percent of the vote required to secure a win. McFarlane, who’s unaffiliated, got 48 percent of the vote on Oct. 10. Francis got 36 percent and Republican Paul Fitts got 12 percent. In a televised debate on Oct. 20, Francis suggested the city shouldn’t focus all of its energy on Dix Park when more basic needs go unaddressed. Dix Park is a 308-acre property just south of downtown Raleigh that the city bought from the state in 2014 for $52 million. McFarlane defended the city’s work on Dix Park, as well as the council’s investment in housing – an area where Francis has said Raleigh should be doing more. "We are spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now," she said. The claim is suspect not only because the city bought Dix Park in 2014 but because Dix Park and affordable housing have shared an identical funding source since summer 2016. The City Council last year raised the property tax rate by two cents – one cent to generate money for affordable housing and the other cent to pay off Dix Park debt. Each cent generated about $5.7 million for its respective purpose in fiscal year 2016-17, which ended this June. The city expects to raise about $6 million for each cause this fiscal year, which ends next June. So, with that said, why did McFarlane claim that the city is paying more for affordable housing than Dix Park? Let’s judge McFarlane on this fiscal year, since she referenced current spending. Paying for Dix Park The city bought the Dix property with the intention of transforming it into a "destination" park that downtown residents or workers can walk to and other Wake County residents would want to drive to. The city hopes to inspire locals to participate in the planning process and there have been several events at the property. Francis has criticized McFarlane and other city leaders, saying they seem more enthusiastic about developing Dix Park than fixing roads or putting air conditioning in city gyms. Kate Pearce, the city’s point person for Dix Park, says the city budgeted $300,000 and $307,000, respectively, for ongoing maintenance at the park each of the past two years. Those figures include mowing, landscaping, clean-up and salaries of park staff members, she said. The planning process and most of the programs held on the Dix property to this point have been paid for by Raleigh’s nonprofit partner, the Dix Park Conservancy. The conservancy signed a deal with the city last year promising to pay at least $2 million of the planning effort and may commit up to an additional $1 million for planning-related activities, she said. So let’s recap: This fiscal year, the city expects to spend about $6 million on Dix-related debt and an additional $307,000 for Dix Park maintenance – combining for a total of $6.3 million in spending. What is affordable housing? First, an explanation: "affordable housing" is a blanket term that can refer to anything from living spaces owned or subsidized by the city, county or federal government to homes owned by the private sector for which low-income residents can pay on their own. Wake County uses the term to describe housing that can be bought or rented by people earning less than 60 percent of Wake's annual median income, $78,800, which comes out to $47,280 a year. Roughly 126,000 Wake residents earn less than that, county statistics show. McFarlane referenced city spending on affordable housing. But even that can be complicated to track. Not only does Raleigh spend money it generates on its own, it’s also tasked with spending money it gets from the federal government. City spending Larry Jarvis, director of Raleigh’s housing and neighborhoods department, says it’s hard to compare year-by-year affordable housing spending. For instance, a voter-approved bond referendum in 2011 set aside $16 million for affordable housing with some of the funds subject to annual expenditure and the rest committed to large affordable housing projects that sometimes take three years to actually complete. "For large tax credit projects like Washington Terrace, local funds are committed or encumbered when the projects are awarded tax credits by the (North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) and then ‘spent’ during construction," Jarvis wrote in an email. "All of the funds have been encumbered for specific affordable housing projects and the funds will be spent as construction progresses." In fiscal year 2017-18, the city budgeted $7.24 million on affordable housing units or housing-related spending, said Tonya Walton, a senior budget and management analyst for the city. The city will spend another $6 million in federal funds on affordable housing and other community development activities, Jarvis added. Our ruling McFarlane said the city is "spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now." The city’s $52 million purchase of the Dix property was certainly a big one. But the city’s is paying for it incrementally and McFarlane is right that the city this year is spending more on affordable housing – $7.24 million – than it is on Dix Park – $6.3 million.

pomt-06403	Barack Obama is the "First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/28/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-first-president-terminat/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail critical of President Barack Obama that’s been making the rounds. It’s headlined, "Barack Obama's 32 Month Report Card." "Mr. Hope and Change wants to create a nation humbled; humiliated, casting-aside capitalism and individual freedoms for one where ‘we the people’ are government controlled," says the chain e-mail, which is attributed to a Rich Carroll. "This would be a system that genuflects mediocrity, steals personal aspiration and opportunity, and punishes those who strive to succeed." The e-mail proceeds to offer roughly three dozen "firsts" about Obama, all of them highly unflattering. We can’t check each and every claim in the e-mail, but we decided instead to spot-check a few claims we hadn’t seen before. (Here’s the full text of the e-mail we received.) The one we’ll check here is that Obama is the "First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space." On July 21, 2011, space shuttle Atlantis arrived at its home port, NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, concluding the last-ever shuttle mission. With the end of the space shuttle program, it’s correct that the United States no longer has the ability to send an astronaut into space by a domestic launch. The hope is that commercial companies based in the U.S. will be ready to launch by 2016, if Congress provides NASA with adequate funding, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. NASA's own system is not likely to be ready until at least 2020, though that might be accelerated by a couple of years at most, she said. So, for at least five years, the United States will not be able to send astronauts into orbit. In the interim, American astronauts are slated to blast off on Russian spacecraft, according to what NASA told PolitiFact Texas the last time we checked this issue. Unlike the reusable space shuttles, the Russian crafts -- which are launched from a base in Kazakhstan -- are disposable. So the chain e-mail contains a grain of truth that the U.S. no longer has the "ability to put a man in space" -- at least from American soil. (The author of the e-mail would have been more accurate if he'd made clear that we’re unable to do domestic launches specifically.) Still, containing that grain of truth doesn’t mean the e-mail’s claim is correct. Initially, we focused on the question of whether it was fair to blame Obama singlehandedly for the current state of affairs for U.S. manned launches. Knowing how long it takes space programs to come to fruition, we were skeptical that it Obama deserved all the blame. When we contacted space experts for their view, they agreed that it would be unfair to blame only Obama. "President George W. Bush directed NASA to shut down the shuttle program, with full knowledge that there would be a multi-year gap for human spaceflight," said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. "Although President Obama could have tried to reverse that directive, he opted instead to promote the near-term development of U.S. commercial capabilities for transportation to and from low-earth orbit (which includes the International space station) and, in the longer term, to develop a heavy-lift NASA-operated launch system for exploration missions beyond low-earth orbit." So Ellegood sees several problems with the chain e-mail’s claim. Obama did not terminate the shuttle capability -- rather, the timing was set in motion by his predecessor, Bush. And once in office, Obama added two shuttle missions in order to reduce the duration of the gap and also worked to get the shuttle’s commercial-based replacement lined up. But there’s another fact that’s even more damning to the e-mail’s claim: Having a gap in U.S. space flights carrying astronauts actually happened once before, making the claim completely untrue. The United States had no ability to launch astronauts into space from 1975 -- the year of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project -- until 1981, when the space shuttle program went live. "One could blame (President Richard) Nixon, who ended Apollo and approved the shuttle, or (President Gerald) Ford, who didn't disagree with Nixon, though by 1974 it might have been too late to rescue Apollo," Smith said. "Usually it's Nixon who is ‘blamed’ for that. By the time Carter came into office, Apollo had already ended and shuttle couldn't be accelerated. It actually was supposed to be ready by 1979, but NASA couldn't pull it off." That the author of the e-mail made this charge against Obama is evidence that "no one really noticed the original gap at the time, or remembers it today, even though it was a six-year gap," Smith said. Our ruling Whether one wants to blame Bush or Obama for our current predicament turns out to be irrelevant to the question raised in the e-mail. Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of "first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space" -- not Obama.

pomt-11419	The default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today, and "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/20/dennis-kucinich/ohio-governors-race-dennis-kucinich-misleads-about/	Former Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich says that young people look with trepidation toward the future because they can’t afford college. He has promised if elected governor he will make it possible for every young Ohioan to attend a two-year college tuition free. "The default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent," he wrote on his campaign website. But now, the "default rate approaches 50 percent." His website also stated "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans." Kucinich is competing in the May 8 Democratic primary for governor. We fact-checked his statistics and found he has a point that student debt is a big problem, but he flubbed some of the numbers about the default rate and then used those to estimate the numbers of Ohioans facing debt. Default rates Kucinich’s claim that "the default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent" is based on a credible report, but Kucinich presented the number as a default rate in the past while the report cites that figure as a prediction for the future. A January report by Columbia professor Judith Scott-Clayton for the Brookings Institution analyzed national data on student debt and repayment, released by the U.S. Education Department in October 2017. Scott-Clayton projected that about 40 percent of the students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023, based on patterns of defaults from earlier cohorts. While Kucinich wrote about student debt as a broad problem, the Brookings report said default rates are higher for students who attend for-profit colleges and for students of color. "The results suggest that diffuse concern with rising levels of average debt is misplaced," Scott-Clayton wrote wrote. Scott-Clayton, the author of the Brookings report, told PolitiFact that her projections do not adjust for changes in student composition, institutional choices, or loan characteristics that might relate to the likelihood of default. It is possible the actual rates will be higher or lower. Sandy Baum, who wrote a report for the College Board, sent PolitiFact data showing that the two-year cohort default rate was nowhere near 40 percent in the past couple of decades. The high point in the two-year cohort default rate between 1987 and 2010 was 22.4 percent in 1990. (Default rates are now measured in three-year cohorts.) We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that the student default rate approaches 50 percent today. The U.S. Education Department released data in 2017 which showed the national default rate for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. (It was 13.6 percent in Ohio.) 'Perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default.' The Kucinich campaign arrived at the estimated prediction of 800,000 in default based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, which are not borne out by actual data. A Kucinich campaign spokesman said that 14 percent of the national population are federal student loan borrowers, or 44 million. If that same percentage holds true for Ohio, then 1.6 million Ohio residents have federal student loans. Using their estimate that half will default (which we found no data to support) would bring the number to 800,000. We went in search of actual numbers of Ohioans who defaulted. U.S. Education Department state data for the FY 2014 cohort showed that 28,955 Ohio borrowers defaulted, or 13.6 percent Mark Kantrowitz, a national expert on student debt, said that while the 800,000 number isn’t justified, Kucinich has a point about the problem of student debt. "Generally, the burden of paying for college has shifted from the federal and state government to families because of a failure of government support to keep pace with increases in college costs on a per-student, inflation-adjusted basis," he said. "Since family income has been flat and loans are the only form of aid that has any degree of elasticity, this has driven annual increases in borrowing to pay for college." Our ruling Kucinich’s campaign website said the default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today, and that "perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans." That’s based on a report that predicted that 40 percent of students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023. So that’s a prediction about the future -- not a default rate for 10 years ago. We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that about 50 percent of students default today. U.S. Education Department data showed that the default rate nationally for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. Using the 50 percent figure and extrapolating from population numbers, the Kucinich campaign concluded that 800,000 face default on their loans. That figure is not supported by actual data.

pomt-09827	"Under the plan, for the first five years your employer not only has to keep the coverage, but you can't migrate to the public plan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/28/anthony-weiner/employers-dont-have-keep-coverage-under-health-ref/	Rep. Anthony Weiner went on the Fox News Channel to offer a spirited defense of House Democrats' plans for health reform, taking questions on the show Fox & Friends . Brian Kilmeade, one of the Fox & Friends hosts, asked him, "What if your company who gives you health care insurance, which you know happens more often than not, says: 'You know what? I'm looking at my budget. I'm going to go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance. The quality is dropped and I save some money.'" "Prohibited under the plan," said Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn, N.Y. "Under the plan, for the first five years your employer not only has to keep the coverage, but you can't migrate to the public plan. The concern was we didn't want a giant movement." Weiner's point that employers can't immediately shift workers to the public option is right. But almost all the other details are wrong. We've read the 1,000-page House bill and there is no rule that employers have to keep coverage for five years, for example. We asked Weiner's office for an explanation and didn't hear back. To examine the rest of his comments, let's recap the basics of the House bill: Employer-provided insurance stays in place. Individuals and small businesses go to a new national health care exchange, where they can comparison shop for health insurance. Private insurers compete on the exchange, but one of the plans is a public option, a low-cost, basic insurance plan offered by the government. During year 1, small businesses with 10 or fewer employees can use the exchange. During the year 2, it's 20 or fewer employees. During year 3, a health choices commissioner has the authority to phase in businesses with more employees. The legislation doesn't say if or when every employer would be allowed on the exchange. The health bill would also set new standards for coverage, requiring insurers to cover basic procedures and adhere to new consumer protection rules. Employer-sponsored insurance will have to meet those same consumer protection rules, but they have a five-year grace period before they have to comply. (See Section 102 on page 17 of the House bill.) So employers can keep their current plans for up to five years before the plans have to conform to the new rules. But there's nothing in the bill that forces them to keep their current coverage. They can change insurance providers just as they do now. Only if they choose to drop coverage would they have to pay an additional tax. Weiner also says, "you can't migrate to the public plan." That's true only if you're talking about large employers having access to the exchange. Individuals are allowed to shop on the exchange right away, if they're willing to drop their employer-sponsored coverage. "You" might not want to, though: In most cases, employers pay part of their workers' insurance premiums. A worker with a large employer who drops coverage from their job to go to the exchange would lose that contribution. In fact, this point also undermines the premise of Kilmeade's question. He said that if he's an employer, he can "go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance." This is not an accurate description of how employers are allowed to use the exchange. The bill clearly states that employers cannot select a particular insurance plan for their employees on the exchange. (See Section 202, page 81.) The employers can contribute a set amount to help cover their employees, but they can't force their workers to pick the public option if the workers are willing to pay more to get private insurance. So the idea that employers can sign their workers up for the public option to save money is wrong. Getting back to Weiner's statement, he said that an employer has to keep coverage for the first five years. But there's nothing in the legislation that forces companies to keep coverage, although large employers would face a tax penalty if they dropped it altogether. He also says you can't migrate to the public plan. It's true that employers can't force their workers onto the public plan, but individuals can select it if they choose to. The only thing Weiner gets right is that employers can't dump their workers into the public option. Almost all the details are wrong. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Faber said the first bills introduced by Senate Republicans would include legislation focused on job training and placement to maintain the strength of the state economy. "Ohio companies," he said, "export more goods and services globally than 41 other states." That aroused the curiosity of PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more, partly because the ranking means Ohio would trail less populous states. The Ohio Department of Development said in its latest report on state exports that Ohio was the 9th largest exporting state, confirming what he said. The Development Department is an affiliate of the U.S. Census Bureau. With the U.S. Commerce Department, it is the official source for U.S. export and import statistics. We followed our curiosity further into its data from 2011, the most recent available: In global exports, Ohio trails Texas, California, New York, Washington, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana and Michigan. The state's largest export market is Canada, followed by Mexico, China, France and Brazil. The state's largest merchandise export category is transportation equipment. And export-supported jobs linked to manufacturing account for an estimated 7.1 percent of Ohio's total private-sector employment. Faber's statement rates True on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-09290	The financial services bill will end "too-big-to-fail."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/26/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-financial-bill-will-end-too-big/	The battle over financial reform continued on the Sunday morning shows on April 25, 2010, including the pivotal question of whether a pending bill in the Senate would end the notion that some giant financial services companies could receive special government protection because they are "too big to fail." On ABC's This Week, for instance, Austan Goolsbee, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told host Jake Tapper, "Well, the president is totally committed, and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore." Meanwhile, on NBC's Meet the Press, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said that when it comes to the question of too big to fail, "We're going to shut that down forever." On This Week, Tapper asked Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, "Sen. Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Sen. Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?" Brown responded, "Yes, it does." A spokeswoman for Brown amplified the senator's comments by telling PolitiFact that "the bill would end the too-big-to-fail policy by setting up a clear process for liquidating large banks that was not available to regulators when faced with the insolvency of" Lehman Brothers, AIG and Citigroup during the financial crisis of 2008. She added that the bill would constrain a Federal Reserve Board authority known as Section 13 (3) that allows the central bank to aid financial services companies "in unusual and exigent circumstances." However, despite some differences in wording, Brown's exchange mirrors a statement we analyzed four days earlier and rated Barely True. In that comment, we looked at what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in an April 19, 2010, floor speech -- that the bill "will end taxpayer bailouts." Bailouts have become a special focus of attention because they are especially unpopular among Americans today. Republican pollster Frank Luntz has advised opponents of regulation that "the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout." And when lawmakers talk about firms that are "too big to fail," they are referring to the risk that the government -- and therefore the taxpayers -- could be on the hook for bailing them out if things turn bad. We rated Reid's statement Barely True because while the bill's provisions are designed to reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, the bill does not include a provision that actually bars future bailouts. As a result, we concluded that despite taking significant strides to curb future bailouts, Reid's use of the term "end" was too definitive to be accurate. After This Week aired on April 25, we asked several financial services experts whether Brown, like Reid, was too definitive in saying that too-big-to-fail would "end" with enactment of this bill. All agreed that Brown was indeed too definitive. To explain why, we'll recap the relevant provisions of the bill and how outside experts characterize what the bill does -- and does not -- do. The current version of the Senate bill -- which may not be the final version -- would, among other things, create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse. The bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. For firms that are "systematically significant" -- a term considered equivalent to "too big to fail" -- the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says: "In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary." The bill's language sets a clear intent: Don't keep a hobbled giant going by using taxpayer money; instead, use industry money to close it down in an orderly fashion. Free-market purists may see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a "bailout." However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company taxpayer money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as "a rescue from financial distress." And in this context, we don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a "rescue." But despite the bill's good intentions -- including its efforts to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place -- our sources generally agreed that Brown's statement, like Reid's, was too definitive about the bill spelling an "end" to bailouts for "too-big-to-fail" companies. If the danger to the wider economy from a potential collapse is perceived to be big enough some day, the federal government will probably bite the bullet and lend some financial support, our sources agreed. "The bill will reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, as well as reduce the magnitude of any that might nevertheless occur," said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. "But 'end' is too strong for what can't be complete certainty under almost any conceivable circumstances." Ronald H. Filler, director of the Center on Financial Services Law at New York Law School, said that he did not see "how the proposed Senate bill completely eliminates the 'too big to fail' theory. If the Treasury secretary wants to bail out a General Motors or an AIG in the future, he should still have the right to act in an emergency state, in my opinion. Whether he will exercise this right, and whether he believes that he needs, and will seek, congressional approval before so acting, is a political question, but not a legal one." "There is no way to know until the next crisis whether a proposal will 'end bailouts' -– it will depend on what policymakers do at the time," agreed Robert Litan, a senior fellow in economics at the liberal Brookings Institution. In the meantime, several sources pointed out that the bill's fund cannot be used to "save" a company or its shareholders, but a firm's creditors appear to remain eligible for payouts. "I realize that there are differing views on the necessity of such authority, and I don't question the sincerity of supporters who see this as the best way to reduce bailouts overall," said James Gattuso, senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "But I think that it should be acknowledged that the bill does authorize such creditor bailouts, however justified or unlikely one believes them to be." It's worth pointing out that Brown is proposing an amendment that's intended to enhance the bill's ability to curb "too-big-to-fail" firms by limiting the amount of debt they can carry. "Reining in Wall Street's cycle of excessive debt will ensure that no Wall Street bank ever becomes too big or too indebted to fail in a way that wrecks the entire U.S. economy," Brown's office wrote in a news release about his amendments to the bill. He also touted it during the interview with Tapper. But it seems clear to us that Brown's "Yes, it does" comment was not referring to his amendment, but rather to the bill as it is currently written. So we will not factor Brown's proposed amendment into our analysis of his comment. The argument that the bill as currently written will end bailouts and "too big to fail" is certainly one that holds political value for Democrats, and it's fair to say that that's the intention of the legislation. Presumably, that's why Brown, Goolsbee, Reid and other Democrats have continued to make that argument. However, it's an exaggeration to say that the bill would put an "end" to future bailouts. Short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded, even after passage of this bill. So we rate Brown's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

The man jogged to McDonald’s for a Big Mac. His ability to pile a plate high with crispy pieces of fried chicken, mounds of barbecued pork and slabs of smoky ribs was legendary. But last year the former chief executive shocked America with a real dietary stunner. Clinton announced he was giving up meat and dairy and undertaking a vegan diet. Following a vegan diet means Clinton will not eat any product that comes from animals. He told reporters that he made the decision after suffering through two major heart procedures.Clinton has undergone bypass surgery and has had stents put in some of his arteries to keep them open. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals responded by naming Clinton its "Man of the Year." It said: "By choosing a plant-based diet, President Clinton has spared the lives of nearly 200 animals a year..." Did they say 200? We understand that beef is what’s for dinner, but 200 sounds like Bill was ravaging pastures of cows, not to mention barnyards of chickens and pigs -- the other white meat. PETA’s estimate is still being disseminated widely -- it appeared just last week in a Los Angeles Times article. A PETA spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia the group actually has no way of knowing precisely how much meat Clinton ate or how many animals were slaughtered to satiate his carnivorous cravings. But the organization conducted a study that determined the average meat-eating American is responsible for the deaths of 198 animals annually. It used statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources to calculate the total number of animals raised in the United States and imported for American consumption. PETA then divided the total number of butchered animals by the U.S. population, minus the estimated number of vegetarians and vegans of course. It didn’t count eggs. But it did count every chicken, cow, pig, fish and duck. But -- and this is where it gets a bit murky -- PETA also counted shrimp, clams, lobsters, oysters, scallops and any other animals that died as part of dairy and meat production. Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, said this sounds like a reasonable approach and could provide an accurate average. But he still thinks the number is misleading the way PETA used it. The USDA estimates the average American eats about 85 pounds of chicken, 58 pounds of beef, 46 pounds of pork, 16 pounds of turkey, 1 1/2 pounds of veal and 1 pound of lamb each year. Hurt estimated -- and he stressed estimated -- this would equal about 28 chickens, one turkey, and a fraction of a cow, pig, and lamb per person annually. This comes to about 30 animals per year, well short of PETA’s 200 number. Hurt, however, did not include sea creatures in his estimate. The majority of the animals killed would have to be small sea creatures for PETA’s estimate to stand, Hurt said. "Perhaps the misinterpretation is that these are farm animals we’re talking about," he said. "That’s a little misleading." The average American eats 15.8 pounds of fish and shellfish a year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That includes an average of 4.1 pounds of shrimp per person, 4.6 pounds of fish filets and steaks, and 2.5 pounds of canned tuna. James Dunn, a professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University, said even counting the small creatures he thinks the PETA number still sounds "way too high." The National Meat Association said the number doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. "They’re only saying that because it sounds good and people can wrap their minds around," said Jeremy Russell, director of communications and government relations for the association. While PETA’s spokeswoman acknowledges its number includes bivalves and other creatures, its number seems to imply a vegan is saving the lives of cute cows, adorable baby chickens and Wilbur-like pigs. Those are, after all, the animals PETA chooses to showcase on its website. PETA’s statement is technically accurate. But it leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.

Some critics seem to be especially unhappy after receiving an informational email from Friends of Greenlight, a pro-transit political action committee. The email says the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority would implement bus rapid transit countywide without altering the current traffic flow. "Bus Rapid Transit will help the Pinellas bus system move faster, but it won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles," the email reads. The email is paired with an artist’s rendering of the 1100 block of 4th Street N in St. Petersburg. The street has been altered to include a bus stop and a new bus lane in front of the block’s businesses. The image, however, shows one other thing -- that the center turn lane 4th Street N has been removed. So how is it that supporters promise the transit overhaul will not result in fewer traffic lanes, while an image shows the opposite? And, more broadly, will Greenlight Pinellas "take existing lanes from other vehicles?" PolitiFact Florida wanted to learn more. What is bus rapid transit? Understanding the concept of bus rapid transit is key to predicting whether Greenlight Pinellas radically alters existing traffic capacity. That’s not as easy as it sounds, because the term bus rapid transit (known as BRT) is a catch-all term that can mean many different things. Annie Weinstock, a director at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, helped us with nailing down the details. She said the Institute generally considers the criteria of a BRT system as having: Dedicated bus lanes (ideally in street medians); Intersections that prevent turns across bus lanes; Transit signal priority that detects the presence of buses and changes lights accordingly; Offboard fare collection to reduce wait times as passengers pay at the fare box, the single biggest bottleneck in bus service; Platform-level boarding to help move passengers -- especially handicapped and elderly passengers -- onto the bus as quickly as possible. BRT can have any of these elements in any proportion, as long as the focus is on moving the buses as quickly and as directly as possible. Greenlight Pinellas incorporates many of these changes, but it’s difficult to say which ones, or where they’re going to be. Why? Because of a Catch-22 in the plan. An outline, not a blueprint The current plan is a broad overview of the potential transit expansion, proposing a 1-cent sales tax increase countywide to pay for the light rail line between St. Pete and Clearwater, increasing bus hours, adding routes and building in improvements to allow for BRT. Voters must approve the initiative on Nov. 4. (We checked a previous claim about the sales tax, which you can read here.) Greenlight Pinellas does call for improvements at intersections and bus stops that will allow bus travel to be faster. Some of those changes may include dedicated bus lanes at intersections or bus stops that allow the buses to get ahead or stay out of the traffic. Some routes may simply run at more frequent intervals. PSTA external affairs officer Bob Lasher said the project may also use a method known as "queue jumping," in which buses use separate lights to start travel before regular traffic does. Bus lanes would be built from existing medians and shoulders on most major roads except St. Petersburg’s 1st Avenue N and 1st Avenue S. Those one-way streets, running in opposite directions, are lightly traveled enough to give up an entire lane for bus service without causing traffic problems, PSTA says. Using those two lanes is enough to foster arguments over whether Friends of Greenlight can make such an absolute statement about the plan. What makes it tougher is that so many cooks will be in the kitchen if the proposal is approved. Lasher said PSTA would work with the Florida Department of Transportation, the county and local municipalities to see if other lanes or rights of way could be used for buses. But the details of what those changes would look like isn’t done yet, because the initiative hasn’t been approved by voters. "The actual stop-by-stop, turn-by-turn details won’t be known until after the engineering and environmental studies are done, which would be only if the measure passes due to expense," Lasher said. "If we were to put out that kind of money before hand, and it failed, that would be a big loss and irresponsible of us." Ironically, without those details, opponents continue to pick apart the plan, saying Greenlight Pinellas won’t work because there’s no way to tell how it will be organized. If it’s altering 4th Street in such a misguided way, what else will it do? The problem is, Greenlight Pinellas doesn’t aim to remove the turn lane from 4th Street N. "That photo – which is a mock up – was to demonstrate what a BRT station would look like," Lasher said, pointing out the payment kiosk on the sidewalk at the bus stop. "I use it for that and when I explain off-board fare payment. It was never meant to imply that we would be taking a lane along 4th Street. Our graphics artists used the backdrop, because they liked the background." Friends of Greenlight spokesman Kyle Parks said they would strive to make sure people understood the image was a rendering designed to show what a bus stop would look like and nothing more. So is it possible traffic lanes may be sacrificed, even the turn lane along Fourth Street? Could capital improvements to major roadways really be made without affecting other drivers? Can Greenlight Pinellas really do what it claims it’s going to do? The answer is, sadly, that we can’t say definitively until after the engineers get down to the nitty-gritty details. And that can only happen if the 1-cent tax passes Nov. 4. Our ruling Friends of Greenlight says in its promotional email that implementing bus rapid transit "won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles." Already the statement needs to be qualified, because two thoroughfares in St. Petersburg will be losing lanes if a 1-cent tax increase passes. And while PSTA and Greenlight advocates say bus lanes would be taken from shoulders and medians, there’s really no way to know how roads will be altered. Pinellas residents will have to vote for the proposal in November before a study can be done to work out those details. We can say that there are no plans currently to remove the center turning lane from 4th Street North, and an artist's rendering showing that outcome was actually intended to show what a new bus stop might look like. So there’s no intention to take away traffic lanes beyond the two Greenlight Pinellas mentions, but there’s also no possible way to guarantee it won’t happen. The plan will be implemented with the input of many local municipalities and the state, which means any number of outcomes are possible. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-09923	The war spending bill "actually spends more money on the International Monetary Fund than on the war."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/23/lynn-westmoreland/claims-war-spending-bill-does-more-imf-wars/	In an unusual role reversal, most Congressional Republicans recently voted against a war funding bill. Some said they opposed the bill because it had so much money for the International Monetary Fund, a coalition of 185 countries that tries to foster global economic growth. Among the Republicans sounding off was Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, who wrote this on his party's blog: "We’re getting an alleged war spending bill that actually spends more money on the International Monetary Fund than on the war," he wrote. "We have the ability to bounce back out of this recession, but we can’t afford to pay for a global bailout – we have more than enough bailouts going on in our own country, thank you very much." All but five of the 178 Republicans in the House voted against the measure on June 16, 2009. The bill is at the White House awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The IMF's profile has risen in recent months in the wake of the economic crisis, and some financial leaders want the agency to loan more money to jump-start the global economy. We wondered if it was possible that a war funding bill would have more money for the IMF than the wars. Overall, the bill costs about $106 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee. Approximately $82 billion — or about 77 percent — is for war-related items, everything from new machinery to hospitals. And for the IMF? Zero dollars, according to the Appropriations Committee. So does that mean Westmoreland's claim is false? Not so fast. The bill does establish a $100 billion line of credit for the IMF that the agency could use to make loans to other countries. But the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the actual cost to the Treasury at approximately $5 billion. That sum is largely the product of some confusing budgetary gymnastics based on estimates of how dramatically the IMF would have to use the line of credit and how quickly loans would be repaid, the CBO explained on its Web site. "In forming this estimate, CBO envisioned various potential state of the world economy," wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf on May 19, 2009. "In the most likely situations, the IMF would draw against only a small portion of the U.S. commitment and, CBO assumes, the likelihood of those funds being promptly repaid would be high. Thus, the cost of the U.S. commitment would be close to zero in those cases." The CBO said there's a slight chance the IMF would need to loan most or all of the line of credit. In that case, the IMF might not recoup all of the money and the cost to the U.S. Treasury would therefore be higher. CBO noted that no IMF borrower has defaulted on its obligations, but many have had their loans extended or been late on their payments. We spoke with budget experts who said the CBO's estimate is reasonable because it reflects the likely risk to the taxpayers. Loans are a routine part of the annual appropriations process, and they are typically assigned some cost based on risk, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the Heritage Foundation. If no money is paid back, "that does potentially make it the most expensive part of the bill. But the odds of it becoming the most expensive part of the bill are slim." The real cost to the Treasury Department all comes down to whether other countries pay back those loans, said Edwin Truman, who is an IMF expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economic think tank. "Since no country has ever lost money in [IMF's] history, the notion that we will lose $5 billion is a stretch," he said. So as for Westmoreland's claim, he's wrong that the appropriations bill spends more money on the IMF than for the war. Lawmakers aren't literally giving the organization a bundle of cash. But he's right that there's a potential for the U.S. Treasury, over time, to give the IMF quite a chunk of change as a result of the line of credit. However, Westmoreland's claim is based on the premise that countries borrowing from the IMF will never pay those loans back, which is a worst-case scenario that experts say is unlikely to occur. So we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03412	Says student loan interest rates will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/28/gene-green/gene-green-says-student-loan-interest-rates-will-d/	U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, recently urged colleagues to move quickly because Congress had "only three days left until student loan interest rates double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st." That statement, from a June 28, 2013, press release, matches recent declarations from other politicians; in fact, we had already started checking a version from President Barack Obama when we received Green’s release by email. Green’s statement further describes the loans as Stafford loans. A spokeswoman for Green, Veronica Custer, emailed us details including a June 18, 2013, report from the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee (Congress’ economic advisory committee) that said, "Unless Congress acts, the interest rate on subsidized federal Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st." Half of the nation’s roughly 21 million college students get some form of federal aid, according to the government’s National Center for Education Statistics. Much of that comes in the form of federal student loans, guaranteed by the government and with low interest rates set by Congress. And about 80 percent of federal student loans are Stafford loans, according to a June 13, 2013, Washington Post news story. Named in memory of a U.S. senator from Vermont who championed education measures, Staffords are either subsidized, meaning the government pays part of the interest, or unsubsidized, meaning the student pays all the interest. Subsidized Stafford loans are available to undergraduates who show financial need; according to the Post story, they make up about a quarter of federal student loans. The unsubsidized variety doesn’t require proof of financial need and is open to graduate students as well as undergrads; about half of all federal student loans are of this type, the Post said. About 7 million students are expected to take out subsidized Stafford loans after June 2013 -- and they’ll get the 6.8 percent rate unless Congress acts as it did at a similar juncture in 2012. Tom Melecki, director of the Office of Financial Services at the University of Texas, described via email the effect of such a rate on a subsidized Stafford loan: "If an undergraduate were to borrow the $23,000 maximum – something which is increasingly common -- he or she would repay $31,761.60 over 10 years at a 6.8 percent interest rate, but $27,163.20 at a 3.4 percent interest rate. So this student would save $4,598.40 in interest payments at the lower rate." The government pays billions to keep its interest rates on federal loans low. According to the Department of Education’s student aid website, rates range from 5 percent to 7.8 percent on non-Stafford types of federal loans taken out from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. Unsubsidized Stafford loans in the same timeframe have an interest rate of 6.8 percent and aren’t scheduled to change, so subsidized Staffords will match the unsubsidized kind if their rate reverts July 1, 2013. In a 2007 overhaul of the federal student loan system, Congress passed a temporary act reducing the rate on new subsidized Stafford loans gradually from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, set to expire July 1, 2012, according to a Sept. 8, 2007, Los Angeles Times news story and a Sept. 28, 2007, Washington Post news story. But lawmakers swooped in June 29, 2012, to postpone the rate hike until July 1, 2013, at an estimated cost of $6 billion. The revised deadline looms amid competing claims about how the issue might be resolved. A June 26, 2013, New York Times news story said plans had been offered by President Barack Obama as well as Republican, Democratic and bipartisan combinations of Congress members. Green’s press release said he supported a measure that would freeze the 3.4 percent interest rate for two years. But with time running out and no agreement on the horizon, the Times said, it appeared likely that a measure addressing the rate would have to be applied retroactively to loans taken out after July 1. Our ruling Green said "student loan interest rates" would double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1. That accurately describes one specific rate change. However, the majority of new federal student loans won’t be affected. We rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Gene Green	None	None	None	2013-06-28T18:53:29	2013-06-28	['None']

pomt-11043	Say "Dunkin' Donuts is providing a free Ḍozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/29/blog-posting/free-dunkin-donuts-online-offer-scam/	A link circulating on Facebook that offers its visitors a free dozen donuts from Dunkin’ Donuts is a scam. (Sorry if you were hoping for a free sugar rush.) "Dunkin' Donuts is providing a free Ḍozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!" a website Dunkin USA announces, encouraging its readers to partake in a short survey in exchange for the donuts. We were curious about whether we could truly take this opportunity to get some free donuts from Dunkin’, so we took the survey to see what would happen. The survey asks its participants three questions. The first is whether the participant has ever visited Dunkin’, the second about why the participant prefers Dunkin’, and the third and final question asks whether the survey-taker is satisfied by Dunkin’s services. After we completed the survey, the website asked us to share the page on Facebook, comment "Thanks for my coupon," and click "Like." We followed all these instructions, but were not presented with a coupon for the donuts. The link resembles past offers that have also turned out to be scams. "We only have 332 Boxes remaining so hurry up!" the Dunkin’ offer claims. A previous scam targeting Delta also featured similar language as well as the number 332: "Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!" the website Delta-Flying.info stated. In addition, links supposedly offering their visitors coupons for free Dunkin’ Donuts in celebration of the company’s 67th anniversary have surfaced in the past. Snopes debunked a previous version of the scam that was widely circulated in December 2017. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., told the website Retailmenot.com that the offer is not affiliated with Dunkin’ Donuts. If that isn’t enough, the survey is rife with grammatical and spelling errors. The survey asks, "Have you ever visited at Dunkin’ Donuts?" when it would be grammatically correct to ask "Have you ever visited Dunkin’ Donuts?" In addition, the answer selections available for the survey’s question "You prefer Dunkin’ Donuts because of?" are "It’s Cheapness," "It’s Environment," and "Don’t Know," even though it would be correct to use "Its" rather than "It’s." What’s more, while the survey touts a "free Dozen Doughnut Box," Dunkin’ Donuts doesn’t use that spelling of the sweet treat. It’s unlikely that an official Dunkin’ Donuts offer would contain so many errors. We reached out to Dunkin’ Donuts but did not hear back. A website’s claim that visitors will receive a coupon for a free dozen of donuts in exchange for completing a survey is too good to be true. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05808	"I have a very conservative voting record."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/22/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-very-conservative-voting-record/	When U.S. Rep. Connie Mack entered the U.S. Senate race in Florida, he immediately became a frontrunner. But he still has to win the Republican primary, and some conservatives have criticized Mack for not being conservative enough. When asked about that, Mack responded, "I am one of the most conservative members of Congress, and I have a very conservative voting record," according to the Republican blog the Shark Tank on Feb. 4, 2012. In the primary, Mack will face George LeMieux, whom then-Gov. Charlie Crist appointed to serve a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009, and businessman Mike McCalister. The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Evaluating whether someone is the "most’’ of anything can be tricky. We wanted to see what led Mack to make that declaration and how he fared in various rankings of the 435 members of Congress. Mack campaign spokesman David James sent a list of organizations that had given Mack conservative ratings in recent years. We will summarize many of the ratings that Mack’s campaign sent us, as well as some we found on our own. Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004, so we could have examined his scorecards for multiple years, but we think that looking at his grades for more recent years from multiple groups provides a good snapshot, since he didn’t specify any time frame in his claim. We’ll also look particularly at some of the votes Mack has made that depart from conservative benchmarks. Groups that gave Mack a 100 percent rating Mack received his most conservative ratings from the Christian Coalition of America, Family Research Council and National Right to Life Committee. These ratings were based on 10 or fewer votes, many about abortion and other social issues. Groups the gave Mack less than 100 percent but in the 90 percent range • American Conservative Union (ACU): Mack got a 96 percent from the group that looks at a variety of issues -- in 2010 that included abortion, health care, earmarks and the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill. He disagreed with the ACU on one of two dozen votes: he voted against lifting a moratorium on offshore drilling a few months after the BP spill. • Club for Growth: The club ranked Mack 52nd out of 435 with a score of 95 percent. This includes 19 House roll call votes on taxes, regulations and other issues, as well as other actions such as signing the club’s pledge to repeal the federal health care law. Mack lost points for his 2010 votes on oil drilling and supporting the national program for flood insurance. • Americans for Prosperity: The group examines votes based on economic issues. Mack received 94 percent. Rep. Mack voted with AFP’s position on all votes in the first session of the 112th Congress, except for the Cut, Cap and Balance package that AFP supported during the debt ceiling debate last summer. Mack said Cut, Cap and Balance still allowed for an increase in the debt ceiling, which he opposed. Mack also signed AFP’s No Climate Tax pledge. One group gave Mack an A with no numerical rating: National Rifle Association gave Mack an A in 2010 -- a spokeswoman told us the group didn’t give a numerical grade. Analyses from news organizations • The Washington Post did an analysis of members of Congress in 2011 that it dubbed "the apocalypse caucus." The Post noted that this group included lawmakers from both parties "who calculate that the best way to fix government is to act as if you wouldn’t mind if it burned down." The Post pointed to six budget votes between April and October 2011, and Mack was part of the small group that voted "no" every time. • The National Journal ranks members of Congress based on key votes about economic, social and foreign policy issues and then gives them a composite score and ranking. For 2010, Mack did not make the Journal’s Top 10 most conservative. Mack was ranked the 67th most conservative and received a conservative composite score of 82.7 percent. The Journal noted that in 2010, economic issues dominated, and there were few votes on social issues or foreign issues. Votes taken that have angered some conservatives Mack has taken heat from some conservatives for certain votes he took since he was first elected to Congress in 2004. The Shark Tank blog wrote in a Feb. 8 post that he drew backlash from pro-lifers after voting in favor of four embryonic stem cell bills between 2005 and 2007 -- including one to over-ride President George W. Bush’s initial veto. "What can be more pro-life than to help people like my grandfather who suffered from illnesses that stem cell research could help," Mack told the Shark Tank. Conservatives have also taken note of Mack's comments comparing Arizona’s immigration law to Nazi Germany in 2010. Mack was a vocal critic of the Arizona law but now tries to emphasize his opposition to amnesty and calls for tough border control. In late 2011, as he launched his candidacy, he said, "I thought the Arizona law went too far. And in fact the legislature in Arizona agreed and made changes. Now they didn't go far enough for me, but they recognized they were on shaky ground. I think what we need to do is be tough on border security, that we need to have the E-Verify as a national system, that we need to be tough on illegal immigrants but at the same time not destroy the freedoms of some Americans that may look different than you and me." Mack’s Republican opponents have also attacked him for voting for billions of dollars in earmarks -- though members of both parties have pursued earmarks. The Miami Herald reported that many of those earmarks were for defense or popular with constituents such as a local university. But he also voted for projects outside of Florida including an aquarium in Connecticut and a city pool near the California district of his wife, Republican U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. Our ruling Mack said "I have a very conservative voting record." The general way Mack worded his claim makes it easy for him: There are times when he didn’t take a hard-line conservative position, such as his stances on stem cell research and the Arizona immigration law. But Mack’s claim here was about his overall record and how he compared to the rest of Congress, and for that he has gotten high marks from several conservative organizations. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Connie Mack	None	None	None	2012-02-22T09:00:00	2012-02-04	['None']
pomt-03112	In Florida "we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists" for community care for the elderly.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/20/nan-rich/nan-rich-florida-waiting-lists-child-care-elderly/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott wants voters to give him ideas about what sort of taxes and fees to cut to save $500 million. Democratic challenger and former state Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, says Florida needs to talk about services to fund. "We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state," she said in a Sept. 11 blog in the Tampa Tribune. "We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education, we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists for CCE (in-home living assistance for the elderly). These are the middle class people we’re talking about." In a related fact-check, we explored how Florida ranks in education funding. Here, we will examine the state’s waiting list for child care and Community Care for the Elderly. Child care waiting list Rich was referring to Florida’s School Readiness Program, which provides subsidized day care for low-income parents so they can work. The program is funded with state and federal money, and families must pay a portion based on their income. To qualify, families must have a gross income no higher than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The programs are administered by early learning coalitions throughout the state. As of July 2013, the program served 222,817 children. "This is about getting people from welfare to work and educating children and getting them ready for school," said Evelio Torres, president and CEO of the Early Learning Coalition of Miami-Dade/Monroe. In 2011-12, the statewide waiting list hit a monthly average of 74,691 -- just a few spots shy of the number cited by Rich. But it has since declined. In July 2013, there were 60,659 children on the waiting list. A chart of the waiting list over the past decade showed that it had a massive increase in 2008-09, reaching about 58,000. That grew to a peak of about 80,000 in 2009-10. Since then, it has been dropping. We talked to directors of organizations that oversee the child care programs in Broward and Miami-Dade, as well as the director of the state Office of Early Learning, to learn why the waiting list has fluctuated. They attributed it to ups and downs in the economy. All three officials warned there are several caveats about the waiting list. Sometimes a child care provider will send a blast email encouraging parents to sign up, and that can create a spike. Other times, an organization cleans up its waiting list, and the number declines. The list in every community isn’t maintained exactly the same way. And the names on the waiting list aren’t all eligible. "It’s not until we screen and call families that we find out whether they are eligible," Torres said. "A lot of times they are a dollar over income, and they can’t qualify, or not employed by the time you call them, and they don’t qualify. ... Unless you pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the system in Florida, you’re not going to eliminate the waiting list." Barbara Weinstein, president of Family Central in Broward, suspects the need is greater than the waiting list, because some families get scared off by the high numbers on the list and don’t even bother to apply. The state received federal stimulus dollars to help supplement the program during the recession, but that has ended. This year the budget is $567 million, compared to $626 million a decade ago. Community Care for the Elderly Next, we’ll look at whether there are 23,000 on the waiting list for the Community Care for the Elderly program. The state-funded program provides in-home services for frail elders that can include meals, assistance with bathing, light housekeeping and transportation to the doctor. The purpose of the program is to avoid more costly nursing home care. The state’s Department of Elder Affairs sent us a chart showing that Florida’s waiting list hit about 23,000 in June 2011. But it has grown since then, and as of August 2013, the waiting list hit 28,604. The program served 13,790 seniors in 2012-13. Under Scott, funding increased by $1 million in 2012-13 and $3.75 million in 2013-14, said Office of Elder Affairs spokeswoman Ashley Marshall. Rich directed us to the Florida Council on Aging, which supplied us with data from the state showing that some clients enter the system through CCE but are later determined to be eligible for Medicaid or other programs. The Community Care for the Elderly is just one of many programs for seniors that have waiting lists. Our ruling Rich said in Florida "we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists" for Community Care for the Elderly. Rich’s numbers on the waiting lists for child care and Community Care for the Elderly were about a year outdated. Her number overstated the child care waiting list by about 14,000 and understated the community care for the elderly waiting list by about 6,000, based on numbers from this summer. Still, her numbers track with recent averages. Both waiting lists require some further explanation: Everyone on the list may not be eligible for that particular program or could be moved into another program. We rate this claim Mostly True.

The meme features a photograph of President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose "war on poverty" agenda in the mid 1960s was known as the Great Society. Superimposed on Johnson’s image is the following text: "Black children born without a father in the home rate pre-LBJ's 'Great Society' welfare system in 1964: 7 percent. Black children born without a father in the home rate post-LBJ's 'Great Society' 2014 = 73 percent. Hey, liberals, how's your 'Great Society' working out for the black family?" We wanted to know if the meme’s numbers were right: Did the percentage of black children born without a father in the home rise from 7 percent before the Great Society to 73 percent today, and was it due to Johnson and the Great Society? As we researched this claim, we noticed a problem: There is no federal data on "black children born without a father in the home." Instead, we found two types of data that are similar -- but not a perfect fit. One is unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births. The other is the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. The first option addresses births, a key focus of the Facebook claim. But this figure ignores cases in which a couple isn’t married, but where the father is living in the home. The second option, by contrast, does address living arrangements, but it includes all children up to age 18, not those who were "born" that year. So to be as complete as possible, we’ll analyze both statistics here. Unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births In 1964, according to federal health statistics, 24.6 percent of births to non-whites were considered "illegitimate," the term used for out-of-wedlock births at the time. In 2012, the percentage of black births that were made to unmarried black mothers was 72 percent. This is a large increase, and the more recent figure is more or less on target. However, the starting point in 1964 is higher than the Facebook post suggests. So the overall increase is more limited than the meme says. (Note: The 1964 figure was based on the "non-white" population, a category that includes Hispanics and Asian-Americans, while the 2012 figure was for African Americans only.) So if you use this measurement, the meme’s numbers are off. The percentage of black children living without a father in the home These figures offer even less support for the Facebook claim. According to Census Bureau data, about 20 percent of black children in 1960 were living with just a mother. The comparable figure for 2013 is 50 percent of black children living with a mother only. (The only pre-Great Society year for which data is available is 1960.) So this measurement, too, shows an increase. But the increase is two-and-a-half times bigger, not 10 times bigger, as the meme says, and it’s up by 25 to 30 percentage points, rather than the 66 points cited in the meme. When we checked with experts, we found additional problems of context and logic with the claim. Here are a few of them: Black families weren’t the only group to see an increase in single motherhood over the same time period Rates of fatherlessness for whites have always been lower than for blacks, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. Six percent of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18 percent in 2013. That’s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children. We don’t really know how common black single parenthood was prior to the Great Society Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable. It was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a "shotgun wedding" pattern that doesn’t suggest long-term stability for children. This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African-Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low. "Welfare" -- the implicit target of the meme -- existed well before the Great Society The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a "marriage penalty" on recipients -- benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. But such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society. " ‘Welfare’ was part of the New Deal in the 1930s," said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. "It was designed for widows with kids who didn’t qualify for Social Security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers." Correlation does not equal causation Just because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the Great Society doesn’t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play. Besharov said the focus on Johnson is off-base. He said that the broader social currents of 1960s "liberalization" -- more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance -- did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but "if you define ‘the Great Society’ as the things Johnson did, then there was very little impact" on single motherhood rates. Our ruling A meme circulating on social media said the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7 percent in 1964 to 73 percent today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. There’s no federal data to back up the meme’s specific claim, but the most applicable statistics show an increase in black fatherlessness that is more limited, and the rise might have been even more modest still if the early-1960s data had been more reliable. In addition, the focus on Johnson and the Great Society is likely a red herring, since broader, societal factors are believed to have played a major role in rising rates of single-parenthood -- not just among blacks, but also among whites. The exaggerated statistics, combined with an ignorance of important context, leads us to rate the claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-03-25T11:49:57	2014-03-25	['Lyndon_B._Johnson']

pomt-00470	Says Leah Vukmir "claimed the open records law didn't apply to her, got sued, lost and cost taxpayers $15,000 in legal fees."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/14/club-growth/did-leah-vukmir-cost-taxpayers-15000-legal-fees-af/	The Club for Growth, a national conservative anti-tax group, released an attack ad against Republican U.S. Senate hopeful state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The video states that Vukmir: "Claimed the open records law didn't apply to her, got sued, lost and cost taxpayers $15,000 in legal fees." Vukmir on Aug. 14, 2018, emerged as the winner in the Republican U.S. Senate primary against Kevin Nicholson and will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin in the November election. There’s no doubt that Vukmir was sued in 2013. But does the ad really capture the whole story? Turns out, much of what the CFG claims in the ad launched in July is easily backed up by evidence in the 2013 case. Vukmir’s 2013 lawsuit The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) sued Vukmir in 2013 for violating an open records request. At the time, Vukmir was second vice-chairwoman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The conservative nonprofit is comprised of state legislators and members of the private sector. The CMD filed a request for records after an ALEC conference in Oklahoma City in May 2013. It resulted in the release of nine documents, but the CMD suspected there were more. The CMD, a progressive watchdog organization based in Madison, was no stranger to requesting records from ALEC. They run a website called ALEC Exposed that targets the organization and its pro-corporation values. And Brendan Fischer, former lawyer for the CMD, said ALEC had been difficult with releasing records in the past. But one of the main reasons the CMD filed the lawsuit was due to a disclaimer that ALEC put at the bottom of their documents. The disclaimer stated: "Because this is an internal ALEC document, ALEC believes that it is not subject to disclosure under any state Freedom of Information or Public Records Act." Fischer said this made it difficult to believe they only had nine documents from the meeting. The assumption proved correct during the settlement when both parties agreed to have Vukmir’s emails searched by an independent party in the presence of a staffer from the center. The independent party found a "significant number" of documents in Vukmir’s email. Later, Vukmir’s team released a statement, blaming the record mishap on technical difficulties. But did she resist by saying that the open records laws did not apply to her? Vukmir filed a motion in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 11, 2013, claiming she was immune from lawsuit while she held office. What Vukmir got wrong was that state law only specifies an exemption during the legislative session. She then tried to claim that the session included the entire term of a sitting legislator. The lawsuit, if Vukmir won, would have allowed all lawmakers to ignore the open records law, according to a report published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But in the end, the case was settled before trial. Vukmir handed over the missing documents. Her legal team racked up $15,000 in fees, which was paid for by the state. Jess Ward, Vukmir’s campaign manager, did not address the case directly but said it is "nothing more than an attempt by Leah’s opponents to attack her stellar record of saving taxpayers billions." The campaign ad The claim about Vukmir’s lawsuit is the second made in the CFG Action video, after the statement that Vukmir sought leniency for a fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault. We rated that claim Mostly True. The group is backing conservatives in seven states during upcoming primaries but have spoken against Vukmir’s campaign. They openly endorsed Nicholson, Vukmir’s challenger in the U.S. senate race against incumbent Baldwin. Our rating The cost of the case may not be the most out-of-the-ordinary part. It is standard practice for a politician to have their legal fees paid for by the state. But in Vukmir’s case, challenging open records laws could have changed the way all legislators respond to records requests. If she had won, legislators would be able to ignore open records law. So, Vukmir did claim the open records laws did not apply to her. She was sued. And she did rack up $15,000 in legal fees. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-11838	"The Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/09/michael-madigan/madigans-ethics-panel-malfunction/	An open letter alleging years of flagrant sexual harassment by members of the Illinois General Assembly toward female lobbyists and others sent lawmakers scrambling to ensure such behavior would not be tolerated going forward. House Speaker Michael Madigan appeared at a House committee hearing to introduce new legislation that adds specific language on sexual harassment to state employee and lobbyist ethics laws. It also sets up required training and reporting procedures on sexual harassment for state elected officials, lobbyists and employees. But another speaker at the same hearing said this action, though laudable, was arriving far too late. In emotional testimony, crime victim advocate Denise Rotheimer delivered detailed allegations of improper behavior toward her by Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, as she worked with him to get a bill passed in the legislature. Rotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein’s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014. It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done. Madigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm. "It’s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it’s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function," Madigan said. He said the ethics commission’s executive director, Randy Erford, "has provided for the commission to continue to function" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so. This made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission "continue to function" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn’t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer’s case languish until she went public with her allegations? Quick response We should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30. So Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter’s appointment. A day after Rotheimer’s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein’s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him. But none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Standard procedure As described on the Legislative Ethics Commission’s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings "only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative… Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General." Madigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general. Other duties listed on the commission’s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or "as often as necessary." Those would not be impeded by lack of an inspector general. Long-term vacancy The office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by "joint resolution of the Senate and the House," lawmakers never filled the vacancy. Republicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint: On his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled. "My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic," Hays said. "No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd." Madigan spokesman Steve Brown called allegations that Madigan impeded a permanent replacement "baseless." Senate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year: "It’s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it," Cullerton said. "These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long." Our ruling Madigan said the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission continued to function for nearly three years while the Office of Legislative Inspector General was vacant. To the extent that the eight-member commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and saw to internal matters, it did "continue to function." This included its executive director receiving numerous reports of alleged ethics violations. But without an inspector general, it could not function in its capacity to take substantive action on alleged ethics violations. This is why Denise Rotheimer’s complaint saw no action until she went public with her allegations in a House committee hearing. There’s an element of truth in Madigan’s statement but there’s a lot more that’s missing. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06384	"I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign. ... We've got about 60 percent done in three years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-60-percent-his-promises-are-done/	During a fundraising event at a home in Los Angeles on Oct. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama took credit for enacting a majority of his agenda during his nearly three years in office. "We’ve seen change," he told donors. "We know what it looks like. We know what it takes. But we’ve got so much more work to do. And I keep a checklist in my desk, and I kind of see, all right, I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign -- (laughter) -- and let me see, yes, I got that done -- (laughter) -- and that one, yes. No, that one’s not done yet. (Laughter.) So we’ve got about 60 percent done in three years but -- (applause) -- so I’m pretty confident we can get the other 40 percent done in the next five years. (Applause.) But to do that, I’m going to need your help." A few readers wondered what we thought about this figure, since we’ve been using our Obameter to check how well Obama has been keeping 500-plus campaign promises since his inauguration. It is the most comprehensive look at what Obama promised during the campaign. When we asked, the White House confirmed that it has indeed been using our Obameter as its yardstick. "By PolitiFact’s own independent assessment, the president has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda," Kate Bedingfield, a White House spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. However, Bedingfield’s standard -- "achieved or made progress" -- is different from what Obama said at the fundraiser, that he’d gotten "about 60 percent done." And that becomes a crucial difference as we rate Obama’s original comment. To explain, let’s first provide some background on our promise meter, the Obameter. The promises we’re tracking were all made during the campaign; they do not include promises made since Obama took office. We rate them as Promise Kept, Compromise, In the Works, Stalled or Promise Broken. One caveat: we're constantly in the process of updating our list of promises, so the numbers change frequently. Given the sheer number of promises Obama made, we haven’t managed to update some in a year or more. The bottom line is that any estimates from our work as it stands today should be made with a grain of salt. That said, here’s the current breakdown of promises on the Obameter: Promise Kept 151, or 30 percent Compromise 46, or 9 percent In the Works 189, or 37 percent Stalled 68, or 13 percent Promise Broken 52, or 10 percent Not Yet Rated 2, or 0.3 percent We think it’s reasonable to give Obama credit for accomplishing the promises rated Promise Kept or Compromise. Together, those account for 39 percent of all promises. At the same time, we think it’s fair to say the president hasn’t accomplished those rated Stalled or Promise Broken. Together, those account for 23 percent of all promises. But to reach 60 percent, the White House needs to include a lot of promises rated In the Works in its count of what's been "done." And that’s a problem. We rate promises In the Works if the administration or its allies in Congress have taken steps to implement the promise but haven’t done enough to move it to either Promise Kept or Promise Broken. Generally speaking, we have had a low threshold for moving promises from Not Yet Rated to In the Works. For instance, if a House Member introduced a bill to enact the promise, we might move it to In the Works -- long before the bill was even considered by the House -- much less passed by Congress and signed by the president. Our threshold for moving a promise to Kept, Broken or Compromise is much more stringent. So Bedingfield is accurate to say that Obama "has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent" of his promises, but Obama himself was wrong to say in his original statement that his agenda is "60 percent done." In the Works, which in some cases may consist only of tiny steps toward accomplishment, is not "done." It’s still theoretically possible that Obama could get to 60 percent. To do so, he’d have to score 108 Promise Kept or Compromise ratings out of the 189 promises currently rated In the Works. That would be 57 percent, a steep but not impossible figure. That also assumes he keeps all of his current Promise Kept ratings -- something that could be at risk from, say, an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling on his health care law. Still, getting the required 57 percent is going to be a huge challenge when facing a Congress where Republicans steadfastly opposed to his agenda control the House of Representative and have displayed great unity in blocking the president. Our ruling Obama’s statement at the fundraiser was clearly in the past tense -- about having already "done" 60 percent of his promises in three years, and a White House spokeswoman made it clear he was relying on numbers from our Obameter. The White House’s subsequent description -- that Obama "has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda" -- is essentially accurate based on our data, but that’s not what Obama himself said. By our numbers, the best he can claim for now is 39 percent. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-11-01T16:26:55	2011-10-25	['None']
pomt-06605	"The federal government has not engaged in (border security) at all."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-federal-government-has-not-eng/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry has railed against the Obama administration for failing to adequately invest in border security in Texas. At the Fox News Google debate in Orlando Sept. 22, 2011, he took it a step further, saying "the federal government has not engaged in (border security) at all." We were under the impression (as is the state of Texas) that the U.S. government is responsible for protecting the nation's borders, so this caught us by surprise. Here's how the debate unfolded: Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum whether he thought Perry was soft on illegal immigration. SANTORUM: And so, yes, I would say that (Perry) is soft on illegal immigration. I think the fact that he doesn't want to build a fence -- he gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about, bi-national health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for bi-national health insurance. So I think he's very weak on this issue of American sovereignty and protecting our borders and not being a magnet for illegal immigration, yes. WALLACE: Governor Perry, 30 seconds to respond, sir. PERRY: I've got one question for him. Have you ever even been to the border with Mexico? SANTORUM: Yes. PERRY: I'm surprised if you have, but you weren't paying attention, because the idea that you -- SANTORUM: Well, the answer is, yes, I have. PERRY: -- are going to build a wall, a fence for 1,200 miles, and then go 800 miles more to Tijuana, does not make sense. You put the boots on the ground. We know how to make this work. You put the boots on the ground. You put the aviation assets -- SANTORUM: But it's not working, Governor. PERRY: -- in the ground. No, it's not working because the federal government has not -- SANTORUM: But you said we know how it works. Is it working in Texas? PERRY: The federal government has not engaged in this at all. When I'm the president of the United States, I'll promise you one thing -- SANTORUM: But you're saying you put the assets there. Has it worked in Texas? PERRY: -- we will put the assets on the ground -- SANTORUM: You said you have. PERRY: -- the boots on the ground -- BAIER: Senator Santorum, let him finish, please. PERRY: -- the aviation assets on the ground, and we will stop illegal immigration, we will stop the drug cartels, and we will make America secure. SANTORUM: Can you answer the question? Is it working? WALLACE: Well, you know, you asked your question, he gave his answer, sir. SANTORUM: OK. So, according to Perry, the goverment needs to get boots, among other assets, on the ground to stop illegal immigration, stop drug cartels and secure the country. And the reason "it's not working" now is because "the federal government has not engaged in this at all." Really? There aren't any federal boots on the Texas border? PolitiFact looked at related issues this summer, concluding that U.S. Border Patrol has "doubled the number of agents since 2004." Meanwhile, we found it Mostly True that the U.S. has more agents than ever patrolling its borders. Of those more than 20,000 agents in 2010, more than 17,000 worked along the Southwest border, much of which is Texas. No boots, huh? Perry's own office has a Homeland Security Strategic Plan that notes that local and state law enforcement officials "partner with federal agencies like the U.S. Border Patrol" and also notes that part of Texas' $200 million investment since 2005 to fill border security gaps came from federal grants. Meanwhile, at the end of fiscal year 2010, the federal Department of Homeland Security investments in border security had grown to $11.9 billion and included more than 40,000 personnel, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. We're not checking whether federal investment has been effective — merely, as Perry said, whether the federal government has been "engaged." With more U.S. agents than ever patrolling the U.S. border — most of them in the Southwest — we've got to say, Governor, your own boots might be at risk. Because we rate your statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12254	Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans "choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/11/newslocom/fake-news-story-twists-paul-ryans-words-poor-peopl/	A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, "Paul Ryan: ‘22 million Americans choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy’." Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senate’s health care bill. "What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it," Ryan said. "So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want." (We rated that Mostly False, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox’s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That’s where the story turned to fiction. "Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it," Ryan is quoted. "So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy." Ryan didn’t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan’s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isn’t always obvious that’s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senate’s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-08441	Says "Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/17/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-rebecca-kleefisch-says-democrat-tom-bar/	Even in the run-up to the Sept. 14, 2010 primary, most voters probably paid little attention to Republican Rebecca Kleefisch or any of the candidates for the get-no-respect position of Wisconsin lieutenant governor. Since her victory, Kleefisch has proven hard to ignore. First, Kleefisch garnered headlines when she revealed she had been diagnosed with colon cancer in the weeks before the primary, had surgery and was declared cancer free. Then, with that in the background, she took center stage in a campaign ad with running mate Scott Walker that assails Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tom Barrett. Little surprise the ad focuses on health care. In the ad, Kleefisch talks directly to the camera: "Thanks to the highest quality health care system in the world," she says, "I won my battle with cancer. I can watch my little girls grow up. Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care. A plan that would increase costs, lower quality and put government in charge of our health care choices. As a mother and a cancer survivor, that’s unacceptable." As Walker enters the shot and nods in agreement, Kleefisch concludes: "Scott and I and our families think you should be in charge of your health care decisions." Strong words. Powerful message. But is it true? The ad drew cheers on the right and howls from the left, in part because while Kleefisch attacks a "government takeover" of health care, her own coverage comes through a state-government plan that covers she and her husband, state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, and their family. We’ve been here before, when it comes to the charge that the health care reforms -- "ObamaCare" to critics -- amount to a government takeover. But this ad has a bit of a wrinkle, since it also points back to Barrett’s time in Congress and an earlier health-care reform effort. Let’s sort it all out. The Walker campaign starts by pointing to Barrett’s support for the Obama-led reforms. It cites a Aug. 31, 2010 story from the Capital Times that includes this line: "Unlike his opponents, Barrett touts his support of the federal health care reform bill. For those who call for its repeal, he says he has a few questions." The story then quotes Barrett: "Why do you want to take health insurance away from a sick 3-year-old who may now, for the first time, be able to have health insurance? Or why do you want to take health insurance away from a 23-year-old woman who has diabetes but wants to go to college?" The Walker campaign also points to the fact that, as a U.S. House member from Milwaukee in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor of Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated health-care proposal. Finally, to support the "government takeover" charge, Walker campaign spokesperson Jill Bader points to a chart from the conservative Heritage Foundation that predicted the percentage of national health care spending under government control would pass 50 percent by 2013. Let’s look at the evidence, piece by piece: The Obama reforms: Leaving aside, for the moment, whether Barrett supports all or some of those reforms, PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have ruled repeatedly on the government takeover charge and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies. To be sure, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new system. More people will be covered. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded. It is not, as the ad suggests, a single-payer system with government running the sole plan. Indeed, the lightning-rod "public option" -- which would have added a government-run plan to the mix -- was dropped from the bill before it passed. Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums. Universal coverage advocates such as Citizen Action of Wisconsin say the national changes mean nearly half a million Wisconsin residents will now have access to private health insurance as Kleefisch and her husband already do. As for the Heritage Foundation chart cited by the Walker campaign, the study notes its projection that government spending on health care will now exceed 50 percent of the market sometime in 2013 is part of a decades-long trend. Indeed, even without the Obama-backed reforms, the government was on track to pay more than half sometime in 2014. The Hillary Clinton plan: Before Obama’s plan, there was the 1993 plan that grew out of Clinton’s work on a health care task force as first lady. Critics shorthanded it "HillaryCare." Two national health care experts -- one deeply involved in work on Clinton’s health care proposal -- told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the Clinton approach was more aggressive and far-reaching than Obama’s plan. A third, Robert Moffit from the conservative Heritage Foundation, judges them equally far-reaching. Clinton’s plan had national spending limits and tried to build a new insurance market with an aggressive regulatory structure, said Judith Feder, a former high-ranking Clinton administration official who is now a professor in Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute. Both PolitiFact National and the New York Times have described Hillary Clinton’s plan, which was dead on arrival in Congress, as a "radical" proposal. But neither Feder nor Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor of health policy and political analysis, think "government takeover" fits the Clinton plan -- or the Obama one. Neither do we. Let’s return to the TV ad, which emphasizes Barrett supports such a plan: At a news conference after the ad debuted, Barrett said it is "not true at all" that he supports a government takeover of health care and said he had never supported a single-payer system. Coverage of Barrett’s 1992 congressional bid in the Milwaukee Journal shows that Barrett endorsed universal coverage -- that is, efforts to cover everyone -- but he rejected a government-run system. But to Kleefisch, Barrett’s view that he does not favor a takeover is undermined by his support for the Clinton plan and his views on the Obama-led reforms. In an Oct. 14, 2010 interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620), she put it this way: "He’s a liar." Barrett spokesperson Phil Walzak responded: "Every plan Tom has forwarded has private insurance as the centerpiece. They are trying to generate false fear on this issue." As for the Obama-led reforms now in place, Walker has argued they should be repealed and the state should join a lawsuit against them. Barrett has rejected the idea of joining the suit but has said Wisconsin's next governor needs to find ways to make sure the law is implemented fairly for the state. Where does that leave us? With the emotional emphasis provided by cancer survivor Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican ticket echoes the GOP attacks used against Democrats across the country and characterizes the Obama-led health care reforms as a "government takeover." But repeating a falsehood -- however often and however loudly -- does not make it true. The Obama reforms would expand the government’s role, but a key principle of the plan is to rely primarily on private health insurance to provide coverage. The government "exchanges" would encourage private insurers to compete for workers from small businesses who currently may not have coverage. As for Barrett, they argue that Barrett backed the whole bill, but provide evidence only that he talked up some aspects of it months after it passed. On the support of Hillary Clinton’s plan in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor, and some experts say it went further than Obama’s plan. But it still would have retained a private-insurance based system. It didn’t amount to a takeover either. Can we light two matches? We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2010-10-17T09:00:00	2010-10-13	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)']
pomt-04586	Says the "number-one source" of illegal immigration "is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/23/rob-andrews/rep-rob-andrews-claims-most-illegal-immigrants-fir/	Most illegal immigration does not start off with a race across the border, but instead with government visas allowing foreigners to tour the United States or attend school, according to U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews. Once those visas expire, the individuals go from being welcomed visitors to outlaws, vanishing into the population, the Democratic congressman said. Andrews, who represents parts of southern New Jersey, made that point during an interview posted online on Sept. 12 with Townsquare Media New Jersey. Andrews is seeking re-election this November against Republican challenger Gregory Horton. "The number-one source of undocumented people in this country is not people coming across the Mexican border," Andrews said. "It is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again." Pinning an exact number on a hidden population remains challenging, but most available estimates suggest Andrews is overstating how many illegal immigrants first arrived legally and stayed past the valid time limits. That "overstay" population typically represents about one-third to roughly half of the country’s illegal immigrants. Therefore, about half to roughly two-thirds of illegal immigrants are generally those who entered the country illegally. In fact, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in April that people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants. "That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left," according to a transcript of Napolitano’s remarks at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Defending Andrews’ statement, his chief of staff, Fran Tagmire, argued there are more visa overstayers than people who illegally crossed the Mexican border. But we told Tagmire that Andrews’ statement did not directly compare those two groups, but instead claimed overstayers are the "number-one source" of all illegal immigrants. Now, let’s review the estimates we found. A common measure for estimating the overstay population has been analyzing data from the immigration forms visa holders must file when they enter and leave the country. Based on that methodology, in January 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that out of the 7 million illegal immigrants in January 2000, 33 percent were individuals who stayed after their temporary visas had expired. In a May 2004 report, the U.S. General Accounting Office argued overstayers also include certain groups who had entered the country legally without visas and did not fill out those immigration forms. Using three alternative data sources, the GAO report estimated the overstay population at 31 percent, 27 percent and 57 percent. The most recent estimate we found was released in May 2006 by the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimated that out of between 11.5 million and 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, "between 33% and 50% are visa overstayers." That estimate is based in part on the immigration form data used in the January 2003 analysis. Still, data on overstayers has been considered unreliable, in part because of the incomplete collection of those immigration forms when foreign visitors leave the country. The majority of illegal immigrants appears to be due to illegal border crossings, but it’s difficult to reach a precise number, said Edward Alden, an expert in immigration policy for the Council on Foreign Relations. Our ruling In an interview with Townsquare Media New Jersey, Andrews claimed the "number-one source" of illegal immigration "is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again." Data on the overstay population has been labeled unreliable, but most available estimates suggest such individuals are not the "number-one source." Those estimates indicate most illegal immigrants had entered the country illegally. Most studies have said overstayers range from about one-third to roughly half of all illegal immigrants, and the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary said people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Rob Andrews	None	None	None	2012-09-23T07:30:00	2012-09-12	['United_States']
pomt-07990	"Some of the men serving in the (Afghan) armed forces have never driven a vehicle before."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/17/marco-rubio/aghan-soliders-first-car-hmmwv-marco-rubio-says/	Florida's U.S. senator, Marco Rubio, joined other senators on a secret visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan over the Martin Luther King Day weekend, where Rubio saw first-hand America's efforts to hand over security and governmental operations to the Afghan people. Rubio and the six other Republican senators did not announce their trip until a conference call with reporters on the morning of Jan. 17, 2011, as the group was preparing to leave. Rubio said that in Pakistan, he met parliament members and U.S. embassy officials. In Afghanistan, Rubio observed Afghan military exercises and met with Gen. David Petraeus and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Speaking from Kabul, Rubio said 2011 would be a "critical" year for Afghan military forces to "step up," but dismissed plans for the U.S. to begin withdrawing troops this summer. "I think we are on the timeline this year to have some real good news and make some significant progress, but I think if you attach a date to it, that you talk about openly in the press especially, you are really creating a difficult situation," Rubio said. "The bad guys, the Taliban and even al-Qaida, must know all they have to do is wait." Rubio also addressed the challenges in training the Afghan National Army to take over as the primary security force for the country. Currently, there are about 132,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 90,000 Americans. "Some of the men serving in the (Afghan) armed forces have never driven a vehicle before," he said. "The first time they've ever driven a car or any kind of vehicle is a HMMWV mine-cleaning vehicle." Rubio's statement was meant to broadly illustrate the difficulties in training Afghan men to join a 21st century military force. But we were curious, if on the specifics of the driving claim, Rubio was correct. As part of their mission, American troops are teaching the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police weapons and combat training, crisis management and all the other skills modern-day Army and police personnel need. That includes driving the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWVs) and other military vehicles. We found several accounts of the driver training courses, which last several weeks. Each story helps confirm Rubio's claim. Many Afghani men joining the Army haven't driven before. Here's an excerpt from a story written for the website of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan: "For many of the students, it's the first time they've sat behind the wheel of a vehicle, let alone behind that of an up-armored military vehicle. They don't know the driving basics -- braking, seat belt, mirror use or signals -– or the more complicated concepts of manual transmission and engine maintenance." New Afghan drivers have difficulty adjusting to using a rear-view mirror, said Army Sgt. Ernest Richardson, U.S. Army driver course team leader. They also have problems with turn signals. (In Afghanistan, many people use a blinker to indicate it's safe for someone else to pass, rather than an indication of changing lanes or turning.) An Army account of its 60-day course says trainees are taught on three vehicles: a Ford Ranger pick-up truck, an armored HMMWV, and a seven-ton flat-bed truck. "A lot of the students who come to the course have never driven before," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Darwynn Palmer. "So teaching them to drive is like teaching a teenager in the U.S. to drive. It's a challenge, but they eventually pick it up." The Army story quoted Mohammed Aghai, an Afghan National Army solider, who was learning to drive for the first time. "I'm here to learn how to be a good driver and so far, I've learned a lot from both the U.S. and the Afghan instructors," he said. "I'm looking forward to completing this class because it will help me, my unit and the ANA." An ABC News story also dealt with the difficulties in something as simple as teaching Afghan soldiers to drive. "About 95 to 98 percent have never driven," U.S. Army Capt. Jon Doiron said. "We are looking at about 90 to 95 percent that are also illiterate in the training as well, so we are having to teach them how to read the different gauges -- everything on the vehicle, as well as any sort of safety warning or anything like that." To confirm the news reports, we reached out to Nazif Shahrani, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at Indiana University and an expert on Afghanistan. He said many people in Afghanistan are unlikely to have driven because the country has been consumed by war for much of the last 30 years. "The statement you have quoted from Marco Rubio seems plausible because a great majority of Afghans of military age have grown up during the devastating war years of the last three decades plus, and are unlikely to have driven any vehicles," Shahrani said. Shahrani said the inability to drive would be particularly common in the remote Afghan countryside. Experts and news accounts agree with Rubio. One of the problems facing American soldiers training the new Afghan army is that many members of the new Afghan force don't know how to drive or have never driven. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05715	Says the federal government "tells health insurance companies how much money they're allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues -- 15 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/07/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-government-lets-health-insurers/	In a 40-minute speech to supporters near Knoxville ahead of Super Tuesday, presidential candidate Rick Santorum framed the health care debate in terms of government power versus individual choice. President Barack Obama, he said on Feb. 29, 2012, "wants that power in the hands of government. He wants to control your insurance policies and your access and the reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and how much insurance companies -- not how much they’ll make, how much they’re allowed to keep of the money they collect. "That’s already in place by the way. The federal government has a regulation in place already that tells health insurance companies how much money they’re allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues. Fifteen percent -- that’s what they can keep. That’s how much money they get to keep to run their businesses." He wrapped up the topic saying, "they’re going to micromanage everything because they don’t believe in you." We decided to check the claim that the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep just 15 percent of their revenues to use for operating expenses. Medical loss ratio Santorum didn’t call it by this name, and we didn’t hear back from his campaign for our story, but it appears he was referring to the medical loss ratio, a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by Obama and opposed by congressional Republicans. The provision is similar to others already in place in several states. It "requires most insurance companies that cover individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement, leaving the remaining 20 percent for administration, marketing, and profit. The … threshold is higher for large group plans, which must spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement," according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There are other exceptions for small companies. (You can read Kaiser’s full explainer on the medical loss ratio here.) Insurance companies that exceed those limits are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers, beginning in 2012. With large group plans required to spend 85 percent of premium income on health care, what’s left is the 15 percent to which Santorum referred. According to John Rother at the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, the medical loss ratio "was enacted to put pressure on insurers to become more efficient" as well as to "make sure that consumers and businesses got a fair deal on their premiums." Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., called it "a pro-consumer regulation." The idea behind, he said, is that "when people purchase health insurance, they ought to have the money go to health care." Revenue not affected Santorum referred to health insurers’ overall revenue -- "what they receive" -- but the provision applies only to revenue from premiums. In other words, of what you pay your insurer in premiums, 80 or 85 percent must be spent on your health care. It may not pay for television commercials or new office space. But other sources of revenue may be used for those purposes. "Many (insurance companies) have side businesses, offering IT services and other services that are sold to health providers," said Rother. Added Jost: "Some insurers are heavily invested, and that doesn’t figure in at all." "It’s not that they are limited to 15 percent of their income for all of their expenses. They’re limited in their premium income," Jost said. While they may not account for all revenue, Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, pointed out that premiums comprise the majority of insurance companies’ revenue. Expenses not affected Some insurers’ expenses, such as quality improvement efforts, taxes, regulatory fees and patient safety, do not have to come out of the 15 percent. Jost said some things that previously were considered administrative costs are now specifically exempted, namely quality improvement costs that include wellness programs and patient safety. "It does not limit the insurers’ ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality. Those costs are not charged against the 15 or 20 percent limit," Rother said. But Zirkelbach said the cap also encompasses services that affect consumers, including services to help patients navigate complicated delivery systems, efforts to modernize technology and programs to prevent fraud and abuse. His group raised concerns about the medical loss ratio when it was being debated, citing fears it would disrupt the health insurance market and inhibit innovation. A Government Accountability Office study found that the majority of established insurers would have already been in compliance with the medical loss ratio in 2010 if it had been in effect. Thus, most policy holders won’t be getting a rebate this year, Jost said. But they’re also likely avoiding premium rate increases that might have happened without the rule. "It’s … fair to say that many insurers are showing that they can meet this requirement without breaking a sweat," Rother said. Our ruling Santorum said the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep only 15 percent of their revenues to run their businesses. His description of the medical loss ratio provision of the health reform law doesn't tell the whole story. The rule does require large group insurance plans to spend 85 percent of their premium income on real health care. For small group plans the rule is more generous. All health insurance companies are still free to spend other streams of revenue however they wish, and several types of expenses are specifically exempted from the 15 (or 20) percent limit. Santorum’s statement leaves out a good deal of important information. That pushes the needle to Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-07T11:11:29	2012-02-29	['None']
pomt-02269	"Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/09/chris-taylor/bird-sized-drones-could-record-you-inside-your-hom/	On April 1, 2014 state Rep. Chris Taylor warned the citizenry about eyes in the sky and attacks on privacy. "Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet," the Madison Democrat wrote in a news release. Was Taylor pulling the public’s leg on April Fools’ Day? No, she was dead serious. Taylor spoke the day the state Senate approved and sent to Gov. Scott Walker a bipartisan bill -- cosponsored by Taylor -- to put limits on drone use. The Wisconsin bill, similar to others around the country, attempts to prohibit both law enforcement agencies and private individuals from recording people in locations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Example: inside their homes. Under the legislation, it would be unlawful in a criminal investigation for police -- without first getting a search warrant -- to use drones equipped with video or audio recording equipment to collect evidence in such locations. Emergency exceptions to this prohibition include locating an escaped prisoner, aiding in a search and rescue mission, executing an arrest warrant or preventing imminent harm to a person or the imminent destruction of evidence. The bill allows hobbyists, entrepreneurs or aerial photographers to use drones as long as that use does not intentionally violate an individual’s privacy interests. Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law on April 8, 2014. Taylor, in her statement, focuses on the state of the technology, not on who is doing the recording. Let’s see if she’s correct. Some basics first. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small aircraft that can fly by remote control without an onboard human operator. They can be part of a system that includes a digital network and personnel on the ground, and can be equipped with high-powered cameras, with infrared devices that sense objects through walls, and with laser radar that can see through trees and foliage, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2013 report. Their use by law enforcement and the military in the U.S. "raises far-reaching issues concerning the extent of government surveillance authority, the value of privacy in the digital age, and the role of Congress in reconciling these issues," the report noted. To address Taylor’s specific statement, we turned to government studies, technology and privacy experts, law enforcement officials and drone manufacturers. The bottom line: A wide range of experts said Taylor’s scenario reflects the capability of current technology. Size Drones can be as small as insects and as large as regular aircraft. Models used by law enforcement have included the Draganflyer X4-ES, which is just 24 inches wide, and the AeroVironment Wasp, described as "bird-size" in a Washington Post story about Texas police conducting discreet video surveillance before a SWAT team stormed a property that officials believed had a cache of weapons. A tiny drone developed for the U.S. military weighs less than a AA battery and resembles a live hummingbird that can hover, climb, fly through an open doorway and relay real-time video back to its operator, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That drone, AeroVironment’s Nano Hummingbird, could someday provide new reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in urban environments, the AeroVironment website says. Someday, because it’s not in production yet. Army-technology.com said in 2012 that UAVs "are getting smaller and more agile to enable combatants to gather intelligence from hard to reach areas, such as in buildings and through tunnels." Internet A Draganflyer official told us it’s easy to upload the live video images that a remote operator is viewing. It just takes some additional equipment. "That’s a minor thing as far as I’m concerned," said Kevin Lauscher, a former police officer who is now sales manager and flight trainer at Draganfly Innovations. "The realistic expectation of privacy is pretty weak in these days of technology" and people recording conversations and posting photos with their phones, he said. Recording people in their homes Taylor aide Craig Trost told us the representative meant recording through a window, not with see-through-walls camera technology that is still under development. Taking pictures of people inside their home is possible with a drone, various law enforcement officials told us. Image quality would be a major challenge though. Daniel Schwarzbach, a pilot for the Houston Police and executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, said police could film people through their windows after getting a search warrant but he doesn’t recall that happening or police being interested in it. So, Taylor’s description of drone capabilities is not imaginary. How likely it is to happen? That’s an important question, and we got an earful on it, though we don’t think the answer bears directly on the accuracy of her warning about what is possible with current technology. "Doing what she is afraid of would be difficult at best, it would be illegal under peeping Tom laws, and it’s not on the agenda of law enforcement," said Gregory McNeal, a national security and criminal law expert at Pepperdine University law school. McNeal added: "If she is worried about invasions of privacy, she should update Wisconsin’s invasion of privacy laws for all forms of observation, not just drones because what she’s alleging can be done by a drone can be done with an iPhone, any camera, or binoculars." The privacy issue is not about unmanned aircraft, it is about image capture and retention, in the view of Alan Frazier, a University of North Dakota aviation professor and former Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputy. "Agencies need to have a robust policy in place regarding appropriate uses of all types of image capture devices," he said. Taylor, a lawyer, says it’s not at all clear that current law criminalizes peeping remotely using a drone. Law enforcement officials using drones told us a rogue user might try to do that, but not them. "We cannot look into homes, our systems are twice the size of a goose and we don't operate in areas where we have internet, nor do we have, or need, the desire to upload anything to the internet …" said Ben Miller, director of the Mesa County, Colorado, unmanned aircraft systems program. "We mostly take aerial pictures of crime scenes and conduct aerial search and rescue flights." Taylor, for the record, says she wasn’t suggesting that law enforcement was illegally peeking into windows, just the possible uses of the technology. Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said a hobbyist could buy a drone size of a large bird and put a camera on it and get video and put it on the Internet. But Bohm called that a "side issue" because there’s no evidence drones are being widely employed in that fashion, in part due to Federal Aviation Administration rules, Bohm said. Public entities seeking to fly drones must get FAA approval. More than 1,800 have done so since 2007, including law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions, the FAA says. (The Milwaukee Police Department does not own or use drones, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us.) Under current FAA rules, a drone must be flown within the line of sight of the operator, less than 400 feet above the ground, during daylight conditions, inside uncontrolled airspace and more than five miles from any airport or other location with aviation activities. "Flying model aircraft solely for hobby or recreational reasons does not require FAA approval, but hobbyists must operate according to the agency's model aircraft guidance," FAA spokesman Les Dorr said in a statement. Commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis and to date, only one has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle. A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. That authorization was limited to the Arctic. Our rating Taylor said that "drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet." There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now. We rate her statement True.

pomt-07494	Says Gov. Rick Scott lost Florida 331,247 jobs.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/apr/12/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-group-says-jobs-governor-lost-33124/	As the grand marshal of a Tallahassee parade, Florida Gov. Rick Scott smiled and waved to crowds lined up along the route for "Springtime Tallahassee," an annual Capital City celebration on April 2, 2011. Some people in the crowd, though, weren’t exactly waving back -- at least, not with their hands. Hundreds wielded "Pink Slip Rick" picket signs and booed. Their posters were hard to ignore, and not just for an eye-catching splash of hot pink. The signs accuse Scott of losing 331,247 jobs. This number stirred our curiosity for a few reasons. One, it's oddly precise. Also, it’s huge! How could Scott, the self-proclaimed "Jobs Governor" who swore to bring 700,000 jobs to the Sunshine State in seven years, eliminate hundreds of thousands of positions so quickly? We thought we'd begin by checking Florida's most recent unemployment statistics. The state's unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percent from January 2011, when Scott was inaugurated, to February 2011, hitting 11.5 percent. Interestingly, the number of non-agricultural jobs increased by 22,700 in that span. We took a closer look. The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, an upstart progressive group that also had a hand in the Dirty Hari website targeting Mike Haridopolos, Florida Senate president and U.S. Senate candidate. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife to Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. (Remember the "Taliban Dan" ad?) PinkSlipRick.com offers a "Get The Facts" page, breaking down how it reaches 331,247 lost jobs, with linked sources copied here: • 135,000 jobs from moving Medicaid to a state-run program • 113,065 construction jobs from Scott stalling SunRail contract • 1,849 in layoffs from Department of Children and Families, as outlined in Scott’s proposed budget • 20,000 teacher layoffs, per Scott’s budget proposal • 49,900 job losses for rejecting high-speed rail • 1,690 jobs cut from state prison system We have an immediate problem, as those figures fall short of Pink Slip Rick's count by about 9,700 jobs. Randolph sent us a spreadsheet accounting for more "lost jobs," and we’ll get into those in a second. Medicaid: Scott wants to turn over more control of the state-administered Medicaid system to managed-care companies, namely HMOs, to save state money. But the federal government, which pays for more than half of the program, needs to sign off on major changes such as these, and getting a waiver isn't so easy. The Florida Senate has proposed withdrawing from the Medicaid program if the federal government doesn't approve of its new bill to expand managed care. The House, which also wants more HMO involvement, has made no such proposal to withdraw from federal oversight of Medicaid. The governor's team has discussed the merits of withdrawing, but the governor has made no such proposal and hasn't spoken in favor of it. His health and human services transition team recommended expanding a current Medicaid waiver for a small pilot program to statewide, but Scott said at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27 that he would prefer a block grant of federal money for Medicaid. "You give me a block grant, let me do whatever I want, and I will cover the right people," he said. Pink Slip Rick attributes the loss of 135,000 jobs to a January 2011 report from the Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, a Tallahassee think-tank focused on low- and moderate-income families and small businesses. According to the report, the state would lose $11.7 billion in federal matching funds and 135,000 jobs representing $5.6 billion in wages next year if it received a complete federal waiver (which is not what Scott proposed). The exact number of eliminated jobs -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. -- would depend on several political variables and business-related decisions, said the report's author, the center's House policy analyst Greg Mellowe. He's also the policy director of Florida CHAIN, a liberal health advocacy group. The prospects of receiving a federal waiver this year are next to impossible, he said, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services won't make a decision on a waiver until June. That's too late for the legislative session, which ends May 6. Given the improbability of obtaining a waiver for expansion, and that Mellowe's estimate of lost jobs would only happen with a total federal waiver (which isn't on the table), Mellowe said it isn't fair to include his estimate of 135,000 into Pink Slip Rick's tally. "No one thinks this is really a reality-based scenario," Mellowe said. SunRail: Scott froze this contract as part of his review of hundreds of contracts exceeding $1 million since his inauguration. Pink Slip Rick cites a one-page summary report from the City of Orlando, which says creation of the Orlando commuter train will bring 113,065 construction jobs for transit-oriented development. We traced that figure to an executive summary of the SunRail project by the Florida Department of Transportation. The report elaborates on that estimate of construction jobs, which would be created within a half-mile of the commuter train line over 20 years. Development doesn't happen overnight. The estimate by Pink Slip Rick seems arbitrary, as it doesn't differentiate among direct construction jobs for the train, train operations and maintenance jobs, and indirect and direct jobs created as a result of development over time. Either way, the number of "jobs lost" here is unclear because the fate of SunRail is under review. Still, Pink Slip Rick counts them as lost jobs. Teachers and high-speed rail: PolitiFact Florida has been down these two roads before, and Pink Slip Rick.com even links to our Truth-O-Meter rulings to corroborate its count. But we find that misleading. Our stories on teacher layoffs and high-speed rail do not endorse these figures. We gave Florida Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith a Half True when he said Scott’s budget would lay off 20,000 teachers. One of the problems we found is that Scott's budget proposal cuts education by an amount that equals 20,000 teacher salaries -- but it doesn't specifically eliminate teacher positions. That would be up to local school districts how they handle the cuts. We also cited the constitutional classroom-size requirement as a factor that could force districts to avoid widespread layoffs, and the fact that districts will see some cost savings from teachers contributing a percentage of their salaries to their pensions. We also checked exaggerated job projections by U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown in the $2.4 billion high-speed rail money that Scott rejected. We found that the Florida Department of Transportation estimated that the project would have created 49,900 "job-years" in Florida, but a job-year is not the same as a job. Basically, it refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. The proposed line connecting Tampa and Orlando would have created construction and construction-spinoff jobs for parts of four years, peaking at a total of 21,600 jobs in the second year of construction. Randolph's site mislabels job-years as jobs, an important distinction. DCF and prisons: Pink Slip Rick got the number of proposed layoffs in the departments of Corrections and Children and Families right, but that doesn't mean those jobs should count as eliminated positions. Scott's budget is really a recommendation for the Legislature, which members can use, adjust or ignore as they craft the state's actual budget. Here's why the Pink Slip Rick figures don't add up on the web: In addition to the cuts in prisons and DCF staff, the web site counts all of Scott's proposed cuts to state government workers for the next two years. That's a total of 13,282 jobs, and it's not clear those are included because they aren't listed in the breakdown of jobs on the site. But those jobs also aren't "lost" either; they are in Scott's proposed budget, but that's not a fact yet. So just because we can see how Randolph got her grand total doesn't mean it reflects an accurate number of lost jobs. Randolph, reached by phone, says she isn’t just counting jobs already cut by Scott, as the signs claim, but jobs lost or stalled by his refusal of federal money and review of contracts, she said. "From where we sit, he’s turning jobs away," Randolph said. "This is specifically to call him out on ‘what jobs are you creating?' " But that’s not what Pink Slip Rick advertised on picket signs and online. The signs read "Jobs Lost Under Pink Slip Rick -- 331,247." We find this tally deceptive for its mixture of proposed layoffs and job projections. The Medicaid jobs total is based on a change that Scott isn't proposing. The SunRail jobs are still up in the air, awaiting a decision from Scott. Teachers may well be affected by the budget, but we've already ruled that 20,000 is not likely. Prison and DCF jobs depend on what the Legislature does, and that's still an unknown. As for high-speed rail, yes, we've ruled that those jobs won't be coming -- but there were only 21,600 of them at the peak of construction. So Pink Slip Rick has pulled together a bunch of numbers but is misrepresenting what they mean. You can't just lump the governor's cost-saving proposals, which need legislative approval and will undergo tinkering by lawmakers, and vague estimates stemming from rumored policy decisions into one sum and label it "Jobs Lost."

pomt-07863	"In Mexico, they don't have birth certificates... they don’t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID."	false	/texas/statements/2011/feb/09/pete-gallego/rep-pete-gallego-says-mexicans-have-one-national-i/	State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, who favors a GOP-backed mandate that voters show their photo ID at the polls, recently pointed to another voter ID — in Mexico. "If you don’t have this card in Mexico, you don’t vote," he said on the Jan. 27 edition of Your News Now’s Capital Tonight, holding a voter card from Mexico’s Federal Electoral Institute that he described as including a photo, fingerprint and "your life’s history." In a separate interview for that night’s program, which airs weekly in Austin, Waco and other cities, state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who opposes voter ID legislation, said: "You’ve got to tell the whole story. In Mexico, they don’t have birth certificates, for example. They don’t have a lot of the same things that we have. They don’t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID. We don’t have a national ID." Shifting away from the hubbub about the proposed voter ID law, we wondered whether Mexicans have one national ID, but lack birth certificates and voter cards. In an interview, Gallego told us that "most of (Mexico’s) population" doesn’t have a birth certificate. "Mexico is not at a point where they have implemented the law all across the country," he said. "They don’t have the resources." Gallego said that supporters of a voter ID in Texas are pointing to Mexico as an example of the law at work, but "Mexicans have a national ID card for everything," not just voting. "It’s just a different system," he said. When we asked if anyone could confirm his statements, he arranged a conference call with Rosalba Ojeda, the consul general of Mexico in Austin. Ojeda told us that birth certificates have "been around forever" in Mexico, but some residents in remote areas "simply don’t get around to registering the baby." Some people aren’t registered until they’re older, "when they have the opportunity to go to the village," she said. Mexicans can register their birth at any time, Ojeda said, but it’s not necessarily easy. They must go to the local municipio, or municipal office, of their birthplace and bring witnesses who can attest to their birth in Mexico. She said that she doesn’t know what proportion of the population has a birth certificate but that the government has conducted "a lot of campaigns" in the "last 15 years and so most of the people I would say now would have one." Birth certificates are required to access hospital services and get a passport, Ojeda said. Ojeda also told us that the Mexican government is conducting a pilot project that gives citizens national IDs. According to a Jan. 25 San Diego Union-Tribune news article, Tijuana elementary school students became the first to register for the new identity card. "The card is aimed at minors from ages 4 to 17, but by the end of 2012, Mexico’s federal government is hoping that as many as 25.7 million children will sign up," eventually extending ID cards to adults as well, according to the article. "With the document, they won’t need to present a birth certificate when registering for school, medical appointments or to receive other public services." The article also says that in Mexico, "birth certificates and voter registration cards are the most commonly used identification documents." Ojeda told us that a birth certificate is also required to get an electoral ID, which citizens need to vote. According to the electoral institute’s website, to vote, Mexicans must apply to the "Electoral Roll" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There’s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can’t go to the offices. Since 1991, the institute has issued free "photo-voting cards" — "an essential document to exercise the right to vote," according to the site. They include the owner’s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number. Kenneth Greene, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, told us that Mexico does have birth certificates. He said that he hasn’t seen a national ID, but that the country does have a voter ID card. Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, told us in an e-mail that Gallego’s statement is incorrect on both counts. Selee said Mexico has birth certificates and registration cards for voters, but the country doesn’t have a national ID card. "Their voter registration card usually serves that purpose," he said. "There is discussion of creating a national ID, but it doesn’t exist yet." While some people in rural areas don’t get birth certificates, Selee said, "that doesn’t seem to be a major problem anymore in Mexico in the way it is in some countries like Haiti and Bolivia." Separately, Greene pointed us to an undated report by the Mexico-based Be Foundation, which works to increase birth registration in the country. The report says Mexico "has no simple system for registering births. For poor people in rural areas, getting a birth certificate can mean walking hours or even days to the nearest municipal office." Karen Mercado, the foundation’s president, told us in an e-mail that "in Mexico, more than 10 million people lack a birth certificate," which she said means "no access to (citizens’) most fundamental human rights to education and health programs, protection and participation." In a follow-up interview, Gallego told us: "My issue is not that they do not have birth certificates — it’s that they’re not credible... it’s not that the system doesn’t exist. In practical terms, a lot of people don’t have them, and they’re not necessarily reliable." He told us that he was referring to the voter ID when he said Mexico has one national ID. To the Truth-O-Meter. As experts pointed out, the statement misfires on three fronts. Mexicans don’t have a "national ID card for everything," though a pilot project is under way to issue identity cards to minors. But the federal government issues voter IDs featuring each voter’s photo and other personal information. The government also issues birth certificates; according to experts we spoke with, less than 10 percent of residents don’t have one. We rate Gallego’s statement as False.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., on a criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went missing and were later found dead. "Trey Gowdy breaks his silence after 2 of his investigators are found tortured and killed," read the headline on the blog WhatHappensintheUSA.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential Library when they were tortured and killed, with no evidence left behind. If such a crime were true, it would be picked up by legitimate journalists. But there is no evidence of anything like that happening in Little Rock, Ark., where the presidential library dedicated to former president Bill Clinton is located. Gowdy, who previously announced his plan to retire earlier this year, was the former chairman of the House select committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic properties in Benghazi, Libya, and Hillary Clinton’s response to the attacks as secretary of state. The final Benghazi report was issued in 2016, and found no personal culpability on Clinton’s behalf. The fake news article also said that Gowdy had no comment about the made-up incident for safety reasons. The story also reported a phony statement by Gowdy about a "vast conspiracy." When searching these statements, we found no credible reports that Gowdy has made any similar claims. We ran this conspiracy by Gowdy's office, and they confirmed it was inaccurate.

pomt-08937	Because of union rules, cooks helpers moved into DMV jobs they were not trained for	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/25/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-union-rules-allowed-cooks-helpers-/	No Rhode Island state agency is more reviled than the Division of Motor Vehicles. And let's face it, with waits that have stretched to seven hours, branch closures and antiquated computing systems, there's not much to like. Seems like we've heard all the complaints. But Republican candidate for governor John Robitaille, speaking on WPRI Channel 12's weekly Newsmakers show earlier this month, offered a new one. Former attorney general Arlene Violet, one of the panelists, asked Robitaille about the Carcieri administration's role in the problems at the DMV. (Before launching his own bid for governor, Robitaille had served as Carcieri's communications director.) In recalling his frustrations with the registry, Robitaille told the Newsmakers panel: "We had cook's helpers that, because of their union status and seniority in other parts of state government, had the right to move into the DMV, not trained for the jobs." It was not surprising to hear Robitaille make this sort of claim. The Carcieri administration has long maintained that union personnel rules have hampered its ability to rejigger state agencies and realign staff. But when we asked Robitaille to back it up, he didn't offer much help. Citing what he said was data from the state's Department of Administration, he told us there was one former cook's helper now working as a DMV customer service representative. He then insisted there are many more former cook's helpers working within the registry. But he said the Human Resources department couldn't confirm that without a time-consuming manual search and he refused to request such a search or provide additional proof. "They have more important things to do. I stand by the information I was given by former members of the administration that there were in fact several employees who bumped into the DMV from cook's helpers positions in the recent past," he wrote in an email. The problem is, he refused to provide us with any evidence. So we filed our own public records request. The data we received revealed that there are three former cook's helpers currently working at the DMV. Despite what Robitaille said, none is a customer service representative. The list shows that one is a senior clerk and one a Spanish interpreter, both of whom previously worked as cook's helpers at Rhode Island College. The third, a senior teller, worked as a cook's helper at what is now known as the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals. There was some truth to the first part of Robitaille's statement. But what about the second part, that the transfers of cook's helpers to the DMV were connected to their "union status or seniority" and that they arrived at the DMV "not trained for the jobs." According to Melanie Marcaccio, deputy personnel administrator for the Department of Administration, applicants for these jobs would have to meet education and experience requirements, regardless of their union status. The official job descriptions all require a high school degree and related experience. For the senior clerk, that means clerical experience. For the senior teller it's supervisory experience, with involvement in payment and accounting practices. And for the interpreter it means "the ability to speak, read and write Spanish." For most job classifications, a civil service examination is also required. Candidates who score high enough are placed on a list to be given preference if a job opens up. Maureen Tripp, president of the union representing DMV workers, defended her members' training. "They had to take the civil service test, receive a score, had a ranking and were interviewed," she said. "They were deemed qualified at the time they applied." But there's a complication. The state only administers these tests periodically, if at all, depending on job classification, according to Marcaccio. Those who have not yet taken the test are therefore considered temporary, pending their scores on the exam. When and if the test is eventually given, they must do well enough, or risk losing their jobs. The three former cook's helpers now at the DMV have not taken the test, she said. However that doesn't automatically make them unqualified. They'd still have to have the necessary education and experience. It's that background that deems them qualified for appointment to the job, regardless of their union seniority, Marcaccio confirmed. Once it is determined who meets the specifications, preference is given to those with the most seniority. While Robitaille's statement that there are a handful of former cook's helpers among the almost 150 DMV employees is correct, he couldn't support his claim that they weren't qualified. We all know the registry needs an overhaul, but it's important to focus on the facts. We rate this Half True.	None	John Robitaille	None	None	None	2010-07-25T00:01:00	2010-07-11	['None']

pomt-05525	About 78 to 81 House Democrats "are members of the Communist Party. ... It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/apr/11/allen-west/allen-west-says-about-80-house-democrats-are-membe/	Speaking at a town hall meeting, Republican Allen West made the startling claim that many of his fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives are members of the Communist Party. The TCPalm, a newspaper that covers northern Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, reported on comments the South Florida congressman made at a town hall in Jensen Beach on April 10, 2012. The article reported that West claimed up to 80 House Democrats are Communist Party members, though he didn’t name names. West’s words went viral. Some of the responses were funny: A commenter on the the Palm Beach Post website pretended to be Joe McCarthy, the red-baiting senator from Wisconsin: "I told you there were 80 communists in Congress!" By the next day, West’s Democratic opponent, Patrick Murphy, had posted a 26-second video of West’s statement. West’s campaign then distributed their own slightly longer version of the video. The audio is somewhat difficult to discern in parts, but here’s a transcript of what we heard: Moderator: "What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card-carrying Marxists or International Socialist?" West: "It's a good question. I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party. ... It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus." So how many -- if any -- Democrats in Congress are communists? West points to the Progressive Caucus We asked West’s spokeswoman Angela Melvin for an explanation: "The congressman was referring to the 76 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its allies. The Progressive Caucus speaks for itself. These individuals certainly aren't proponents of free markets or individual economic freedom." On Facebook, West elaborated: "I stand by the point of my comments. The press wants to write gotcha stories and talk semantics, but just look at the words and actions of the Progressive Caucus. You can call them socialist, Marxist, communist or whatever you want, but the point is, they oppose free markets and individual economic freedom, they want to redistribute wealth, and they want to see the nation fundamentally transformed. Their policies are destructive and I will stand up to them regardless of the critics. Members of this Caucus lavished praise on Fidel Castro following a 2009 visit, just to name one example. The Communist Party USA claims the Progressive Caucus as its ‘ally.’" West’s campaign manager Tim Edson told the Washington Post that some Democratic members have traveled to communist Cuba or praised Fidel Castro. (The Post noted that some Republicans have gone to Cuba too.) From the Post: "Pressed on whether those members are actual communists, Edson said the label isn’t the point. "We can quibble about the terminology used to describe them, but it’s clear. Whatever you call people that oppose capitalism and free markets and individual economic freedom — maybe it’s ‘socialist,’ maybe it’s ’communist’ — but that’s the point the congressman was making, and he stands by the words." It might surprise you to know that PolitiFact has already checked claims about how many members of Congress are socialists. In the past, though, it’s been a claim confined to bloggers. (See these fact-checks from PolitiFact state sites in New Jersey, Texas and Oregon.) Here in Florida, we previously ruled on a claim from bloggers that three Florida Democratic members of Congress are socialists; we rated that Pants on Fire. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- the largest caucus within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and other causes. The Progressive Caucus is co-chaired by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota. We asked Ellison’s spokeswoman Jennifer Gore if any members of the caucus, which she said numbers 78, are communists: "That would really be a surprise to us. ... I don’t know how anyone would know if someone was a card-carrying member unless he or she said they were," she said. Eric Johnson, a consultant for Murphy’s campaign, joked in response to West’s claim: "50 million Americans are living under communist rule if every member of the Progressive caucus is a communist." (He multiplied the 78 caucus members times the average district population of 646,000 based on the 2000 census. That gets you to about 50 million.) The Communist Party responds Communist Party USA does describe the Progressive Caucus as "our allies" on its website, and we found several other positive mentions of the Progressive Caucus on the site as well. But it also dishes out some criticism of Democrats in general as being "accommodationist." There are no members of Congress who are members of the Communist Party, said Libero Della Piana, vice president of the Communist Party USA, which has fewer than 5,000 members. Applicants have to apply through the national or local organizations and pay dues. Even if prospective members applied through a local group, Piana said he’d hear about it. (Generally, the party no longer issues cards. If someone asks for them, there are some older cards on hand.) "Trust me -- if a member of Congress applied to join the Communist Party we would know about it," Piana said. "It would set up some red flags -- pardon the pun." The Progressive Caucus promotes policies that the Communist Party thinks are better for the country than some promoted by other caucuses, but "our support of their policies does not mean they support us or our policies. That is pretty much guilt by association on steroids,’’ Piana said. We read West’s claim to Bertell Ollman, a professor who teaches political theory at New York University and an expert on Marxism. Ollman said he considers himself a Marxist and a communist with a small "c’’, since he’s not active in a political party. "I wish he was right," Ollman said of West’s claim. "If it was even 10 percent true I would be dancing in the streets. It would indicate that the Democrats are much more to the left than they really are." And what’s the difference between Marxism, communists and socialists? Ollman said Marxism is more of an analytical tool, looking at what capitalism is as a system and how it works for some and not others. Communists draw more on Marxism than socialists do and are generally critical of socialists for being too moderate. Also, he added, communists tend to argue a lot more among themselves about political theory. Our ruling West said, "I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party." West said he was referring to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and that the Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its ally. But just because the Communist Party has spoken positively about the Progressive Caucus doesn’t mean that the Democrats in that Caucus are communists. Heck, West has often pointed out that he and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich -- a liberal Democrat from Ohio -- agreed on a resolution calling for withdrawing from Libya. That doesn’t make West a Democrat. West is using guilty by association here, and has failed to prove that any member of Congress is a communist. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01841	Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/16/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-revisits-gop-support-eric-holders-20/	In a recent edition of his talk radio show, Rush Limbaugh took umbrage at part of an interview that Attorney General Eric Holder gave to ABC News. During the interview with ABC, which aired on July 13, 2014, Holder suggested "there's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me, directed at the president," adding "there's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don't think this thing is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus." Limbaugh countered that Republicans gave Obama and Holder a fair shake in 2009, when he was nominated to be attorney general. "The Republicans bent themselves into as many shapes as they could to agree with this president," Limbaugh said. "They went out of the way to praise Holder's nomination. I'll never forget that." Limbaugh went on to add, "By the way, not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination." Given that Holder’s tenure has subsequently become a focal point for Republican disapproval of the Obama administration, we wondered, did at least some Republican senators go "out of the way" to praise Holder’s nomination in 2009? And when it came time to vote on his nomination for attorney general, did every Republican vote to confirm him? We took a spin through the archives and found Limbaugh is partly correct. (He did not respond to an inquiry.) Did Republicans go out of their way to praise Holder’s nomination? They did -- at least a number of them did -- in public fashion. While Holder received a tough grilling from senators in both parties at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing -- that’s the panel’s job, after all. Several Republican senators went out of their way to praise him in their introductory comments. And they weren’t just the most moderate members of the GOP caucus. For instance, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said, "Congratulations, Mr. Holder, on the nomination. You certainly bring excellent background and experience to the job as a federal prosecutor for a number of years and as a federal judge." Sessions even compared Holder favorably to a Republican attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. "I think you come to the office with far more experience than Attorney General Gonzales had," Sessions said. "I thought he was a good man, but when you lack experience, sometimes, you can make errors unintentionally. I think former Attorney General Janet Reno was a state prosecutor but was really inexperienced in a lot of the big issues that come before an attorney general." Then-Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said he had "a number of questions to ask you, but I want to congratulate you and your family for an extraordinary American journey." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, cited areas of common ground, including government transparency. "I don't want to speak for you, Mr. Holder, but I think you agreed that you would work with us to open up the government, to make it more transparent and more accountable," Cornyn said. And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, "I'm almost ready to vote for you right now." That appears to have been a joke -- the transcript reports that Graham’s comment was followed by laughter -- but other portions of Graham’s opening statement were more serious. "The president of the United States deserves the ability, within reason, to pick a lawyer in the attorney general that he or she has great confidence in," Graham said. "And the fact that this president has chosen you speaks well for you. And given your resume, even though we have probably a lot of political differences, I could understand why he has great confidence in you." Beyond the Senate, Holder received notable support from former Republican officials and officeholders. Former Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Bob Barr, R-Ga. -- both of whom were managers of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the House -- wrote letters of support for Holder, according to the trade publication Main Justice. So did Manus Cooney, the top aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Republican lawyers Ted Olson, George Terwilliger, Victoria Toensing and Joseph DiGenova. Of course, some of the senators’ comments could be characterized as simple good manners. Still, we do think they support Limbaugh’s assertion that Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination." Did no Republican senator oppose Holder's nomination? This is where Limbaugh’s claim outstrips the facts. When the Senate voted on Holder’s nomination on Feb. 2, 2009, he was confirmed by a vote of 75-21. Those voting in favor included 19 Republicans: Graham, Hatch and Sessions, plus Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Robert Bennett (Utah), Kit Bond (Mo.), Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), Susan Collins (Maine), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Judd Gregg (N.H.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), John McCain (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pa.) and George Voinovich (Ohio). In fact, at the time, some conservative commentators were apoplectic that any Repubicans supported Holder. Michelle Malkin introduced the vote summary on her blog by writing, "Here are your 19 Bend Over Republicans who voted yes on Holder. Some disappointing names on the list in addition to the usual suspects." Among Holder’s 21 no votes -- all Republicans -- were two senators who offered praise during the committee hearing, Brownback and Cornyn. The other GOP senators who voted against Holder's nomination were: John Barrasso (Wyo.), Jim Bunning (Ky.), Richard Burr (N.C.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Jim DeMint (S.C.), John Ensign (Nev.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (Texas), James Inhofe (Okla.), Mike Johanns (Neb.), Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Jim Risch (Idaho), Pat Roberts (Kan.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), John Thune (S.D.), David Vitter (La.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.). Holder ended up getting more no votes than some nominees received (such as former Sen. Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State, who was confirmed 94-2) but fewer no votes received by other nominees (for instance, Timothy Geithner for Treasury Secretary, 60-34, and Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, 65-31). So on Holder’s vote totals, Limbaugh is wrong. However, it’s worth noting that the previous time Holder faced Senate confirmation, he was confirmed without any Republican dissent. When he was nominated for deputy attorney general by Clinton in 1997, Holder won confirmation by a perfect 100-0 vote. However, there is no indication in the transcript of Limbaugh’s show that he was referring to Holder’s 1997 confirmation. The discussion on his show was about how Obama was treated after he took office in 2009. Our ruling Limbaugh said Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination." He has a point that several prominent senators and other Republicans spoke highly of Holder as his nomination was being considered, but it’s not true that no GOP senator voted against Holder -- 21 did. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-07-16T13:00:57	2014-07-14	['Eric_Holder', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-10697	"I do provide universal health care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/03/barack-obama/he-says-universal-but-its-no-guarantee/	Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back: "Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated — forced — them to get health care." Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common. One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like. Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University. Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later. So is it fair for Obama to call his plan "universal"? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09253	"This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/05/mike-pence/republican-says-obama-cut-budget-illegal-immigrati/	While many Democrats have criticized Arizona's tough new immigration laws, it's many of those same Democrats who have made the illegal immigration problem worse in Arizona, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on May 2, 2010. "This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control," Pence said. Later, Pence was more specific. "Here's the numbers," Pence said. "Fiscal 2007, the last year Republicans wrote a budget, $1.2 billion for border security and fencing. By 2010 that was cut to $800 million ... I mean, the Democrats have cut three-quarters of a trillion out of this, and the president wants to go to 50 percent of the level that Republicans spent on border security. We have got to take border security seriously." Pence toggles between two statistics here, spending on border security and a subset of that, spending on border fencing. The fact is, between 2007 and now, while spending on border fencing has gone down, overall spending on border security has increased. Let's get to some numbers. In 2007, discretionary spending on border security was $6.3 billion. As Pence noted, that was the last year of full Republican control. After that, while George W. Bush remained in the presidency, Congress was controlled by Democrats. But discretionary spending on border security continued to rise year after year. It went to $7.9 billion in 2008; to $9.8 billion in 2009; and to $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2010. President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for a slight decrease in discretionary spending on border security, but even at the proposed level of $9.8 billion, that's a 55 percent increase between 2007 and 2011. A spokesman in Pence's office said Pence was focusing specifically on funding for the border fence. Spending under the budget heading "border security, fencing, infrastructure and technology" has gone down -- from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $800 million this fiscal year. Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for trimming the fence budget again, to $574 million. Funding for new border fencing surged in 2007 and 2008 after Republicans passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of hundreds of miles of new border fencing. Much of that fencing has been completed. The other major piece of the fencing budget is the so-called "virtual border fence" championed by Bush. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was freezing funding for the "virtual border fence" along the U.S. Mexican border. The virtual fence -- which includes cameras, radar and ground sensors to detect illegal border crossings -- has been plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines and technical bugs, such as the radar motion detector being unable to distinguish between humans and animals crossing the border. The program had gotten several dreadful reviews from the Government Accountability Office. So Pence is correct that border fence budgets have been trimmed since 2007. But Pence repeatedly said that funding for border security has been steadily cut by Democrats since 2007. And as we noted earlier, spending on border security has actually risen steadily. That's because Obama has focused more funding in other border security areas, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. The 2011 proposed budget, for example, includes $94 million to expand the number of Customs and Border Patrol officers -- putting the country on target to reach Bush's goal of 20,000 officers. Between 2007 and 2011, the Border Patrol budget increased from $2.3 billion to $3.6 billion. The budget for inspections at ports of entry increased from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $2.9 billion in 2011. In addition, Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for $1.6 billion for customs enforcement programs to identify and remove illegal aliens who commit crimes; and $137 million to expand immigration-related verification programs. "I would not say the Obama administration has cut back on border enforcement in general," said Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Rather, Democrats have shifted funding from border fencing to other border security items, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. "Most immigration experts will tell you that adding personnel is much more important than additional fencing," Rosenblum said. "No one thinks building fences, in and of itself, is very effective." That's a policy debate. But when Pence said "this administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control," that's wrong. Funding for fencing is down, but funding for border security is up. In fact, discretionary spending on border security is up 55 percent between 2007 and 2011, even with a small proposed cut in 2011. We rate Pence's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c10a8d81-2441-48cd-8144-d3c5f7a1fdcd	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2010-05-05T11:48:51	2010-05-02	['United_States_Congress', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01953	Says of flood of non-Mexicans being apprehended at the border: "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jun/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-airs-ridiculous-unsupported-claim-about/	On the "Fox & Friends" program, Gov. Rick Perry bemoaned record-high apprehensions of individuals not from Mexico near the nation’s southern border. Perry then said: "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." After Perry spoke, we confirmed the U.S. Border Patrol is setting at least a 17-year record for apprehensions near the border of individuals not from Mexico, rating that part of Perry’s statement True. On June 18, 2014, Perry and other state leaders ordered a surge in state spending on border security in the wake of an uptick in unaccompanied minors, many from Central America, crossing the Rio Grande. Is Perry also right that all these apprehended immigrants not from Mexico hail from countries with substantial ties to terrorist regimes and operations? In 2011, we rated as Half True a softer statement by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that in the first 19 months of Barack Obama’s presidency, the U.S. detained people from nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism on the southwestern border. While nearly everyone detained near the border was a Mexican national, Cornyn showed that in the cited period, there were 153 apprehensions of Cubans, 17 of Iranians, seven of Sudanese and two of Syrians. That fact check noted, too, that while an "apprehension" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally, the number of people actually detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once. When we sought backup for Perry’s 2014 statement, state officials offered no figures. After Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said by email Perry drew on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger replied to us by email: "On a regular basis, undocumented immigrants from countries with ties to or which sponsor terrorism are being apprehended by Border Patrol." He later named Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan as such countries, adding that the department had no further response. Terrorist states, safe havens Next, we sought afresh to define a terrorist state, spotting online a U.S. State Department list of four nations "determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." They are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Another agency web page lists about a dozen countries, as of 2013, considered "terrorist safe havens," which "include ungoverned, under-governed, or ill-governed physical areas where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both." These included Somalia, Mali, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Colombia and Venezuela. Countries of origin And how many of the individuals stopped after crossing the border are coming from those countries? We were unable to come up with up-to-date data. By telephone, Dennis Smith, a Del Rio spokesman for the Border Patrol, guided us to a chart in the agency’s "2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics" indicating dozens of countries of origin for more than 643,000 individuals apprehended in the 12 months through September 2012. We set aside the 448,697 individuals from Mexico, finding that about 7,800 of the apprehended individuals -- 4 percent of the non-Mexican detainees -- hailed either from the U.S.-designated terrorist states or 10 "safe haven" countries. Some specifics: Cuba, 4,041 detainees; Iran, 276 individuals; Sudan, 220 individuals; and Syria, 56 individuals. Border Patrol officials didn't offer more recent information. But when we reached out to Megan Mitchell, a Cornyn aide, she emailed us a chart she attributed to a House committee showing countries of origin for the Border Patrol’s 153,055 OTM apprehensions in the 12 months through September 2013. According to the chart, 577, or 0.4 percent of such apprehensions, involved people from the government’s identified terrorist states or safe havens with Colombia accounting for the biggest single share, 457. From Iran, the chart showed, there were 7 apprehensions; from Cuba, 4; from Syria, 2; and from Sudan, 1. Countries with most immigrants removed from U.S. Analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that seeks to reduce immigration, helped us see another way to probe this topic by turning to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency within Homeland Security responsible for deporting people not legally authorized to be in the United States. ICE published a report and chart in December 2013 showing no countries outside the Western Hemisphere ranked among the top 10 countries of origin for immigrants returned to home countries by the U.S. government in the 12 months that ran through September of that year. Alone among them, Colombia is one of the U.S.-designated terrorist havens. In the period, the agency said, "Mexico continued to be the leading country of origin for those removed" from the United States, "followed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador." Removed Population by Citizenship* October 2012 through September 2013 Citizenship Total Mexico 241,493 Guatemala 47,769 Honduras 37,049 El Salvador 21,602 Dominican Republic 2,462 Ecuador 1,616 Brazil 1,500 Colombia 1,429 Nicaragua 1,383 Jamaica 1,119 Top 10 Total 357,422 *This counts individuals caught near border and beyond Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, December 2013 (accessed June 19, 2014) According to the report, the government removed 90,461 people from countries other than Mexico who had been caught by the Border Patrol after crossing the border--a 27 percent increase from the year before. Around the country, overall, ICE removed 368,644 individuals, the report said. Put another way, the top 10 countries--all but Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica located in Central and South America--accounted for 97 percent of the foreigners removed. By email, Vaughan said her search of an ICE database covering 2013 yielded "a handful of cases of aliens who had been arrested by the Border Patrol who were citizens of countries linked to terrorism and had crossed the border illegally from Mexico recently. There were 2 from Nigeria, 3 from Pakistan, 1 from Egypt, 1 from Morocco and 1 from Afghanistan," she wrote. "All were between the ages of 26 and 50." Generally, Vaughan said, "some" border crossers detained by the Border Patrol originated in terrorist states. By phone, she said the majority of OTM apprehensions have long involved people from Central America. Also to our inquiry, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor expert on immigration, questioned Perry’s claim, emailing us charts he made indicating that over the past decade, apprehensions of individuals from non-terrorist states have far outnumbered individuals from terrorist-linked nations. See Massey’s charts here. "Apprehensions of nationals from potential terrorist nations are not increasing," Massey said. Our ruling Speaking of a flood of immigrants from countries other than Mexico being apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border, Perry said, "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." The latest available data show that less than 5 percent of "other than Mexican" apprehensions in the last two completed federal fiscal years involved people from U.S.-designated terrorist states or safe havens. Perry, in contrast, placed all such people being apprehended by U.S. border officials into that category, a conclusion neither the governor or the agency described as his source backed up with evidence.

pomt-11177	"The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/may/22/david-rouzer/congressman-deal-ensured-iran-could-hit-us-nuclear/	Most congressional Republicans applauded as President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement. Among them was Rep. David Rouzer, a Republican from southeastern North Carolina. Rouzer argued (accurately) on Twitter that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism. But then he went a step further. "The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US," Rouzer tweeted on May 8. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com PolitiFact has heard and reported on a lot of rhetoric surrounding the Iran deal, an agreement signed in 2015 by Iran, the United States, and other nations and championed by former President Barack Obama. In Rouzer’s claim about a nuclear bomb "capable of reaching the U.S.," the word "guaranteed" stands out to us. We contacted Rouzer’s office and asked for evidence to support his claim. His staffer, Danielle Smotkin, referenced three people’s comments to support the congressman’s claim: In an April 2015 interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was developing intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the United States. In an August 2015 interview with an Iranian news outlet, a member of Iran’s negotiating team said Iran expected to reach "complete industrial (uranium) enrichment" eight years after the deal. In October 2017, Iranian Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari said Iran’s missiles can hit U.S. forces and interests within 2,000 kilometers, which is 1,200 miles. About that missile range: That means Iran is capable of reaching U.S. interests in the Middle East, but isn’t capable of striking the United States mainland — 7,200 miles away. (PolitiFact has written before about how likely it is that Iran will develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.) The Iran deal, officially titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on how much uranium Iran can enrich until 2030. How it works As part of the deal, Iran drastically limited its ability to build a weapon by giving up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile when it signed the deal. Iran could also build a weapon with plutonium, but the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one. Some of the deal’s terms last forever, including a ban on nuclear weapon design and manufacturing. The Additional Protocol, separate inspection guidelines for the International Atomic Energy Agency, improves international oversight of nuclear fuel. It also allows broader inspections, such as collecting environmental samples at any location to detect radioactive materials. "In fact, the text of the JCPOA explicitly states that ‘under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons’," said Elena Chachko, coordinator of Harvard’s Empirical Legal Studies Series and a doctoral student at its law school. So the deal, on paper, restricts Iran from building nuclear weapons. And so does an agreement among about 190 countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, Chachko said. "As a non-nuclear-weapon state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is banned from acquiring nuclear weapons under international law regardless of the JCPOA," she said. A broader point David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security, suggested that the public not judge Rouzer’s words in the literal sense. He agreed with Rouzer’s broader point that, years from now, Iran could have enough materials to secretly build a nuclear bomb. The Iran deal "kicked the can down the road and did not settle the question of Iran building nuclear weapons," he said. Ian Williams, managing editor of Missile Threat, a product of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed. "The deal does not completely block the path" toward a nuclear bomb, Williams said. "On a very fundamental level, it leaves them everything they would need," he said. However, the Iran deal "definitely made it harder" to make a bomb. However, "the tweet is inaccurate. It makes it seem like, in 10 years, we will give them a nuclear weapon," Williams said. Our ruling Rouzer tweeted that the Iran deal "ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US." For one thing, the deal didn't promise Iran a nuclear weapon. In fact, language in the deal — and in the separate Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — bans Iran from possessing such a weapon. Experts acknowledge the deal didn't necessarily prevent Iran from getting the bomb — but said it made it more difficult. Further, Iran is currently limited to missile strikes within a 1,200-mile range, not nearly far enough to reach the United States. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12515	Says Eric Trump said, "My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/25/democraticmomscom/fake-news-story-claims-eric-trump-said-donald-trum/	A fake Internet post on a website filled with extremely left-leaning stories quoted Eric Trump as saying President Donald Trump was going to end taxes for the rich, making the release of his father’s tax returns irrelevant. The headline on an April 17, 2017, post on DemocraticMoms.com read, "Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway.’" The story was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news. The post focuses on Donald Trump’s past promise to release his tax returns, referring to a tweet he sent out on April 16: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com DemocraticMoms.com cites a fake interview Eric Trump supposedly gave with "KXYL Radio." The post reads: "Eric argued that Trump’s tax return is ‘irrelevant,’ largely because ‘he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.’ He said, ‘When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.’" The post goes on, but we know it’s fake, because it steals its content almost entirely from an April 16 story on Politicalo.com. The site is related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." Stories on sites under the Newslo.com umbrella take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. It appears DemocraticMoms.com edited some of the details of the original post, such as deleting Politicalo.com’s reference to another April 16 Donald Trump tweet backing off his promise to label China a currency manipulator: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The headline also has been changed. The original on Politicalo.com read, "Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for "extra productive people" anyway.’" DemocraticMoms.com subbed in the word WEALTHY instead, IN ALL CAPS for extra effect. Otherwise, the story contains entire paragraphs of Politicalo.com’s story (Neither version notes that the radio interview is fake; Politicalo.com calls KXYL an Orlando station, but it’s based in Texas.) DemocraticMoms.com has a cryptic About Us description that says only that their "team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn’t even know you needed!" There was no apparent way to contact the site, but every post was steeped in anti-Trump fervor. No author information accompanies the profile that posted the article, either. DemocraticMoms.com was registered anonymously on Nov. 20, 2016, after Donald Trump was elected The owner is likely looking to capitalize on anti-Trump sentiment. In this case, it’s by posting a parody story and implying it’s real. It’s clear Eric Trump didn’t say his dad was going to end taxes entirely for anyone, rich or otherwise.

pomt-08158	Said Republicans made historic gains in state legislatures during last month’s election	true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/03/national-review/gop-made-historic-gains-state-level-year/	Just hours after the November election ended, the conservative journal National Review boasted online that the GOP had enjoyed a historic win. Not in Congress, but in state houses across the nation. That’s not a new story in Georgia, which elected its first Republican governor since Reconstruction in 2002. A few years later, both chambers of the state Legislature had GOP majorities. Those majorities increased in the 2010 election cycle, and a half-dozen lawmakers elected as Democrats on Nov. 2 have fled to the GOP in the election's aftermath. But nationally, did Republicans actually pick up historic ground in state legislatures in last month’s election as the National Review stated? PolitiFact Georgia checked with Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a guy who knows about as much about political shifts at the state level as anyone around. "It’s a much different landscape than it was prior to the election," Storey said. The Colorado-based Storey said Republicans gained 691 state legislative seats in the November election. Nationwide, they now hold 3,928 seats to 3,366 for Democrats. "It was definitely historic gains," he said in a telephone interview. "It’s the most GOP [state] legislators since 1928." Republicans had the momentum going into the election, he said, but some questioned whether the GOP could surpass its 1994 performance, when the GOP picked up 525 seats at the state level. They easily surpassed that number and saw the biggest party shift in legislative seats since 1966, Storey said. Some of the state pickups surprised even the experts. Minnesota, the same state that made Democrat Al Franken a U.S. senator in 2008, saw its Legislature taken over by the GOP. And the Michigan House of Representatives went Republican. The GOP tilt was even greater in the South, where state-level offices had been trending Republican for two decades. Still, when the election began, 14 legislative chambers in the South were controlled by Democrats and 14 by Republicans. When the dust cleared, 19 of the region’s 28 chambers were controlled by Republicans. The 2010 election cycle in the South represents a "historic tipping point," Storey said. For the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP holds a majority of chambers and seats. The online journal Politico recently ran the headline "Democratic South finally falls." The change has been going on for some time, writer Jonathan Martin noted in the article. "But what this year’s elections, and the subsequent party switching, have made unambiguously clear is that the last ramparts have fallen and political realignment has finally taken hold in the South’s last citadels of Democratic strength: the state houses," Martin wrote. Democrats lost both chambers of the legislatures in Alabama and North Carolina. Democrats now control both legislative chambers in just two Southern states, Arkansas and Mississippi. The realignment of power in the state legislatures can have enormous consequences. State lawmakers soon will begin the process of redrawing political boundaries, a process known as redistricting that occurs every 10 years. The party in power will obviously try to draw those lines to benefit itself, so the GOP romp of 2010 could have some real staying power. We rate the National Review claim of historic GOP gains as True.	None	National Review	None	None	None	2010-12-03T06:00:00	2010-11-03	['None']
pomt-04384	"President Barack Obama (is) the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/19/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-says-obama-cut-medicare-700-/	Claims about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, were staples of congressional campaigns in 2010. Many have resurfaced, or simply continued, in the 2012 federal elections. Several appear in a brochure sent to voters by the Ohio Republican Party in support of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Aimed specifically at seniors, the brochure says they can count on Romney, but not on President Obama, "the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion." If the claim has a familiar ring to it, it’s because it similar to others that PolitiFact has reviewed. But its continued use, including in the presidential and vice-presidential debates, makes it worth another look. The "cut" refers to an aspect of the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform known as Obamacare. There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the budget of Medicare, which operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number. What kind of spending reductions? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to continue to increase. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law. But it doesn’t reduce its overall budget. That’s why claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. And in the past, PolitiFact has rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. That CBO estimate is cited as the supporting source for the claim in the brochure, that Obama is "the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion." That claim is partially accurate. That amount refers to the savings expected from Obamacare’s reductions in growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals. Those savings were credited to the health care law to keep it from adding to the deficit. What the law does not do, as the claim implies, is chop $700 billion that was already allocated to Medicare for its programs.. One other point worth noting: The changes that lead to the projected savings are a result of legislation that was approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Obama -- not as a result of an executive order or decision Obama made individually in his administration. Those are important details that give context to the statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Ohio Republican Party’s claim rates Half True.

pomt-00543	Says Hillary Clinton "insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ "	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/17/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-hillary-clinton-said-progressive-age/	As he tries to appeal to religious conservatives, Jeb Bush has portrayed Hillary Clinton as the enemy of those who believe in religious freedom. "These have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience, and the leading Democratic candidate hinted of more to come," Bush said during his announcement speech at Miami Dade College on June 15. "Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ That is what she said. That is what she said. And I guess we should at least thank her for the warning." So is that what she actually said about the need for religious beliefs to change? We looked at when and where she made her comments, and found Bush is taking her words out of context. Clinton’s Women in the World speech A spokesman for Bush confirmed that he was referring to a comment Clinton made during her speech at the Women in the World Summit in New York City on April 23. (And he’s attacked her speech previously.) In the section Bush referred to, Clinton raised concerns about lack of access to education for girls, the rate of maternal mortality and domestic violence, and reproductive health care. It’s in that context she made the claim about religion: "Yes, we’ve nearly closed the global gender gap in primary school, but secondary school remains out of reach for so many girls around the world. Yes, we’ve increased the number of countries prohibiting domestic violence, but still more than half the nations in the world have no such laws on the books, and an estimated one in three women still experience violence. Yes, we’ve cut the maternal mortality rate in half, but far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed. As I have said and as I believe, the advancement of the full participation of women and girls at every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the 21st century, and not just for women but for everyone — and not just in far away countries but right here in the United States." Bush’s campaign referred to news articles about her speech including one in New York magazine which stated "the speech had other double meanings that show fiery rhetoric geared toward a group of mostly progressive women." The headlines from conservative media that we found such as Fox News focused on abortion: "Hillary: ‘Religious beliefs’ must change for sake of abortion." Clinton, who is a supporter of abortion rights, didn’t use the word abortion, but she did mention "reproductive health care," which can include abortion as well as birth control or prenatal health care. But her statement is somewhat different from Bush’s claim. She didn’t say that a "progressive agenda" should dictate religious beliefs -- her overall point was that countries need to do more to help protect women’s rights to education, health care, and to live safely -- and that to do so requires enforcing laws and changing religious beliefs. Clinton’s speech didn’t only pertain to far flung countries -- she was making a statement to religious conservatives in the United States. "America moves forward when all women are guaranteed the right to make their own health care choices, not when those choices are taken away by an employer like Hobby Lobby," she said. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies with religious objections can opt out of a mandate under the Affordable Care Act to provide free contraception to their employees. "One would like to imagine that Clinton was speaking only about primitive cultures where children are forced into marriage and childbearing, or where genital cutting is common," wrote Kathleen Parker, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post. "But we know that she also meant religious conservatives closer to home whose beliefs get in the way. She explicitly criticized Hobby Lobby for not paying for its employees’ contraception." Clinton’s spokesman told PolitiFact that Bush took her remarks out of context. "Hillary Clinton was talking about atrocities and horrible practices around the world that are carried out against women and girls in the name of deep-seated cultural codes and religious beliefs," Josh Schwerin said. "If any candidate thinks rape, child marriage and genital mutilation -- done in the name of deeply held religious beliefs -- should be allowed to continue, they should say so directly and not try to make it into a false political attack." Our ruling Bush said, "Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ " During a speech about women’s rights worldwide in April, Clinton talked about the rates of maternal mortality, domestic violence, lack of access to education and "reproductive health care." She said that laws must be enforced to protect those rights "and deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed." So the only area where she says beliefs must change that has any possible connection to domestic issues is in the reference to the overall category of reproductive health. Bush is making Clinton’s remarks sound far more sweeping than they actually are. Clinton was talking about specific issues affecting women’s health and safety, in both a global and domestic context.

pomt-09234	On the Arizona immigration law.	half flip	/florida/statements/2010/may/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-position-arizona-immigration-law/	With controversy swirling around Arizona's new hard-line immigration law, U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio if often asked about the bill. But his answers have seemed inconsistent. We decided to put his comments to our Flip-O-Meter. The law, generally speaking, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. On April 27, 2010 in front of a largely Cuban-American crowd in West Miami, Rubio likened Arizona's bill to the creation of a "police state," saying the American people wouldn't be comfortable with people being required to have documents on them at all times proving their citizenship status. Then on April 30, he told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that didn't believe the Arizona law was "the best answer to that problem." But in an interview with a conservative blogger nine days later, Rubio said he would've voted for the measure. The seeming flip, the Rubio campaign contends, is because of late changes inserted into the immigration bill. "Marco's position has been consistent," campaign spokesman Alex Burgos said. "It's the law that has changed since his first comments on it.'' Let's check it out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What Rubio said on April 27 in West Miami "I think the law has potential unintended consequences and it's one of the reasons why I think immigration needs to be a federal issue, not a state one.' "Everyone is concerned with the prospect of the reasonable suspicious provisions where individuals could be pulled over because someone suspects they may not be legal in this country. I think over time people will grow uncomfortable with that ... I've always said I think the ultimate solution is to create a technologically based system where employers can verify the eligibility of the folks they are employing." When Rubio was asked specifically about immigrants being required to produce documents at a moment's notice, the son of Cuban exiles said, according to the Miami Herald, "That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state.'' What Rubio said on Fox News April 30 "I don't believe that law is the best answer to that problem." Later, Rubio said, "There are portions of the law that over time may lead to unintended consequences." What Rubio said to a Human Events reporter in a story published May 6 "Understand that what Arizona is facing is different from anything Florida has ever faced," Rubio told Human Events' Jason Mattera. "Arizona has a physical border with Mexico. And there (are) kidnappings, human trafficking, drug wars coming across that border into an American city. Frankly, very few states in the country can imagine what that’s like." Human Events, a conservative publication, asked if Rubio were in the Arizona Legislature, would he have voted for the law? "The second (version) that passed hit the right note. Yes," Rubio responded. The interviewer then asked about the first version. "Well, I would have wanted to see changes like the ones that were made because I know that that’s not the intent of the bill." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PolitiFact has thoroughly explored the Arizona immigration bill and the changes inserted in the final days of the regular session of the Arizona Legislature. We rated two claims after the first version of the bill passed and another two claims after the second version passed. The original version of the bill was signed into law by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23. One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by "racial profiling" -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning. Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges. The new version of the law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." The prior version had said that an official "may not solely consider race" in such circumstances. Rubio, in his comments in West Miami, said he was particularly concerned about under what circumstances law enforcement officials in Arizona could stop people to inquire about their citizenship status. He said the changes in the bill had quelled those concerns. "I mean no one is in favor of a bill that would force American citizens to have to interact with law enforcement in a way that wasn’t appropriate," Rubio said in the Human Events interview. "And the first bill I thought held that door open. Since then, the changes that have been made to the bill I think greatly improve it." But legal scholars say the door to some form of racial profiling remains open despite the changes in the law. Specifically, there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1975 ruled in United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce that U.S. Border Patrol could stop and question people in vehicles about their immigration status based solely on their appearance. In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that "because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause." The Supreme Court decision seems to conflict with the Arizona law, and a separate federal appeals court that covers Arizona, and is likely to set up a legal fight. There's also a provision of the law that requires legal immigrants to carry documents confirming their legal status. Rubio was concerned about that in his comments in West Miami April 27. When asked specifically about immigrants having to carry documents on them, Rubio said "That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state." That part of the law, however, was not stripped out in the amended version. The Mexican government already has issued a travel alert to their citizens, directing them to use extreme caution if visiting Arizona. And the cities of Flagstaff and Tucson have said they will sue to challenge the new law, which could go into effect in July or August. The bill has been criticized by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: "I think it creates unintended consequences,” he told Politico. “It's difficult for me to imagine how you're going to enforce this law. It places a significant burden on local law enforcement and you have civil liberties issues that are significant as well.” We also should note that the changes, though made to sway critics of the original bill, did little to alter the vote totals in the Arizona Legislature. In fact, no one in the 60-member state House or the 30-member Senate voted against the first version of the immigration bill and in favor of the replacement bill. Rubio has suggested he would have voted against the first version of the bill, equating it to a "police state," and said he would have voted for the second bill. That would have made him an anomaly in the Arizona Legislature. Rubio has outlined two basic concerns about the bill -- the possibility of racial profiling and the fact that people would be required to produce immigration documents at a moments notice. He has explained that his remarks changed because he was satisfied with the altered bill. That indeed is supported by the changes in the bill on the possibility of racial profiling, but it still does not explain his concerns on producing documents and the risk of a "police state," because it is not addressed by the revised bill. So we rate his change a Half Flip.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-05-12T16:51:43	2010-05-06	['Arizona']

pomt-03058	"Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/03/blog-posting/obama-declares-november-national-muslim-appreciati/	The headline flew around the conservative blogosphere: "Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month." The fact that it came from a website, National Report, known for Onion-like satire, didn’t stop some bloggers from reporting it as news. The piece was packed with fake details designed to press anti-Muslim buttons: President Barack Obama held a news conference to make his declaration. He said Muslims "are not all bad. In fact, most of them are good." His announcement was hailed by a "member of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party." He said he would work with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn U.S. citizenship. "Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us," he was reported to say. Following other attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim -- such as this one that we rated Pants on Fire -- the National Report’s gambit worked. "How dare Obama declare November, the month when we give thanks to God for our blessings and great nation, National Muslim Appreciation Month!" wrote a blogger for Tea Party Nation. The PolitiFact inbox saw email after email with links to such stories from readers who got it from outraged friends. Urban-legend debunker Snopes.com quickly confirmed that it originated with National Report. The headline was utterly invented, and the event was entirely fabricated. While we didn’t hear back from the White House, we found no evidence of any such proclamation at the White House website. We also asked Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "I’m fairly certain they haven’t. Otherwise, I would have heard about it," he said. Obama regularly commemorates Muslim holidays alongside Christian and Jewish ones. He’s proclaimed a Jewish American Heritage Month, a National Day of Prayer and a Religious Freedom Day, noting, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, Sikhs and non-believers." He has declared heritage months for Irish-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean-Americans and Hispanics. He has proclaimed a month for appreciation of African-American music. But nothing about Muslims. As for Obama’s purported proclamation, the Tea Party Nation blogger posted an update to her outrage: "Just found out this article was a hoax. They sure fooled me. However, my comments still stand if O should ever do such a thing." Our ruling Bloggers posted a claim that the president had declared November "National Muslim Appreciation Month."

pomt-11457	California’s single-payer healthcare proposal would "force seniors off of Medicare."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/mar/08/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosas-claim-sb-562-will-force-seniors-medi/	Would seniors in California really be forced off Medicare by the single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom? That’s the allegation from former Los Angeles Mayor and fellow Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, Newsom’s top rival in the crowded gubernatorial campaign. Two other Democrats and two Republicans are also vying to succeed termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. At issue is Healthy California, or Senate Bill 562, introduced last year by Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara. It would establish one central government health insurance provider to cover all Californians. Supporters say the plan would save money by eliminating the need for private insurance and reduce prescription drug costs. But even some who back the idea question how the key details will work, including how to pay for it. The bill passed the State Senate last year but was shelved in the Assembly, where Speaker Anthony Rendon called it "woefully incomplete." Heated issue Despite stalling out, the plan has become among the most debated issues in the governor’s race. Newsom has offered support for SB 562, though he’s been nuanced about it. He has been attacked by other Democratic gubernatorial candidates, chiefly Villaraigosa, for backing a proposal that’s still light on details. In turn, the California Nurses Association and National Nurses United, which supports Newsom, has called Villaraigosa’s claims "fear mongering" and "disgracefully intended to alarm seniors about their Medicare coverage." Here’s Villaraigosa’s claim about the plan in a March 5, 2018 press release: "Newsom calls any attempt to demand details of his $200 billion tax increase and plan to force seniors off of Medicare as ‘defeatist.’ I call refusing to say how you will successfully persuade Californians to more than double their taxes while taking away their Medicare simply deceptive." This is not the first time Villaraigosa has made some version of the claim, and lumped Newsom in with it. "Seniors have earned the right to Medicare as we know it. We should start the discussion with protecting this effective single-payer system, not with the Newsomcare plan to demolish it," Villaraigosa said in a campaign email on Jan. 25, 2018. Villaraigosa again criticized SB 562 at a gubernatorial candidates forum in Sacramento on March 8, 2018, saying: "It would end Medicare as we know it. … Everybody that has an insurance program would be off of it." Villaraigosa added that he still favors a single-payer system "in concept," just not this specific bill. In this fact check, we focused on Villaraigosa’s claim the plan would force seniors off Medicare. We’ll save an examination of whether the plan is really a $200 billion tax increase for another time. Visit PolitiFact California's Tracking the Truth series here to see all of our 2018 governor's race fact-checks. Our research Health policy experts told us there’s a lot of uncertainty about what the single-payer proposal will do, if it’s ever passed. They said Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate to a point, but also leaves out much of the story. The text of the bill says it would honor the rules and benefits of federal health plans such as Medicare, which covers more than 5 million Californians. "I think it is correct to say that the bill aspires to fold Medicare into the California single payer, Healthy California," Joy Melnikow, director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, said in an email. Laurence Baker, professor of health research and policy at Stanford University, added: "It’s probably technically correct to say it (SB 562) intends to get rid of Medicare. It’s also fair to say we don’t know what it would be replaced with." Partially true? Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, agreed there’s some truth to Villaraigosa’s claim. "I would rate this assertion by Villaraigosa as partially true. SB 562 would replace Medicare with a more comprehensive state program that would make Medicare beneficiaries better off, because it would be more inclusive than Medicare, and dramatically reduce out-of-pocket payments for supplement insurance and deductibles and copayments. The press release uses negative language to describe this change, which in my opinion is misleading," Kominski said in an email. All three expressed a degree of skepticism that the federal government would allow California to incorporate Medicare recipients into a statewide single-payer plan. "Whether a federal waiver would be granted to do this is speculative," Melnikow wrote. Evidence from Villaraigosa We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence supporting the claim. A spokesman responded with links to news articles that describe the plan and issued the following statement, which adds a bit more detail than the initial claim that caught our attention: "Under SB 562, California seniors would no longer receive healthcare through Medicare. All federal funds currently going towards Medicare beneficiaries in California will be redirected to an unknown, state-run plan." Villaraigosa has challenged Newsom to an in-depth debate on the single-payer proposal. Response from Newsom In a statement, Newsom’s spokesman rejected the idea that the candidate supports any plan that would harm Medicare coverage: "It’s outright fiction to suggest Gavin Newsom would ever advocate for a reduction in Medicare coverage. He will never support a bill that ends Medicare for anyone -- full stop. Gavin strongly believes we need to double down on Medicare in California and was the first candidate in this race to support a federal Medicare for All bill. Under a Newsom state health plan, anyone eligible for Medicare would keep their Medicare, and Gavin will fight hard to guarantee comprehensive health care for anyone not covered under Medicare." Newsom’s spokesman added that the lieutenant governor supports SB 562 moving through the legislative process, noting that changes will take place as it advances. The bill’s author, State Sen. Ricardo Lara, said SB 562 would "equal or exceed the coverage" of Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, through his spokesman. Our ruling Candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed a single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom would force seniors off Medicare. That plan, also known as SB 562 or Healthy California, proposes to create one central government health insurance provider in the state by folding in all other plans, including federal coverage such as Medicare. So, in this sense, Villaraigosa has a point. If successful, the plan would eliminate Medicare in the state and create a brand new, untested system. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, ignores the fact that the single-payer proposal at least intends to honor all rules and benefits under Medicare and improve upon the system. His statement gives the impression that seniors would be forced off Medicare and left without healthcare, which is far from the plan’s stated goal. Notably, California would need federal approval to bring Medicare and other federal plans into its new system. Experts say this approval is, at best, a long-shot. Newsom, the frontrunner in the race for governor, has expressed support for SB 562, though he’s said it’s not complete and still needs to move through the legislative process. In the end, there is much that’s unknown about the California proposal, including whether it will ever pass the Legislature. What we do know is that Villaraigosa’s statement about taking away Medicare is partially accurate, but leaves out key context and tells only part of the story. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08116	In 2007, "the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," which is "more than the entire bottom 50 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-viral-speech-says-top-1-percent-ear/	On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests from readers to fact-check it, we decided to do just that. We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil. Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans. "Mr. President, in the year 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," Sanders said. "The top 1 percent earned 23.5 percent of all income--more than the entire bottom 50 percent. That is apparently not enough. The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent has nearly tripled since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent earned about 8 percent of all income. In the 1980s, that figure jumped to 14 percent. In the late 1990s, that 1 percent earned about 19 percent." To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that "the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," which is "more than the entire bottom 50 percent." When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, "Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)." We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent "has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007." An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007. In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us. Still, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere. One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said. Another study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said. The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of "income" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. "There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes," he said. So, we're left with three studies that vary slightly but which all point in the same general direction -- showing the top 1 percent earning between 21.4 and 23.5 percent of the national income in 2007. The studies also show that this share exceeds what the entire bottom 50 percent of the United States earns. So we rate Sanders' statement True.

pomt-01418	"According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/08/morgan-brittany/did-washington-tell-responders-prep-ebola-months-a/	As if Ebola were not frightening enough in its own right, it is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. One of the latest comes from Morgan Brittany, a former actress from the original television soap opera Dallas who is now a commentator with the conspiracy-minded blog WND. Brittany suggests that Ebola is part of a larger White House plan to control the nation. Brittany’s column describes a Los Angeles dinner party where the conversation turned grim. "One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic," Brittany wrote. "According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that’s just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened." A few months ago, we debunked that last eyebrow-raising bit about the government being behind the surge of undocumented children at the border. Now, we examine whether something called "the Disaster Assistance Response Team" was told to get ready for an outbreak of Ebola. Brittany’s column provided a link to Global Research, another conspiracy website. Global Research had its own alarming article. "A large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in ‘high risk events’ says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Golden State FIRE EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen." Global Research even had a screenshot of the Twitter exchange from Sept. 30, and indeed, there we found, "DART teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October. Timing seems weird. Source: current DART member." The tweets are authentic. What’s lacking is anything of substance behind them. We spoke to Ed Castillo, president of Golden State FIRE EMS. Castillo was regretful. "A couple of EMS guys were talking about conspiracy theories," Castillo said. "There are no facts to support it. It can be written off as a couple of guys shooting the breeze." Golden State is based in Woodland Hills, Calif. Among other services, it contracts with Hollywood film companies to have a medical team on hand when they shoot stunt sequences. Castillo said the company’s only goal now is to "extinguish the flames" and stop hearing from conspiracy theorists. "These guys came out of the woodwork left and right," Castillo said. "We had to tear down our Twitter account. Now we’re just sticking to Facebook and our Web page. We just want to get back to work." The Golden State tweets might have been vacuous blather taken as reality, but the Global Research and Brittany posts went beyond even what the tweets said. Their reference to a "large government supplier of emergency response products" seems to have greatly reimagined Golden State’s line of work. To write about "the Disaster Assistance Response Team" as a singular entity also seems odd. Such a name applies generically to any group that jumps in to help in a disaster. Brittany doesn’t write definitively that these theories are accurate but closed her article on a note of fear. "Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over." Our ruling Brittany passed along as fact that a government supplier knew that emergency responders had been told well in advance to get ready for Ebola. The rumor was based on tweets from a private California medical and safety services company, which now says the tweets were based on nothing. The reckless use of implausible assertions earns this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Morgan Brittany	None	None	None	2014-10-08T17:34:31	2014-10-07	['None']
pomt-07013	On repeal of Wisconsin's smoking ban	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-repeal-wisconsins-smoking-ban/	It’s been a year since you could light up a smoke in Wisconsin bars and restaurants. The state’s smoking ban, approved by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2009, took effect in July 2010 and continues to stir debates. Some tavern and restaurant owners say it’s hurt their business and driven away long-time patrons -- or sent them outside to shiver. Others say state government shouldn’t be mandating what businesses can and can not do. Meanwhile, smoking ban supporters are pleased they can have a beer or a meal and not go home smelling like an ashtray. On June 30, 2011, as the ban’s first anniversary approached, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement that said he would not support a repeal of the ban. That sounded like a new stance from the conservative Republican governor. So, we decided to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent politicians have been on key issues. Remember: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective. Indeed, on contentious issues, some will view a switch as sensible flexibility in response to constituent demands. Others will see it as political appeasement or caving to pressure. As they say, where you stand depends on where you sit. In this case, perhaps, especially if you sit at the bar. Here is the sum total of Walker’s statement: "Although I did not support the original smoking ban, after listening to people across the state, it is clear to me that it works. Therefore I will not support a repeal." What did Walker say about the smoking ban in the past? While a candidate for governor, Walker was opposed to the ban, and then his position shifted -- to being even more strongly opposed to it. The shift came in response to positions staked out by Mark Neumann, his opponent in the Republican primary election. Here’s how that played out: Walker said on July 6, 2010, that he would didn’t believe that government should have been involved. "On principle I don’t think the government or anybody else should be telling these establishments or anybody else what they should or shouldn’t do," he said. A few days later, Neumann said he supported repealing the ban: "The smoking ban to me is a local issue and it’s about personal responsibility and personal freedoms and local control." The following day, on July 10, 2010, Walker matched Neumann’s call for a repeal of the ban: "I don't think the government should have been involved in a smoking ban in the first place, and as governor, I would sign a repeal of this law." The smoking ban did not become a key issue during the primary campaign or the general election. And Walker did not made any additional statements about the ban until the one where he said he would not back its repeal. Studies by groups such as the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center said that air quality in state bars and restaurants had improved 92 percent since the ban took effect. And SmokeFree Wisconsin, a group that supported the ban, said 75 percent of state residents support the ban. So, Walker started out opposed to the ban, even toughening his stance to promise a repeal. But now he’s opposed to a repeal, so the ban will remain. For those scoring at home, that comes in as a Full Flop.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-07-07T09:00:00	2011-06-30	['Wisconsin']

pomt-03726	The Internal Revenue Service spent $60,000 on a "Star Trek" training video.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/15/tom-graves/congressman-finds-no-humor-irs-star-trek-parody/	Video. The final frontier for some federal workers. A group of Internal Revenue Service employees went where few had gone before by creating a video in which they dressed as "Star Trek" characters. The video was intended for training purposes. When word got out about the video, particularly that tens of thousands of dollars were spent on it, many said the IRS workers should not have gone there. The critics included a Georgia congressman. "Next time anyone (@barackobama) says they need to raise your taxes, send them this IRS star trek video -- cost you $60k," U.S. Rep. Tom Graves posted on his Twitter page. PolitiFact Georgia went on a mission to see whether the North Georgia Republican was correct. Thankfully, our search for the facts didn’t take as much time as Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and their crew spent on the Starship Enterprise. CBS News filed a federal Freedom of Information Act to get a copy of a 6-minute video of IRS employees in "Star Trek" gear decrying various tax evasion schemes. Here’s how the video began: "Space: the final frontier These are the voyagers of the Starship Enterprise Y Its never-ending mission is to seek out new tax forms To explore strange new regulations To boldly go where no government employee has gone before." The video ends with the crew heading from space back to Earth to pick up a "tax gap vaccine." Many news organizations quickly picked up on the story. The video was made in 2010. William Shatner, who starred as Capt. James T. Kirk in the television series, was not pleased about it. "So I watched that IRS video. I am appalled at the utter waste of US tax dollars," Shatner posted on Twitter. This was not the only video. In 2011, some IRS workers dressed as characters from the campy 1960s television series "Gilligan’s Island" for another training video. Combined, the IRS said two videos cost $60,000. Couldn’t Thurston Howell III at least put up the money for the "Gilligan’s Island" video? Some news organizations, however, reported just the "Star Trek" video cost $60,000. Graves’ tweet did not mention the "Gilligan’s Island" video. PolitiFact Georgia contacted the congressman’s office to see whether it was aware of the other video. We were told the best person to talk to about it was Graves’ spokesman, John Donnelly, who was out of the country for a week and temporarily unavailable for comment. We caught up with Donnelly when he returned. He explained that the office saw some of the errant media reports and headlines and based its tweet on them. "IRS admits $60,000 'Star Trek' parody video a mistake," was the headline of an NBCNews.com story. The article reported the existence of both videos and noted they cost a combined $60,000. The vast majority of news outlets reported $60,000 was spent on both videos. In a statement, Donnelly reiterated the congressman’s concerns about how taxpayer dollars were spent. "The fact that the IRS used even 1 cent of someone’s hard-earned paycheck to make these bizarre videos is a horrific abuse of public funds and an embarrassing illustration of what happens when bureaucracies are bloated by billions of dollars in deficit spending," Donnelly said. "Pause for a moment and consider that your tax dollars were used to pay for props like replica Spock ears, and think about how the IRS spent well over Georgia’s median household income to create these exorbitant spoofs -- it is absolutely shameful." The IRS contends there was a cost benefit to the "Gilligan’s Island" video. The video "was used to train taxpayer assistance employees in approximately 400 locations across the United States, saving an estimated $1.5 million as compared to the potential costs to train these employees in person," acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller wrote in a letter to U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., chairman of a House oversight subcommittee. Some news outlets reported that the "Star Trek" video cost more than the "Gilligan’s Island" video. The IRS did not respond to our follow-up question concerning the cost of each video. To sum up, Graves posted on Twitter that the IRS spent $60,000 on a training video in which some of its employees were dressed as "Star Trek" characters. The IRS says that video and another cost a combined $60,000. Graves’ statement was based on inaccurate news coverage. Most news organizations, though, got it right. The congressman’s claim is partially accurate. The IRS did spend a lot of taxpayer money on a "Star Trek" video. But Graves’ claim omits some important context, primarily that the $60,000 is inflated since that price tag covered two questionable videos. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-01360	"I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/20/ernest-almonte/treasurer-candidate-ernest-almonte-says-he-was-spe/	Next to jobs and the economy, public employee pensions have been among the biggest issues in many 2014 political campaigns. Ernest Almonte, an independent running for general treasurer, was asked during an interview that aired Oct. 5, 2014 on the second half of WLNE's "On the Record" whether the 2011 overhaul of Rhode Island’s state pension system went far enough. "First of all," Almonte said, "I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago, warning elected officials that if you didn't take care of this problem, it would take draconian measures" to fix it. As a "matter of fact," he said, "it got to the point of saying that, 'If you're not going to fix this, you should start, (instead of) sending your children and grandchildren birthday cards and Christmas cards, you should just send them invoices and just tell them the truth: You're passing on your debt to them,' So something had to be done." We wondered whether Almonte, who served as Rhode Island's Auditor General from 1994 to 2010, was prescient enough to be warning about problems with Rhode Island’s public pension systems 17 years ago, and what kinds of reforms he was saying were needed. Almonte’s campaign sent us several documents from the auditor general's office. Only a few go back to late 1990s and the relevant ones dealt with pension payment problems in individual communities, not state employees. One was a 1998 letter to Coventry's treasurer saying that some of the town's pension plans "have insufficient assets to meet projected benefits." That was 16 years ago. Another was a 1998 copy of a report by the Johnston Financial Review Commission, which Almonte chaired, warning that the town owed $3.2 million in required pension contributions for its employees. For example, Johnston hadn't paid into the firemen's pension fund for more than three years, putting it more than $1.3 million behind in its payments. We note that Almonte's comments in both of these reports are in dry auditor language. Some readers might not take that as the type of scary warning that Almonte says he made. But we also found a May 8, 1988 front-page Providence Journal story reporting how Almonte explained to more than 200 Johnston residents that their town was in deep financial trouble. "To drive home the severity of the situation," the story said, "Almonte gave examples that sometimes made the audience wince: A bottom-of-the-barrel credit rating. A time between April 1996 and March 1997 when the town's bank account was overdrawn for 146 days. Falling behind $3.19 million in required pension contributions for workers. "And that's not all, Almonte said. Still to be reckoned with is an unfunded pension liability that hasn't been quantified, and could add up to untold millions," the story reported. Almonte's campaign also referred us to a March 1999 report, available on the Auditor General's website, for the 1997 fiscal year. It notes that "five school districts, five municipalities and three police and fire units were delinquent" to the tune of about $1.7 million in their pension payments. The state withheld school aid and traffic fine payments to six municipalities until they paid up. That was 15 years ago. If Almonte wasn't warning about a looming crisis in the state pension system in those days, that's because there wasn't one. His 2000 audit of the state Employees' Retirement System, covering the fiscal year that ended in 1999, reported that the funded ratios -- the amount of money each plan had compared to the amount of money it was expected to need to cover its pension costs -- had been growing steadily for years. The ratio for state employees, for example, went from 73 percent in 1993 to 81 percent in 1998. In addition, all the plans had been getting the recommended amount of funding since at least 1996 and, in many cases, even longer. That would change. By 2006, the funded ratio for that plan had dropped to 55 percent. By 2009, it had only gone up to 59 percent and the debate about pension costs was poised to explode. We found no documentation from that era suggesting Almonte was advocating the type of sweeping changes to the separate pension plans for state employees and teachers that were pushed by General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and approved by the General Assembly and Governor Lincoln Chafee. In an interview, Almonte argued that he was talking about the state's pension problem at the time because late payments he was referring to were payments by cities and towns to the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System, also known as MERS, which is under the jurisdiction of the state treasurer. "Reform is not just what you to do an employee or an employee's benefits," he said. "I was advocating a reform of management" to get the communities to make their payments on time, especially when the money being withheld by workers to help pay for pension benefits is being retained by the city or town. "When payments are made late, you miss out on earnings, and that's the start of the problem because the problem compounds itself." Our ruling Ernest Almonte said, "I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago." The comment was in the context of a question on the state's pension system. It’s clear from documentation Almonte provided and information we found that Almonte was warning about problems years ago. But the documentation he could provide only dealt with problems in municipal plans, although some of those were in the MERS system run by the state. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-02924	"Rand Paul’s speech ... on 'Gattaca' was totally ripped off of Wikipedia."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/01/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-rand-pauls-gattaca-speech-was-t/	There’s no love lost between Rachel Maddow and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The MSNBC host for years has criticized the rising Republican star and libertarian during her evening talk show. So when Maddow went on a rant about a recent stump speech Paul gave on behalf of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, at first it seemed like business as usual. During remarks Oct. 28 at Liberty University, Paul ventured into a diatribe against eugenics -- a sensitive topic in Virginia, where until 1979 it was legal to sterilize the mentally disabled -- when he brought up the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law. It’s at that point Maddow said he got into trouble, claiming Paul’s comments about the movie were "totally ripped off of Wikipedia." "Rand Paul wants to be president," she added. "But right now he’s just lifting whole sections of this Wikipedia entry hoping that nobody’s going to notice and he can call it his speech." It’s not the first time a politician has been accused of (ahem) borrowing his words from someone else. But from Wikipedia? It seemed too sophomoric a slipup for someone like Paul, who filibustered for 13 hours straight on the Senate floor earlier this year without any accusations of lifting his remarks. It’s true the campaign trail isn’t the classroom, where copying and pasting from secondary sources is a fatal sin. But Paul is a major political player in Washington, and is considering a run for president in 2016. So a bold accusation like Maddow’s raised our eyebrow. Paul shrugged it off as a phony controversy ignited by Maddow, who he said has been "spreading hate on me for about three years now." "This is really about information and attacks coming from haters," Paul said. We’re more than familiar with the "haters gonna hate" defense, just as we fact-checkers know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Maddow’s scorn. But it was a serious enough claim that we decided to check it out anyway. What Wikipedia says We wanted to review the Gattaca Wikipedia page for ourselves. Any of the site’s users can edit entries as they see fit, meaning pages’ content changes frequently. But the pages’ edit histories are public, too, making it clear who added or changed which information and when. At first, we thought it might be possible that a reader edited the movie’s Wikipedia entry to match Paul’s speech after-the-fact. However, the history shows no change to the page between Sept. 25 and Oct. 29, the day after he stumped for Cuccinelli. Let’s check several examples of Paul’s words against the Sept. 25 version of the page: "In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common and DNA plays a primary role in determining your social class." The Wikipedia entry reads, "In ‘the not-too-distant future’, liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class." That looks nearly identical. "Due to frequent screenings, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way to achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut, is he has to become what’s called a ‘borrowed ladder.’ " Wikipedia: "Due to frequent screening, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut is to become a ‘borrowed ladder’, a person who impersonates a ‘valid’ with a superior genetic profile." That too is mostly identical, with a brief addition at the end. "He assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a world-class swimming star with a genetic profile said to be ‘secondary to none’ but he’s been paralyzed in a car accident." Wikipedia: "He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a former swimming star with a genetic profile ‘second to none’, who had been injured in a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down." Some of the wording here is different, but the sentence structure is strikingly identical. "Jerome buys his identity -- uses his DNA, his blood, his hair, his tissue, his urine -- to pass the screenings." Wikipedia: "Vincent ‘buys’ Jerome's identity and uses his 'valid' DNA in blood, hair, tissue, and urine samples to pass screening." Almost identical, but Paul mixed up the character names. Sensing a pattern? So are we. Paul was adamant there was no wrongdoing. Speaking on Oct. 30 to Fusion, a news and pop culture network aimed at young Hispanics, Paul insisted "nothing we said was not given attribution to where it came from" and the matter was a "disagreement on how you footnote things." "We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It’s a movie," Paul told Fusion. "I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie." In a statement to PolitiFact on Nov. 1, his office added: "While Sen. Paul doesn’t believe that this is the normal standard for speeches, going forward he will be more cautious in presenting and attributing sources." Experts weigh in Paul’s excuse doesn’t hold water, said Bob Lehrman, author of The Political Speechwriter’s Companion and a former speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore. "When I looked at the size of language and how closely he took it, I thought that was really inappropriate, and his defense of it shows he’s either desperate to shield something or he doesn’t understand plagiarism," he said. Lehrman, who also teaches a speech writing class at American University, says he tells his students lifting "even one distinctive phrase or sentence is plagiarism and is grounds for turning you in. It is absolutely inappropropriate." It’s happened before. Then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for president in 2008 when he was caught using a line uttered previously by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. It turned out to be a blip in the race. "People do it," Lehrman said. "That doesn’t mean it’s the right thing, and it’s not the right thing to take language and just use it in a speech without attributing it." Paul’s speech is a more serious offense than that of Obama’s 2008 gaffe, said Jonathan Bailey, the creator of Plagiarism Today, an online resource for writers to combat plagiarism. Obama forgot an attribution, one he remembered several other times, and acknowledged the error. "What gets me is not so much what happened," Bailey said. "What happened by itself is fairly mundane. All Paul had to do was apologize." But Paul claiming he credited the movie exacerbated his problem, since the movie itself wasn’t what he lifted from. "A little transparency, a little openness about what happened and why it’s not going to happen again would also go a long way," he said. Our ruling We’ll leave it to the prognosticators to determine how much impact Paul’s blunder will have on his political prospects, but the facts are pretty clear on this one. Maddow was dead on; Paul recited Gattaca’s Wikipedia page nearly word-for-word. We rate her statement True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2013-11-01T18:03:45	2013-10-28	['None']

pomt-05526	Says she balanced a $10 billion budget shortfall without raising taxes.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/11/elizabeth-ames-jones/elizabeth-ames-jones-says-she-balanced-10-billion-/	In an online video, Texas Senate hopeful Elizabeth Ames Jones says voters can count on her to oppose higher taxes. Jones, a former Texas railroad commissioner and legislator who’s among challengers to Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in the May 2012 Republican primary, opens her video: "Texans need a new state senator -- one who’s 100 percent committed to tackling our budget problems without raising your taxes -- and that’s what I’ve done." The ad’s narrator later says: "She was a leader, balancing a $10 billion budget shortfall in the Texas House -- $10 billion -- and she did it without raising your taxes." Wait: The House has 150 members -- and can’t pass a budget into law without the Senate and governor also signing off. That in mind, we inquired into how Jones balanced the budget referenced in her ad. Jones campaign spokesman Patrick Isenberg told us in a telephone interview that the claim ties to Jones voting in 2003 to balance the 2004-05 state budget in the face of a $10 billion revenue shortfall -- without raising taxes. At the time, too, Jones was a member of the budget-drafting House Appropriations Committee. Isenberg also passed along newspaper stories including an excerpt of a Jan. 12, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article quoting Jones saying that legislators should balance the budget without new taxes. "When an economy is slow, it's not really the time to initiate new taxes," the story quotes her as saying. As we noted in a May 2010 check of a shortfall-related claim by Gov. Rick Perry, the $10 billion figure reflects then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn’s grim forecast as the 2003 Legislature convened that state revenues for the 2004-2005 budget period would fall short of estimated expenditures by $7.4 billion. Add looming expenses — a health plan for local school district employees plus projected health and human services needs — and the state was facing a $9.9 billion state revenue shortfall, Strayhorn said. To cover the projected shortfall in the months remaining in the 2003 fiscal year, the Legislature trimmed $1.4 billion in budgeted state spending, while spending $450 million from the rainy day fund. But lawmakers also passed a 2004-2005 budget that appropriated $1.8 billion less in state funds than had been spent during 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. They added $811 million from the rainy day fund. And they used $1.3 billion in federal aid, part of fiscal relief made available to states in response to economic difficulties in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. Other steps: Members voted to extend a tax on telephone customers originally levied to pay for technology in schools and hospitals, raise fees for certain state services and use creative accounting to defer state payments to the next budget period.. So, the Legislature closed the $10 billion shortfall in 2003 via various mechanisms, none of them a tax increase. And Jones voted for the version of the budget advanced by the appropriations committee on April 7, 2003, according to an April 8, 2003 Express-News article poined out by Isenberg. That story quoted her as noting that the committee salvaged a slimmed-down Children's Health Insurance Program after a subcommittee recommended its abolition. Jones, describing the budget as frugal "belt tightening," was also quoted saying: "This is not a tea party." On April 17, 2003, Jones was among House members to vote for its version of the budget, House Bill 1, which went to the Senate by a 100-45 margin, the House Journal says. On June 1, 2003, she voted for the ultimate House-Senate compromise version, which went to Gov. Rick Perry by 105-41, according to the journal entry for that day, We asked an Austin consultant to Jones, Todd Olsen, to elaborate on how Jones led the state to the balanced budget without a tax increase. Olsen underscored her membership on the appropriations committee, where he said she heard hours of testimony. As to budget-related roles played by other lawmakers, the Senate and governor, Olsen said: "I think voters know there are 150 members in the House, and that there’s a governor and that there are three branches of government." He said too that Jones was the first woman elected to a leadership post in the House Republican Caucus. According to a Feb. 6, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article, Jones was elected vice chair of the House Republican Caucus in the 2003 session. Finally, Isenberg forwarded the script of what he described as a radio ad on the theme of the web video, which he said was also airing as a TV ad. In the radio ad, according to the script, Jones says she was a House member when she was a leader in balancing the budget without a tax increase. Our ruling Jones was among a select group of House members to draft the first version of the budget that she touts and ultimately voted, like most House colleagues, to send to the governor. Her video could easily have specified that Jones fought in the House for no new taxes and worked to make up a $10 billion shortfall. In contrast, it leaves the misimpression that "she did it," all of it, as if by herself. All told, her claim has a clear-cut element of truth, but ignores critical facts putting her role in perspective. We rate her statement Mostly False.

abbc-00282	"Under Labor, defence spending as a share of GDP dropped to its lowest level since 1938," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at a doorstop interview on February 24, ahead of the release of the Government's Defence White Paper.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-24/turnbull-defence-fact-check/7196360	Mr Turnbull's claim is not the full story. In the 1938-39 financial year, defence spending was 1.5 per cent of GDP. Under Labor in 2012-13, spending was 1.60 per cent of GDP, the lowest it has been since 1938. Under the Howard government, defence spending was 1.62 per cent — only 0.02 per cent higher — in 2002-03. But Mr Turnbull did not mention that defence spending also rose to 1.93 per cent of GDP under Labor in 2009-10, which was higher than at any time during the former Howard government and higher than it has been under the current Coalition Government. It is the highest figure since 1994-95, when Paul Keating was prime minister and defence spending as a share of GDP was 1.96 per cent. Whilst a share of GDP is commonly used by governments of all stripes to measure defence spending, GDP estimates are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to new economic data becoming available, whilst defence spending remains fixed after its final determination. This can arbitrarily affect the appearance of defence spending in any given year, and there is no way to predict whether the figures for 2002-03 and 2012-13 will be estimated as higher or lower than each other in future releases from the ABS, as more information comes to light which could alter GDP estimates. The Government itself has a policy of decoupling defence spending from GDP, as evidenced in the 2016 Defence White Paper, to address the problem of fluctuations due to revisions of GDP estimates.

pomt-03556	"We have a tax code that allows groups to use their political operations within the tax code, under the guise of a charity, to use undisclosed millions of dollars to do political campaigns."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/22/xavier-becerra/tax-code-allows-groups-spend-undisclosed-donations/	The fallout from the Internal Revenue Service’s tougher scrutiny of tea party groups continues with former IRS officials testifying that they never tried to mislead Congress about IRS practices. Republican senators like Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, were openly skeptical. "You lied by omission," Hatch said. President Barack Obama and Democrats have criticized the excesses of the IRS. But some would like to shift the focus to the legal ambiguity that allows some tax-exempt groups to engage in politics without revealing their donors, as formal campaign organizations must do. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra of California, promoted that line during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. "We have a tax code that allows groups to use their political operations within the tax code, under the guise of a charity, to use undisclosed millions of dollars to do political campaigns," Becerra said. We checked whether charities actually can engage in politics and the experts we reached were quite clear. If by charities, you mean groups with 501(c)(3) status, the law says they can’t. "If Rep. Becerra had used the term ‘tax-exempt organizations’ rather than the word ‘charities,’ his statement would be correct," said Brett Kappel, counsel at the Washington law firm Arent Fox. Kappel represented the Ron Paul 2012 campaign. "Charities are 501(c)(3) organizations and cannot engage in any partisan political activities," Kappel continued. "501(c)(4) social welfare organizations are tax exempt, but they are not charities. They can engage in partisan political activities as long as they are not the organization's primary activity." Becerra said his target was 501(c)(4) groups and notes that the tax code spells out that for such groups, their net income should be "devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes." "Charitable is another form of the word charity," Becerra told PolitiFact. "I used that word because Americans understand it and they associate it with something good, not groups that are in the business to do politics. If I had said 501(c)(4), they would have understood everything except that term." There are thousands of tax-exempt organizations that have the legal right to try to shape the course of legislative votes and elections. They could be a chamber of commerce, a child welfare organization that presses for certain legislation, or powerful political players like Crossroads GPS, founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Crossroads GPS spent $70 million on television ads and other media in the last election. For the curious, here’s how the rules breakdown for the different groups: • Charities - 501(c)(3): Donations are tax deductible; donors go unreported; no political activity allowed • Social Welfare - 501(c)(4): Donations are not tax deductible; donors go unreported; some political activity allowed. • Super PAC - 527 groups: Donations are not tax deductible; donors are reported; political activity allowed. Social Welfare Organizations IRS regulations define a social welfare organization as one that is "primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community, i.e., primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterment and social improvements." Since civic betterment is in the eye of the beholder, a group can form around virtually any cause. It can raise money to support its activities, and ever since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case, it has a relatively free hand to try to shape the outcomes of elections. Kenneth Gross is a former lawyer for the Federal Elections Commission and now heads the political law practice at the Washington firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. Gross says the Citizens United decision gave 501(c)(4) groups considerable leeway. "They can run ads that say don't vote for some candidate," Gross said. "They can go very strong, so long as they can say they are predominantly a social welfare organization." Gross noted that spending on campaign ads triggers the need to report the expenditures to the FEC, and to that extent, disclosure is part of the picture. Brad Smith, law professor at Capital University School of Law in Columbus, Ohio, says Becerra is wrong to ignore the FEC reporting. "We know how much (c)(4)’s spent, we know what they spent it on and what candidates they supported or opposed," Smith said. "All we don't know are the names of individual donors." But that Bercerra told us, was his point. Disclosure of donors, their names and the amounts they gave, is never required. This goes back to a 1958 Supreme Court ruling involving the NAACP. In that decision, the court said keeping membership lists private is essential to protecting the constitutional right to assemble. Becerra made his comments in the middle of a discussion about whether the public should know the backers of groups that intervene in politics. If a candidate, political party, an ordinary political action committee or a Super PAC raises money, it must report its donors. But not a 501(c)(4). So long as the group can argue that most of their other activities are aimed at nonpolitical social welfare goals, it can engage in hardcore political work. "This controversy is 100 percent about disclosure," Gross said. How much is too much The crunch point in the debate over 501(c)(4) organizations is the fuzziness over what percentage of their effort goes toward engaging in bare knuckles politics. IRS rules say such groups must be organized exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, but in terms of how much political work they do, the rules limit that only in a relative sense. The political effort can not be their "primary activity." The IRS does not define its terms. "Some lawyers say, so long as it’s 49.99 percent, it’s okay," said Gross. "But there is no percentage in the regulations." Allison Hayward, an attorney and a board member of the House Office of Congressional Ethics, says the IRS decides whether a group is following the rules based on a test that evaluates "facts and circumstances." "It is a test that doesn’t offer a lot of clarity," Hayward said. Our ruling Becerra said the tax code allows charities to spend undisclosed millions to do political campaigns. Becerra might have used the word "charities" too broadly to describe the tax-exempt organizations that rely on this wrinkle of the tax code. Becerra said he was trying to use language that most people would understand instead of the tax code’s technical term of a 501(c)(4) group. He’s right that these organizations can raise millions to engage in politics, and they need not reveal their donors. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court should follow the same confirmation process as the nominees of former President Barack Obama. In a Feb. 5 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, CNN host Jake Tapper asked if he would join an effort to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. "Look, Obama’s nominations required 60 votes," Sanders said. He continued, "Obama had to get 60 votes, that’s the rules of the United States. And if 60 people vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch, he will become the next nominee. That is the process, those are the rules that we operate under." We decided to fact-check Sanders’ claim that Obama’s Supreme Court nominees "had to get 60 votes." Sanders has a point, but he is somewhat overplaying what happened. Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor received more than 60 Senate votes, but Senate rules only require a simple majority to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. Sanders’ comment echoes similar claims from other high-ranking Democrats after Senate Republicans blocked Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture. A "cloture vote," agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes, the threshold Sanders has referenced. (His office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31. The last Supreme Court nominee to face a cloture vote to ensure confirmation was President George W. Bush’s nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006. After the cloture vote, Alito was confirmed 58-42. That means at least two senators decided to allow the vote to go forward without actually voting for Alito themselves. (In Alito’s case, it was more than two, as 72 senators voted for cloture.) The accuracy of Sanders’ statement hinges on which vote we are talking about. If the Senate doesn’t unanimously consent to voting on the nominee, then 60 votes are required to end debate and hold a confirmation vote. But the confirmation itself, strictly speaking, requires only a simple majority. Our ruling Sanders said Obama’s Supreme Court nominations "required 60 votes." Going into the nomination fight, Obama had to prepare for the possibility that his nominees would need 60 votes to support cloture, as Alito required during the Bush administration. But once the unanimous consent agreement or cloture was reached, all the nominees needed was a simple majority. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07676	"Since 1999, all Virginia Lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth for kindergarten through 12th grade."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/09/virginia-lottery/virginia-lottery-claims-all-profits-1999-have-gone/	With the Mega Millions jackpot up to $151 million, Virginians will be flocking to stores this week to buy lottery tickets. Of course, there’s no guarantee a Virginian will win. Forty-one states plus Washington, D.C. play the game and the chance of winning is almost 1 in 176 million for each dollar laid down. The Virginia Lottery encourages play by saying all of the profits it generates go to a good cause. "Since 1999, all Virginia lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth, for kindergarten through 12th grade," its website boasts. State politicians and officials have long debated whether all lottery profits really go to public schools. So we decided to take a look. But before we get to the numbers, it’s helpful to consider a thumbnail history of the Virginia Lottery. Voters approved it in 1987 and the first tickets were sold in 1988. During the first two years, lottery profits were set aside tor construction projects. During the 1991 recession, the proceeds were moved to the state’s general fund which supports K-12 schools, health and public safety. In 1995, the General Assembly was controlled by Democrats. Then-Gov. George Allen, a Republican, accused the Democrats of breaking long-standing promises to earmark every dollar of profits for education. Although news stories from the time say Allen did not provide proof of his claim, defensive lawmakers approved the Omnibus Education Act which required all lottery revenues sent to the general fund to be used only for public education. Many Republicans and educators denounced the bill as an election-year sham. That was because the $312 million in annual lottery profits at the time was one of many revenue sources flowing into the multi-billion dollar general fund. No one could say with certainty whether proceeds would up in education or another service. Think of it this way: when raindrops fall into a reservoir, can anyone pinpoint whose bathtub they fill? In 2000, the General Assembly asked voters to approve a state constitutional amendment that required lottery profits only be used for public education. The amendment was overwhelmingly approved. It established a Lottery Proceeds Fund to funnel lottery profits to education. The controversy was hardly settled, however. The new coffer was made part of the general fund. Again, it was impossible to trace a direct flow of lottery profits into public schools. Although state support for education increased over ensuing years, it’s impossible specify how much of the rise was caused by lottery profits and how much was caused by revenue surges from a variety of taxes that pour into the general fund. Walt Kucharski, Virginia’s long-time Auditor of Public Accounts, says he has always been able to confirm that state lottery officials have transmitted their profits to the general fund. But until three years ago, he could not verify that 100 percent of the lottery proceeds ended up in the K-12 budget. "Can I match it up dollar for dollar, serial number to serial number, the answer is no," Kucharski said. That changed in 2008 when the General Assembly, heeding advice from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell, separated the Lottery Proceeds Fund from the general fund. The action provided the direct pipeline that allowed Kucharski and others to trace the flow of lottery money into schools. Kucharski has no hesitation saying that since 2008, every penny of lottery profits has gone to public education. The state budget now lists line items that detail the allocations of the proceeds to specific education programs. This fiscal year, the Lottery is expected to contribute $436 million to the state’s $5.5 billion education budget. About two-thirds of the lottery money is earmarked for programs that help prepare four-year-olds from low income families to enter school, provide early reading intervention, provide breakfast for low-income students, and provide special education. John Hagerty, a lottery spokesman, noted that its always been up to the General Assembly to decide how to spend lottery profits. "The lottery makes the money and then hands it over to the state," Hagerty said. Let’s Review: The lottery says that since 1999, all of its profits have gone to support K-12 education. The claim has problems. Prior to 2008, the money went into the state’s general fund -- now totaling about $16 billion a year -- which supports major services such as health and public safety in addition to public schools. It was impossible to trace individual lottery profits into any specific program. Audits show lottery officials correctly transmitted all their proceeds to the state, but make no representations about how the money was specifically allocated. Since 2008, the state’s auditor of public accounts said that the profits go into their own separate fund and are distributed directly to localities for public education. The money is detailed in the state budget line items. Just as lottery officials can’t prove their claim that all lottery profits since 1999 have gone to education, nor we can we disprove it. The Lottery would lay aside doubts if it simply said all of its profits go to schools and didn’t mention a start date. We rate their claim Mostly True.

pomt-01863	The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act "would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact to fix our infrastructure and roads."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/11/monica-wehby/would-rebuild-america-jobs-act-have-cost-average-a/	Monica Wehby, a Portland pediatric neurosurgeon, is seeking to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat. The jabs they’ve traded so far include who would do a better job managing the economy. Wehby, a Republican, took Merkley to task for recently reiterating his support for the Rebuild America Jobs Act. The bill, proposed in late 2011 by President Barack Obama, called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. The act died when Democrats failed to rally enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. The claim: Wehby described Merkley’s vote for the act as "typical of a Washington insider like Senator Merkley." Then she added this: "I would have voted no because this legislation would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact to fix our infrastructure and roads." PolitiFact Oregon wondered about the cost figure and checked. The analysis: Wehby’s criticism of Merkley’s vote included the assertion that the "nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s own analysis of the bill identified the cost of this legislation for every Oregon family to be $958.40 per year…" We checked the CBO’s website to see if that’s what it found. No such figure appears in the CBO’s analysis of the Rebuild America Jobs Act. Instead, the one-page analysis estimated only that the act, if implemented, would have brought in $56.7 billion in revenues through taxes, while spending $56.5 billion for infrastructure projects. In other words, it would have been nearly revenue-neutral, according to the CBO. We emailed Wehby’s campaign. Her communications manager, Dean Petrone, wrote back saying that the $958.40-per-year figure "is backed up by Jim Harper, director of Information Policy Studies at the Cato Institute." We emailed Harper, who wrote that "it appears very likely" that Wehby got her number from WashingtonWatch, a policy analysis site he maintains in his spare time. (Harper, incidentally, said he considers WashingtonWatch to be a libertarian-leaning site.) Harper faulted Wehby’s claim on two counts. The first involved the $958.40 figure itself. In reality, he said, only half of that would come in the form of new taxes. The remainder really doesn’t count since it’s in the form of new spending. And while it could be argued that new spending amounts to a long-term debit, the CBO’s own finding that the bill was budget-neutral negates that point. His second point was that "average families" would not have borne the burden of any new costs because language in the bill made clear that it would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. "It’s important and relevant to many … that the incidence of the taxes would have been on relatively rich people," Harper wrote. "The $500 in taxes would not have hit the "typical" American or Oregonian family." The median household income in Oregon from 2008 through 2012 was $50,036, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, only about seven percent of all Oregon households made more than $150,000 in 2012, according to the Oregon Employment Department. The ruling: Monica Wehby, in criticizing U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s support of a major transportation spending bill, said the legislation would have "cost the average American family $1,000 a year…" The source the campaigned relied on, Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, for the figure said only half that amount could be attributed to new taxes imposed on any household. The rest would come in the form of new spending for infrastructure projects. Harper acknowledged that the bill in question -- the Rebuild America Jobs Act -- contained language specifying that all costs would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. Harper noted that any new taxes from the bill would not have affected the "typical American or Oregonian family." Wehby’s campaign attributed the original $958.40-per-year figure to the CBO’s "own analysis." When asked, the campaign said the figure actually came from a partisan political organization. The bill ultimately failed, but had it passed, it would not have cost the "average American family" a dime. We rate the claim False. Comments? Questions?

pomt-06806	"The country's bankrupt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-countrys-bankrupt/	Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who has raised warning flags about U.S. debt for decades, declared in an Iowa debate Aug. 11, 2011, that "the country's bankrupt." Okay, we'll bite: Is it? PolitiFact Wisconsin tested a similar claim in February from Gov. Scott Walker ("We’re broke. We don't have any more money.") and found it False. But Paul's talking about the whole country. Paul's comment came as part of his response to the first question posed to him, by Fox News anchor Bret Baier. Here's the transcript: BAIER: Congressman Paul, as you know, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating last week, one of the reasons S&P listed was because of partisan gridlock in Washington. Congressman, what specific things would you do as president to increase growth, calm the markets, create jobs that could pass through a divided Congress? PAUL: Well, they didn't downgrade it mainly because they couldn't come to a conclusion. They couldn't come to a conclusion because they didn't know what was going on. The country's bankrupt, and nobody wanted to admit it. And when you're bankrupt, you can't keep spending. And all these proposed cuts weren't cuts at all. What you have to do is restore sound money. You have to understand why you have a business cycle, why you have booms and busts. If you don't do that, there's no way you can solve these problems. And the booms and busts comes from a failed monetary system that -- the interest rates that are way lower than -- than they should be encourages malinvestment and debt. And to get out of that, all this other tinkering, you cannot do that unless you liquidate debt. You don't bail out the people that are bankrupt and dump the debt on the people. That is what's happened. So you have to allow liquidation of debt, eliminate the malinvestment. Then you go back and you can get growth again by having a better tax structure, lower taxes, invite capital back into this country, get a lot less regulations. And under those conditions, you can have growth again. For this fact-check, we're not going to explore whether there's a grand conspiracy to hide the condition of U.S. finances. Rather, we'll focus on the simple question of whether the country is bankrupt. We e-mailed Paul's campaign asking for support for his statement, but didn't hear back by our deadline. Instead, we'll rely on common definitions of "bankrupt" that seem to best fit the context of Paul's statement. One is "declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts." Another is "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." We'll tackle the more specific definition first. Since the U.S. government hasn't landed in bankruptcy court and been declared unable to pay its bills, we'll simplify it to whether the United States can pay its debts. Ratings agencies such as Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch pay attention to this very question. They offer sovereign credit ratings based on the same idea as your credit score: What's the risk a nation might default on its debt by failing to pay its bills? And S&P did downgrade the country's credit rating on Aug. 5, 2011. But what does that mean, exactly? The United States had a AAA credit rating, which S&P defines as having "extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." It's the highest rating you can get. After the downgrade, the United States has a AA+ credit rating. It's just one notch down from AAA on a scale that has more than 20 notches. S&P now says the United States "has very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." The "+" shows that the U.S. rating is on the high side of AA. Meanwhile, two other ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, didn't change their U.S. ratings — America still has the highest rating they offer. Fitch Ratings said on Aug. 2, 2011, that "despite the heated political debate ... corporate sector balance sheets and profitability are healthy, underlying productivity growth is still relatively strong, and the U.S. dollar remains unchallenged as the global reserve currency." We'll note that the ratings are forward-looking -- they evaluate whether the United States is likely to default in the future. But Paul went further than that. He said "the country's bankrupt," in the present tense. So we asked the U.S. Treasury: Can the country pay its bills right now? Yes, said spokesman Matt Anderson. "Because Congress acted to prevent a default crisis, the government has been able to meet its financial obligations," he said. Meanwhile, he pointed out that the Bureau of Public Debt has had no trouble selling bills, notes and bonds to finance the public debt. Indeed, after S&P lowered America's credit rating, the amount of interest the United States has to pay on its new debt actually went down — our credit got cheaper! Why? As financial markets swing, investors still consider U.S. government securities a safer place than alternatives to park their money. (We should also note that unlike Wisconsin, which has many of the same tools to make ends meet -- taxes, layoffs, spending cuts, debt shifting -- the federal government as sovereign nation could just print more money.) Now, about that second definition, "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." Allow us an analogy: Your paycheck doesn't cover your bills every month. But you have a great credit score, use your credit card to cover the difference, and have no trouble paying your credit card bill. Would you describe yourself as "bankrupt" or "impoverished"? We wouldn't. We'd reserve that description for the neighbor who was behind on his mortgage and couldn't pay his creditors. Paul said: "The country's bankrupt." While ratings agencies have warned that the United States needs to put together a plan to reduce its deficit to hold onto its strong credit into the future, the country so far has paid its bills, which does not match the definition of being bankrupt. And while S&P lowered its rating a notch, two other agencies still give the U.S. the top grade for its ability to pay its bills. We rate his statement False.

pomt-02628	Travis County is "surrounded by red counties."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/21/lloyd-doggett/historically-blue-travis-county-surrounded-red-cou/	In a video endorsement of Andy Brown for Travis County judge, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett stressed the Austin lawyer’s past chairmanship of the county’s Democratic Party, adding: "I know he shares our values. He will stand up to the Republicans. We are surrounded by red counties." Six counties enwrap the capital’s county: Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays, Blanco, Burnet and Williamson. Unlike Democratic-blue Travis, are they all Republican-red? A standard way of gauging whether a state is red or blue, so to speak, is whether the Republican or Democratic nominee won the state in the latest presidential election. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried each of Travis County’s contiguous counties, drawing 54 percent to 77 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state. Republican U.S. Senate nominee Ted Cruz similarly prevailed across the board, drawing 51 percent to 73 percent of each county’s vote. That November, Democrat Barack Obama won 60 percent of Travis County’s vote; Democratic Senate nominee Paul Sadler got 59 percent. Next, we scrolled presidential election results for the surrounding counties from 1992 through 2008. We largely saw red: The Republican nominee won Blanco, Burnet and Williamson counties all five elections. The nominee carried Hays County in all but 1992 and Bastrop and Caldwell counties from 2000 on. Separately, we asked the state parties how they would gauge the red or blue qualities of counties. By email, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, Steve Munisteri, said the party draws on a proprietary index for each county, its Optimal Republican Voting Strength or ORVS, which he described as based on a mathematical formula originated years ago. Munisteri said the ORVS draws on particular election results to indicate the percentage of the vote a party nominee would likely get in a general election in the best of circumstances. Munisteri sent us a chart indicating the ORVS for each of the six counties: Bastrop (56.2 percent); Blanco (72.5 percent); Burnet (74.3 percent); Caldwell (55 percent); Hays (56.2 percent); and Williamson (62.2 percent). By phone, Munisteri said the fact that Democrats have been elected to offices in some of the counties means the congressman’s claim isn’t entirely so. Election results for 2012 show local Democrats winning countywide races in two of the Travis-bordering counties, sometimes after they didn’t draw a Republican opponent. In 2010, Democrats won countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties. Let’s paw the details. In Bastrop County, according to 2012 results, a Republican won for county judge and the Democrats did not have a sheriff nominee. On the flip side, there was no Republican choice for county tax assessor-collector; Democrat Linda Harmon won without opposition. Two years earlier, Republicans won two contested county races, though a Democrat beat a Republican for county clerk, the results indicate. In Hays County, Republican victors in 2012 for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector ran unopposed, according to results emailed to us by Joyce Cowan, a county elections official. In 2010, Democrat Sherri Tibbe ran unopposed for criminal district attorney as Republican Bert Cobb defeated Democrat Jeff Barton for county judge, according to results. By telephone, Jon Leonard of the Hays County Democratic Party agreed that the county is red, though he expects Democratic candidates for statewide office to fare well there in November 2014; Obama, he pointed out, lost the county in 2008 by two percentage points. In Caldwell County, Democrats Daniel Law and Darla Law defeated Republicans to win 2012 races for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector, respectively, according to results emailed to us by a county official, Joy Morris Pardo. Two years before, victorious Democrats ran unopposed for the offices of criminal district attorney, county clerk, district clerk and county treasurer, though Republican Tom Bonn defeated Democrat Morris Alexander for county judge. In Burnet County, Democrats had no 2012 nominees for the several county offices, according to county-posted results. Two years earlier, several Republicans nominated for county offices (including county judge) lacked Democratic opponents. In the only red-blue 2010 showdown for county office, Republican Casie Wills handily defeated Democrat Cynthia Chisolm for district clerk. In Williamson County, according to county-posted results, Democrats had no 2012 nominee for sheriff as the losing Democratic nominee for district attorney garnered 40 percent against Republican Jana Duty. In 2010, Republicans cruised past Democrats for two contested county court-at-law judgeships. We did not obtain official records of Blanco County election results. But by telephone, Barbara Hudson, who chairs the county’s Democrats, told us that while the party seeks candidates to run countywide, for now, "we don’t even have Democrats who run for local offices." Our ruling Doggett said Travis County is "surrounded by red counties." That’s supported in each of the six counties by the outcome of presidential elections since 2000, though there has been some purpling in that Democrats won a few countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties in 2012 and 2010.

pomt-03397	In South Florida, "we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-south-florida-weve-h/	Not long after President Barack Obama gave a speech outlining his plan for attacking climate change, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment. "We've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s," said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. "What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years." In this item, we won’t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has "had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s." First, some background on sea-level rises. "Sea level" refers to the height of the ocean’s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years. We located sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That's roughly nine inches since the 1920s. We checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate. We will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise. One complication for making these measurements is that the land-based reference point for a tide gauge is not as fixed as it would seem to the naked eye. In reality, the land itself may be rising or falling, masking changes in sea level. For instance, in some places, such as Alaska or Scandinavia, the land is rising because it’s still rebounding from the retreat of heavy glaciers. In other locations, the slow action of plate tectonics is pushing the land upwards. The effect of land rises can be strong: In places like Alaska, the rise in the land has been faster than the rise in sea level, meaning that sea level is actually dropping in relative terms. By contrast, in Louisiana, the land is sinking due to a variety of landscape changes made by humans. With sea levels rising and the land sinking, the relative change in sea level is especially dramatic. South Florida fits somewhere between these two extremes. But because of the variability in land rise from place to place, it’s not appropriate to assume that just because sea level has risen by nine inches in Miami Beach that it has risen by the same amount everywhere. The second caveat is that past changes in sea level are a whole lot clearer than future changes. In a 2011 paper, Mitchum estimated that sea level in South Florida would rise 32 inches by 2100, with a smaller possibility of a 40-inch rise. However, other estimates have varied, and Mitchum cautions against assigning too much certainty to long-term estimates of sea-level rise. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that in South Florida, "we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s." That essentially matches the data collected by the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration. While there is considerable uncertainty about the future course of sea-level rises, Wasserman Schultz’s estimate of the historical rise appears to be on target. We rate her statement True.

pomt-14860	"Wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-wages-havent-risen-turn-centu/	Much of the first part of the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines addressed foreign policy, but soon the conversation turned to economic issues. At one point, Hillary Clinton was asked about how she would pay for such proposals as paid family leave. Clinton said she would not raise taxes on the middle class. "I have made very clear that hard-working, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase," she said, adding that "wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century." To check her assertion about stagnant wages, we turned to figures collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To take advantage of the most recent available data, we looked at figures for the third quarter of 2015. And to design the fairest comparison, we looked at third-quarter data for two different years -- 1999 and 2000 -- that could be used to describe the baseline "since the turn of the last century." To adhere to Clinton’s parameters, the figures below are all inflation-adjusted. Here’s what we found: Period Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, inflation-adjusted Third quarter, 1999 $315 Third quarter, 2000 $321 Third quarter, 2015 $340 This shows that wages didn’t rise very much above inflation over that period, though they did rise. Specifically, they rose about 8 percent between 1999 and 2015, and about 6 percent between 2000 and 2015. This is not very much of a rise over a 15-to 16-year period, as Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out when PolitiFact contacted the campaign. Still, it does undercut Clinton’s wording in the debate. We should note that this pattern didn’t simply start in 2000 -- it goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s. As the Pew Research Center noted, using similar BLS data, "For most U.S. workers, real wages — that is, after inflation is taken into account — have been flat or even falling for decades, regardless of whether the economy has been adding or subtracting jobs." Specifically, Pew wrote, "in seasonally adjusted current dollars, median usual weekly earnings rose from $232 in the first quarter of 1979 (when the series began) to $782 in the second quarter of (2014, the most recent data available). But in (inflation-adjusted) terms, the median has barely budged over that period." The paper added that what gains have been made over that period have accrued to the upper-income brackets. "Since 2000, usual weekly wages have fallen 3.7 percent (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution, and 3 percent among the lowest quarter," Pew wrote. "But among people near the top of the distribution, real wages have risen 9.7 percent." Our ruling Clinton said that "wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century." They didn’t rise by much -- roughly half a percentage point per year above inflation over the past decade and a half -- but they did rise. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11672	"Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/05/new-century-times/white-house-staffers-removed-job-subject-false/	A misleading story on Facebook said that an FBI raid led to White House staffers losing their jobs. "Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out," stated a headline by the New Century Times, a left-leaning website, on Dec. 30. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While staffers were removed from the White House, that happened nearly a year ago and by calling it a "raid" over dramatizes the actual news. The same story appeared on another website in February. The story by New Century Times said that an intelligence agency decided to fight back and sent Trump a message by escorting six staffers out of the White House for failing background investigations. By calling the event an "FBI raid" it conjures up an image of armed personnel storming the White House to take out suspicious staffers. But that’s not the way it sounded in news reports. The website attributed much of the information to Western Journalism, which describes itself as a source of conservative and libertarian news. In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico. Western Journalism reported Feb. 16 that the six staffers were escorted from the White House for problems with their SF86 application, a questionnaire for national security positions. The questionnaire, more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant’s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant’s mental health and use of illicit drugs. The Western Journalism article followed an article by Politico, which reported based on unnamed sources that some of the aides were "walked out of the building by security." One of the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign director, Politico reported. Caroline Wiles, who resigned before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She was slated to get another job in Treasury. Our ruling The website New Century Times said in a December headline that "Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out." Yes, six White House staffers were removed from their jobs due to problems associated with their in depth background checks, Politico reported. But their removals occurred in February -- this isn’t "breaking" news in December. And it seems a stretch to describe the removals as an FBI "raid." We rate this claim False.

pomt-03206	"I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/27/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-claim-misses-his-annually-being-no-1-pick/	In a Dallas-area call on behalf of a jailed niece, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Texas law enforcement agencies consistently rank him fairest of them all. In his Aug. 3, 2013, call to the Allen Police Department, a recording of which was later released in response to a request from NBC 5, KXAS-TV, Dewhurst inquired into what he needed to do to hasten the release of Ellen Bevers, described in the station’s news report as a schoolteacher detained for allegedly shoplifting at a grocery store. His call did not yield special treatment; Bevers was released after posting bond the next day, according to an Aug. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. But critics including Dewhurst challengers in the 2014 Republican primary charged him with trying to throw his weight around. Readers zeroed in on a curious Dewhurst claim. "Sergeant, you don't know me," Dewhurst is heard saying on the police call, "but I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas." First and foremost? Agencies do not rank officeholders, we found, though law officer associations make candidate endorsements as do other advocacy groups with an interest in what happens in government. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was endorsed by several officer groups in his 2006 re-election race and in his 2012 U.S. Senate race. Also, Considine noted, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas deemed Dewhurst its Texas Crime Fighter of the Year in 2003, his first year in what many consider the state’s most powerful post. A Nov. 24, 2003, association press release credits Dewhurst with steering reforms in drunken-driving laws and helping on other measures. CLEAT spokesman Charlie Wilkison is quoted describing Dewhurst as a "real friend" to the state’s law enforcement community. By telephone, Wilkison, poised to become the group’s executive director, told us that in 2012 the association gave Dewhurst a lifetime achievement award thanks to his consistent support over the years. Especially notable, Wilkison said, Dewhurst has repeatedly volunteered to keynote a biennial Texas Capitol ceremony honoring fallen officers at which he comforts survivors including children, one by one. Wilkison said he believes that in the call to the police department, Dewhurst meant to say he was No. 1 with law enforcement groups, instead making a common semantic mistake by saying "agencies." Like representatives of other law enforcement advocacy groups that have supported Dewhurst in elections, Wilkison agreed that agencies do not rank officeholders; the agencies are supposed to be politically disinterested. Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association, another influential group, said by phone that it has enjoyed a great relationship with Dewhurst. "Law enforcement agencies have no business endorsing candidates," Lawrence said, and while associations or unions make candidate endorsements, they do not pick one officeholder over another--assigning ranks, that is--unless the officeholders face each other on the ballot. "Associations don’t sit around saying who is our favorite politician," Lawrence said. Gary Chandler, a Department of Public Safety sergeant and president of the DPS Officers Association, later said by phone: "We don’t rank the government officials or public officials," instead focusing on trooper salaries and benefits. Then again, Chandler said: "As government works, the lieutenant governor of Texas is a very powerful person. We have worked with David Dewhurst the last three" legislative "sessions at least." He said that personally, Dewhurst "has been my No. 1 guy," though every legislator "is important to us when it comes to accomplishing our goals… I wouldn’t mind calling them all No. 1 at some point." Lacking any sign of agencies ranking officeholders, we turned back to Considine, who said the cited endorsements demonstrate Dewhurst's appeal to law enforcement organizations. Our ruling Dewhurst said that "every year, I'm the No.1 pick of all the law enforcement agencies in Texas." This declaration falters in substantive ways. Law enforcement agencies do not rank elected officials against one another in any way. Nor do law enforcement advocacy groups, though Dewhurst has drawn multiple re-election endorsements. Then again, such endorsements do not occur every year. The election for lieutenant governor occurs every four years. We rate this claim as False. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01478	Health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/29/republican-party-florida/health-insurance-costs-are-skyrocketing-under-obam/	Got a beef with Obamacare? The Republicans want to remind voters that Democrat Charlie Crist thinks the president’s health care law is "great." A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida features anecdotes from people making claims about how the health care law has hurt them in the pocketbook or made it harder to find doctors: "I think Obamacare harms doctors and patients." "It increased my health policy, personal health policy, 30 percent." "I’m disabled and I can’t find doctors that will help me." "My family’s medical costs have doubled." "Many doctors are losing their patients, and patients are losing their doctors. I was one of them." "Obamacare hurts my ability to create jobs." The ad soon pivots to Crist saying of Obamacare "I think it’s been great," comments he made in a TV interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley in March 2014. Crist has campaigned in favor of the federal health care law while his opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott has been a major critic. The ad doesn’t identify the various men and women complaining about Obamacare making it impossible to verify each individual’s experiences. State GOP spokesperson Susan Hepworth’s only reply to our questions about the people and their insurance woes: "They are not actors." But we can research the ad’s overall message that the Affordable Care Act has inflated Floridians’ health care costs anywhere from 30 percent to twice as expensive. Data about rising premiums There have been various studies about average premium increases since the health care law was implemented, but the results vary widely depending on the methodology and available information. The studies we saw that cited larger increases were generally based on the individual or small-group market and not the category of large-group employer plans. Some predictions that came from Florida officials were based on a hypothetical plan that wasn’t even for sale in the state. The Republicans cited a few surveys showing higher prices. For example, a national survey by the investment firm Morgan Stanley showed Florida was seeing a 36.8 percent increase for individual plans and 20.7 percent increase for small group plans based on the response of six insurance brokers. But large-group plans were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. (PolitiFact New Hampshire noted this in their state as well.) Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. That’s because existing individual- and small-group policies likely didn’t include many of the law’s new minimum requirements, such as preventive care with no cost-sharing. When the policies had to change, premiums were likely to rise. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health policy research center, has said there are several reasons not to compare costs before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge again is how policies have new coverage requirements, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. The plans people are buying in 2014 are not the same as what they may have bought last year. In 2013, Kaiser explained that overall average unsubsidized premiums for nongroup coverage would be higher because "many people will be getting better insurance." Kaiser didn’t have a breakdown by state, but reported national data in September 2014 that showed average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage rose 3 percent. A 2014 Kaiser survey found that nearly half (46 percent) of those who previously bought non-group insurance and switched to a subsidized, ACA-compliant plan said their current premium is lower than it was under their previous plan, while four in 10 (39 percent) say it is higher. The rate at which those premiums changed is a question mark because of how each study measured whatever they measured, but the anonymous examples cited in the commercial sound extreme to some experts. "While it would not be impossible for a consumer to experience a ‘30 percent increase’ in his ‘health care policy,’ that situation would unquestionably be an extreme outlier," said Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. "The doubling of ‘medical costs’ would be even more extreme. Representing those consumers as typical Floridians would therefore be grossly misleading." So what are typical premium numbers? PricewaterhouseCoopers released data in August 2014 on individual market rate filings based on state insurance department rate filings and public statements. PWC found a 7.4 percent increase for Florida, a hair above the national 7 percent increase. The report cited a broad range of rate increases in some states and noted that they would likely shrink after regulators reviewed them. Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation and the White House released different information regarding premium costs in August. The Miami Herald wrote that Florida officials said rates would rise an average of 13.2 percent for new plans in the individual market next year, while the White House said most Floridians who buy an Obamacare plan will pay less in monthly premiums. How can that be? Because they’re each doing different math in order to prove their points. The Florida insurance office, an agency working for a Republican governor and GOP-led Legislature that is against the Affordable Care Act, calculated the average on individual health plans on both the private market and the health exchange, leading to that 13.2 percent rise, the Herald pointed out. The White House was only counting the second-lowest priced silver plan on the exchange in each Florida county. That method predicted an average 4 percent drop in monthly premiums. "The bottom line is that there is absolutely no way to assess the ad without knowing where the person came from (pre-ACA insurance) and something about their health needs," Caroline Pearson, a vice president at health care consulting firm Avalere, told PolitiFact Florida. "Generally, most people in exchanges were previously uninsured or in the individual market. Most of those people will have much better coverage post ACA, but there are absolutely examples of healthy people whose costs will go up." Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, said there still are some groups who may have seen substantial increases in their premiums. "These are individuals or couples who had purchased individual insurance tailored to their needs and who were forced to buy more comprehensive and therefore expensive plans," she said. Wilensky added that last fall there were many complaints from single people and older couples who had to buy policies with those new requirements. They didn’t need things like maternity care and full dental plans for children, but their premiums went up anyway. However, most people who have bought insurance were those who were eligible to get substantial subsidies, she said. In response to the Republicans’ ad, the Crist campaign sent reporters a copy of a recent Tampa Bay Times editorial that cited numbers that show health care reform is working in Florida -- including that nearly 1 million have elected to get a plan through the federal marketplace. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad shows several unidentified people saying that health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more. Many reports that cite big double-digit premium increases are based on individual or small-group plans and omit large group plans, the type of coverage many people have through work. Kaiser concluded that in large-group plans, the largest segment in the market, premiums will rise 3 percent. The Republicans’ ad takes anecdotal experiences about cost increases that would be rare but potentially true and creates the impression that the federal health care law is just one big heap of problems for patients without any benefits. Then it tells voters that despite that morass, Crist supports it. People may see increases to their health care costs under the law, but the typical experience is nowhere near what the ad suggests. Indeed, other Floridians will see their costs go down. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-09-29T11:26:51	2014-09-23	['None']
pomt-10707	Romney failed to take action against "sanctuary cities" in Massachusetts.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/28/rudy-giuliani/right-facts-but-they-dont-prove-romney-weak-on-imm/	The Giuliani campaign has responded several times to Romney's attacks on "sanctuary cities" by alleging that it was Romney who was weak on immigration because he did not speak up or take action against Massachusetts cities that had similar policies to New York's. Giuliani is on solid ground with this attack. There's no evidence that Romney spoke up or took action against those cities. But Romney's inaction does not necessarily confirm the Giuliani campaign's larger point –- that Romney was soft on illegal immigration. Late in his term, Romney approved a plan to deputize state troopers to help enforce immigration laws, although the plan was not implemented because it was rescinded by his successor, Gov. Deval Patrick. We expect to see this allegation repeated as the campaign goes on, though. The Giuliani campaign has apparently been searching for cities with policies of not turning in illegal immigrants; they recently upped their count of Massachusetts sanctuary cities from three to six. We rate Giuliani's claim as Mostly True because, although the facts are right, there's not enough evidence to back up Giuliani's larger point that Romney was not aggressive on illegal immigration.

pomt-15245	"Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/04/sandra-smith/fox-business-reporter-95-planned-parenthoods-pregn/	Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee supports the federal government cutting off more than $500 million to Planned Parenthood, calling the organization "an industry of abortion" in a recent Fox Business Channel interview. His interviewer, Fox Business reporter Sandra Smith, did not disagree — and she offered numbers to back up her point. "Almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions," Smith said as she guest-hosted Mornings with Maria on July 28, 2015. We wanted to know if the percentage of abortions was really that high. We reached out to Smith for comment but did not hear back. 'Pregnancy services' Viewers may miss that Smith’s statement refers only to "pregnancy services." By choosing those words, she is likely referencing a fact sheet by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates. The Susan B. Anthony List’s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood’s 2013-14 annual report. The first caveat to know is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for "pregnancy services." That’s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading claims over the years. On the fact sheet, "pregnancy services" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy. With that in mind, here’s the section from Planned Parenthood’s annual report that contains those categories. To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements from the chart: prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653). Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories. For several reasons, that’s a misleading way to analyze the data. Referrals for prenatal care not in equation Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700 clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus. As a result, many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care. How many? It's impossible to know. Planned Parenthood does not record how many pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers, said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. If referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by how much — and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List. The rest of the story Planned Parenthood does not specifically track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption. Testing and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at more than 4.47 million. Contraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception kits, and sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million services. Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams, account for 935,573 services. As show on the chart above, there were also more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments, or 65,500 "family practice services." Over the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year. Of all services, abortions account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report. But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to 12 percent. Some critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood’s measurement of "services." Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.) Our ruling Smith said, "Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions." An anti-abortion group puts the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes "pregnancy services" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant. But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information. What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals. Planned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers. Without that information, we don't know an accurate percentage of "pregnancy services" that were abortions. Neither, however, does Smith. We rate the claim False. UPDATE: After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on the record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on the record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information. We've updated this fact-check to include her comments.

pomt-01586	Says his comment about extremists being a JV team "wasn’t specifically referring to" Islamic State.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/07/barack-obama/what-obama-said-about-islamic-state-jv-team/	President Barack Obama granted an exclusive sit down to Meet the Press for new host Chuck Todd’s inaugural show. As expected, Todd and Obama had a long discussion about the administration’s strategy for dealing with Islamic State, the terrorist group responsible for the beheading of two American journalists, with Obama stating "we’re going to defeat them." Todd then remarked that Obama’s response was a "long way from when you described them as a JV team." "Was that bad intelligence or your misjudgment?" Todd asked. "Keep in mind I wasn’t specifically referring to (Islamic State)," Obama replied. "I've said that, regionally, there were a whole series of organizations that were focused primarily locally, weren’t focused on homeland, because I think a lot of us, when we think about terrorism, the model is Osama bin Laden and 9/11." Is Obama editing his remarks or did Todd misrepresent what Obama said? We decided to take a look. Critics have maligned Obama’s "JV" remark in recent weeks as the Islamic State continues to wreak havoc throughout Syria and Iraq. The origin of the comment is a New Yorker profile of Obama by editor David Remnick. The New Yorker published Remnick’s profile on Jan. 27, 2014. In it, he wrote, "In the 2012 campaign, Obama spoke not only of killing Osama bin Laden; he also said that Al Qaeda had been ‘decimated.’ I pointed out that the flag of Al Qaeda is now flying in Fallujah, in Iraq, and among various rebel factions in Syria; Al Qaeda has asserted a presence in parts of Africa, too." Obama responded: "The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant." (For the nonsports fan, JV stands for junior varsity, and it usually means a high school or college's secondary team.) Remnick confirmed to PolitiFact that the interview took place on Jan. 7 and he was referencing a specific event that had happened just days before: the overtaking of the Iraq city of Fallujah on Jan. 3. At the time, Islamic State (often referred to as by its acronyms ISIS or ISIL) was not a household name. It was often referred to as an al-Qaeda-linked group in press reports. But reports from the time clearly indicate that the group was responsible for taking over the city. Al Jazeera America reported on Jan. 4: "On Friday, ISIL gunmen sought to win over the population in Fallujah, one of the cities they swept into on Wednesday. A commander appeared among worshippers holding Friday prayers in the main city street, proclaiming that his fighters were there to defend Sunnis from the government, one resident said. " ‘We are your brothers from the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant,’ gunmen circulating through the city in a stolen police car proclaimed through a loudspeaker. ‘We are here to protect you from the government. We call on you to cooperate with us.’ " Officials within the Iraqi government told the "Agence France-Presse that ISIL, the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, remained in control of parts of the two cities on Thursday," according to NBC. So when Remnick referenced an al Qaeda group taking over Fallujah, it’s clear whom he was talking about. On Aug. 25, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed Obama’s comment was being taken out of context and that the "president was not singling out" Islamic State in that interview, but rather Islamic extremist groups in general. The Washington Post Fact-Checker compared that with the previously unreleased transcript and gave Earnest’s comment four Pinocchios, his worst rating. (For what it’s worth, Remnick told PolitiFact that the Post fact-check "got it right.") A transcript of the conversation provided to the Post (and verified by Remnick) also confirms as much. Remnick: "You know where this is going, though. Even in the period that you’ve been on vacation in the last couple of weeks, in Iraq, in Syria, of course, in Africa, al-Qaeda is resurgent." Obama: "Yes, but, David, I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian." Remnick: "But that JV team just took over Fallujah." Obama: "I understand. But when you say took over Fallujah –" Remnick: "And I don’t know for how long." Obama: "But let’s just keep in mind, Fallujah is a profoundly conservative Sunni city in a country that, independent of anything we do, is deeply divided along sectarian lines. And how we think about terrorism has to be defined and specific enough that it doesn’t lead us to think that any horrible actions that take place around the world that are motivated in part by an extremist Islamic ideology is a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into." This pretty much leaves no doubt. Obama may not have specifically said Islamic State, but it’s clear he was talking about them. Remnick was referencing events in Syria and Iraq, particularly the takeover of Fallujah, which was conducted by Islamic State, and Obama referred to the group responsible for that as "a JV team." Our ruling Obama said his JV comment "wasn’t specifically referring to ISIL." He was not specifically asked about Islamic State, but it’s pretty clear this is the group that was being referenced in the conversation. The transcript backs this up, as do news events from the time of the discussion. We rate the statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-09-07T18:14:11	2014-09-07	['None']

pomt-04213	"National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices … (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost."	false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/30/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-said-national-studies-show-businesses-ar/	Some Florida public officials, including Gov. Rick Scott, have softened their tone on the federal health care law since the U.S. Supreme Court declared it constitutional and President Barack Obama was re-elected. But don’t count Attorney General Pam Bondi among those officials. In remarks at a Florida Chamber of Commerce event Nov. 28, 2012, Bondi said the health care law is already hurting businesses. "Unfortunately, national studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices in order to compensate for their added costs due to Obama’s health care plan. If they aren’t raising prices, they’re cutting jobs as a result of the added cost, both of which hurt our economy. According to a Mercer survey, more than 60 percent of employers expect the federal health care plan to increase their health costs. Twenty percent of those employers are bracing for at least a 5 percent increase in costs." This comment caught our attention because added costs for business under the health care law do not start until 2014. So why would they be raising prices and cutting jobs now? First, a bit of background: In 2014, the law’s major requirements take effect. Individuals will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty. And large employers will have to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt, and large employers that already offer health insurance are not affected. Translation: Most large employers who don’t offer their employees health insurance will be subject to the penalty. But again, those penalties haven’t started yet, which made us question Bondi’s statement that businesses "are raising prices" and "cutting jobs" as a result of the law. Employers have seen some new requirements since the law went into effect. One requirement that has started is that parents be allowed to add adult children to their policies. Another regulation forbids caps on how much insurance will pay over the course of someone’s lifetime. But we didn’t find evidence of these regulations leading to higher prices or eliminated jobs. We contacted Bondi’s office and asked for evidence of Bondi’s remarks. They provided the Mercer survey that Bondi mentioned, as well as news reports on businesses preparing for the health care law’s requirements. We’ll review that evidence here. The Mercer survey We contacted Mercer, a health care consulting company, and obtained the survey Bondi referenced. It was conducted two weeks after the Supreme Court decision and queried 1,215 employers of various sizes. As Bondi said, the survey found that 61 percent of employers expected cost increases. Employers were asked to estimate the cost impact of the health law’s key provisions that go into effect in 2014. Here are the survey’s findings on costs: * 10 percent of employers said they expected no increase in costs; * 10 percent of employers said they expected a less than 1 percent increase in costs; * 17 percent of employers said they expected a 1 to 2 percent increase in costs; * 14 percent of employers said they expected a 3 to 4 percent increase in costs; * 20 percent of employers said they expected a 5 percent or more increase in costs; * 29 percent of employers said they didn’t know what to expect. So Bondi is correct on the specific numbers she cited. However, she was selective in quoting the survey’s findings. For example, another way to read the results is that 51 percent of employers expected their costs to go up 4 percent or less. A spokesperson for Mercer told us their surveys show employers are actually lowering their estimates of the cost impact as the law’s actual implementation gets closer. Finally, we should note that the Mercer survey asked employers to predict what they thought would happen in 2014. It did not ask employers about how the law is affecting their actions today. And it did not show that businesses are raising their prices or laying off workers, as Bondi suggested. News coverage Bondi’s office also pointed us to news stories about how businesses are reacting to the health care law, reports from conservative think tanks and opinion pieces from conservative outlets that oppose the law. The most relevant and persuasive evidence that the law would raise prices or cause layoffs were news stories about how the law would affect the restaurant industry. Franchise owners for restaurants such as Papa John’s have said they intend to reduce workers’ hours or add surcharges to their food in order to comply with the health care law’s requirements. The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 3, 2012, that companies such as Darden Restaurants of Orlando, which runs Red Lobster and Olive Garden, were shifting their workforce from full-timers to part-timers to try to avoid paying penalties. We found this evidence interesting, but anecdotal, and not definitive. The chief executive officer for Papa John’s, for example, wrote an op-ed for the Huffington Post to correct reports that the pizza chain was laying off workers. "Many in the media reported that I said Papa John's is going to close stores and cut jobs because of Obamacare. I never said that," wrote John Schnatter on Nov. 20, 2012. "The fact is we are going to open over hundreds of stores this year and next and increase employment by over 5,000 jobs worldwide. And, we have no plans to cut team hours as a result of the Affordable Care Act." Still, we found no large-scale studies showing that many businesses are currently raising prices or laying off workers to prepare for the health law. In 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the law’s effects on the nationwide labor force and found the effects would be minimal. Also, most of the economic effects of the law would happen after the provisions took effect, not before. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Our ruling Bondi said, "National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices … (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost." It’s true that some large businesses -- specifically, those with more than 50 employees who do not currently offer their employees health insurance -- will face new costs because of the health care law. Starting in 2014, they will have to offer their employees health insurance or pay a financial penalty to the federal government. But Bondi’s comments ignore two points: These requirements haven’t taken effect yet, and it’s not clear whether businesses will find themselves forced to raise prices or cut jobs. We found no credible national studies showing these widespread effects, and certainly not showing those effects right now. We don’t doubt there’s anxiety among some businesses over what’s to come under the health care law, and maybe some are talking about whether they’ll have to raise prices or cut jobs. But Bondi didn’t talk about planning, she talked about what’s occuring right now, and we find no studies already showing the negative effects or evidence that businesses are cutting jobs or raising prices now. We rate Bondi’s statement False.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2012-11-30T14:52:16	2012-11-28	['None']

pomt-05684	Says her accomplishments include "a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/14/chris-telfer/can-chris-telfer-claim-credit-budget-re-balance-cl/	Like other savvy politicians, state Sen. Chris Telfer, R-Bend, issued a press release via the caucus office crediting herself for her accomplishments in the 2012 legislative session: Senator Chris Telfer (R-Bend) wrestled several important successes from Oregon’s first annual session, which ended Monday evening. Among her accomplishments are two substantial job-creating bills and a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending. Innocuous enough, right? Except that the press release prompted this tweet from a colleague of PolitiFact Oregon: OR Sen. Telfer, R-Bend, takes credit for "fiscally responsible budget" -- which she voted against. Whoa. That got our attention. What’s the story? We found there were votes on five budget related bills Monday, the last day of the 2012 legislative session. Telfer voted in favor of bonding and capital construction, but voted against operating money to run state government. The key bill was Senate Bill 5701, the "omnibus budget reconciliation bill" that reflects the bulk of the agreement struck by House and Senate budget negotiators. Nine Republicans in the Senate voted no, including Telfer. Senate Bill 5702 allocates the other part of state general fund: state lottery money. Two Republicans voted no, including Telfer. Telfer is a certified public accountant who is not on the Ways and Means Committee. She said on the floor that the budget bills were important bills, but she didn’t receive them in time to vet them properly. She also said that there is extra money on the books that state agencies are hiding from lawmakers. "Just letting everybody know that I will be no on all the budget bills," she said on the floor. We reached Telfer by telephone. She said she did not write the press release, but did review it and she stands by the statement. She said the budget agreement struck by the three budget writers reflects her stance on trimming state personnel and opposing new taxes. She said she was in frequent contact with the office of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, the Republican in the meetings. Her no votes were an opportunity to send a message to fellow lawmakers, Telfer said. "It’s a budget I can live with," she said, "but I certainly think there were lots of faults with the budget." To be fair, the press release went on to talk about her advocacy for "budget transparency and accountability" and that she fought "to end runaway state spending and successfully lobbied against new taxes and fees increases." In other words, the release was candid about the general nature of her role. But the statement specifically cites "among her accomplishments are … a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending." Telfer didn’t negotiate, or help negotiate, that agreement. Not only that, she voted against the bills that authorize operating money for state government. Her statement is not accurate and it makes a ridiculous claim. We rule the statement Pants on Fire. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-01886	"13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/08/donny-deutsch/uninsured-rate-lowest-ever-donny-deutsch-claims/	Morning Joe guest host Donny Deutsch, discussing House Speaker John Boehner’s refusal to vote on immigration reform, called out the GOP for being wrong about, well, just about everything. "Once again the party of no," Deutsch said on July 1, 2014. "The country’s will was for immigration reform, they're against it. Minimum wage, we want to raise it for everybody, another populist point of view. They don't want to do it. By the way, 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. Everything is going in the right direction." While there are several things we could fact-check from Deutsch’s comments, we were most interested in his claim that 13 percent of Americans are currently uninsured -- the lowest that figure has ever been. The poll numbers Neither Deutsch nor his press agent responded to our interview requests. But it’s likely that Deutsch is referring to a Gallup poll on the rate of uninsured Americans. The poll found that in April and May of this year, 13.4 percent of Americans were without health insurance, holding steady since open enrollment for coverage ended March 31. This is indeed the lowest rate of uninsured Americans since the poll began five years ago, besting 2008’s 14.4 percent and dropping from 2013’s peak of 18 percent. The problem is, Gallup doesn’t have numbers before 2008 -- which means there’s no way to know if it’s the lowest rate ever as Deutsch claimed. Other surveys, including from the government, also attempt to measure the percentage of Americans without health insurance. According to those surveys, the percentage of Americans without health insurance has been lower than the 13.4 percent cited by Gallup: 2001: 13.1 percent (Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey) 2000: 13.1 percent (Census Population Survey), 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1999: 12.2 percent (National Health Survey) 1998: 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1988: 13.4 percent (Population Survey) 1987: 12.9 percent (Population Survey) 1980: 12 percent (Health and Human Services Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) 1978: 12 percent (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) While the percentages suggest the current uninsured rate is hardly the "lowest ever" reported, it should be noted that it is ill-advised to compare across the polls because of the differences in methodology and timing. Gallup surveys adult Americans multiple times a year about their health insurance at the time of the survey. Gallup analyst Jeff Jones confirmed that the exact question asked was simply "do you have health insurance"? Census data, which hasn’t caught up to Obamacare implementation, includes Americans of all ages, though both broadly define "uninsured" as lacking insurance at any time of the year. The Health and Human Services surveys only consider nonelderly adults (under 65), includes those with only noncomprehensive plans as "uninsured" (i.e. dental or vision, coverage for accidents or specific diseases), and differentiates between uninsured any time in the year, for the first part of the year, and the full year. And to make matters more complicated, the Census Bureau is changing the way it collects information on the uninsured. That means new Census Bureau data will not be comparable to old Census Bureau data. In short, year-to-year data comparisons may be a moot point so let’s look at the bigger picture. Historical trends First off, insurance coverage, let alone coverage figures, simply doesn’t go all the way back to the all-elusive "ever." In fact, it didn’t really exist before the 1920s. The closest thing offered was "sickness" insurance, which paid a worker even if he/she had to take a day off due to illness -- essentially paid sick leave. According to political economist John Murray, about a third of the industrial workforce was enrolled in these sickness funds in the 1920s. In 1929, the first insurance plan in America covered 21 days of hospitalization and was offered to Dallas teachers by Baylor University for an annual fee of $6 (about $82 today). This plan, named Blue Cross, became popular during the Great Depression. In 1940, less than 1 in 10 Americans had the plan, said economic historian Melissa Thomasson. The next two decades saw an expansion of employer-sponsored plans, incentivized by Internal Revenue Bureau Code 1954’s tax subsidy, according to Thomasson. This accounts for the employer-sponsored coverage system we all know and love today. "Most plans were employer based and always have been because insurance companies then and now figured that only sick people would want health insurance and the plans would not be sound. This is a problem called adverse selection," said Thomasson. By 1959, about two-thirds of Americans were insured, according to the Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey, though historical rates of coverage for the elderly were low. "Insurers could not figure out how to cover people who made lots of claims and retirees often lost their employer-provided insurance when they retired. So Medicare would have resulted in large increases in coverage," Murray said. With the creation of social safety net programs in 1965 -- Medicare for the elderly (over 65) and Medicaid for the poor -- more than 80 percent were insured by 1968. That same year, 96 percent of the elderly were insured, more than double that of a decade earlier. Health and Human Services data show a decline in the percentage of uninsured nonelderly Americans from 1959 to 1980. Then, the rates began to climb, level off in the 90s, and then rise substantially circa the Great Recession. Again, this is because it all ties back to the employment-sponsored system of insurance, experts say. The higher the employment ratio is, the higher the insurance rate. But Medicaid and the recent trend of employers not offering coverage complicates this relationship. "Unemployment doesn’t come with health insurance, unless one is poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The 1990s was a decade of high and rising employment, and that boosted insurance coverage," said Brookings Institution senior fellow Henry Aaron. "During the 2000s the employment population ratio fell and employers continued to move gradually away from offering coverage. So, both trends were negative." As a result, all the polls we looked at indicated that post-Great Recession uninsured rates hovered above 14 percent. And though the unemployment rate has fallen in the 2010s, the employment ratio has not. Martha Heberlein, research manager at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, and Aaron both cite Congressional Budget Office projections of the uninsured rate leveling off in the next few years at 8 to 9 percent. Obamacare won’t be universal technically because of undocumented aliens, those excused from the mandate, and those who remain uninsured and pay a fine. Heberlein adds that the rate could decline even further if more states adopt Medicaid expansion. "I think that the key point is not whether the insurance percentage is or is not at an all-time low today. The key points are that the Affordable Care Act reversed an upward trend and has done so emphatically and if the projections of the Congressional Budget Office are even approximately correct, the percentage will come down still more," Aaron said. The ruling Deutsch claimed that 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Yes, it is the lowest that Gallup has reported in its five-year poll, though other equally valid surveys show lower rates before 2008. Nonetheless, experts agree that more Americans are insured than there were in the past couple of years. Whether that’s the lowest ever is hard to say. We rate Deutsch’s statement Half True.

pomt-04229	Says Delta Air Lines has "once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/25/steve-cohen/delta-broke-promises-memphis-says-congressman-cohe/	When the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines was under consideration in 2008, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., was skeptical of the deal. While noting that the Memphis Airport Authority and the Memphis Chamber of Commerce backed it, Cohen sought some assurances from those seeking to implement it. The Memphis congressmen is now assailing Delta, which has grown very unpopular in the region while flights are cut and fares are raised, for failing to live up to those assurances. Cohen put out a press release Oct. 31 saying some of the assurances he received were misrepresentations and "that Delta has once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis." The release’s opening paragraph referred to a "string of broken promises," so we decided to look at the history and determine if Cohen is accurately representing the company’s record. Cohen’s office provided hearing transcripts and press accounts. In one, the CEO of Delta, Richard H. Anderson, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee’s task force on antitrust laws in April 2008, and Cohen was there to question him. Anderson, who had served as a senior vice president for labor relations at Northwest in the early 1990s, noted that he’d spent "many days in Memphis" and was "instrumental in launching the service from Memphis to Amsterdam some, I guess, 10 years ago now." Cohen: "The Amsterdam flight would remain, I presume?" Anderson: "Yes." The Delta-Northwest merger was announced on April 14, 2008, and the boards of the two companies approved terms of the deal in September of that year. It received regulatory approval from the Justice Department’s antitrust division and from European regulators. Delta announced in March of this year that the flight to Amsterdam, inaugurated in 1995 and giving the Bluff City huge international cachet, would be converted to a summer-only schedule. Then, in October, the airline dropped the flight from the schedule completely. Similarly, in a Memphis Daily News article of June 2008, Anderson was quoted saying Memphis would be an integral hub of the merged airline: "The consolidation is about addition, not subtraction." The article was one of many from that time noting that, "Anderson said the move could even bring more flights to the city, especially international flights, considering the long list of worldwide cities now served by the two companies." At the time, the cheering section included Memphis Airport Authority chairman Arnold Perl, who was quoted as saying, "The Northwest-Delta merger is great for Memphis, great for the Memphis region, great for Tennessee and great for the United States." To many in Memphis, including those among the 6,000 members of the anti-Delta Facebook group, "Delta Does Memphis," the merger now seems more grating than great. Northwest Airlines flew 240 flights out of Memphis before being acquired by Delta in 2008. In June of this year, Delta announced it would chop 25 flights from Memphis out of its schedule, leaving the hub with 46 percent fewer flights than when the merger took effect. Memphis International Airport chief financial officer Forrest Artz reported that, in September, daily Delta flights were down to 122, compared to 175 the same month a year earlier. For its part, Delta blames other factors beyond the merger for the reduced flights. "Any operational assurance that Delta provided officials was under the understating that any action to the contrary would not be directly related to the merger," Delta spokesman Anthony L. Black said by email. "Specifically, raising fuel costs, the current international economic environment, lack of passenger demand and profitability have been the primary drivers of all network restructuring." While Delta may now claim that any assurances it gave were conditioned by any number of factors, people in Memphis thought they had a deal that meant a strengthened hub and a continued flight to Europe, and maybe more. The facts are the Delta Air Lines CEO said the Memphis-Amsterdam flight would continue. It was first curtailed to summer-only, then chloroformed. That’s a broken promise. Next, the Delta point man said Memphis would remain an integral hub of the new merged airline and might even have "more flights to the city." The number of flights has dropped from 240 to 122, a 49 percent decline. Whatever the circumstances, these qualify as broken promises. Our ruling Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen accuses Delta of breaking promises made to him and the city of Memphis about the impact of its merger with Northwest. Delta has subsequently ended the city’s direct flight to Amsterdam and has cut the number of flights nearly in half. We rule this statement True.

pomt-00953	"There is a very identifiable Somali community" back home in Delaware.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/19/joe-biden/joe-biden-and-his-somali-cab-driver-friends/	In the latest of a series of perceived gaffes that have punctuated his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden set eyerolls rolling when he said he had an extensive friendship with the Somali community in his hometown of Wilmington, Del. At a White House summit on violent extremism on Feb. 17, 2015, Biden said, "Somalis have made my city of Wilmington, Del. (their home) on a smaller scale. There is a very identifiable Somali community. I might add if you come to the train station with me you’ll notice I have great relationships with them because there’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real. I’m not being solicitous. I’m being serious." In short order, CNN interviewed some Wilmington cab drivers who said they know of drivers from some African countries such as Ghana and Liberia, but none from Somalia. "I don't think I've seen any (Somalis) in Delaware," Anthony Eber, a taxi company owner who emigrated from Sierra Leone, told CNN. Did Biden know something no one else seems to know? Apparently not. The Census Bureau’s latest American Community Survey did find some Delaware residents with Somali ancestry -- it estimated that there were a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware. That’s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state’s population. If that’s "very identifiable," it would help to have a microscope. Compare that with Minnesota, which has the United States’ largest Somali population, at more than 35,000. Meanwhile, Biden’s home-away-from-home, the Washington, D.C., metro area, ranks in the top five for Somali populations. Refugees from the east African country started coming to the United States en masse in the 1990s, after a civil war broke out. Today, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate Islamic terrorist group, is a major source of instability in Somalia and a reason why refugees continue to flee to the United States. All told, roughly 90,000 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States since 2000, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. However, Delaware has not received any of them, according data from the same office. Jewish Family Services of Delaware is the state’s largest refugee resettlement organization. On their website, there’s a list of nearly 40 countries from which refugees have been resettled. About half of those are African countries, but Somalia is not one of them. Wilmington is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, which has one of the higher rates of foreign-born residents from Africa, according to the American Community Survey. But even in this expanded geographical area, the vast majority are from African countries other than Somalia. Of Delaware’s foreign-born population, only 9.5 percent are from the African continent -- about 8,000 people in all -- and most of those are from West Africa, according to the survey report. And of those 8,000, just 4 percent work in "transportation and warehousing, and utilities," the category that includes taxi drivers. Biden’s office did not respond to a query.

pomt-10687	"For every single illegal immigrant family in this country, it costs $20,000 — it costs us $20,000; $20,000 in infrastructural costs. They pay about $10,000 in taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/tom-tancredo/one-cost-of-illegal-immigration-accuracy/	During an Oct. 9, 2007, debate, Tom Tancredo pressed to change immigration policy by making a dollars and cents argument. Tancredo said an average household with an undocumented worker costs the country more than it pays in taxes. PolitiFact found nothing to disprove Tancredo's statistics, but no one who could verify them — including his campaign. Asked where the statistics originated, Tancredo spokesman Alan Moore referred to the Center for Immigration Studies. Bryan Griffith, a center spokesman, said officials there know of no CIS report with those numbers. However, Griffith pointed to a 2004 report that showed families with undocumented immigrants contributed $4,200 on average to the federal government, but cost Uncle Sam $6,950. That's a long way from the $20,000 in costs and $10,000 in taxes line that Tancredo used. Pressed for more specifics, Tancredo's campaign at first asked for details on the very study it was citing. Weeks later, spokesman Moore pointed to another report. In a 2007 study, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, found that families with low-skilled immigrants cost taxpayers about $30,130 in 2004. Those households paid about $10,573 in taxes for 2004. But that study includes all low-skilled, immigrant households in America, representing 15.9-million people. About 60 percent were entirely legal households, and 40 percent had undocumented workers. Tancredo's statement is about undocumented workers only, so this study is off point. We found no other recent studies on the overall costs and benefits linked to families of undocumented workers. Moreover, critics point to flaws in the studies showing larger costs than contributions by undocumented workers. Tim Vettel of the American Immigration Law Foundation said he was uncertain where Tancredo's statistics originated but lumped them with other reports that the foundation, which promotes immigration, has criticized. Focusing more broadly on all immigration, the American Immigration Law Foundation said in November 2007 that most studies rely on one-year "snapshots" of the immigrant population without taking into account rising income and future tax contributions. The foundation also said the studies fail to count economic contributions such as consumer purchasing power. The Congressional Research Service reached the same conclusion after reviewing studies in 2005. Its report said information that typically is the basis for cost estimates is not collected, producing estimates based on assumptions and disagreement about accuracy. In the case of illegal immigration, analysts tend to disagree on how many government benefits undocumented workers actually use. "It is very difficult to enumerate a population which is trying to avoid detection by the government," analyst Alison Siskin wrote. Given the lack of information, and dispute over reports we did find, we rule Tancredo's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Tom Tancredo	None	None	None	2007-12-11T00:00:00	2007-10-09	['None']
pomt-06807	"We created a flat tax in the state of Utah."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-he-enacted-flat-tax-utah-governo/	During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman touted his record on taxes. When he was governor, he said, Utah had "historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country." This isn’t the first time Huntsman has made that claim. Our PolitiFact team in New Hampshire checked a similar comment Huntsman made at a July 4th, 2011, house party in Belmont, N.H. At that July 4 event, Huntsman said that when he was governor, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that "cut income taxes by 30 percent." Since Huntsman didn’t repeat the claim that this tax changes had "cut income taxes by 30 percent," we will only rate him now on the question of whether his administration "created a flat tax in the state of Utah." When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) While we gave Huntsman a Mostly False for his previous statement, most of our downgrade stemmed from our criticism of his claim that his policies "cut income taxes by 30 percent." The system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors. But it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax -- a single rate for all income groups. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06688	"We [the city of Atlanta] are overbuilt on housing."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/07/yolanda-adrean/slow-housing-market-poses-problems/	Anyone trying to sell real estate inside Atlanta’s city limits knows the once-red-hot market, with a few exceptions, is pretty chilly. Some experts are so despondent they see the Alpha and the Omega announcing the end of time. Others think we are in a housing slump that will right itself in a few years. There are many explanations for the downturn in the housing market. Atlanta City Councilwoman Yolanda Adrean tossed out one possibility in June when she said on the city’s website: "We are overbuilt on housing." Whoa. Let’s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing? To the Truth-O-Meter! Adrean said the statement is based on conversations she’s had with friends in the real estate business and articles she’s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory. "I would love to be wrong," Adrean told PolitiFact. Bill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been hit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead condominium market is clearly overbuilt. But he said that’s not what’s holding back the broader real estate market. "We’re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built," Adams said. "I think mostly it’s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines." Potential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don’t want to take on additional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market. Housing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas. And last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired. SmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed housing. The city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000. "We have a lot of vacant homes," he said. Even so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market. "Our inventory is way down," he said. Some economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory. The current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said. If the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area. This is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years. Bill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing and points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it’s generally agreed the city’s population has increased over the past 10 years. This would suggest the city’s problem is not an oversupply of housing. But Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand. This is why it’s a buyer’s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point. This was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean’s statement does not apply to some popular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city’s population continues to inch up, but demand is still low. The councilwoman is not wrong, but she’s not totally right either. Her statement is accurate but leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-06010	"When [Mitt Romney] was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/18/judy-manning/lawmaker-says-romney-performed-same-sex-marriages-/	Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has spent a lot of time trying to convince socially conservative voters that he really, really is one of them. Many, including one Georgia lawmaker, still do not think Romney is a true believer in their social and political principles. State Rep. Judy Manning, a Republican from Marietta, recently told The Marietta Daily Journal that she thinks the former Massachusetts governor is a flip-flopper and she is supporting Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman who was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. We thought one of her comments deserved a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. "When he was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages — and now, when he is running as president on the Republican ticket, he says that marriage is between a man and a woman," Manning said in the article. Did Romney actually perform 100 to 180 gay marriages? Didn’t Romney say in a nationally televised debate earlier this month that while he believes gay couples should have basic legal rights, one right they should not enjoy is marriage? We were curious to find out if Manning was right, particularly since she wasn’t sure about how many marriages Romney may have performed. Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg denied the claim. "That is simply and completely untrue," she said. We called Manning at her legislative office and at her home and sent the representative an email over the span of a week and did not get a reply. Romney was elected governor in 2002 and served from 2003 to 2007. In 2003, the Massachusetts State Judicial Court ruled that same-sex couples have the legal right to marry. Massachusetts has an obscure law that allows family members or friends to perform marriage ceremonies under a one-day marriage designation. The law includes same-sex couples. In 2006, The Boston Globe reported that Romney approved 189 special-issue, one-day marriage designations to same-sex couples in 2005. The article was a look into Romney’s approach on gay marriage as he considered a 2008 presidential run (which he later lost in the GOP primary). A Romney spokesman said in that article that he was bound by the law and had to approve those one-day marriage designations, although he opposed gay marriage. Maggie Gallagher, founder of the National Organization for Marriage, wrote a column in December praising Romney’s support for a federal marriage amendment and his efforts to fight against gay marriage in Massachusetts. The National Organization for Marriage has fought against same-sex marriage on the national and local level. Romney "apparently approved many more, both before and after 2005, but we have not been able to get any records on them," Steve Baldwin, former executive director of the Council for National Policy, said in a column that appeared in the National Review late last month. "There have been Freedom of Information Act requests to get more documents about this whole issue, but the state government has not been forthcoming." Massachusetts officials said their records of one-day marriage designations date back to 2006, not 2005, the year The Boston Globe examined. Massachusetts officials say they do not keep track of how many one-day marriage designations are approved annually for same-sex couples. MassEquality, a Boston-based group organized to preserve same-sex marriage equality, said Romney has not been supportive of gay marriage, and the group seriously doubted that he performed any ceremonies as governor. "The notion that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, presided over the weddings of same-sex couples is ridiculous," Executive Director Kara Suffredini told us via email. "To the contrary -- and contrary to the promises he made while campaigning for governor -- he did everything he could to position himself as the face of the anti-marriage movement, going so far as to revive an arcane and racist anti-miscegenation law to block out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts. Make no mistake, former Gov. Romney was no friend to loving same-sex couples and the thousands of children they are raising in Massachusetts." There’s no evidence that Romney has performed any gay marriage ceremonies. It appears Rep. Manning used the wrong language to describe Romney’s actions as governor because her estimate of how many marriages she thought he performed is very similar to the number of one-day marriage designations that The Boston Globe reported. Had Manning said Romney approved 100 to 180 one-day marriage designations, her statement would likely be correct. However, she used the word "performed," which suggests Romney actually officiated the ceremony and created a vastly different impression of the candidate’s stance on same-sex marriage for anyone who read that article.

pomt-04858	Says Barack Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/	A group known as American Principles in Action is running an ad targeting Hispanic voters in Nevada, trying to weaken their support for President Barack Obama. "Don’t be fooled by President Obama’s words," the narrator says. "He’s not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote. With the election on the line, he offers our undocumented youth a temporary solution that cheats them of legal status. Why didn’t he keep his promise to push immigration reform? Instead, Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. With friends like these, who needs enemies?" The group behind the ad, American Principles in Action is an affiliate of the American Principles Project, a group founded by conservative scholar Robert George of Princeton University. The group’s staff member responsible for Latino issues is Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under President George W. Bush. But while the group is independent of the campaign, the ad’s message helps Romney. Nevada is a key battleground state that Obama won in 2008 and which he’s eager to win again. Latinos are a significant voting bloc there and in other swing states that Obama won in 2008, such as Colorado and New Mexico. Polls this year have shown that Latinos heavily support Obama over Mitt Romney, in part because Romney took a tough line against illegal immigration during the GOP primaries. So Obama’s critics would like to shrink his lead among Latino voters, particularly in key states, either by bringing them over to Romney’s side or at least by making them less enthusiastic about Obama. The ad first dismisses Obama’s proposal in June to temporarily halt deportations of young people, saying it "cheats them of legal status." It then says Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history." Given the rhetoric that sometimes criticizes Obama for being weak on illegal immigration, we wondered if that was true. We found it was, for the most part. According to current figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the federal agency responsible for deportations -- Obama has removed 1.4 million people during his 42 months in office so far. Technically, that's fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush’s number covers eight full years, which doesn’t allow an apples-to-apples comparison. If you instead compare the two presidents’ monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents. We wondered whether there might have been a surge of undocumented immigrants that explained the increase, but there wasn’t. During the first two years of Obama’s tenure, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated the illegal immigrant population nationwide at 11.2 million, compared to an average during Bush’s eight-year tenure of 10.6 million. And illegal immigration actually peaked late in Bush’s second term, at which point the recession hit and the numbers declined under Obama. Such patterns do not explain the 57 percent bump in monthly deportations that we found under Obama. We should also note that if Obama doesn't win a second term, he will almost certainly finish his term trailing George W. Bush in deportations, which would make inaccurate the claim that Obama has "deported more people than any other president in this country's history." Still, the ad has a point in noting a significant uptick in deportations under Obama. We asked five immigration specialists -- Columbia University historian Mae M. Ngai, University of Albany historian Carl Bon Tempo, Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, University of California (Davis) law school dean Kevin R. Johnson and University of San Francisco law professor Bill Hing -- whether they thought the ad’s numerical claim was basically accurate, and they all agreed. Bon Tempo cautioned that some variations in data quality make long-term comparisons somewhat dicey. Still, he added that "it does seem that deportations are on the rise, and markedly so." Boosting the number of deportations in recent years are a program dating to the Bush years that targets "fugitive" aliens, as well as a program known as Secure Communities, under which federal immigration authorities are kept apprised of people who are fingerprinted at the state and local level. Hing, a critic of the program, says it has "gone way too far, sweeping up many crime victims, witnesses, arrestees whose charges are later dropped, and minor offenders." The American Civil Liberties Union has gone even further, with legislative counsel Joanne Lin saying that Obama’s enforcement policies overall have left a "wake of devastation in Latino communities across the nation," according to the Los Angeles Times. Obama has not been shy about touting his immigration-enforcement credentials, though he’s usually careful to say he’s prioritizing resources by focusing on deporting criminals rather than law-abiding people. For instance, during the speech in which he offered the youth non-deportation proposal, Obama said, "In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. … We focused and used discretion about whom to prosecute, focusing on criminals who endanger our communities rather than students who are earning their education. And today, deportation of criminals is up 80 percent. We've improved on that discretion carefully and thoughtfully." Ngai, the Columbia historian, perceives Obama’s tough enforcement policy as a tactical move. "My interpretation is that the Obama administration decided to be tough on ‘criminal’ aliens in order to get support for legalization of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record," Ngai said. Of course, Romney is widely considered to be taking a harder line on illegal immigration than Obama. According to his website’s statement on immigration policy, Romney opposes both "amnesty" and "all ‘magnets’ that entice illegal immigrants to come to our country. As governor, he vetoed in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants and opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants." Our ruling Technically, the ad isn’t correct to say that Barack Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history," since George W. Bush cumulatively deported more over his full eight-year term -- and since Bush would remain ahead of Obama if Mitt Romney wins the presidency in November. However, we -- and the experts we interviewed -- agree that the ad is right to note a significant jump in deportations under Obama. Measured by the monthly frequency of deportation, Obama’s numbers are significantly higher than Bush’s were, even as the estimated population of illegal immigrants was falling.

pomt-08329	Says Peter Kilmartin has "only three years experience in his own law practice."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/29/christopher-little/g-candidate-little-says-kilmartin-has-only-three-y/	Christopher Little, the Moderate Party's candidate for attorney general, has been attacking the qualifications of his Democratic opponent, Peter Kilmartin, by saying he has meager experience as a lawyer. "Only the insider candidate could have a hope of being attorney general with only three years experience in his own law practice. But that's what Kilmartin has," Little says in a television ad as it displays the words "Started private practice in 2007." After the Kilmartin campaign issued a news release labeling Little's accusation "completely false," we decided to see if the Truth-O-Meter would agree. Kilmartin's campaign says he has been a practicing lawyer since 1999, when he was admitted to the Rhode Island Bar. And Kilmartin has been touting his additional experience working as the officer in charge of the Pawtucket police prosecution bureau from 2001-2004. Kilmartin spokesman Brett Broesder sent us a copy of a Citizens Bank statement showing that Kilmartin opened up a business account prior to May 1, 1999; the address lists a law office at 393 Armistice Blvd, Pawtucket, where his name is on the sign beneath the names of three other attorneys. When asked for evidence of an early case that Kilmartin handled as a practicing attorney, Broesder sent along a District Court eviction notice for nonpayment of $425 in rent, listing Kilmartin as the landlord's lawyer. The date: July 14, 1999. Of course, one eviction notice does not a legal career make, so we asked for more, especially after we were unable to find Kilmartin's name listed in the "lawyers" section of any edition of the Verizon Yellow Pages from 2001-2005. In response, the campaign supplied us with copies of Kilmartin's Schedule C forms from his 1999-2005 tax returns. Schedule C is for reporting business profits and expenses. His business is listed as "legal services" and gives a new address of 598 Armistice Blvd., which is Kilmartin's residence. But the dollar amounts are blacked out, so we have no idea of the scope of his business, how many clients he has had over the years, or whether the blacked out figures were profits or losses. We asked his campaign to at least tell us his minimum or maximum income for any of those years. His spokesman declined. So it appears that although Kilmartin wasn't actively advertising his services to the general public (at least through the phone book), Kilmartin was doing at least some private practice work eight years earlier than Little's ad asserts. The Little campaign responded to our query by sending information showing that Kilmartin retired from the police department in 2007. Spokesman Robert LaChance asserted that between his police job and his work as a state representative in the General Assembly, Kilmartin could not have been an "active" lawyer until 2007 because he had other responsibilities. LaChance said the "active practice" designation is important, citing R.I. Supreme Court rules that say an out-of-state attorney is allowed to skip part of the Rhode Island Bar Association examination only if he or she has been in full-time practice for at least five years. But that rule doesn't apply to Kilmartin, who has had the right to practice in Rhode Island for more than a decade. LaChance said that "As far as what most lawyers would consider legal experience, [Kilmartin] has only been doing that for three years" when he retired from the police department. Maybe so. But Little's claim in his commercial makes no distinction between being a full-time ("active") or part-time lawyer. It says he has "only three years experience in his own law practice." Kilmartin's tax forms, showing that he was doing some degree of legal work -- as limited as it might be -- well before 2007 shows otherwise. The Truth-O-Meter rules that Little's claim is False.

But no matter the details, the point Edwards seeks to make is the same: Because they lack bank accounts, millions of poor must rely on expensive check-cashing services and payday loans. The Edwards campaign Website uses the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank for its figure of about 56 million people without accounts. The center got the number from a 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, which used U.S. Census data to estimate that 55.9-million adults did not hold checking, savings or money market accounts in 1999. But that number is at the high end of the available estimates. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million. The Census estimates 2.6 individuals per houshold, which would put the Federal Reserve estimate on bank accounts at 26-million at the very most because the Census household figure includes children.

pomt-13125	Says Donald Trump and Ron Johnson "oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingolds-attack-donald-trump-and-ron-johnson/	The tight Wisconsin U.S. Senate race has been marked by attacks made on GOP incumbent Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Russ Feingold. (We’ve highlighted 20 of them.) But ahead of the Nov. 8, 2016 election, Johnson and his fellow Republicans are also trying to tie Feingold to the unpopular Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. And Feingold and other Democrats are trying to hitch Johnson to the equally unpopular GOP nominee, Donald Trump. A Feingold radio ad released Oct. 26, 2016 makes a number of claims about Johnson and Trump on women’s issues, including saying they both "oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act, denying protections to victims of domestic violence." Let’s check both parts of the attack. Right to choose On abortion generally, Trump has been controversial. In Green Bay in March 2016, he said women should be punished for having an abortion. (Our In Context item fleshed out those remarks.) Then, hours later, Trump’s campaign posted a statement saying women are victims of abortion. When it comes more specifically to a woman’s right to choose, Trump went from pro-choice to anti-abortion, as our colleagues noted in rating True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina that Trump had "changed his mind" on abortion. As late as 2000, Trump wrote that he was pro-choice. But by 2011, he said he was anti-abortion, a position he has stated as recently as October 2016. Trump has said, including in his Green Bay remarks, that he supports exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape. Johnson is also anti-abortion. During his successful campaign to win Feingold’s seat in 2010, Johnson was asked if he Roe v. Wade was "settled law." He said the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion "was a real tragedy," saying it "usurped the democratic process." In this race, Johnson was endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which noted his support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a 2015 bill that would have generally banned abortion at 20 weeks and later. And Life News has urged support for Johnson, saying he has a "strong pro-life voting record." Feingold’s campaign also pointed out that in 2011, Johnson co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which declared "that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being beginning at the moment of fertilization, cloning, and other moment at which an individual comes into being." Johnson, however, has supported the three exceptions -- a position that drew some criticism from conservatives when he challenged Feingold in 2010. Violence Against Women Act The Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994. When it was reauthorized in 2005, it was set to expire in 2011. New reauthorization votes were taken in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Johnson was among 31 Republican senators who voted no. The bill passed the Senate, but died in the House. In 2013, the bill passed the Senate again, with Johnson among 22 Senate Republicans to vote no. The measure then passed the House and was signed into law. Like the 1994 version, the renewed law makes it easier to prosecute crimes against women in federal court, and provides such services as domestic abuse hotlines and shelters for battered women. The new bill was also extended to women of Native American tribal lands who are attacked by non-tribal residents, as well as to immigrants, gays and lesbians. It’s worth noting why Johnson said he voted no. Johnson issued a statement after his 2012 vote, saying in part: I believe it’s critical to ensure that laws are in place to prevent and deter crime – against both women and men. Regrettably, the debate over the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was completely politicized by the Senate Democratic leadership. Republicans offered very reasonable alternatives to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Senate Democrats today defeated proposals to provide U.S. marshals the tools they need to track sex offenders across state lines. They voted against legislation to establish an interstate database for DNA evidence, to ensure sex offenders are brought to justice regardless or the jurisdiction in which they commit their crimes. And they rejected legislation to provide additional funds to allow law enforcement to pursue justice for hundreds of thousands of women. Johnson also issued a statement following his 2013 vote, saying in part: In passing the Violence Against Women Act, the Democrat-controlled Senate turned the renewal of a non-controversial piece of legislation that had a history of strong bipartisan support into a divisive and highly partisan bill. As a result, the Senate has approved a piece of legislation that sounds nice, but which is fatally flawed. By including an unconstitutional expansion of tribal authority and introducing a bill before the Congressional Budget Office could review it to estimate its cost, Senate Democrats made it impossible for me to support a bill covering an issue I would like to address. Most analysts believe it would add more than $2 billion to the deficit. I voted for an alternative that did not have these serious flaws. That alternative would help deter and prosecute violence against women – without the inclusion of unconstitutional provisions. Our rating Feingold says Trump and Johnson "oppose a woman’s right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act." Trump and Johnson are anti-abortion, though Trump in particular has said he supports exceptions to allow abortion in certain cases. Johnson did vote no on reauthorizing the violence law, but it’s not as though he opposed protections for women; in fact, he voted for alternative measures that did not pass. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9098398a-5eba-4691-8b05-25a5f5b6640a	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-11-03T06:00:00	2016-10-26	['None']
pomt-00071	On Abigail Spanberger: "She got $2.2 million from ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2018/nov/02/dave-brat/dave-brats-linkage-george-soros-abigail-spanberger/	The spectre of George Soros - a billionaire philanthropist who supports liberal causes and is the focus of many conspiracy theorists - has entered the 7th District congressional race. Dave Brat, the Republican incumbent, is saying on conservative radio shows that Soros is behind the hefty fundraising of Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger. Spanberger had raised $4.5 million through Sept. 25, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commision. That was nearly double the $2.3 million raised by Brat - or a $2.2 million difference. Brat says Soros organizations are responsible for the difference. "She got $2.2 million from ActBlue," Brat said during an Oct. 21 interview on Breitbart News Sunday. "Your audience probably knows who they are, right? But that is the George Soros resistance group. That’s not even mainstream Democrat. That’s the group that’s doing the riots in Portland, that’s promoting violence and mobs instead of jobs." "...Abigail Spanberger is getting $2.2 million from the Soros-linked resist movement - ActBlue," Brat said during an Oct. 22 interview on the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth. "She raised $3 million in the last three months, which is unheard of, from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and ActBlue, which is a George Soros-backed group," Brat said during an Oct. 16 interview on News Radio WRVA in Richmond. "It’s her largest bundler which raises money, and that is the group that is behind the resistance movement across the United States." Soros has been high in the news lately. Some conservatives - including religious broadcaster Pat Roberston of Virginia Beach - have accused Soros of funding the migrant caravan from the Honduras to the United States - a charge the billionaire says is false and for which no supporting evidence has emerged. And on Oct. 22, a pipe bomb was found in the mailbox of Soros’ home near New York City - one of at least 14 explosives that had been mailed in late October to critics of President Donald Trump. We wondered whether Brat is right in claiming Spanberger’s campaign has received $2.2 million from a Soros-controlled group called ActBlue. Let’s take a look. What is ActBlue? ActBlue is a nonprofit organization that provides a software platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns through personal computers and cell phones. If you donate to a Democratic candidate on his or her website, there’s a good chance that ActBlue is the conduit that sends your money to the campaign - much like PayPal is the conduit for many online purchases. Since its inception in 2005, ActBlue says it has funneled $3 billion to Democratic candidates and "progressive" causes. Spanberger uses ActBlue, and has received several thousand individual contributions through the platform. They totaled almost $2.2 million through Sept. 25, which was the most current FEC reporting date available when Brat made his statements. Soros is among millions of people who have made contributions through ActBlue, according to Chris Fleming, spokesman for the nonprofit. "Soros has given through ActBlue, not to ActBlue," Fleming said. "Anyone can give through ActBlue." Fleming declined give the sum of Soros' donations to candidates through ActBlue. But he emphasized that Soros does not financially support ActBlue nor play a role in its operations. "ActBlue is in no way related to George Soros," he said. Soros has not personally given money to Spanberger’s campaign or to any Democrat running for Congress during this two-year election cycle, according to FEC records. Brat’s explanation We asked Brat’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that ActBlue "is the George Soros resistance group." Katey Price, Brat’s campaign spokesperson, sent an article from USA Today and blogs from two conservative websites: Human Events and The Daily Signal. On March 20, 2017, USA Today ran a story headlined, "George Soros-aligned group weighs funding anti-Trump activists." The article reported that Indivisible - a group seeking to build "resistance" to President Donald Trump’s agenda - was seeking support (successfully, it turns out) from the Democracy Alliance, an activist organization Soros helped found in 2005 that raises money through ActBlue. The Daily Signal - on Feb. 10, 2017 - reported that one member of Indivisible’s board of directors had previously worked for a Soros-funded group, and another member is now employed by an organization that has received money from the billionaire. That shows, according to the blog, that Soros has "loose ties" to Indivisible. ActBlue, the blog says "raises money" for Indivisible. Human Events - on July 7, 2009 - called ActBlue a mouthpiece "for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor." As proof, it wrote that "Soros directly donated $6,900 to ActBlue on May 11, 2008." Fleming said this is wrong; Soros contributed the sum "through" ActBlue to Scott Kleeb, a Nebraska Democrat who was running for the U.S. Senate. Our ruling Brat says of Spanberger, "She got $2.2 million for ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group." Brat is implausibly positioning Soros, the focus of many conservative theorists, as the power behind Spanberger’s campaign. ActBlue is not a Soros-controlled organization. It’s a nonprofit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to Democratic candidates and causes through their personal computers and cell phones. ActBlue is a conduit; it does not raise political money. As of Sept. 25, Spanberger had raised almost $2.2 million through ActBlue. The money came for from several thousand individuals, not Soros. Brat’s attempts to tie Soros to ActBlue and, therefore, Spanberger’s campaign - sometimes through third or fourth-hand links - is contrived and deceptive. We rate Brat’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12308	A waiver in the American Health Care Act "doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/22/john-faso/maternity-care-coverage-could-be-lost-through-stat/	The U.S. Senate health care bill would allow states to waive federal requirements for what insurance plans must cover. With state waivers, insurers could skip coverage of what the current Affordable Care Act now requires to be covered, known as essential health benefits like prescription drugs, laboratory services and hospitalization. Health insurance companies in those states would be able to sell lower-priced plans with less coverage. The House included the same provision in its Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act. Rep. John Faso, a Hudson Valley Republican, defended the provision in a radio town hall before the Senate version was released. "I read this provision extremely closely, and I don’t believe many, if any, governors will actually seek these waivers. It’s an extraordinarily limited waiver," Faso said. "It doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage." A spokesperson from Faso’s office said he was talking about how coverage for maternity care would still be required in New York state even if the state sought a waiver. Iinsurers are required to cover maternity care under New York state law, a distinction Faso did not make in his claim. Is Faso right that the new waivers would not apply to coverage for maternity care? Law on maternity care coverage Maternity care is included in one of ten health care categories insurance plans have to cover under federal law. Those categories, the essential health benefits, were established in 2010 as part of Obamacare. The benefits only apply to individual and group plans with 100 or fewer members, known as small group plans in New York state. Most states define small group plans as those with 50 or fewer members. The House and Senate bills would allow states to waive the essential health benefits requirement. Insurers in those states would not have to cover any benefit not mandated by that state’s law. "The waiver that was included in the American Health Care Act allows states to redefine essential health benefits as it applies to individual and small market groups in their state," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow in the Center of Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. "Maternity coverage is one thing that’s considered an essential health benefit today so a state could eliminate maternity care coverage in their state," Fiedler said. Maternity coverage was not federally mandated before Obamacare. Only 18 states required it in small group and individual plans prior to the 2010 health care law according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. Large group plans, those with more than 100 members in New York state, have been required to cover maternity care since the federal 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Will could happen? The Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency that provides nonpartisan fiscal analyses for Congress, predicted maternity care coverage would be lost in states that seek a waiver. "Services or benefits likely to be excluded from the EHBs in some states include maternity care, mental health and substance abuse benefits, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and pediatric dental benefits," the agency said in a report on the American Health Care Act. "If a state only waives the requirement that plans offer maternity coverage, then it’s unlikely any plan would voluntarily offer maternity coverage," said Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The CBO said maternity care may be offered by insurers in those states as a rider, or addition, to a plan. But that would not come cheap. "Without maternity coverage, new moms could expect to pay about $17,000 out-of-pocket," Cox said. "Or, if they tried to buy a rider, they could expect to pay more than $1,000 per month." Congress included $15 billion in the American Health Care Act for maternity care, mental health care, and substance use treatment. The CBO predicts that money will go to health care providers to reduce costs for patients instead of insurers. Our ruling Faso said a waiver in the American Health Care Act "doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage." The waiver applies specifically to maternity coverage. If a state does not require maternity coverage and is approved for a waiver, insurers there would not be required to cover maternity care. We rate his claim False.

pomt-00794	Says Hillary Clinton will receive her "congressional salary until she dies" and the Secret Service pays her mortgage.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/06/chain-email/chain-email-secret-service-pays-clintons-mortgage/	Now that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is nearing the launch of her 2016 presidential campaign, old rumors are starting to resurface. A reader forwarded us a chain email he received that calls out Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for shady financial decisions. Versions of this same email first circulated in 2001 and again in 2008, during Hillary Clinton’s first presidential run. And now it’s back. The email reads, in part: Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York State Senator now comes under this fancy "congressional retirement staffing plan" which means that if she never gets re-elected, she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies. If Bill out-lives her, he then inherits HER salary until he dies. He is already getting his Presidential salary ($20,000 a month) until he dies. If Hillary out-lives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies, Guess who pays for that? WE DO! Clinton's 20 Acre - $11 million mansion is common knowledge. For her to establish NY residency, they purchased this mansion in upscale Chappaqua, New York....makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense. Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments are around $10,000/month. But an extra residence had to be built by the government on the acreage to house the Secret Service Agents. Any improvement to the property is owned by the property owners...the Clinton's. So....the Clinton's charge the federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of the extra residence to house the Secret Service staff which is just about equal to their mortgage payment. There’s a lot to unravel here. Is any of it true? Short answer: No. Pensions First, let’s look at whether Clinton will receive her congressional salary until she dies. Upon retiring, Clinton would receive benefits through the Federal Employee Retirement System, which would also cover her time as secretary of state. However, the pension for a member of Congress must not exceed 80 percent of the member’s final salary, according to law. So even if she received the highest pension possible, she wouldn’t be getting her full salary. In fact, in Clinton’s case, it would be much lower. Pension annuities for federal employees are calculated using length of career, a benefits accrual rate and an average of the employees’ highest three salaries. Clinton spent eight years in the Senate and about four years as secretary of state, where she made her highest salary of about $186,000. Her accrual rate would be 1.7 percent. We did the calculation, based on the formulas in a Congressional Research Service report, and found that she would actually earn a pension of about $41,000 -- about 25 percent of her salary as a senator. And would Bill Clinton get that pension if he outlives Hillary? No -- according to the federal Office of Personnel Management, he could receive a maximum of 50 percent of her pension. As for Bill Clinton’s presidential pension, he receives about $220,000 a year, which is about 75 percent of his presidential salary, after adjusting for inflation. Taxpayer-funded mortgage? The email also implies that tax dollars are paying for the Clintons’ mortgage at their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. As it turns out, this was one of the very first claims PolitiFact ever fact-checked back in 2007. We rated it False, but let’s run through it quickly one more time. As all former presidents, Bill Clinton is entitled to Secret Service detail for the rest of his life, including protection at his home. According to a Secret Service spokesman quoted in a 2001 Washington Post article, it is customary for the government to pay rent to the property owners in a situation like this. However, the Clintons declined that rent. Former White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert told the Washington Post that "the Clintons are entitled to collect rent from the agency for space at their Chappaqua, N.Y., home but have declined the payments of about $1,100 a month." When we looked at this in 2007, Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said, "They have not and do not receive money" from the Secret Service. This time around, we asked current spokesman Nick Merrill, who said, "this is the same as it used to be, nothing has changed since last time you reported this." We should point out that the Clintons purchased their Chappaqua house in 1999 for $1.7 million, not $11 million as the email says. They also purchased it on a certain type of mortgage that required they pay back the entire amount within five years with monthly mortgage payments of about $8,000, according to the New York Times. Even if the Clintons got the $1,100 rent from the Secret Service, it would not have covered the size of their monthly mortgage. This is not to say the Clintons aren’t wealthy -- and they still receive a good amount of money from the government because of Bill Clinton’s presidency. But the claims in this email are in no way accurate. Our ruling A chain email said Hillary Clinton will receive her "congressional salary until she dies" and that the Secret Service pays her mortgage. Actually, a pension for a member of Congress cannot exceed 80 percent of the member’s last salary, according to law. Using federal employee retirement system formulas, Clinton’s retirement pension would likely work out to be about 25 percent of her congressional salary, about $41,000 a year. And while the Clintons are eligible to receive rent payments from the Secret Service -- who need space to operate at the Clintons’ house -- the rent amount would not have covered their mortgage payments. In any case, the Clintons do not accept these rent payments. We rate these claims Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2015-04-06T15:30:00	2015-04-06	['None']
pomt-14101	"Austin is number one in Texas in startups, venture capital and patents."	true	/texas/statements/2016/may/13/steve-adler/steve-adler-correctly-says-austin-no-1-texas-start/	Austin’s typically soft-spoken mayor recently popped a big-as-Texas boast. "There’s a reason Austin is number one in Texas in startups and venture capital and patents," Steve Adler said. Adler, speaking outside City Hall, went on: "There’s a reason that tech and transportation companies come to Austin to roll out their new initiatives. And that’s because Austin is where good ideas become real. Claiming that Austin is anti-innovation has no basis in fact." Hear hear! Still, we wondered about the rankings Adler declared while revealing his plans to vote against a ballot proposition, later rejected by voters, affecting background checks of drivers for ride-hailing services. Startups Adler's office didn't immediately offer his backup. Meantime, our online search for information on startups led us to a June 2015 report from the Kansas City-based Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation stating that in the "last year," the Austin metropolitan area ranked No. 1 nationally for the area’s pace launching startups, which the foundation defined as "firms less than one-year old employing at least one person besides the owner." Asked what "last year" means in the report, foundation researcher E.J. Reedy advised by phone the conclusion tied to data from 2012 and 2014. According to the foundation, which says it focuses on improving lives through education and entrepreneurship, the nation’s top 10 metropolitan areas for "startup activity" among the 40 most-populous metropolitan areas were: Austin; Miami, Fla.; San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles; Denver; San Francisco; New York; Houston; San Diego; and San Antonio." Per Adler’s Texas point, the Austin area had 180.8 startups per 100,000 residents, the foundation says, outpacing the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area (142.5 startups per 100,000 residents), Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown (136.9 startups per 100,000 residents) and the San Antonio-New Braunfels area (111.9 startups per 100,000 residents). By email, foundation spokeswoman Lacey Graverson told us the presented concentrations drew on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics to tally startups matched with population data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Reedy agreed by phone that among the big Texas cities, the Austin area had the greatest concentration of startups. But generally, Reedy indicated, counts of startups can vary, partly because there’s no single accepted definition of startups, which inherently come and go at a rapid pace. The government has official measures, Reedy added, but each one captures an aspect -- for instance new employer businesses or newly self-employed individuals. Also, Reedy said, observers differ over what merits counting. Some stress large firms that employ many, he said, others urge a fix on technology firms and others say that any count should recognize small businesses (including one-person endeavors) that grow by an employee or two a year. A foundation chart presenting Austin’s "startup density" since the late 1970s indicates the area has had peppier times--including in 2008 (201.7 startups per 100,000 residents), 2006 (214.9), 1999 (217.9) and, the chart’s high point, 1981 (499.5), which was up a huge measure from 1980 (31.4): SOURCE: Web page, "Startup Activity, Austin Area, 2015," Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, June 4, 2015 (viewed May 5, 2016) Venture capital Next, we turned to exploring Austin’s ranking for venture capital, which describes money invested in a business or project at considerable risk. A January 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story, citing a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, said Austin entities in 2015 were "by far" the state’s largest recipients of venture capital, with $740 million; Dallas firms placed second, fielding $214.4 million, ahead of Houston outfits, at $160 million. The Austin-connected investments added up to the largest annual dollar figure for Austin since 2001, the newspaper said, when 127 companies received $1.14 billion. By email, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford pointed out another account of the survey results; a Silicon Hills News story said the 99 Austin deals in 2015, mostly to develop software, were down from 114 in 2014. Also, the story said, Austin’s number one deal for the latest year was Civitas Learning, attracting $60 million in venture capital, followed by Aeglea Biotherapeautics with $44 million, Mirna Therapeutics with $41.8 million and SpareFoot with $30 million, the story said. Nationally in 2015, the Statesman story said, venture capital investments rose to $58.8 billion, up 22 percent from the year before. Silicon Valley, as usual, took in the most money, with the San Jose area receiving $27.3 billion in 1,333 deals, the story said. Patents Stanford said Adler made his claim about Austin leading Texas in patents based on a May 2010 Forbes.com article by Andy Greenberg stating that Austin and neighboring Round Rock had "produced an impressive average 1.7 patents for every thousand residents over the last 12 months," the second-most per-capita of any metro area in the country, he wrote. Greenberg elaborated: "Austin’s culture of innovation may be boosted by well-known tech credentials like the South by Southwest (SXSW) Web startup and music festival held annually in March, as well as the nearby headquarters of hardware industry giants Dell and Freescale Semiconductor. But they also have two secret weapons in the innovation race: the University of Texas’s Cockrell School of Engineering, and IBM’s Austin research lab. "IBM produces more patents than any other company in the world, and for the last seven years Austin has produced more of those patents than any other IBM office. In total the lab produced 880 patents in 2009. That’s just 30 less than all of Cisco, and 300 more than Sun Microsystems, Boeing, AT&T or Toyota." We were unable to confirm or duplicate Greenberg’s Austin conclusion. To get our own sense of how Texas cities stand in patents originated, we reached out to the Dallas-based regional office of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. By email, spokesman Ryan Elliott pointed out patent counts posted by the office indicating that in 2012-13 and from 2000 through 2013, the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area generated more patents than the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area. However, the regions’ raw counts were close, according to the agency, while the Austin area was responsible for more patents than any other Texas area from 2009, 2010 and 2011 through 2013, by our reckoning. Snapshot: The Austin area was responsible for 12,387 patents from 2009 through 2013, according to the office, with the Dallas area accounting for 11,546 patents -- which we took to mean that the less populous Austin area ran well ahead of the Dallas area in patents per 1,000 residents. Our search for relevant analyses led to a 2013 report by the Brookings Institution finding that from 1980 to 2012, most U.S. patents--63 percent--had been developed by people living in just 20 metro areas home to 34 percent of the U.S. population. "Reflecting the advantages of large metropolitan economies," the report said, "92 percent of U.S. patents are concentrated in just 100 metro areas, with 59 percent of the population. For patents applied for from 2007 to 2011, the metro areas with the highest number per capita are San Jose; Burlington, VT; Rochester, MN; Corvallis, OR; and Boulder, CO." The authors wrote: "From 1980 to 2011, a few large metros notably changed their share of U.S patents. At the top, San Jose moved up from ninth to first, and San Francisco moved from seventh to fourth, moving ahead of Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Boston. Seattle and San Diego moved up 15 and nine places, respectively, to become seventh and eighth. Meanwhile, Austin and Raleigh moved up 41 and 55 places, respectively, to become 11th and 20th. Cleveland fell 10 slots from 13th to 23rd, while Philadelphia fell from fourth to 13th." Not only did Austin surge in total patents, it lately achieved a high ranking in per-capita patents. From 2007 through 2011, a chart in the report indicates, the Austin metro area had 1,503 patents per million residents, tops in Texas and placing the area fourth nationally among high-patent areas behind San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California (5,066 patents per million residents); Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, New York (1,829); and San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont (1,638). In Texas, the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metro area had 379 patents per million residents and the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area had 310 per million, according to Brookings. Next, we heard back from Mark Muro of Brookings who shared a chart that he said was based on a different data source -- global PCT patents, meaning the international patent system rather than the U.S. PTO. By that metric, the chart suggests that from 2008 through 2012, the Houston metropolitan area generated more cutting-edge "technology" patents per 1,000 residents (1,598) than the Austin area (1,294). An excerpt: SOURCE: Chart ranking 100 U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas in tech patents invented per 1,000 population, 2008-2012 (received by email from Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings, May 5, 2016) Regardless of those results, Muro and a Brookings colleague, Nick Marchio, suggested we hew to the U.S. patent office counts as the best general way of assessing the mayor’s claim. Marchio even volunteered to adjust the patent office’s raw counts for the population of each metropolitan area. Result: In 2013, the latest year of tabulated patents, the Austin area ranked No. 11 nationally with 1.55 patents per 1,000 residents, far outpacing the No. 2 Texas metro, Dallas, at 51st with 0.44 patents per 1,000 residents. Also, from 2009 through 2013, the Austin area ranked 10th nationally with 6.95 patents per 1,000 residents, far ahead of the No. 2 Texas metro, in this case the Houston area, which landed 52nd nationally with 1.81 patents per 1,000 residents. Our ruling Adler said: "Austin is number one in Texas in startups, venture capital and patents." Houston has been running ahead in international technology patents, it looks to us, but Austin lately leads the state in overall patents, startups and venture capital. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09624	“Illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/lamar-smith/rep-lamar-smith-says-immigrants-hold-8-million-job/	In response to a new Democratic proposal to overhaul immigration laws, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith noted that a large number of illegal immigrants have jobs in the United States and suggested that one way to reduce the unemployment rate would be to free up those jobs for citizens and legal immigrants. Smith, R-San Antonio, said the illegal immigrants hold 8 million jobs, according to a news release distributed Dec. 15. Arguing against the Democrats’ proposal to provide millions of immigrants a path to citizenship, Smith says U.S. policies should “put American workers, American taxpayers, and American citizens first, not those who are in the country illegally. This is the kind of legislation that foreign governments would promote, not the U.S. Congress.” He added that “allowing millions of illegal immigrants to stay and take jobs away from citizens and legal immigrants is like giving a burglar a key to the house. Illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs. Those stolen jobs rightfully belong to citizens and legal immigrants.” Leaving aside the question of whether any of those jobs were "stolen" from their rightful owners, we wondered whether Smith's 8 million figure — about the same as the population of Virginia — was correct. Do illegal immigrants hold that many jobs? Smith’s source for the number is a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, Jeffrey Passel, who analyzed the relevant data for an April 2009 report, “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” The Pew center is a research organization that seeks to “improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population.” Using March 2008 data, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau, Passel estimated that the number of undocumented workers in the United States was 7.8 million, so Smith is clearly in the ballpark. But is it fair of the congressman to make his statement about jobs when the data refers to workers? Passel said yes. We found a wrinkle, though. Economic conditions have changed since March 2008. Smith’s statement suggests that the 8 million is a current figure, but the data used for that estimate are more than 20 months old. Since then, millions of people have lost their jobs, including many undocumented immigrants. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate for March 2008 was 5.1 percent; that figure has skyrocketed, to 10 percent, in December 2009. That month, more than 15 million people were without jobs. Immigrants have been hit harder in the economic downturn. The unemployment rate for immigrants, without regard to their citizenship status, has gone up faster than that of natives, Passel said. With huge job losses across all demographic groups, Passel said the number of employed illegal immigrants has most likely dropped. Passel suggested that today the number is closer to 7 million. So Smith is right that millions of jobs are held by illegal immigrants. Yet by citing numbers that were 20 months old, he didn't account for conditions that have caused some of those jobs to disappear. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05167	Says President Barack Obama wants to raise "the lowest (income) tax rate from 10 to 15 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/17/reince-priebus/gop-leader-reince-priebus-says-obama-wants-raise-l/	When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus talked with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on June 5, 2012, it was primarily to discuss Gov. Scott Walker’s victory that night in the historic Wisconsin recall election. But Priebus, the former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, quickly turned his sights to the November 2012 presidential election, telling the conservative TV talk show host that President Barack Obama is not a mainstream Democrat. The example cited: Taxes. "And you know, what does Barack Obama want to do?" Priebus asked. "Raise the poorest -- the lowest tax rate -- from 10 to 15 percent." There’s been a fierce debate in recent months about whether the wealthiest Americans should pay more in income taxes. But does Obama really want to raise the lowest income rate by half to 15 percent? Bush-era tax cuts When we asked Republican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney for evidence to back Priebus’ claim, he said the lowest rate would rise to 15 percent if the so-called Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire. So, let’s first get an understanding of those. As we noted in rating Mostly False a U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim against U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under GOP President George W. Bush. Their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010. In December 2010, Congress voted to extend the tax cuts through 2012 and Obama signed the measure into law. But where does Obama stand now on extending the cuts and maintaining the lowest income tax rate at 10 percent? Priebus’ evidence Mahoney provided six pieces of information that he said show what Obama "has considered doing" in relation to the tax cuts. 1. A February 2010 Bloomberg news article quoted Obama as saying he is "agnostic" about raising taxes on households that earn less than $250,000 (and individuals who earn less than $200,000). At most, that’s an indication Obama -- more than two years ago -- was open to raising taxes on non-wealthy Americans. The article doesn’t address raising the lowest tax rate to 15 percent. 2. A February 2012 book, The Escape Artists by Noam Scheiber, says Obama was "intrigued" -- in 2009 -- by the idea of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. Being "intrigued" by an idea three years ago doesn’t show Obama now wants to allow the tax cuts to expire in a way that would raise the lowest tax rate. 3. In July 2011, The Washington Post reported that a White House official "argued" Obama could block extension of the Bush tax cuts, either as a final act in office or after winning a second term. But a staff member’s strategizing or speculation nearly a year ago doesn’t equate to what the president wants to do now in terms of the lowest tax rate. 4. The same day, Post blogger Ezra Klein pointed out the Democrats wouldn’t have to take any action in order for the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012. That’s not evidence of Obama’s intent, however. Moreover, the opinion article also says that about four-fifths of the Bush tax cuts go to households making less than $250,000 a year," and that the Obama administration doesn’t "want to raise taxes on those folks." 5. Then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden said in a National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare survey in 2007 he would "roll back tax cuts on dividends and capital gains." Not only is that not a statement about Obama’s desires, it’s not even a statement about income tax rates. 6. New Yorker Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza wrote in June 2012 about federal tax and budget discussions between Republicans and Democrats, saying: "Several White House officials I talked to made it clear that if a deal, or at least the framework for a deal, is not reached before December 31st Obama would allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire -- a tactic that would achieve huge deficit reduction, but in a particularly painful and ill-conceived fashion. The administration is preparing for that outcome, and Republicans may not be willing to budge without the threat of this cataclysm." Lizza wrote that Obama senior adviser David Plouffe said, "I think we’re going to have the ability to tell the American people, ‘Hey, your taxes may go up on January 1st because these guys refuse to ask the wealthy to do anything. Hey, there are going to be cuts in spending that aren’t done as smartly as they could because these guys won’t agree to ask anything from the wealthy.’ " This suggests that if a fiscal compromise with the GOP can’t be reached, Obama might allow the tax cuts to expire, which would raise the lowest rate to 15 percent. But that’s not evidence that Obama, as Priebus claimed, wants to raise the rate. Other evidence We asked for a response from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin. She noted that in his 2013 budget message, issued in February 2012, Obama opposed extending the Bush tax for families earning over $250,000 per year. But he supports extending the rest of the tax cuts, Morris said. We also interviewed tax experts at two national think tanks: Alan Viard, resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. They agreed that if the Bush tax cuts expire, the lowest income tax rate would rise to 15 percent from 10 percent. But they also agreed that Obama has consistently backed extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone but families earning $250,000 and individuals earning $200,000. Under Obama’s proposal, Williams said, the two highest tax rates would rise to 36 percent from 33 percent and to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. But the lowest rate would remain at 10 percent. Our rating Priebus said Obama wants to raise "the lowest (income) tax rate from 10 to 15 percent." He provided no evidence that that is the president’s position. And experts agree Obama does not support raising the lowest rate. We rate Priebus’ statement False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2012-06-17T09:00:00	2012-06-05	['None']
pomt-07374	"America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/05/gerry-connolly/gerry-connolly-says-us-owns-3-percent-worlds-oil-c/	During a House floor speech on May 3, 2011, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., addressed the recent jump in gasoline prices, saying that energy independence and lower gasoline prices will come from higher automobile fuel efficiency and new sources of domestic energy, including wind, solar and biofuels. In making the argument, Connolly cited a statistic showing how out-of-proportion the United States’ oil consumption is. "America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves," Connolly said. We thought we’d check his statistic. We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal clearinghouse for energy statistics. For the first part of Connolly’s statement -- "America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil" -- we turned to a table showing proven reserves of crude oil internationally. For 2009 -- the most recent year with full data available -- the United States had proven reserves of slightly under 20.7 billion barrels, compared with more than 1.34 trillion barrels for the world as a whole. That works out to be 1.5 percent of the world total -- about half of what Connolly said, but still a small percentage of the global total. As for the second part of his statement -- that the U.S. "consumes 25 percent of (the world’s) global reserves" -- we found an EIA table showing international oil consumption. For 2009, the U.S. consumed 18.8 million barrels a day, compared with 84.3 million barrels a day for the world as a whole. That works out to 22 percent -- a little low, but once again, in the right ballpark. When we checked with Connolly’s office, they sent us a few documents with figures more in line with the ones the congressman had cited, but when we looked at them, we noticed that they cited statistics from between 1999 and 2004. So we’ll stick with our numbers. Bottom line: Connolly’s numbers are a little low because they are out of date, but his general point -- the U.S. consumes a disproportionate share of the world’s oil -- is valid. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Gerry Connolly	None	None	None	2011-05-05T09:50:09	2011-05-03	['United_States']
pomt-14493	Says Donald Trump hired illegal workers "from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-donald-trump-had-pay-1-million-hi/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens. "He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment," Rubio said. "That’s a fact. People can look it up. I’m sure people are Googling it right now, ‘Trump Polish workers.’ You’ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did." "Wrong, wrong," Trump said. We did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to media reports about a protracted class-action lawsuit involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago. Rubio is right about the Polish workers, but it’s unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Here’s the story. Sometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump’s tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the "Polish Brigade." The Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed. In 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said. Appearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented. "Nobody’s proven to me that they were were illegal," Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time. Nonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative "knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work" and that his company participated in a "conspiracy" to cheat the union. Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney’s fees and costs, Stewart ruled. That wasn’t the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade. In 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the New York Times about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didn’t know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court "on principle," according to the New York Times. If the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the Times calculated. A year later, Trump quietly settled, according to the New York Daily News, but the agreement was placed under seal. "It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides," labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the New York Daily News. Our ruling Rubio said Trump "hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment." It was Trump’s contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn’t know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest. But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so it’s unclear how much he ended up doling out.

pomt-03092	The U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education.	true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/25/david-watts/1982-supreme-court-decision-texas-case-said-public/	Running for Texas land commissioner, Republican David Watts noted in a campaign email Sept. 16, 2013, that a big part of the job is managing public land to generate money for public schools. To make that money go farther, he said, Texas should use it only for educating children here legally. "Unfortunately," Watts wrote, "the (U.S.) Supreme Court decided in 1982 (Plyler v. Doe) that non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents) must be given a free K-12 education." We wondered about the details of this 30-year-old decision in a Texas case that is sometimes compared to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education anti-segregation ruling but has "none of the same fame," as a Dallas Morning News retrospective news story said June 11, 2007. "It is absent from Texas history lessons. … Yet the Plyler case has been used as a defense against countless proposals aiming to deny rights to illegal immigrants," the News story said, because it affirmed that a constitutional protection covered people who were illegally living in the United States. Watts, a businessman who lives outside Longview, emailed us links to the Plyler opinion and analysis of it, plus a Dec. 5, 2010, Dallas Morning News news story that used data from the Pew Hispanic Center, state government and other sources to estimate that 3 percent of Texas schoolchildren in 2009 were in the United States illegally and educating them cost the state more than $1 billion per year. Texas’ Legislature, the Plyler opinion said, changed state education law in 1975 to let school districts refuse entry to children who weren’t legal U.S. residents and to allow the state to hold back money being sent to districts to educate such students. Two years later, Tyler’s school district began charging $1,000 tuition per year for children without legal documentation. A class-action lawsuit naming Tyler school superintendent James Plyler went to Judge William Wayne Justice’s U.S. District Court for Texas’ Eastern District. In his 1978 ruling, Justice, already known for groundbreaking decisions in civil rights cases, agreed with the plaintiffs that Texas’ law (and Tyler’s policy) broke the 14th Amendment "equal protection" guarantee that laws in the U.S. be applied to all people in the same way. Undocumented children, Justice found, have the same right to attend public schools in Texas as U.S. citizens. His decision was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then, in 1982, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which extended the right nationwide. Texas had argued, in part, that illegal immigrants were not protected by the 14th Amendment. Justice found, and the Supreme Court affirmed, that though not citizens of the U.S., they were "within its jurisdiction," as the amendment puts it, and so effectively denying the children an education because of their illegal status was unconstitutional. We checked Watts’ claim against the Supreme Court’s words. Watts specified that the ruling applied to "non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents)" and that the Supreme Court said they "must be given a free K-12 education." The parents’ legal status wasn’t at issue in this case, and how the children entered the country was raised in the legal debate -- typically it was held that the children were not responsible for breaking immigration law because their parents made the decisions -- but it also was not an essential part of the law or the court rulings. The high court’s Plyler opinion begins, "The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens." K-12, kindergarten through 12th grade, spans elementary education plus middle school and high school, which is what Texas school districts provide at no cost to students, though families and others pay school-supporting taxes. Public state universities offer "higher" education, but charge tuition and also depend on tax-generated aid. (Texas and some other states, using logic similar to that in the Plyler decision, offer in-state tuition rates to non-citizens who graduated from the state’s public schools.) Texas’ 1975 election law changes, as quoted in Justice’s opinion, said any child who was "a citizen of the United States or a legally admitted alien" could attend Texas districts’ public schools and benefit from state education dollars. The Supreme Court decision, which was delivered by Justice William Brennan and frequently cited Justice’s findings, examined the parts of Texas’ argument that hinged on the children’s illegal status and concluded Texas had not proven it was justified in singling them out. Texas argued it was in the state’s interest to keep resources focused on educating legal residents. In the Supreme Court opinion, Brennan wrote that because citizenship was a federal status, Texas’ law had to fit in with the purposes of federal laws. If Texas was claiming it would help keep illegal immigrants out of the U.S., Brennan said, then this education law was a poor way to achieve that. If Texas was claiming that these children imposed a financial burden that lowered the statewide quality of education, Brennan said, then it had failed to provide (as Justice wrote) "any credible evidence" that was so. Finally, Brennan said, Texas appeared to be suggesting that these children were less likely to stay in the U.S. because of their legal status, meaning the state would not benefit from their future productivity -- so using their legal status as a criterion for keeping them out was justified. Brennan said Texas had no way to know whether any schoolchildren, legal or not, would use their education in Texas, and that "the record is clear" many non-citizen children would stay in the U.S. "It is difficult to understand precisely what the state hopes to achieve by promoting the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime," he wrote. "It is thus clear that whatever savings might be achieved by denying these children an education, they are wholly insubstantial in light of the costs involved to these children, the state, and the nation." Brennan concluded, "If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest. No such showing was made here. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases is affirmed." Our ruling Watts said the Supreme Court decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education.

pomt-01302	Leticia Van de Putte "voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/29/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-leticia-van-de-putte-voted-stop-s/	A TV ad from Republican Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, unsurprisingly criticizes his Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor, Leticia Van de Putte, for opposing "school choice," which can describe public dollars made available for students to attend private schools. Another statement in the ad delivers more of a shock: "Liberal Leticia actually voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony," the narrator says, "convicted" appearing in red. We were unaware of any lawmakers voting to keep schools from firing felons. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said the claim reflected a vote by Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, against a 2011 measure passed into law making it easier for Texas schools to fire teachers convicted of felonies. We looked at the change in law and at Van de Putte’s related votes on House Bill 1610, which originated in the House but was carried in the Senate by Patrick. Then we gauged if her ultimate opposition to the proposal was the same as voting against schools removing felons. House Bill 1610 The adopted change in law permitted a school that becomes aware of a worker’s felony conviction to suspend the employee without pay or void his or her contract and terminate the worker "as soon as practicable," without a provision for teacher appeals. Teacher groups and the Texas Education Agency told us districts already could remove felons. But under the previous law, teachers had "due process" rights. Those were eliminated by the 2011 measure, potentially saving school districts time and money. By email, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Lauren Callahan said the pre-2011 law said a district could terminate a teacher for "good cause" after giving proper notice and giving the teacher the option of a hearing and possible appeal to the state education commissioner. "For teachers convicted of a felony, HB 1610 removed the teacher’s right to notice, a hearing and appeal to the commissioner," Callahan said. which made "it quicker, easier and cheaper for school districts to terminate teachers convicted of felonies." Callahan also pointed out a pro-and-con House Research Organization analysis of the legislation cited by Patrick stating that under the previous law, a teacher could be immediately fired only if he or she was convicted of a violent crime or a crime against a minor, leaving out crimes that destroy public trust, such as theft, burglary, and embezzlement, the report said. In contrast, the analysis said, opponents of the proposal said the changes could lead to a teacher losing his or her teaching certificate for any felony, which could punish some teachers needlessly for mistakes made in their younger years. The report continued: "The current system works and should be maintained. The bill would take away a teacher’s right to due process by prohibiting an appeal. If a school district or charter school was wrong to terminate a teacher, the teacher would have no recourse to challenge the decision." Van de Putte’s actions We divined more detail from legislative records including audio and video available online. According to March 22, 2011, testimony by a Houston-area school lawyer to the Texas House Committee on Public Education, under the old law districts wishing to act against a felon-teacher had to present a case for termination before an independent hearing examiner, a process costing money and taking 90 to 120 days, lawyer David Hodgins testified. "These are very rare situations," Hodgins told the House panel. "But when they do happen, they are very critical to a school district." According to a May 2011 summary of the legislation by the Texas Senate Research Center, an educator convicted of certain felonies, including felonies involving a minor, already could have their teaching certificate revoked. The summary said the law also required that an educator be removed from campus or administrative office upon notice of the conviction, but the law didn’t require anyone to be fired immediately. "As a result, many school districts place these individuals on paid administrative leave when scheduled for termination rather than go through a costly administrative hearing process," the center said. In the 2011 session, the Texas State Teachers Association, Association of Texas Professional Educators and Texas Federation of Teachers opposed the quick-termination proposal, while it the support of the Texas Association of School Boards and Texas Association of School Administrators, according to witness lists created by House and Senate committees that advanced the measure. According to Texas Senate records, Van de Putte supported and opposed the proposal at different times. Specifically: --On March 23, 2011, she voted for a committee substitute for the House-originated proposal and asked to be shown as making the motion to send the revised measure to the full Senate; --On May 21, 2011, when the Senate took up the proposal, she expressed misgivings about the sweep of the plan, but also told colleagues that "certainly" if a teacher was convicted of a felon, his or her school should be able to act quickly. Van de Putte also unsuccessfully offered an amendment to remove the provision for quickly terminating school employees who’d received "deferred adjudication" for felonies. "My worry," she told colleagues, "is that deferred adjudication does not imply guilt." Her amendment also sought to limit those felonies enabling speedy firings to ones related to a worker’s job performance. Senators tabled her amendment after Patrick said it "guts the bill." --A moment later, she was among nine Democrats to vote against the final version of the proposal. By email, Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia said Van de Putte made her favorable committee motion as a favor to the panel’s chair, then-Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano. Garcia said Van de Putte voted for the same version in committee "because she supported it in principle, however she also acted in good faith that her concerns of the bill being overly broad would be addressed on" the "Senate floor, where she would offer an amendment." Garcia said: "Her concerns were that the language of the bill did not account for when the offense occurred in that person’s life and allowed for it to include" a "first-time felony-level off-duty DWI conviction." After her proposed changes were spurned by the Senate, he said, she voted against final approval. Meaning of voting 'no' So, was the Democrat’s "no" vote in the end also a vote to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of felonies, as Patrick says? Callahan of the education agency offered no comment on that while teacher groups, some supportive of Van de Putte’s candidacy, each stressed the previous law’s permission for districts to fire teachers for good cause. Monty Exter, lobbyist for the ATPE, said by email: "Voting down HB 1610 would not have stopped schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony; it would have simply required districts to continue to observe the teachers’ due-process rights in situations not already covered by" a measure passed into law in 2007. That year’s Senate Bill 9 required districts to remove a teacher convicted of either violent crimes or a crime requiring registration as a sex offender. Van de Putte voted for its final passage. By phone, Lonnie Hollingsworth, an attorney and advocate for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, said Patrick’s claim was largely incorrect, though it is so that Van de Putte voted to stop schools from terminating teachers convicted of a felony "without due process." Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte "voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony." Nope. There was never a vote to stop schools from firing teachers convicted of a felony. Still, Van de Putte voted against making it easier to terminate such teachers – a toughening that was supported by Patrick to wipe out the right of teachers to request an independent hearing before being let go.

pomt-14499	Says that in the Philippines more than a century ago, Gen. John Pershing "took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood," and shot 49 Muslim rebels. "The 50th person, he said, ‘You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.’ And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-cites-dubious-legend-about-gen-pershi/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. "They were having terrorism problems, just like we do," Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. "And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem." After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a "legend." We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump’s takeaway is wrong-headed. We’ll take a look at those two concerns separately below. Did it happen? The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin "to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers," Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. Snopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005. But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines. "Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal," according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal. However, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.) Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least. "This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited," said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. "I am amazed it is still making the rounds." Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that "I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character." Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to "pacifying" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. "He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply." Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. "The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims," Janda said. "This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism." Facts aside, Trump’s larger point is wrong To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified "terrorists" is actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable. "Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense," said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region "remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present." Silbey of Cornell agreed. "Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked," he said. "The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism." If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative. "The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied," Janda said. "It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies." Our ruling Of the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact. Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump’s claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents "were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins." In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: "Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics." While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, they do not support the claim Trump made. There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig’s blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today. When we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion.

pomt-12365	"The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/06/david-lewis/thousands-more-children-and-families-could-soon-ge/	Thousands of North Carolina parents hoping to get their children into free preschool classes might have cause for hope during budget negotiations this month. Last year, nearly 5,000 children were on a waiting list for NC Pre-K, the state-run program that prepares 4-year-olds for school. The N.C. House and Senate have each passed budget proposals, and now they’re negotiating which provisions to keep and which to change or jettison. One of the main budget writers in the House said that if his chamber gets its way on Pre-K funding, that waiting list could go away entirely – giving thousands of needy children an educational head start that their parents might not otherwise be able to afford. "The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget," Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a tweet. So we started combing through the 356-page budget proposal to find out if he was right. Broad political agreement If Lewis is right – and if the final version of the budget ends up going in this direction – it would be a moment of bipartisan agreement. Expanding NC Pre-K was also one of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s campaign promises. We’re tracking about three dozen promises Cooper made on our Coop-O-Meter and have rated the Pre-K promise as In The Works. The state reported that for the current school year, NC Pre-K enrolled 27,019 children – with another 4,668 on the waiting list. State law caps Pre-K class sizes at 18 students, and there has to be one teacher for every nine students in a classroom. That means cutting down on the waiting list requires finding space for new classrooms, hiring more teachers or both. So how much will it cost to ensure that no eligible children are turned away? Budget proposals from the the state Senate and the governor’s office both estimated that each new seat costs around $5,200, and the program as a whole costs the state about $5,500 per seat. An initial look into Lewis’ claim, on the other hand, appeared to show the House relying on estimates that were only half that much. We sent an inquiry to Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, a Pre-K expert at UNC-Chapel Hill who is also the director of the National Pre-K and Early Learning Evaluation Center. She called that math "curious." So we wondered if the House discovered a way for the program to use funding more efficiently, or if perhaps something was amiss. That led us to get in touch with some state budget officials. They said there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation – and that Lewis was neither wrong nor using faulty accounting. Crunching the numbers The House, Senate and governor’s office all agree that North Carolina should use $6 million in federal grant money next school year and $12.2 million in 2018-19 to expand Pre-K funding. The Senate plan stops there. But Cooper would double it by matching that federal money with state funds. The House budget initially appears to follow the Senate plan, which led to the initial confusion. But in reality, the House – like Cooper – would require a state match. The average budget explorer might not realize that, however, because House budget writers omitted the additional state funds from some documents. "The House says it in their narrative but it doesn't show it in their numbers," said Pam Kilpatrick, North Carolina’s senior assistant state budget officer. The House, Senate and Cooper all agree it will cost right around $5,200 for each new seat. And those estimates jibe with recent history. Last year the state spent an extra $1.325 million on NC Pre-K and created 260 new seats, for an average of $5,096 per seat. Kilpatrick, the state budget expert, agreed that using both the federal funds and matching state money ought to be enough to get rid of the existing waiting list – just like Lewis said. "We're definitely in agreement," Kilpatrick said. "It's right on the money." Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. David Lewis, a top budget writer in the House of Representatives, said that chamber’s budget will eliminate the waiting list for NC Pre-K. The program, which serves needy children and military families, turned down 4,668 children this year due to a lack of seats, according to the state. And Lewis is right that the House’s version of the budget has enough money to create at least that many new seats if it becomes law. We rate this claim True.

Mitt Romney has taken aim at President Donald Trump before, but he never said Trump should resign because of "serious emotional problems," despite what one false headline would have readers believe. "Mitt Romney: ‘Trump has some very serious emotional problems, he must resign before we…’," said a June 6, 2018, headline from International Flash News, an online blog. A few replica stories were posted under the same headline on other blog sites in May. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The International Flash News story alleged that during an interview on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Romney said Trump "has some very serious emotional problems." The story also quoted Romney as suggesting Trump should resign over sexual misconduct claims and expressing concern regarding the president’s tweets about North Korea and domestic race relations. We searched for the headline in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Romney made such a statement. Shimrit Sheetrit, director of Anderson Cooper 360, told us it has been several years since Romney was last featured as a guest on the show. But as it turns out, we did find that the comments attributed to Romney in the false report were all at some point made by another former presidential candidate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. On Dec. 13, 2017, Sanders joined the set of Anderson Cooper 360 and said Trump "has some very serious emotional problems" in reference to a Twitter attack Trump made against U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. During the same interview, Sanders said Trump should resign because of the multiple sexual assault allegations levied against him. The International Flash News story also included quotes that can be properly attributed to Sanders’ statement on CBS This Morning on Dec. 7, 2017. And Sanders — not Romney — has on multiple occasions accused Trump of "trying to divide us up by the color of our skin," including on Nov. 12, 2017, while visiting CBS’s Face the Nation. So the supposed Romney quote, along with several others included in the text of the story, is actually a misattribution of multiple different quotes from Sanders.

pomt-01988	Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine voted "to let the U.N. take OUR guns."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/15/chain-email/chain-email-says-sens-mark-warner-and-tim-kaine-vo/	A chain email lists Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine among 46 "legistraitors" in the U.S. Senate who voted to let the United Nations seize the guns of Americans. "Folks: This needs to go viral," the email said. "These Senators voted to let the UN take OUR guns. They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed." A reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall. No group or individual takes credit for the email, which denounces the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, while North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, is aimed at restricting the international flow of large and small arms to nations beset by terrorists or dictators with poor human rights records. President Barack Obama said he would sign the pact. But before the U.S. can be bound by any treaty, the agreement must be approved by the Senate. The U.N. treaty had long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups, who said it could infringe on constitutional rights to own arms in the United States. Before the U.N’s approval of the accord, the Senate passed legislation, by a 53-46 vote, stating opposition to the treaty. Warner and Kaine voted with the minority that favored the pact. The email says that the treaty, in addition to allowing the U.N. to seize guns, "would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo." Facts about the treaty Let’s look at the what the treaty actually does. It states its purpose is to "establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms" and to "prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion." It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take "appropriate measures" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty has no enforcement power, but supporters hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36 countries. The U.S. State Department says the treaty, if joined by the United States, would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish "control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards," the State Department wrote in a fact sheet last September. What about the email’s contentions that the treaty would "let the U.N. take OUR guns," and "implement and international gun registry ... on all guns and private ammo?" There are no provisions for any of that in the treaty. To the contrary, the pact’s preamble affirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." Our ruling A chain email says Warner and Kaine were among 46 senators who voted to "let the U.N. take our guns." This is a wild distortion of the senators’ support for a U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that has no enforcement power but encourages nations to adopt common standards to block the flow of arms into nations beset by terrorists or dictators with brutal human rights records. The goal is to raise the international arms trade rules to standards already used by the United States. The treaty explicitly recognizes the sovereign rights of nations to control gun laws within its borders. So the assertion that the U.N. would be empowered to take guns from United States citizens is outlandish. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04970	Says Texas proved in court that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest Texas election.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-dead-voters-Texas/	Greg Abbott, defending the state’s stalled voter identification law, said in a Fox News interview on July 15, 2012: "What we have proved in Texas is that voter fraud exists. We have more than 200 dead people who voted in the last election -- and we proved that in court in addition to the fact that the voter ID law will have no disenfranchisement effect on the voters in the state of Texas." We’ll set aside the last part of the Texas attorney general’s statement given that a federal judicial panel is reviewing the state’s case challenging the U.S. Department of Justice, which maintains that the state’s mandate that voters present photo IDs at the polls, passed into law in 2011, would prevent many voters from making it to the polls. The department’s objection has kept the law from taking effect. We were curious about Abbott’s claim that the state proved in the court showdown that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest election. To our inquiry, Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean passed along a fact sheet from Abbott’s office related to the just-completed trial. By email, Bean said an official with the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees elections, testified that it had found 239 people who voted in the May 2012 primaries "who were actually dead when they supposedly voted." Bean also forwarded a transcript of the trial proceedings of July 9, 2012, including questions posed by Adam Mortara, a Chicago lawyer representing the state, to Brian Keith Ingram, director of the secretary of state’s elections division. Mortara initially asked Ingram if he had evidence of deceased voters having their voter registration cards used in the May primaries. Ingram replied that he compared a list of 50,000 deceased Texas voters registered with "active voter unique identification numbers" to who voted in the May 29, 2012, party primaries. By email, Bean told us a list presented by the Justice Department at the trial identified 57,718 registered Texas voters as deceased. Bean said the comparison of that list to reports of who voted in the 2012 primaries revealed that 239 voter identification numbers belonging to deceased registered voters were used to cast ballots. Ingram put it this way in his testimony: "We believe 239 folks voted in the recent election after passing away" including, he said, 213 who voted in person. Mortara: "Have you done anything beyond that to confirm whether there are in fact deceased individuals who voted in the May elections?" Ingram: "Well, this was, of course, a surprising and troubling result so we took the best matches, the ones that had full nine Social Security number(s) in both databases, and we asked the Department of Vital Statistics to provide us with actual death certificates for as many of those as we could round up in a short time and we received 10 death certificates." Mortara: "Of the 10 death certificates you received how many of them do you think may have been dead people who voted in the May elections?" Ingram: "Four." Mortara: "And what led you to conclude from review of the death certificates that those four people had voted?" Ingram: "Their Social Security numbers matched, the names matched, the date of births matched and they pre-deceased before, they pre-deceased before the election. One (in) March of 2012, the rest of them from 2004, 2006, 2009." What happened with the other six seeming matches? By email, Bean told us that based on Ingram’s testimony and a conversation she had with the secretary of state’s office, at least one identifier -- a Social Security number, birth date or name -- "didn't match up completely on the death certificate." Ingram further said the state had not conducted such an investigation before because officials had not had both a list of active voter registration numbers belonging to deceased Texans plus a complete record of who had voted in statewide elections. Bean later told us by email that the 2011 Legislature voted to require counties to tell the state which voters had cast ballots after each primary, runoff or general or special election. Previously, she said, some counties voluntarily shared partial voting histories. So, the May 2012 primaries proved the first time every county had to send such information to the state, which hence was able to compare who voted in the primaries to the list of deceased voters identified by the Justice Department, she said. Mortara asked Ingram: "Does the investigation you performed on the May voting data tell you anything about the prevalence of in person voter fraud of this type?" Ingram replied: "It tells us that it's more common than we thought..." Under questioning from Elizabeth Westfall, a Justice Department attorney, Ingram referred to the four voters who used registration cards belonging to dead Texans as the ones he could confirm, but also said that’s being "very conservative." He said that all 239 would be referred to Abbott’s office. He agreed, though, that there had been no criminal investigations, prosecutions or convictions. Westfall asked if clerical errors could explain the 239 matches. Ingram said either the county reports of who voted in May or the state’s list of deceased residents could have errors. "I hope that that is the case for the majority of these," he testified, "but I know for four of them, it's not." We sought to interview state election officials about Ingram’s testimony. Rich Parsons, spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office, directed us to Abbott’s office, saying by email that the 239 "cases" have been referred to the attorney general’s office for possible investigation. We also asked the Department of Justice about Abbott’s claim. Spokesman Mitchell Rivard declined comment. Asked how the testimony proved Abbott’s claim, Bean stressed that Ingram spoke under oath. She added by email: "The dead voter number was subject to cross examination by judges, DOJ lawyers and lawyers for groups hostile to Voter ID." Our ruling Abbott said the recent trial proved that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest elections, the May 2012 party primaries. But the trial was less conclusive. To recap: An elections official testified that after comparing a list of 50,000 dead registered voters -- where’s that headline? -- to records of voters in the recent primaries, "we believe" that 239 "folks voted in the recent election after passing away," meaning 239 voters cast ballots using voter registrations of dead Texans. According to his testimony, the state then took the best matches and sought death certificates "for as many of those as we could round up in a short time." Ten death certificates came back and, the official testified, four names, birth dates and Social Security numbers completely aligned on the lists and death certificates. We can see how this information might raise flags, but we do not see that it proves there were more than 200 dead voters, so to speak. That's because there’s a difference between suspecting fraud and proving it. After all, Abbott's office has been handed the 200-plus matches to investigate. His claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-04822	Says "Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/17/barack-obama/obama-says-ryan-supports-banning-all-abortions/	The day after Republican Mitt Romney announced Paul Ryan as his running mate, President Barack Obama’s campaign tweeted a gender-specific warning about the Wisconsin vice presidential pick. "Make sure the women in your life know: Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest." The @BarackObama account has 18 million followers, and the Ryan abortion comment was widely circulated through more than 6,000 re-tweets. It’s one piece of the campaign’s effort to court the vote of women. The Obama claim has a familiar ring: his campaign ran an ad in July 2012 saying Romney "backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest." PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire, because Romney had made clear he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. But what about Ryan, the newly-minted vice presidential candidate? The seven-term congressman has taken a consistent anti-abortion stand -- National Right to Life says he has never voted against its position in 13 years -- that has earned him 100% ratings from anti-abortion groups and 0% ratings from abortion-rights organizations. News coverage of Ryan’s first congressional race in 1998, as well as statements he made to the National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion group, show Ryan has taken a stricter anti-abortion view than Romney. The only anti-abortion exception Ryan favors is situations where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The National Right to Life Committee concurs, based on information the group says it collected in 1998 and 2000 from Ryan as a candidate. So the Obama ad correctly claims that Ryan opposes abortions in cases of rape and incest. But the tweet also says Ryan "supports banning all abortions." That appears to go too far. From his first campaigns, in 1998 and in 2000, Ryan has said he supports an exception to any abortion ban for when the life of the mother is at risk. Abortions in such cases are rare, but they do occur. The Obama campaign argues Ryan has been inconsistent on that point, saying Ryan does not back that exemption in cases involving a procedure known as "partial birth" abortion. They point to a quote from Ryan in his 1998 campaign, from a Kenosha News story, that he supports an "unqualified" ban on late-term abortions. But we found strong evidence that Ryan has favored a life exception in partial-birth cases, including an Oct. 30, 1998 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Ryan's campaign told us he favors the life exception in those cases, and the National Right to Life Committee says it believes that is his position based on its surveys over the years. The partial-birth abortion ban enacted in 2003 was written with a life-of-the-mother exception. Ryan voted for that law. As for Ryan’s current views, there is no indication they have changed. Since entering Congress, Ryan has focused on budget and fiscal issues so his views on abortion and social issues have not received much attention. Other evidence There is another, more recent, piece of information to consider. Ryan is among 64 House Republicans who co-sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act, an anti-abortion bill that declares that human life shall be deemed to begin at fertilization, and should be protected from that point. The legislation, which has stalled, reflects the budding movement -- endorsed by Ryan -- to enact "personhood" rights for the unborn. It would weaken the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision by "giving back the right to individual states to outlaw abortion," according to Gualberto Garcia Jones, legal analyst for Personhood USA. Abortion-rights advocates say the measure would go further. It would nullify Roe v. Wade and create legal uncertainty about abortions, said Donna Crane of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Neither side in this debate, though, claims the measure would immediately outlaw abortions. That would be up to Congress and/or individual states in subsequent legislation, if the Human Life Act holds up in the courts. And the measure does not deal with what exceptions -- if any -- would be allowed. It leaves that up to states or Congress to decide. Some legal observers, such as Harvard University’s I. Glenn Cohen say, that the measure’s declarations -- the right to life "is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person" and "every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood" -- can be read as hostile to the life of the mother exception. Our conclusion President Obama, through a campaign tweet, pegged Paul Ryan as supporting a ban on abortions, "even in cases of rape or incest." Ryan does oppose those exceptions. Obama’s Twitter claim misfires in saying Ryan supports banning "all" abortions. He has supported an exception when a mother’s life is at stake. That’s an important detail that is left out. We rate Obama’s claim Half True. Editor's Note: This item was changed on Oct. 26, 2012 to correct the record on Paul Ryan's position on exceptions to a partial-birth abortion ban. That National Right to Life Committee pointed out an inconsistency between our our original description of Ryan's position and the documentation cited in the item. After further reporting, we have changed the item to reflect that Ryan has supported an exception to the ban in cases where the life of the mother is in danger. Such an exception was written into the partial-birth abortion law passed in 2003.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-17T09:00:00	2012-08-17	['None']

pomt-04331	"One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/26/johnny-isakson/need-job-obamas-hiring-georgia-senator-says/	There’s been much said about the dearth of "Help Wanted" signs across America, but one lawmaker from Georgia recently talked about a place where there’s been an increase in the workforce in recent years. "One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government," U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Marietta Republican, told a group of community leaders at an Oct. 11 luncheon in Cobb County. Isakson’s larger point was that the federal government is not making the hard choices to spend wisely, as American families are doing, according to an article in The Marietta Daily Journal. Since the Great Recession, we’ve heard much about state and local governments laying off employees to cope with the decline in tax revenue. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the senator was correct about an actual increase in the number of employees on Uncle Sam’s payroll. USA Today reported earlier this year that federal employment grew 13 percent — 250,000 jobs — from the recession's start in December 2007 to a peak in September. During that time, private employment fell 5 percent and state and local governments cut staffs by 2 percent. Under President Barack Obama, the federal government has attempted to ease hiring processes and been more aggressive in hiring Latinos, The Washington Post recently reported. Obama's budget calls for a small increase in federal workers, although the president has frozen employee salaries for more than two years. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Obama for the increase in the size of the federal workforce under his administration. Romney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10 percent. For every two employees who retire, Romney’s goal would be to hire one new federal worker, according to the Post. The federal Office of Personnel Management has data on its website with an annual total of federal employees dating to 1962. It includes Postal Service employees. The number of federal employees rose the greatest, by 22 percent, when Democrat Lyndon Johnson was in the White House during the mid- to late 1960s. The number of federal employees was at its highest in 1990, when Republican George H.W. Bush was president. Federal employees represent slightly more than 1 percent of the nation’s total workforce, a statistic that has changed little in recent years, according to government data. Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson said the senator came up with the figure after reviewing data from the Office of Personnel Management’s website. The most recent month available was June 2012, which showed the federal government had 2,115,707 workers. Isakson’s office compared it with September 2008. The federal government had 1,938,821 workers that month, according to that website. The difference is 176,886. The website does not have figures for June 2008. The data include people who work for Cabinet-level agencies, larger agencies such as NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and more obscure ones such as the Railroad Retirement Board and the Marine Mammal Commission. It does not include enlisted members of the U.S. military. If you were wondering, the Office of Personnel Management said it does not include people hired to conduct the U.S. Census in its count of the federal workforce. The Census Bureau needed to fill 1.2 million part-time positions for the work. It does include statisticians who were temporarily hired to help with the census. The Partnership for Public Service, a Washington-based, nonpartisan organization that works on ways to help federal workers improve their jobs and ideas when they fall short. The organization also uses the Office of Personnel Management numbers to measure the size of the federal workforce. Staffers there noted that the numbers Isakson used to make his comparison included seasonal and part-time workers. PolitiFact Georgia found a breakdown of full-time federal workers in September 2008 and June 2012. The increase was 178,857, which is slightly more than what Isakson cited in his speech in Cobb County. The biggest increases during this time period were in the Defense, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security departments. To sum up, Isakson said the federal workforce has increased by about 176,000 between September 2008 and June 2012. His claim is accurate if you examine full-time workers and include those working for Uncle Sam on a part-time or seasonal basis. Our rating: True.

pomt-12707	Says he presented "a balanced budget."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2017/mar/09/bruce-rauner/rauners-budget-balancing-claim-doesnt-add/	In his annual budget speech, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said he was presenting a balanced budget. "Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation" the governor said. The next morning, his campaign sent an email underscoring that he had offered a balanced budget proposal for the next fiscal year. "Governor Bruce Rauner yesterday outlined a plan to balance the budget that reforms Illinois and builds a new economy," the email read. It included a link to a new, Rauner-funded website, www.budgetandreform.com. The website features a campaign ad that repeats the claim that the governor, who is embroiled in an unprecedented budget stalemate with majority Democrats, has proposed a balanced budget. The ad’s narrator says, "Bruce Rauner's plan to balance the budget reforms Illinois, builds a new economy, freezes property taxes, caps spending, pays down the debt and term limits politicians' power." With so many assertions that Rauner, who has yet to sign a budget into law since his election in 2014, had proposed a balanced revenue and spending plan, we decided to check it out. Balancing the rhetoric Article 8, Section 2a of the Illinois Constitution states, "The Governor shall prepare and submit to the General Assembly, at a time prescribed by law, a State budget for the ensuing fiscal year. … Proposed expenditures shall not exceed funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year as shown in the budget." Illinois has not had a full budget enacted into law since 2014. In 2015, Rauner vetoed the budget bills majority Democrats approved, except for the bill that funded pre K-12 education. His 2017 budget proposal is his third since taking office after winning election in his first run for a public position. He previously worked as a highly successful private equity financier. Since his 2017 budget speech last month, Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance. Page 30 of the budget book released the day of the speech by the governor’s office of management and budget includes a fiscal year 2018 summary page that has a line that says the budget is balanced with $4.57 billion by "working together on a grand bargain." The "grand bargain" refers to efforts by Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont to strike a complicated, 12-bill compromise on several major topics that combine new or increased taxes to generate revenue along with business and political reforms aimed at strengthening the state economy and boosting public confidence in government. To date, such a bargain has not come to fruition. The governor’s press office referred questions about the balanced budget claims to Illinois Republican Party spokesman Steven Yaffe. Asked via email to provide the original source for the statement that the governor’s budget proposal was balanced, Yaffe said, "As stated in his budget address, Governor Rauner's plan to balance the budget includes freezing property taxes, capping spending, paying down the debt, and term-limiting career politicians." When asked again for the original source of that statement, Yaffe said, "His plan to balance the budget includes these four items. That's what the advertisement is saying. These four items are keys to passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan in the General Assembly. The final plan is obviously still being negotiated, but these reforms are critical." Despite repeated requests, Yaffe did not offer an original source but said, "The ad is accurate." In his speech, the governor acknowledged he expected Democrats to attack him for not proposing a balanced budget and noted the Legislature’s controlling party has not approved a balanced budget for years. "It’s not going to help us move forward if right after this speech, Democrats run to the media claiming we’ve never proposed a plan to balance the budget," he said. "And it’s not going to help us move forward if Republicans run to the media to point out that the Democratic legislature’s never passed a balanced budget. People want to see us get something done – to get a balanced budget to change our broken system." Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, noted the concept of a balanced budget has been a difficult one for many Illinois governors and legislators over many years. "The word ‘balanced’ seems to have become a politically malleable term. And not just with Rauner," he said, noting former Democratic Govs. Pat Quinn, Rod Blagojevich and others have bent the meaning. "It is in some sense institutionalized and hidden by all the special funds. So does the proposed budget have expenditures equal to revenues in clear, concrete and plausible terms? It doesn’t look like it. "I think the term has been stretched so far by both sides of the aisles and both branches over recent years," Mooney added, that he would "hardly blame" the governor for "playing this ongoing political word game." Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning think tank, didn’t concern himself with rhetoric. "The FY2018 General Fund budget proposed by Governor Rauner cannot be considered balanced by any objective standard for two reasons: first, it relies on over $1 billion in unspecified and unlikely savings from ‘pension reforms’ that are not only unlikely to pass, but if they did, would likely be ruled unconstitutional; second, and even more troubling, is the $4.572 billion in ‘savings’ the governor anticipates from ‘working together on a grand bargain’ -- which is so ambiguous that it cannot credibly be valued at all." Sheila Weinberg, a certified public accountant and the founder of Truth in Accounting, a government finance think tank said, "Our elected officials have been claiming ‘balanced’ budgets for decades, but the state owes more than $187 billion. Mostly likely the governor is not including all of the state’s employee compensation costs in his calculations." Our ruling Gov. Rauner said he proposed a balanced budget. "Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation" the governor told lawmakers. Yet, the budget book produced by the governor’s office of management and budget suggests the budget is balanced by "working together on a grand bargain." A so-called grand bargain budget compromise, though, has not been achieved or enacted. Illinois government finance experts agree Rauner’s proposal is not balanced. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-14068	"We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2015-was-best-year-us-auto-in/	On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pitched herself as someone who will continue many of President Barack Obama’s policies. At a campaign rally in Kentucky May 16, Clinton praised the 2009 auto industry bailout, which people view as an Obama success. "We saved the auto industry," she said. "That’s important in Louisville. It’s important in Bowling Green. It’s important in Northern Kentucky. It’s important across this commonwealth. That’s a big difference between me and my opponent in the primary. I voted to save the auto industry, he voted not to. It’s important to know that it was the right vote because we just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history." We’ve already looked into how Clinton’s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted on the auto bailout, which totaled an estimated $85 billion. But we were also curious about Clinton’s claim that 2015 was "the best year for the auto industry in America in history." This is true by one big measure: Americans bought more cars and trucks in 2015 than ever before. But that success might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. In 2015, Americans bought more than 17.5 million cars. The last peak was 17.3 million in 2000, followed by a collapse to 10.4 million at the height of the recession in 2009. Additionally, the past six years have been the longest period of sustained year-over-year growth in auto sales since the 1920s, according to Auto Alliance, a vehicle manufacturer association. Vehicle sales wax and wane with the economy. Wards Auto, an analytics organization, has tracked vehicle sales since 1963. When times are tough, vehicles become a discretionary purchase that consumers are willing to put off. Analysts believe car sales have done so well in the past couple of years because of a combination of the improving economy, cheap gas prices, available credit and low interest rates for loans. Experts we asked agreed with Clinton’s claim, saying the sales figures are a reasonable way to measure the auto industry’s health. "She's right," said Bruce Belzowski, managing director of the automotive futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. "By any objective measure, the auto industry bailout is an Obama success story." The Detroit Three big automakers — Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler — reported strong sales in 2015 and projections for 2016. But it’s worth remembering that the record-breaking total vehicle sales figure isn’t just for American-made cars. It includes foreign models sold in the United States, too. Of the 2.4 million cars sold so far in 2016, 71 percent were imports, according to the Wall Street Journal. David Lewis, a professor emeritus of business history at the University of Michigan, compared 2015 to the golden age of the American car industry. "Think of 1955, a record sales year, and a time in which well over 90 percent of the vehicles sold in the U.S. were manufactured by American companies," Lewis said. Even taking into account the number of foreign versus American car purchases, Clinton’s claim is reasonable because foreign car sales count as part of the "auto industry," said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Foreign cars have been a growing part of the U.S. auto market since the 1980s. But it might not be fair to take her claim as proof of the long-term health of American manufacturers, Winston said. While the bailout resurrected struggling American auto manufacturers, it’s possible that it just stalled the companies’ eventual decline as consumers choose foreign cars instead. He also noted potential future threats from ride-sharing services and self-driving cars. "Let us not get too excited about one or even a few years of successes with this industry that has been extremely turbulent and repeatedly rescued by the government," Winston said. "All the while, the Detroit share has gone down. So that tells you something that any given year still may mask long-term issues." This is partially reflected in employment data. Employment among car dealers has in fact returned to its pre-recession high of about 1.2 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But employment in the motor vehicle and parts manufacturing sector hasn’t completely recovered. About 1.3 million people worked in this sector in the early 2000s; that figure dropped to about 620,000 at the height of the recession in 2009, and it has risen to about 920,000 in early 2016. But "for the factories that made it out of the recession, all is well," Belzowski said. U.S. vehicle production in 2015 was the eighth-largest in history, at 11.9 million. That’s high — and almost double production in 2009 — but still not quite as high as it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some industry analysts expect the good times to keep coming for the next few years, with 2016 breaking more records, according to the Detroit Free Press. "It’s a great time to be in the automobile business, and it’s particularly sweet for those who lived through the dark days of 2009 and 2010," said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby. Our ruling Clinton said, "We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history." With sales figures that exceed the pre-recession high, 2015 was a great year for the auto industry, including American manufacturers. This high point should be taken with a grain of salt because it might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. Clinton’s statement is nearly accurate but requires that extra bit of context, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d3ea8b7-e3b8-41e8-b56a-b7ce4d6745cb	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-20T15:00:00	2016-05-16	['United_States']
pomt-12440	"Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/15/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-planned-parenthood-leading-abo/	On April 30, 2017, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) provoked an outcry at a town hall meeting in Neenah when pressed to explain his support for defunding the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. A woman doing the questioning warned Grothman that he shouldn’t use Planned Parenthood’s abortion services as an excuse to pull funding, because the agency is already prohibited from using federal funds to support abortion procedures. Grothman’s quick response: "Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country." He added that the group is an outspoken advocate for what he termed "controversial" services. To be sure, Planned Parenthood does more than abortions. Services include screening for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, sex education and general health care. Indeed, in a one-year period from 2014 to 2015, 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood clinics for services other than abortion, PolitiFact Wisconsin found in February 2017. Grothman’s statement about the "biggest abortion provider" was one we’ve seen in various forms from House Speaker Paul Ryan, Cardinal Seán Patrick O’Malley of Boston and National Public Radio. Does it hold up? Running the numbers There’s no complete, centralized database that tallies abortions, much less breaks that number down by providers. But there is strong indirect evidence backing Grothman’s claim. Planned Parenthood self-reports that 323,999 abortions were performed at its facilities nationwide for the year ending September 30, 2015. That represents 35 percent of the 926,200 U.S. abortions estimated for calendar year 2014, the latest year studied by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization whose survey-based data on abortions is widely quoted by both sides in the abortion debate. Grothman maintains 49 percent of abortions are performed by Planned Parenthood. That’s because he uses the smaller base of 664,000 abortions -- the figure reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is based on voluntary reporting. Here’s what we heard from two groups deeply involved in the abortion issue: -- Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States, according to the Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers. It’s worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization -- including freestanding clinics and private practice hospitals -- collectively do the majority of the procedures. -- The 35 percent "easily" makes Planned Parenthood "the nation's largest abortion chain," and there’s no evidence any other provider is close, according to the National Right to Life Committee. More about Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood’s abortion services grew rapidly between 2000 and 2015, rising by 127,000 procedures at a time when the total number of abortions nationwide was falling significantly. The agency operates some 660 centers across the country. About half offer abortions, according to agency spokeswoman Beth Lynk. Its facilities see patients from all 50 states, though one state, North Dakota, has no Planned Parenthood health center. The Moorhead, Minn., health center is two blocks from the state border and serves predominately North Dakota patients. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said the agency doesn’t track the numbers on other providers and wouldn’t venture an opinion on Grothman’s claim. But Jennifer Thibodeau, a spokesperson for the Abortion Care Network summed up the general feeling among informed observers this way: "There is no other national organization that operate on the scale they do." Our rating Grothman told constituents that "Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country." The agency’s national network of clinics stands apart from other providers as the undisputed leader when it comes to providing abortion services. This is one of those truisms that is basically, well, True. (Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for "controversial" services such as birth control. A spokesperson for his office said on June 7, 2017 that the video, in which Grothman's voice is hard to hear at times, may have led people to that conclusion, but that Grothman does not believe birth control is a controversial service. The birth control quote had no bearing on the congressman’s statement about Planned Parenthood and its role in abortions, so the rating of True is unchanged.)

pomt-11913	NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is "against the law."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/19/roy-moore/it-against-law-nfl-players-kneel-national-anthem-r/	Roy Moore, Alabama's Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, introduced a new dimension to the debate over NFL players’ protest by claiming that kneeling during the national anthem is illegal. "It’s against the law, you know that?" Moore said in an Oct. 16 interview with Time magazine. "It was a act of Congress that every man stand and put their hand over their heart. That’s the law." Given his controversial role as the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore’s claim caught our attention. We’ve previously looked at the history of athletes protesting the national anthem, but this is the first time we wanted to explore what the law says — and doesn’t say — on the matter. What does the law say — and not say? Moore cited Title 36, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which designates the Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. It also instructs military members and veterans on how to properly comport themselves while the anthem plays, before addressing civilian etiquette. "All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart," the law states, "and men not in uniform, if applicable, should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart." So Moore is correct in one sense: Congress indeed passed a law dealing with decorum during the national anthem. But the etiquette is merely a suggestion, not a legal obligation. We know this because lawmakers used the word "should" — not "shall" — with regard to their patriotic guidance. The word "should" implies "usually no more than an obligation of propriety," according to the authoritative legal reference Black’s Law Dictionary. In other words, "should" does not create a legally enforceable duty. "When laws are binding they use the word ‘shall.’ Shall is non-negotiable, and not discretionary," said Catherine Ross, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in First Amendment law. " ‘Should’ is a recommendation. That is, in the context of patriotic ceremonies, it’s what a civilian should do if they want to follow best practices." Moore’s statement may give the impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s toothless — at least with regard to non-military members. It contains no mechanism to force the average civilian to stand at attention during the national anthem, and contains no penalties for those who opt to sit or kneel. The absence of such consequences reinforces that the law is simply a protocol or ideal, as opposed to a legal mandate, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at UNC School of Law. First Amendment protection Because the law contains no enforcement mechanism or penalty, it’s difficult to imagine a civilian who knelt for the national anthem being hauled into court. But for argument’s sake we asked legal experts how a judge would handle such a case. "In spite of whatever the law says," Gerhardt said, "there is strong Supreme Court precedent protecting people from being compelled to express a message they do not approve." Ross said two Supreme Court cases virtually ensure a court would find that the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. In 1943, the court ruled in West Virginia vs. Barnette that the First Amendment protects people from being forced to participate in patriotic ceremonies that offend their conscience or beliefs. In the 1989 case of Texas vs. Johnson, the court protected the the right to burn the American flag as a form of symbolic speech. "If the Constitution protects the right to burn the flag and the right not to participate in the pledge as aspects of free speech," Ross said, "it must also protect the right to kneel respectfully during the national anthem or the pledge of allegiance." Our ruling Moore said NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is "against the law." Moore's basis is that a law on the books describes patriotic etiquette during the national anthem. But his statement gives the false impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s merely guidance that carries no penalty. Additionally, legal experts told us the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. We rate this False.

pomt-12251	California taxes are "among the highest in the nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jul/11/travis-allen/mostly-true-californias-taxes-among-highest-nation/	In the video announcing his run for California governor, Republican Travis Allen said he wants to reduce the state’s crime rate and its high taxes. We recently fact-checked Allen’s claims on crime in the video. The Orange County state assemblyman earned a Mostly False for his statement that "crime is on the rise" in all the state’s major metros. We found he cherry-picked data from an uptick in crime in 2015 and ignored the state’s decades-long decline in crime which continued in early 2016. Given the importance of taxes in California, we also decided to examine Allen's claims on this topic. "I’ve seen our taxes increase to be among the highest in the nation," Allen said in the campaign video on June 22, 2017. "In California, we must get serious about cutting our taxes. Californians pay among the highest taxes in the entire nation." Allen makes his claim at about the 0:15 minute mark of the video above. Was Allen right? Are California’s taxes really "among the highest in the nation"? We set out on a fact check. Our research We decided to examine where California ranks in key tax categories, including income, sales and property taxes. Additionally, we looked at how California measures up in a more comprehensive category: Its overall state-local tax burden. We also spoke with several tax experts for some context on these rankings. They all said comparing tax rates is doable but messy, noting that states assess taxes in different ways. Allen’s campaign did not respond to our request for evidence to support his claim. Here’s what we found in each key tax category: Income tax California’s top tier income tax rate is the highest in the nation at 13.3 percent, according to the Tax Foundation and California Taxpayers Association. It’s the rate paid by Californians who earn more than $1 million annually. Maine had the second highest top rate at 10.15 percent, followed by Oregon’s 9.9 percent, as of Jan. 1, 2017. Several states have no income tax, including Nevada, Washington, Texas and Florida. Of course, only a fraction of Californians pay the top income tax rate, noted Annette Nellen, professor and director of the graduate tax program at San Jose State University. A recent Sacramento Bee analysis of state tax data found 61,000 households, or 0.4 percent of the state’s 16 million total, reported income of more than $1 million in 2014. "This is a very small percentage of the population," Nellen said. "Not everybody is paying that. So, if someone was to say we have really high taxes in California, sometimes that’s interpreted as everybody’s paying a really high tax when in California we also have a fairly high exemption for individuals and children which might cause some lower-income folks to not pay any California income tax at all, at least not directly." Per capita, Californians pay $1,991 annually in state income taxes, which ranks fourth highest in the country, according to the Tax Foundation. Sales tax While only a fraction pay the state’s top income tax rate, everyone who lives here or visits pays California’s highest-in-the-nation sales tax rate of 7.25 percent. Four states tie for the second-highest statewide sales tax rate, at 7 percent: Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Tennessee, according to the Tax Foundation. States with no sales tax include Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire and Delaware. When adding state and local sales taxes, California rank drops to 10th highest. This combined tax rate varies across the state. In some parts of Los Angeles County, for example, it tops 10 percent, said David Kline, a spokesman for the California Taxpayers Association. The association researches tax data and opposes what it calls unnecessary taxes. Property tax Unlike California’s income and sales tax rates, the state's average effective property tax rate is among the lowest in the nation, at 0.72 percent, or 36th among states, according to the Tax Foundation. That’s due to voter approved Proposition 13, which limited property tax increases to no more than 2 percent per year. New Jersey had the highest property tax rate at more than 2.1 percent, according to a 2016 report by the Tax Foundation. Still, Kline said, property tax in California is compounded by additional taxes, such as parcel taxes and Mello-Roos assessments, or fees charged to property owners in a specific area to pay for public improvements such as streets and parks. "Those can add hundreds or thousands of dollars every year," he added. Total tax burden In addition to ranking individual tax categories, the Tax Foundation produces a more comprehensive category it calls the State-Local Tax Burden. It measures the share of income in the state that goes to state and local taxes. California ranked sixth highest on this list at 11 percent. New Yorkers faced the highest burden at 12.7 percent, followed by Connecticut at 12.6 percent. Alaskans paid the smallest share of their income, 6.5 percent, in state and local taxes. We asked Joe Henchman, vice president of the Tax Foundation, about the accuracy of Allen’s claim that California’s taxes "are among the highest in the nation." "I think it’s a fair comment to make," Henchman said. "Unless you’re being really specific about a particular type of tax, California is usually at the high end of the states. It’s almost always in the top half of the states in terms of a tax or its burden or how much people pay. And it’s often in the Top 10." Exceptions do exist, he said, such as California’s low taxes on wine (44th highest), spirits (40th) and beer (28th), compared with other states. Nellen, the San Jose State University tax professor, agreed California’s taxes are generally high and said Allen’s claim is mostly backed up by the facts. Growth and taxes In recent years, top Democrats in California have deflected criticism about the state’s high taxes by pointing to strong employment and GDP growth. Gov. Jerry Brown, for example, has repeatedly pointed to the more than 2 million jobs California has created since he returned to office in 2011. Allen has criticized Brown’s recent signing of a 12 cent per gallon increase in the state’s gas tax. That move is expected to make California’s gas tax second highest in the nation, behind Pennsylvania’s, once it goes into effect in Nov. 1, 2017. Henchman said, for now, California’s economy has succeeded despite it’s high taxes. "Nobody moves to California because of taxes," he said. "They move in spite of the taxes, because of other positive benefits. … There’s good weather, there’s Silicon Valley, there’s great universities, there’s Hollywood, etc., etc. "Those, for a lot of people, make it worth paying the taxes, to a point," Henchman added. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Travis Allen recently claimed California’s taxes are "among the highest in the nation." Allen’s statement is broad and needs clarification. But when looking at some of the most important tax categories, including income, sales and gasoline taxes, there’s a lot of truth to his claim. California has the highest top tier income tax and the highest state sales tax in the nation. It’s important to note that the top rate income tax is paid by only a fraction of households in the state, and that the sales tax rate drops to 10th in the nation when local and state sales taxes are examined state-by-state. Notably, it does not have one of the nation’s highest property tax rates, at 36th highest. Allen’s claim is accurate but needs this additional information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. UPDATE: An earlier version of this fact check described California's property tax rate as 0.72 percent. We have clarified that this is the state's average effective property tax rate. Visit our Tracking the Truth series here to see all of our 2018 governor's race fact-checks. Governor’s race Allen is one of several Republican candidates to announce a run for California governor. The others include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and former state Assemblyman David Hadley of Manhattan Beach. Several prominent Democrats are also competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. They include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. A poll released in June 2017 showed a tightening race. Newsom was in the lead among all candidates, with 22 percent support from likely voters. Villaraigosa had 17 percent support, up from his 11 percent three months earlier. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked?

pomt-01049	Says President Barack Obama is "not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/22/carly-fiorina/fiorina-obamafails-meet-his-own-measures-equal-pay/	President Barack Obama didn’t say much about women in his State of the Union address, but one of his few references drew a jab from former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. In his speech, Obama said "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." He was referring to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would allow workers to talk among themselves about how much they are being paid. Fiorina, a California Republican who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2010, took the president to task the next morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required," Fiorina said during a conversation with White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. "I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law. I am struck by the fact the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House." "In the White House, women do earn equal pay for equal work," Jarrett said. "The bill that’s currently before Congress would make it easier for women to find out if they are being discriminated against." From that exchange, what caught PunditFact's attention is that Obama isn't practicing what he preaches in the White House. So what do the facts say? At a baseline level, there is a gender pay gap in the White House. Each year, the president’s office publishes a list of all staff members, the jobs they hold and their pay. With a little commonsense and a bit of Googling (we now know that Brayden is an Irish boys name), we sorted the most recent list of 460 employees by gender. We found that the average female staff member made $78,767 in 2013, while the average male made $85,602. The Washington Post did its own analysis and came up with slightly different numbers, but no matter how you cut it, a difference exists. In round figures, the average woman makes about 10 percent less than the average man. (One detail: Just about all the staffers are listed as employees, but about 6 percent are on loan as it were from other agencies. They are listed as detailees and their pay is not set by the White House. It does have some impact on the numbers. For the record, we included all workers in our analysis.) So there is a pay gap. But the context of the comments made by Obama at the State of the Union, and then by Fiorina, go beyond that a pay gap exists. The suggestion is that it exists out of some level of discrimination. Put another way, women are paid less than men for doing the same job. We found no real evidence of that happening at the White House. When we matched men and women by their job titles, not only did the gap disappear, the edge went to the women. This table shows how things break down for two higher echelon titles, "assistant to the president" and "senior policy adviser." Job Title # Men Average pay # Women Average pay Assistant to the president 12 $170,141 10 $172,270 Senior policy adviser 7 $106,714 9 $107,442 In cases where the titles match completely, as with the "deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president," the salaries were identical. The three men and one woman holding those jobs in 2013 all made $158,500. Same thing with "analyst." We found 15 men and women with the title analyst all making $42,000 a year. A man and woman with the title "assistant counsel of ethics" both earning $60,000 a year. Five men and women with the title "assistant director" making $50,000 a year. Another five men and women with the title "coordinator" making $45,000 a year. But not all titles matched up so easily. The title of "deputy assistant to the president" comes with a range of add-on titles. There was a "deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of communications," and a "deputy assistant to the president and director of the White House military office." If we ignored the add-ons, we found that the average female deputy assistant made $141,562, or about $10,000 less than the average male deputy assistant who made $150,115. And within titles, we did see some pay gaps -- in both directions. A woman with the title "director of operations" made $30,000 a year more than her male counterpart. A male with the title "calligrapher" made about $9,000 a year more than a female with the same title. (There's also a chief calligrapher, in case you were wondering.) "Equal pay means equal pay for equal work and that's what we have at the White House," a White House spokesman told PunditFact. "Men and women in the White House in equivalent roles earn equivalent salaries." He added that department heads all make the same salary and over half are women. The numbers are clear. By the standard that men and women doing the same jobs should get the same pay, the Obama White House makes the grade. When we reached Fiorina’s office, we learned that her comment emerged out of a running Republican dispute with the administration over its talking points on this issue. Fiorina had something very particular in mind when she referred to Obama’s "own measures." Back in April, Obama marked Equal Pay Day by signing executive orders that imposed new rules for federal contractors. A line in the press release said, "Women still make just 77 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, and continue to face prejudice in the workplace. And that number hasn’t improved — the pay gap has stayed constant since 2002." Republicans, including Fiorina, find the 77 cents figure to be a deceptive rallying cry, precisely because it ignores that women and men tend to hold different jobs than men and those jobs tend to be lower paying. They argued that by that standard, the White House is not much better than the average employer. "When the White House talks about equal pay for women they use one set of math for themselves and one set for others," said Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. "The president uses this statistic to compare the average pay of women in all jobs to the average pay of men in all jobs. But when applying this rhetoric to assess pay in the Obama White House, they cry foul." In that regard, Fiorina has a point. PolitiFact rated a claim from Obama Mostly False that, "Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." The rationale: The gap isn’t all because women are paid less for doing the same work. A large part of the gap exists because women and men are doing different work. But when the claim changes even slightly, it becomes more true. In 2014, Obama said simply that Women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That rated Mostly True because it removes the idea that the pay gap is solely related to discrimination. This year, Obama was careful with his wording as well, simply saying that "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." And all Fiorina said was Obama was not paying women equally "by his own measures." Linda Babcock is an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading researcher on women in the workforce. Babcock told PunditFact that the pay gap at the White House and across the country is rooted in occupational segregation. Women tend to hold positions that pay less than men. "We’ve made good progress on equal pay for equal work," Babcock said. "But that’s not fixing the whole problem. You look at any kind of organization and you will see relatively more women at the bottom and relatively more men at the top." Babcock said research has found that many factors lie behind this. She said men are more likely to have more senior, more powerful advocates for them inside organizations. Babcock also noted than when deciding whether to promote someone, managers tend to be risk averse. "We are more uncertain about women and we force them to meet a higher bar of performance before they go up to the next level," Babcock said. Our ruling Fiorina said that Obama is not paying women equally in his own White House by "his own measures." That by "his own measures" in some ways is the key to this claim, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it by just reading Fiorina’s comment. Fiorina is trying to reference past occasions when Obama said that "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." That’s Mostly False, because the pay gap is not all about discrimination. But the framing of the discussion post-State of the Union was different. Obama said, "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." Fiorina followed with, "Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required," and then, Obama’s "not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House." The latest White House staffing data shows that there is a gap in average pay for men and women. But when the job titles are the same, largely so is the pay. In fact, for some job categories, women do a bit better than men. Fiorina’s dispute had to do with past rhetoric, not the issue as she framed it. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13241	"During his 18-year Senate career, (Russ Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right. … (He) promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/19/ron-johnson/testing-ron-johnson-claim-russ-feingold-judges-and/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a campaign ad on the Second Amendment. In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold won’t. "Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk," Johnson said in the ad, which was posted online in August 2016. "Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows." Johnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is mired in a tight re-election race with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010. While carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat ("One more liberal justice will flip the court") and says he has "held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so." Not so with Feingold, Johnson claims: "During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and he’d do it again if elected to a fourth term." That last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners — namely that Feingold "supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right." Johnson also says that while Feingold "promises to protect those rights," his voting record shows the opposite. But do the facts really support Johnson’s conclusion? Let’s take a look. Confirmation votes and court rulings When asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingold’s votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices — Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor — who dissented in major gun rights cases. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead "protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests." (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.) Two years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor. (Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.) Thus, there is some truth to Johnson’s claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun. But here’s what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights. For example: • Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts, who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald. • Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case Ezell v. Chicago, Sykes authored a court decision that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits. • Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman, who in 2013 said the Second Amendment should protect an individual’s right to possess a handgun outside the home. • Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea, who earlier this year joined a ruling that found a California county’s ordinance prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment. And while Feingold has said he favors mandating background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows, he also has said he was pleased with the outcome in Heller and he has explicitly expressed support for an individual’s right to own a gun. "I’ve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms," Feingold said in 2010. Our rating In a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold "supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right." Feingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights.

pomt-06291	"The American healthcare system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/20/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-us-spends-18-percent-i/	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, was one of several speakers at a Sept. 21 health care forum in Washington on the future of health care in the United States. Not surprisingly, much of his speech focused on how much the nation spends on health care. The forum was organized by the nonprofit Washington-based Partnership for Quality Care, whose members, according to its website, include physician groups, health plans, employers, hospitals, consumer groups and policymakers. One point Whitehouse made caught our attention. "The American health care system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close," he said. We knew our spending was high compared with other industrialized nations, but we wondered whether he got his facts right. First, we contacted Whitehous'’s spokesman, Seth Larson, to find out where the information came from. He sent us links to two websites. The first link took us to the site for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. There, we found this statement: "Total health expenditures reached $2.5 trillion (in 2009), which translates to $8,086 per person, or 17.6 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product." The most recent comparisons are for 2009. (Gross Domestic Product, the market value of the nation’s production of goods and services, has since been revised for 2009, so the share of health care spending that year was actually 17.8 percent of the GDP, said Thomas Dail, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Either way, it still rounds to 18 percent, as Whitehouse said.) Next, we followed the second link to check how the United States’ health care spending compares with spending in other industrialized countries. The international data came from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based organization with 34 member countries. The organization, which has an office in Washington, D.C., is funded by contributions from its member governments. Under "Frequently Asked Questions," we found a link to a spread-chart that shows annual health expenditures by country as a share of GDP. In 2009, the most recent year with complete data, the industrialized country with the next highest health expenditure per GDP is the Netherlands, at 12 percent, followed closely by France, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden -- all above 11 percent. (It should be noted that many countries that spend far less on health care than the United States get better results on such measures as life expectancy, access to care and treatment of heart attacks and other health problems.) Our ruling Whitehouse said that U.S. health care spending accounts for 18 percent of the national GDP, far outstripping other countries. He got his facts right, accurately summarizing two reports based on federal government data. We rate his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-03317	Rick Scott "invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project," which "covered missing federal funds for the project."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/26/republican-party-florida/republicans-greet-obama-ad-touting-lack-federal-mo/	President Barack Obama isn’t just late to the party for Florida’s ports, Republicans say. He’s taking credit for throwing it. The Republican Party of Florida, umm, "welcomed" Obama to the Jacksonville Port Authority on Thursday with a full-page ad in the Florida Times-Union talking up Gov. Rick Scott’s focus on the economy, especially the ports. "Here in Jacksonville, right where you will be speaking, Gov. Scott invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project," the ad stated. "It is a state investment that will help create good-paying jobs. And it covered missing federal funds for the project." Their attack is riddled with political irony: Obama and Scott have had major differences over transportation projects in the past (see high-speed rail), but both are fans of ports. We wanted to know if it was true that the state provided missing funds for ports that the federal government didn’t. The Mile Point project is aimed at improving access to the Jacksonville port. Right now, strong ocean cross-currents prevent the biggest cargo ships from accessing the harbor outside of a narrow window each day at high tide. "Two-thirds of the day, that cargo cannot move," said JaxPort spokeswoman Nancy Rubin. "Those are just the very largest ships, but that is becoming a significant part of the trade we’re dealing with." To fix the problem, the federal Army Corps of Engineers devised a plan that will basically remove part of a man-made wall contributing to the strong currents and reconstruct the surrounding area. By law, Congress must authorize the corps to do the project. In a gridlocked, sequester-ridden, earmark-less era, that’s no easy task. Large-scale infrastructure projects have fallen prey to an earmark ban, even though its intention was to weed out spending on unvetted, wasteful projects, said Kurt Nagle, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. "What got caught up in that were port projects that do have a clear federal role and clear national interest and have gone through multiple layers of review and analysis," he said. Congress typically approved money and permission for port projects in the Water Resources Development Act, which has not passed since 2007. In May, the Senate passed a bipartisan version of the bill that would authorize Mile Point and other projects, as well as allow for the corps to proceed with projects, under certain conditions, for which it has outside funding. (Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., voted for it; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against.) Obama called on the House to pick up the Senate bill. Catch that? The Mile Point project is essentially held up by the House, led by Republicans averse to new spending, growing the deficit and tax cuts. The corps projected the cost for the Mile Point project at about $36 million, with 65 percent coming from the feds and the rest coming from local sources. Scott, eyeing a state budget surplus with no federal investment in the pipe anytime soon, pushed the Legislature to set aside $36 million for the project. The Legislature agreed. The port kicked in $500,000 and the federal Army Corps of Engineers kicked in $1.5 million to create designs for the project. (The ad credits all of that money to Scott, which isn't quite right.) But even though the port has the money from the state, it can’t spend it because Congress hasn’t moved legislation that would allow that. The state’s JaxPort investment is part of a trend under Scott not to wait for federal dollars. In 2011, he got $77 million for a deep dredging project in Miami. JaxPort also wants to deepen its channel, but the Mile Point project is a ready-to-go priority (and hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper). "We feel like we are at the finish line, we’ve got the money," Rubin said. "The authorization, to us, is pushing us over the finish line." Port of Tampa CEO and director Paul Anderson penned a June op-ed advocating for passage of the federal legislation. The Port of Tampa received about $25 million for various projects from the state in the 2013-14 budget. Our ruling Yes, Scott persuaded state leaders to put aside $36 million for the project, with the remaining $2 million coming from the port and the corps. In years past, the federal government paid most of the tab for improving a federal shipping channel. The Republicans’ ad implies Obama bears the burden for missing federal funding for Mile Point, saying Obama "took his eye off the ball." Truth be told, it’s the fault of Congress, which has final say over Army Corps port projects. A wide-ranging bill that would authorize the Mile Point project is stalled, the norm in recent years. RPOF’s ad is accurate but could use more context. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2013-07-26T16:32:41	2013-07-25	['None']

pomt-12870	"Here's the fact: The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/kellyanne-conway/kellyanne-conway-incorrect-worker-remittances-mexi/	White House counselor Kellyanne Conway offered several possibilities for how President Donald Trump will build a wall across the southern border, including a tax on goods crossing from Mexico to the United States. Conway went on to decry the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico during an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose, calling "repatriation of funds" a "very big piece of President Trump’s vision for this country." "Here's the fact," Conway said on Jan. 27, 2017. "The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back." This would be more appropriately considered an alternative fact. Conway does have a point that "remittances" (as they are officially called) from individuals in the United States constitute a significant boost to the Mexican economy, and they may be of enormous importance to the individual families on the receiving end. However, they are far from the country’s No. 1 source of income. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) BBVA Bancomer, a Mexican economic forecaster, has projected that once all the data for 2016 is tallied, Mexicans will have sent $27 billion in remittances into Mexico in 2016 -- a one-year record, and an increase of more than $2 billion over 2015. (Part of the reason for the uptick, the group says, was a surge in remittances in November with Trump’s election, driven by widespread concerns that he may cut off remittances in the future.) These totals are in line with U.S. government data. However, we found at least two different types of money flows from the United States to Mexico that are bigger than remittances. Ranking first is the money spent by United States consumers and companies on good old-fashioned Mexican exports -- everything from manufactured goods to oil to agricultural products. According to federal data, the United States in 2015 imported Mexican goods totaling $295 billion. That pot of money is more than 10 times bigger than the amount of remittances. The biggest category of Mexican exports to the United States -- auto vehicles and parts -- was by itself north of $100 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. In addition, foreign direct investment by the United States totaled $28 billion in 2015 -- a bit higher than the projected remittances for 2016 and clearly higher than the total of remittances for 2015, which was $24.8 billion. Foreign direct investment is defined as "investment from one country into another, normally by companies rather than governments, that involves establishing operations or acquiring tangible assets, including stakes in other businesses." Three experts in U.S.-Mexico economic ties -- Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mary C. King, a Portland State University economist; and Robert A. Blecker, an American University economist -- concurred with our analysis of the data. "Remittances are important -- just far from No. 1," Blecker said. "And from a Mexican point of view, it’s a huge disappointment that remittances are so high relative to foreign direct investment and tourism, which would be much more positive sources of income. Nevertheless, they are not the biggest -- not nearly." Our ruling Conway said, "Here's the fact. The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back." A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives living and working in the United States, whether legally or illegally. However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods -- to say nothing of services -- are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in Mexico. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14949	"In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/25/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-has-mixed-facts-regulated-chemicals/	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently joined Hasbro executives at their downtown headquarters to push a bill to regulate thousands of chemicals, including hazardous substances that pose a risk to children. From behind a blue podium that was as brightly colored and as plastic as a child’s toy, Whitehouse made this claim: "In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated." This certainly sounded like the Wild West of unregulated chemicals to us: 22,996 chemicals on the market and only four run-ins with regulators? It was clear early on that our fact-checking of the statement would pivot on the definition of "regulated." Our dictionary tells us that to "regulate" is "to control or direct by a rule." Whitehouse’s go-to expert on chemicals, Richard A. Denison, a lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was at the event and provided some immediate clarification after the senator spoke. The EPA blocked four chemicals from the marketplace after the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. That, Denison said, was the regulation Whitehouse was talking about. So almost 23,000 other chemicals went unregulated? That didn’t line up with a 2010 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector General. Through September 2008, according to the report, EPA "regulated 1,432 chemicals by means of Consent Orders." The consent-order process, which involves negotiations with manufacturers, is quite different from the process that EPA used to block those four chemicals. But it’s a form of government regulation nevertheless — the outcome of a process in which manufacturers of a new chemical must, by rule, file a notice with the government and receive the EPA’s approval. We contacted Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson for clarification. Larson told us that Whitehouse had been "speaking off the cuff." Larson asked us to consider a somewhat similar statement made in two news releases issued to publicize the Hasbro event. "In almost 40 years," says the news release. "TSCA has restricted just five chemicals of the more than 80,000 that are in commerce — and even failed to ban asbestos." The five chemicals referenced in the release are different from the four substances that Whitehouse referred to at the Hasbro podium. The five chemicals were among 62,000 chemicals already in existence in 1976, while the four substances were among chemicals created after the law was passed, according to Denison. Our research into the restriction of "just five" substances took us right back to the more than 1,400 chemicals that OIG says EPA regulated through the consent-order process set forth in the 1976 law. The agency, according to its website, can establish conditions for safe use via a "consent order," with the manufacturer agreeing to: toxicity testing, warnings, worker protections, "restrictions" on use and releases to "water, air and land." But Denison says the orders are negotiated case by case, behind closed doors, and the terms can remain secret or are heavily redacted in the few instances they become public. Still, the 1,400 chemicals have been regulated or restricted in some way. And the EPA even refers to certain negotiated requirements as "restrictions." Denison, in a later email, referred us to a collection of comments that high-level EPA officials have made regarding the five particular chemicals Whitehouse cited in the news releases. We noticed that in each case, the EPA officials had qualified their remarks in ways that Whitehouse didn’t. However, from a broader perspective, none of this analysis undercuts Whitehouse’s basic argument that the 1976 law isn’t protecting the public and it needs an overhaul. While many companies have agreed to restrictions under EPA pressure, the overall regulatory environment is extremely lax. Regulators don’t know the toxicity of many chemicals in the marketplace. "It is important to note that almost 90 percent of pre-manufacture notices submitted to EPA complete the review process without being restricted or regulated in any way," the agency says on its website. More than 60 senators have signed on as supporters of the legislation backed by Whitehouse. Hasbro’s chief executive, Brian Goldner, says Hasbro is on a mission "to make the world a better place for children and their families, and this reform will be a victory." Our Ruling Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator used the wrong verb at Hasbro. He asked us to test a different statement that uses a different verb and refers to different facts. We did. In both cases, we found evidence that the number of regulated or restricted chemicals was far greater than the tiny number that Whitehouse and his office referred to in their various statements. Cheryl Hogue, an assistant managing editor at Chemical & Engineering News, agrees that EPA’s regulatory authority is greatly limited by the 1976 law. But she also told us,"Every new chemical that comes on the market has to give a notice to EPA…Is that regulation?," she asked. "A lot of chemical companies would call that regulation." The 1976 law is weak, and it looks like Congress might make it tougher. But Whitehouse used the wrong verb and he mixed up the facts to make his case for change when he claimed that "only four" of 23,000 chemicals "were regulated." For these reasons, we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2015-10-25T00:00:00	2015-10-14	['None']
pomt-09101	"We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/22/edward-markey/markey-says-us-consumes-25-percent-worlds-oil-desp/	The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on the nation's energy portfolio. In an appearance on the June 20, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said, "We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis. That is nonsustainable." We won't pass judgment on whether it's sustainable or not, since that's a matter of opinion. But we did think it would be worth checking Markey's facts, especially since this comparison has become something of a Democratic talking point. President Barack Obama said something similar in his Oval Office address to the nation on June 15, 2010. The president's phrasing differed slightly, saying that the United States consumes "more than 20 percent" of the world’s oil, rather than "25 percent." We looked to the Energy Information Administration -- the nonpartisan Energy Department office that publishes the most complete set of statistics on U.S. energy use -- to confirm these numbers. For U.S. oil reserves, we turned to EIA's "World Liquid Fuels Analysis to 2030." A table in this report showed that, as of Jan. 1, 2009, the U.S. has 21.3 billion barrels of oil reserves. That's about 1.6 percent of the world total which, rounded up, would be 2 percent, as Markey said. (For the curious, that ranks the U.S. 12th in the world in reserves, with the top five being, in order, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait.) As for the second claim, about U.S. consumption, we turned to EIA's country-by-country summaries of petroleum consumption. The most recent figures, available for 2008, are preliminary. These show that the U.S. consumed 19,498,000 barrels per day, compared to 85,462,000 for the world as a whole -- or 22.8 percent. That's a bit lower than Markey's 25 percent. But we'll add that in 2006 and 2007, the U.S. share of world consumption was 24 percent, which is just a hair under the number Markey cited. All told, Markey would have been better off using Obama's formulation -- that the U.S. consumes "more than 20 percent" of the world's oil. But he's still close. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00617	Says Ted Cruz said: "While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/may/28/facebook-posts/made-ted-cruz-quotation-has-texan-comparing-child-/	Readers brought to our attention a Facebook meme suggesting U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican running for president, made a comment suggesting child molestation wasn’t as terrible as gay relations. We were skeptical, in part because we’ve found no factual bases for similar web posts attempting to link Cruz to especially provocative statements. Pants on Fire ratings were bestowed in March and April 2015 to two outlandish posts about Cruz.. Now comes this May 2015 Facebook post showing a smiling Cruz next to Josh Duggar, who resigned from the conservative Family Research Council May 21, 2015. Duggar's resignation came after reports surfaced that at the age of 14, he had allegedly sexually assaulted four female siblings in his large family, plus an additional female victim. According to U.S. News and World Report, Duggar’s family confirmed the allegations via an apology on their Facebook page, downplaying the multiple incidents as "very bad mistakes." For those of us bereft o' cable TV: Josh Duggar is among the children in the Duggar family of Arkansas who are stars of the TLC show "19 Kids and Counting." The Facebook post says that the day after Duggar quit the council, Cruz said: "While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other." We spotted the meme, posted the evening of May 22, 2015, on a Facebook page titled Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off. It had been shared more than 4,600 times in its first four days online: SOURCE: Facebook post, May 22, 2015 We asked Cruz aides about the quotation and didn’t hear back. Separately, our search of the Nexis news database yielded no sign of Cruz commenting on the allegations about Duggar, which surfaced in recent reporting by In Touch magazine, which cited local police reports. Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has been adamantly opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court possibly legalizing same-sex marriage. At an April 2015 event in Wisconsin, he said advocates of traditional marriage should ''fall to our knees and pray'' against such a decision, the New York Times reported. Its April 26, 2015, news story said too, though, that Cruz had earlier indicated at a New York event that he would be comfortable if his young daughter were gay. On May 24, 2015, the debunkists at Snopes.com found nothing to the May 2015 Facebook post supposedly quoting Cruz. Snopes.com added: "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is an entertainment Facebook group that frequently mocks conservative politicians and pundits with fake quotes, and their disclaimer states that their ‘page is for entertainment purposes’ and ‘is NOT meant to be taken seriously.’" Maybe this is the right time to point out the same Facebook group on May 25, 2015, posted a made-up quotation attributed to PolitiFact: "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is the most accurate source for news, not only on Facebook, but pretty much everywhere."

pomt-11654	On expanding offshore oil drilling	full flop	/florida/statements/2018/jan/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-full-flop-oil-drilling/	Gov. Rick Scott met with a member of President Donald Trump’s administration and struck a deal to remove Florida from a list of states proposed for more offshore oil drilling. "As a result of our interest in making sure that there's no drilling here, Florida will be taken off the table," Scott said Jan. 9th, after meeting with U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in Tallahassee. Zinke highlighted Scott’s role in the deal. "Florida is obviously unique," Zinke said. "For Floridians, we are not drilling off the coast of Florida, and clearly the governor has expressed that it's important." Scott’s statement led to claims that Scott had flip-flopped on offshore oil drilling. We decided to measure whether Scott had shifted his position on our Flip-O-Meter. Scott’s announcement came as the term-limited Republican governor is poised to potentially run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, an opponent of an expansion of drilling. Scott’s spokespersons argued that Scott made no flip. "Since 2010, Governor Scott has consistently said that we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected and has made it clear that protecting the environment is his top priority," Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. Today, he opposes an expansion. Scott favored drilling in 2010 PolitiFact Florida has tracked Scott’s stance on oil drilling since his first campaign in 2010. On his campaign website then, Scott called for more drilling offshore but said that the state’s beaches must be protected. "As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S. we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards. ... Rick supports expansion of nuclear power, use of alternative fuels and off-shore drilling." A Scott campaign spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida in May 2010 that his campaign had initially posted his position before the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April and later updated it to add the phrase about the environment and safety standards. During that summer, Scott reiterated his call for safe offshore drilling when meeting with Panhandle fishermen. Scott said drilling wouldn’t happen in the "foreseeable future. ...We are not going to drill now. ...It's not safe. It doesn't make any sense." Scott never took significant steps toward his promise to explore expansion of drilling in a safe, environmentally sound way. We rated his promise broken in 2013. Trump’s plan to open up drilling In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order that aimed to expand offshore drilling. Scott was initially mum. Days later, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times that he hadn’t seen the proposal and declined to comment. The state Department of Environmental Protection sent an Aug. 17 letter to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management raising concerns about the effects of oil and gas activities on the environment, but did not expressly oppose the drilling proposal. On Jan. 4, Zinke announced a proposal to open up more coastal areas in Florida, California and the Atlantic to drilling. Scott expressed his voice quickly on Twitter Jan. 4, saying that he opposed drilling: "Based on media reports, it is likely that the Department of the Interior will consider Florida as a potential state for offshore oil drilling – which is something I oppose in Florida. I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration. My top priority is to ensure that Florida's natural resources are protected, which is why I proposed $1.7 billion for the environment in this year's budget." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Over the next few days, Scott had multiple meetings with Trump administration officials. On Jan. 9, when asked what caused the Trump administration to change its position on Florida drilling, Zinke said, "The governor." Scott praised the Trump administration for removing Florida from consideration. Oil and gas exploration doesn’t seem to be entirely off the table, though. Zinke said seismic testing still would be allowed, but no new drilling. Susan Glickman, Florida Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the only reason to allow seismic testing is to find places to drill. Our ruling During his first campaign for governor in 2010, Scott called for drilling offshore. After the Deepwater Horizon explosion, he added language to his campaign website to state that he wanted drilling done in an "environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards." During his first term, Scott took no meaningful steps to expand drilling. But when Trump’s administration proposed an expansion of offshore drilling Jan. 4, Scott said he opposed the idea and sought a meeting with Zinke. That rejection sounds different from his stance when he first ran for governor in 2010 and he was open to drilling. We give Scott a Full Flop.

pomt-08306	"The Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/30/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-claims-mitch-mcconnell-says/	With the looming possibility of Democrats losing their grip on the House and possibly even the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections, President Barack Obama took some time in his weekly address on Oct. 30, 2010, to talk about the need to work in a bipartisan way to solve the country's most pressing issues, such as the weak economy. But Obama said a couple recent comments from Republican leaders weren't a good harbinger. "Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, we need to come together to help put people who are still looking for jobs back to work," Obama said. "On these issues -- issues that will determine our success or failure in this new century -- I believe it’s the fundamental responsibility of all who hold elective office to seek out common ground," Obama said. "It may not always be easy to find agreement; at times we’ll have legitimate philosophical differences. And it may not always be the best politics. But it is the right thing to do for our country. "That’s why I found the recent comments by the top two Republican in Congress so troubling. The Republican leader of the House actually said that "this is not the time for compromise." And the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." We're fact-checking the last part, the claim that "the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." It's based on a comment Sen. Mitch McConnelll made in an interview with the National Journal's Major Garrett on Oct. 29, 2010: "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." So McConnelll said it. But we think some further context is in order. McConnell said he had been studying the history of presidents who suffered big defeats in midterm elections in Congress, but then won re-election in two years anyway. McConnelll said he doesn't want Republicans to repeat the same mistakes that allowed that to happen. "After 1994, the public had the impression we Republicans overpromised and underdelivered," McConnell said. "We suffered from some degree of hubris and acted as if the president was irrelevant and we would roll over him. By the summer of 1995, he was already on the way to being re-elected, and we were hanging on for our lives." McConnell said Republicans need to treat the midterm elections as "the first step in retaking the government." It was in that context that McConnell said, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Garrett asked if that meant "endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president?" Said McConnell, "If President Obama does a Clintonian backflip, if he’s willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it’s not inappropriate for us to do business with him." In other words, in the very same interview, McConnell said that he'd be willing to work with Obama if Obama is "willing to meet us halfway." That's called compromise. And that sounds very much in the spirit of Obama's call to "seek out common ground." The other comment Obama referred to came from House Leader John Boeher in a radio interview with Sean Hannity on Oct. 27, 2010. It was made in the context of the health care bill, in response to retiring Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) saying it wouldn't be a good idea to repeal the bill. "This is not a time for compromise," Boehner said. "...We're going to do everything -- and I mean everything -- we can do, to kill it, stop it, slow it down." We think Obama's comment leaves the impression Boehner's "not a time for compromise" statement was more general in nature -- as opposed to being specifically targeted at the health care bill. As for McConnell's comment "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president," that sounds an awful lot like Obama's summation that "his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." But while McConnell said it, Obama left out an important detail -- that McConnell also said in the same interview that he is willing to meet the president halfway. That leads us to a ruling of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-30T16:05:42	2010-10-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-02138	Says the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans, and that its president called Nancy Pelosi "the person I respect the most in Washington."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/07/defending-main-street/did-club-growth-president-say-he-respected-nancy-p/	An Idaho congressional race has become a key battleground in the face-off between establishment and anti-establishment Republicans. In an attempt to tar its rival with an ideology-bending linkage, Defending Main Street is trying to tie Bryan Smith, the Tea Party challenger to GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, to — of all people — House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. "Meet the DC insider launching misleading attacks about Mike Simpson," the ad says. Then, the ad plays a clip of Club for Growth president Chris Chocola saying, "The person I respect the most in Washington might surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi." The narrator continues: "His group spends more money trying to defeat Republicans than defeating Democrats. … And while personal injury attorney Bryan Smith and his financial backers help Pelosi, Mike Simpson is Nancy Pelosi’s worst nightmare." (Not to be outdone, Smith’s supporters are also trying to tie Simpson to Pelosi. We looked at that ad separately.) In this fact-check, we’ll review Club for Growth’s record in recent campaigns and see whether the ad accurately portrays what Chocola said about Pelosi. What is the Club for Growth? The Club for Growth has supported candidates who are focused on lowering taxes and easing regulations. The club has frequently ruffled feathers within the Republican establishment by endorsing primary challengers to GOP incumbents and by pushing Republicans further to the right in order to head off intra-party competition. For example, in Indiana’s 2012 primary, the club supported Richard Mourdock over longtime Republican Sen. Richard Lugar (Mourdock won the primary but lost the general election). Last year, the club strongly backed the government shutdown to defund Obamacare. In this campaign cycle, they’ve pumped more than $100,000 into Idaho to help Smith oust Simpson in the primary, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the ad, Defending Main Street says the Club for Growth spends more money fighting Republicans than Democrats. They have spent quite a bit — $11.5 million since 2011— running ads against Republicans. That’s about 55 percent of $21 million they’ve spent in the last four years. But the money spent against Republicans wasn’t in general elections to help Democrats, it was in primaries where Republicans had conservative challengers. They’ve also spent more than $5 million attacking Democrats and about $4.5 million running ads supporting Republicans. So it’s true that the group has challenged Republicans, but typically by boosting one Republican against another in GOP primaries. Respecting Pelosi And how about that quote from Club for Growth president Chris Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana? The clip is taken from an American Enterprise Institute discussion called "Tea party vs. establishment: Who is helping the right, and who is hurting it?" (Chocola was debating Steve LaTourette, who helped create Defending Main Street.) Chocola was defending Club for Growth’s support for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and like-minded conservatives in the House and Senate who last year pushed Congress to defund Obamacare even at the risk of a government shutdown. Here’s the transcript of Chocola’s remarks:: "The person I respect the most in Washington my surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi. The reason I respect Nancy Pelosi is because she had a historic job. She was the first woman speaker of the United States House of Representatives. And she woke up for 40 years saying, ‘I want to pass nationalized health care.’ And she got the job that she could get it done, and during the process she realized that public opinion polls never get close to 50 percent approval. ... "But she got it done and she knew it would jeopardize her historic job. She could lose her job over doing what she believed. But she found a way to do it. Because she believed in it so strongly, it’s the law today. Is there a Republican you can think of that is willing to risk their job to do what they think is right? Is there a policy that they’re willing to fight on? … If you don’t like the tactic of Ted Cruz going to the floor and doing a filibuster, what’s yours? What’s your tactic besides surrender? Is it better fight, make a point and lose, or just surrender, making no point?’" The full context makes it clear that what Chocola admired about Pelosi was her tactical ability -- her singleminded willingness to pursue her goals in the face of great risks -- and not the substance of what she was fighting for. Chocola didn’t support Pelosi’s policies or Obamacare, but instead wished Republicans would follow her example and take firm stances to pass their priorities. And that’s a very different impression than one would get from the ad. The moderator of the debate, AEI fellow and Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney, told PolitiFact that he never took Chocola’s statement to mean he had love for Pelosi. "Main Street's ad struck me as totally misleading," Carney said. "Chocola was clearly saying Republicans need to be as dedicated to their conservative beliefs as Pelosi is to her liberal beliefs. The Main Street ad clearly implies Chocola is a buddy of Pelosi, which was not at all the nature of his remarks." Our ruling There’s some truth to the claim that the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans. One of the club’s key strategies has been to put its money in Republican primaries in order to support the most aggressively conservative candidates. This means taking on some Republicans — but also supporting others. Meanwhile, Chocola clearly said what the ad said he did, but the ad takes that remark wildly out of context. Chocola was expressing admiration for Pelosi’s Machiavellianism, not supporting her political agenda. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07685	"Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. Mubarak didn't want independent unions. These autocrats in history don't want independent unions."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/08/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-hitler-stalin-and-mubarek-a/	Ohio's Sherrod Brown took the floor of the U.S. Senate last week to recall some history he considered pertinent, given current events involving public worker unions in Ohio and Wisconsin. "I look back at history," he said, "and some of the worst governments we've ever had, you know one of the first things they ever did? They went after the trade unions. Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. (Former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak didn't want independent unions. These autocrats in history don't want independent unions." Brown hastened to say that he was not drawing an analogy. "I'm not comparing what's happening to the workers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin," he said. "But I am saying that history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in society that creates a middle class, and it protects our freedom." Recent history also teaches us that nuance and context are lost when someone drops the H-bomb. Mentioning Hitler in political discussion obscures any other point. The Washington website Politico.com quickly posted a partial video of Brown's speech that carried the headline, "Sherrod Brown compares Republicans to Hitler." Chris Bond, press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released video of part of the speech, with the headline: "Sherrod Brown invokes Hitler in his latest political attack." E-mailed and tweeted video links started making the rounds. Brown's office noted that some of the links and postings did not include the full context of his remarks, but that should not have come as a surprise. Brown apologized the next day. "I should not have mentioned the hostility of tyrants like Hitler to unions," he said. "I don't want my mistake to distract from the critical debate in Ohio, and I apologize for it." But fact-checking is our business. Even accepting that Brown did not intend a comparison, PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine the accuracy of his history. We thought it was important, in particular, because of postings by some bloggers and commenters claiming Hitler did not oppose unions -- that he wrote favorably about them in "Mein Kampf," that he proclaimed May Day a workers' holiday, and that he even started a union. We looked at contemporary and historical accounts and a transcript of the Nuremberg Trials, and we consulted Kenneth F. Ledford, associate professor of history and law at Case Western Reserve University. He is a social historian of modern Germany and an authority on German legal and labor history. Citations from "Mein Kampf" come from the chapter "The Problem of the Trade Unions" -- "which is really pretty incoherent," Ledford said. "It is not an endorsement of trade unions but a call to subordinate the message of class solidarity to one of national solidarity" and "a call for the quiescence of labor to favor heavy industry," he said. In saluting unions, as in naming the Nazis the National Socialist German Workers' Party, Hitler "was using words he knew had appeal. It was as if they had been focus-grouped. Those were hot-button words that had resonance in the revolutionary period after 1918. "The reality is, the (Nazi) party could not make inroads into the organized, unionized, working-class electorate in Germany," Ledford said. May Day was first celebrated as an international day of labor in New York in the 1880s. Hitler made it an official paid holiday, not just a negotiated day off, on May 1, 1933 -- and used it to rally for his regime and industrialization. William Shirer (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich), who was there, called it "an elaborate piece of trickery." The next day, on May 2, 1933, unions were dissolved, their assets were confiscated, their offices were occupied and their leaders were arrested. Hitler then outlawed strikes, abolished collective bargaining and established the German Labor Front, a corrupt party organization. "It wasn't even a sham labor union," Ledford said. In Russia, he noted, "Stalin didn't have to eliminate unions -- Lenin already had." And Stalin's first Five-Year Plan converted labor groups into oppressive mechanisms for increasing worker productivity. Mubarak does not belong in the same category as Hitler and Stalin. But his government did routinely suppress worker protests by force. The government-run Egyptian Trade Union Federation was given a monopoly on labor organization in 1957 by the Trade Union Act, which prohibits union freedoms. Brown’s statement about tyrants and unions may have been distracting and ill-advised given the current standoffs, but it also is historically accurate. We rate Brown’s statement as True.

pomt-03296	Says the State Department spent $630,000 to get 2 million Facebook "Likes."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/aug/01/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-tax-dollars-went-down-drain-b/	Money can’t buy you love, as the Beatles sang, but money can buy you "like." Sen. Rob Portman thinks the price can be more than it’s worth. The Ohio Republican made the point in his monthly statement for July "highlighting Washington’s wasteful spending during a time of record debt and deficits." This one, decrying "tax dollars down the drain," said the U.S. State Department "spent $630,000 to obtain 2 million Facebook 'Likes'." "With Washington running budget deficits of more than $1 trillion – or $10,000 per household – the Administration should not be wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous items such as attempting to buy Facebook fans," Portman said. That clicked with PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more. Portman said his source was a report by the U.S. State Department’s inspector general. Completed in May, the 57-page report was one in a periodic series examining policy implementation, resource management and management controls in the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs. The report says the bureau launched digital diplomacy campaigns in 2011 and 2012 that started or expanded online activities in six foreign languages, and started or expanded English-language Facebook pages, Twitter feeds and blogs aimed at foreign audiences. "The bureau spent about $630,000 on the two campaigns," the inspector general found, "and succeeded in increasing the fans of the English Facebook pages from about 100,000 to more than 2 million for each page. Advertising also helped increase interest in the foreign language pages; by March 2013, they ranged from 68,000 to more than 450,000 fans. "Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as 'buying fans' who may have once clicked on an ad or 'liked' a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further," the report said. The inspector general found that the number of Facebook users who actually engaged with each page was relatively small, with only about 2 percent "liking," sharing or commenting on any item within the previous week. And the report said that the bureau's target audience is older and more influential than the people likely to spend hours engaging on the social site. The campaign became less effective in 2012, the report said, when Facebook changed its mechanics, making the bureau's fan pages less prominent to users who did not engage with them. But engaging with fans might not be an improvement over trying to increase the number of them, the inspector general said: "The bureau could reduce spending and increase strategic impact by focusing its advertising not on raising overall fan numbers or general engagement statistics but on accomplishing specific PD [public diplomacy] goals." State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked about the report during a daily briefing with reporters on July 3. She said that the Bureau of International Information Programs had cut its spending on Facebook ads, from $315,000 a year to $36,000 a year. "Spending on online advertising has significantly decreased," she said. "It’s now at $2,500 a month, and that still allows us to reach out and communicate with a wide range of individuals living overseas. And on June 27th, IIP also submitted to OIG (Office of the Inspector General) its strategy for implementing the report’s recommendations, and also provided an update on those that have already been met. IIP will implement the majority of OIG’s recommendations on or before the start of fiscal year 2014." It is important to know that the inspector general's stinging report found that the Facebook campaign was being questioned in the bureau by November 2012, and that spending has been cut by almost 90 percent. But Portman's statement about the State Department spending for Facebook "Likes" is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

pomt-07349	"Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero. There is no collective bargaining for federal employees."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/10/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-federal-workers-have-zippo-ze/	Equity among workers is one of Republican Gov. John Kasich’s most consistent arguments in favor of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law. The law, Senate Bill 5, will bring Ohio’s public workers closer in line with private sector workers, who, on average, pay more for health care benefits and have weaker pensions, Kasich repeatedly has said. Now the governor is weaving collective bargaining for federal workers – or lack thereof – into his support for the law. Even though SB 5 restricts collective bargaining for the state’s 360,000 public workers, they would still be better off than federal workers, Kasich recently told a Youngstown radio show. "Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero," Kasich told radio host Dan Rivers on April 26 when discussing SB 5. "There is no collective bargaining for federal employees." Kasich has been among the most vocal supporters of SB 5, and likely will continue to fill that role if the law heads toward a voter referendum this fall. Considering his influence and the widespread interest in SB 5, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim about collective bargaining for federal workers. We did not have to dig deep to get started. Our colleagues at PolitiFact checked a similar statement Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made in late February, when his state, like Ohio, was in the middle of a controversial effort to pass legislation to limit collective bargaining for public workers. Walker told NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory that "most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay." PolitiFact gave Walker’s claim a True rating. So how does Kasich’s similar claim hold up? Federal workers generally cannot collectively bargain pay and benefits, but they can negotiate working conditions, according to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which administers the labor-management relations program for more than 1 million federal workers. "Employees also have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees," the FLRA’s program guide reads. There are about 1.6 million non-postal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining. For the most part, however, federal workers only can negotiate working conditions, said Sarah Whittle Spooner, FLRA counsel for regulatory and external affairs. The right to negotiate working conditions is significant, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. (PolitiFact also interviewed Bronfenbrenner while checking Gov. Walker’s claim. We interviewed her separately.) Bronfenbrenner pointed to a recent union election among the Transportation Security Administration’s 43,000 workers. They had three options: either of two unions vying to represent them or no union at all. More than 16,000 of the workers voted in favor of a union representation and about 3,000 voted for neither union. Because the vote between the two unions was so close, there will be a runoff election May 23 to June 21. "Would they have organized a union if they didn’t have the right to bargain?" Bronfenbrenner asked. "They wouldn’t have gone through all this if there wasn’t something at the end of the tunnel." So what does it mean for federal workers who can negotiate working conditions? It means they can negotiate discipline policies, hours of work, procedures for performance evaluations, safety, procedures for layoffs and more, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union, with about 625,000 members from about 75 federal agencies. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols acknowledged federal workers do have some ability to bargain collectively. "The fact is most federal workers cannot collectively bargain for pay or benefits and the governor’s point is that under Senate Bill 5, Ohio’s public employees will have more collective bargaining rights than most federal employees," Nichols said. So where does Kasich land on the Truth-O-Meter? It would be easy to rate Kasich’s statement False. Federal workers may have limited collective bargaining powers. But that isn't "zippo" and "zero." But the governor also is known to shoot from the hip, and ruling an off-the-cuff statement as False without looking at his underlying meaning would amount to a game of gotcha -- a game PolitiFact doesn’t play. Kasich long has advocated reigning in collective bargaining, arguing that schools and governments needed better ability to control labor costs. But he has not called for it’s elimination. Changes approved in SB 5 would reduce the number of topics subject to union negotiations, ban public workers from striking, prohibit employers from paying more than 85 percent of workers’ health insurance costs, and base pay raises on performance rather than length of service. But public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective bargaining powers than most federal workers, Kasich’s underlying point. That some federal workers can bargain over working conditions, rather than having "zero" collective bargaining ability, is a critical fact, though, that could give a listener a different impression. We rate Kasich’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11064	Says Donald Trump's executive order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/22/tammy-baldwin/trumps-executive-order-doesnt-address-2000-separat/	On June 21, 2018, the day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on the separation of children from their parents at the border, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin tried to poke holes in it. The Wisconsin Democrat is running for re-election in November 2018. Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson are seeking the Republican nomination to run against her. Baldwin, interviewed on "Late Night with Seth Meyers," claimed Trump’s order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families." In some respects, this is a fluid situation. So let’s set out what was known when Baldwin made her statement. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The order Families attempting to enter the United States without permission had been separated in the past, but immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. That changed in April 2018, when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings. Government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12. After an international outcry, Trump reversed himself and signed the executive order to end the practice of separating families. (Vukmir also shifted her position on separating families at the border, earning a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter.) The Trump order reiterates that the administration’s policy is to "rigorously enforce our immigration laws." It says in part: It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources … The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law ….Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 ("Flores settlement"), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. So, to the second part of Baldwin’s statement, the order does call for continuing to detain families -- though together, rather than separating parents from their children. But her use of the word "jailing" goes too far. The families, while kept in custody in some type of facility, would not be incarcerated in jails. The children already separated As for the 2,300 children already separated, PolitiFact National said it was not clear how or if the policy change might ultimately affect them. Initially, on the day of order, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said there would be no special effort from the Trump administration to reunite migrant families separated at the border. But later the same day, the department said the spokesperson had misspoken about the order. In a statement, the department said "it is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter," but that "reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of" unaccompanied alien children "and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody." In any case, the order itself does not address the 2,300 children. Moreover, Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, told National Public Radio that reunification would be hampered by the U.S. separation process, which keeps parents in federal custody while moving children into facilities controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services. "The U.S. authorities create different files for the children than for the parents, and it's very difficult to follow up on those cases," Torres said. And CNN noted that separated children are in facilities or foster homes spread across states far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including Michigan, New York, South Carolina and more. The White House referred us to a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services, but we didn’t get a reply. Our rating Baldwin says Trump's executive order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families." The thrust of Baldwin’s statement is correct. Federal officials in charge of reunification said after the order they "are awaiting further guidance" on how to proceed. But in fact the order does not address reunifying the 2,300 children with their parents, which is seen as a complicated process. The order also says, as Baldwin claims, that families entering the country without permission will continue to be detained — together, rather than parents and children being separated. But while the families would be in custody, at various facilities, Baldwin overreaches in saying the families would be put in jails. Baldwin’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification — our definition of Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-06-22T17:51:22	2018-06-21	['None']

pomt-03382	Obamacare "will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jul/09/chain-email/illegal-immigrants-are-covered-under-health-care-l/	There are no graveyards for ridiculous, oft-debunked chain emails. A lengthy, widespread email keeps resurfacing with dire warnings about Obamacare as determined by Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. "Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on," the email begs. "We all need to be informed." Unfortunately, the email is riddled with errors, starting with the fact that is referring to an initial 2009 health care proposal that never became law. Still, because it has the subject line "Obama Care Outrage," we thought people might confuse it with the health care law on the books. In that context, and given all the talk about potential immigration reform, one line jumped out: "The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally," the email states. Make no mistake, this line is wrong in the context of the 2009 law (Pants on Fire! wrong, in fact), and wrong in the context of the health care bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Let us explain. The Affordable Care Act contains an individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits. But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don’t have to follow the mandate because they shouldn’t be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage). Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery. And federal law requires hospitals not to turn away individuals for emergency treatment, even if they are uninsured (or undocumented), according to the National Immigration Law Center. But those policies predate the Affordable Care Act. "They don’t get health insurance, which is coverage, which is different than a hospital getting reimbursed for Medicaid," said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Chain, a consumer health advocacy group. The Affordable Care Act does provide some benefits for certain legal non-U.S. citizens. We repeat: Legal. Immigrants who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges. Thanks to the Supreme Court and Florida legislators, certain poor, legal noncitizens have it a little easier in Florida than the state's most impoverished citizens. The law includes a special rule (page 108) allowing them to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they (a) do not qualify for Medicaid because they have not been here for the required five years and (b) earn at or below the poverty line. Meanwhile, about 1 million of Florida’s poorest citizens will continue not to have affordable access to health insurance. They are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges, and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them during the 2013 legislative session. Goodhue calls it a "black hole" of coverage. Republican Gov. Jan Brewer had noticed a similar scenario playing out in Arizona if its leaders did not expand Medicaid, saying, "For poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, only legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies." Our ruling The chain email says that Obamacare provides insurance "to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally." It’s actually citing a 2009 proposal that didn’t pass, but that doesn’t really matter. The email’s wrong either way. The Affordable Care Act does nothing to provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. It does offer some assistance to legal non-U.S. citizens, which by the way is different than a non-U.S. resident as the email claims. (A non-U.S. resident could be living in Mexico, France or even Mars). We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-07-09T16:36:53	2013-07-07	['United_States']
pomt-13536	"They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/29/donald-trump/trump-says-they-were-going-build-wall-06-no-enviro/	Donald Trump may have confused people recently about whether he supports mass deportation. But there’s one thing he’s been consistent about: building a wall along the southern border. And having Mexico pay for it. In an interview aired Aug. 23, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the Republican presidential nominee how long it would take to build the wall, from start to finish. "Almost immediately," Trump answered. "Now if you would believe it, you know, they were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements. Can you believe it? Okay. Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad or…" We were curious about wall plans from a decade ago and whether environmental impact statements hindered its construction, as Trump’s statements suggest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for more information. But immigration experts referred us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush. Secure Fence Act The act called for the construction 700 miles of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. It also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to deter illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Bush said the new law would make borders more secure and hailed it as "an important step toward immigration reform." The act also required the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Environmental impact statements So there was a 2006 law that sought to increase fencing around the border. But it didn’t face hurdles from environmental impact statements. That’s because the REAL ID Act of 2005, passed by Congress, gave the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to "waive all legal requirements" that may get in the way of construction of barriers and roads along the border. In 2008, then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, used his authority to waive environmental reviews. "Congress and the American public have been adamant that they want and expect border security," said Chertoff in an April 2008 New York Times report. "We’re serious about delivering it, and these waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward." The secretary also waived requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act, according to Melinda Taylor, who directs an energy and environmental law center at the University of Texas and who co-wrote a paper on the environmental impacts of the border wall between Texas and Mexico. The waivers were not without controversy. "The environment was certainly a major issue that opponents of the wall brought up," said Cassie Williams, spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. But DHS did not need an environmental impact statement because of the Congress-approved waiver, Williams said. In July 2008, DHS released an Environmental Stewardship Plan, analyzing potential environmental impacts of the fence and plans to mitigate them. While there were environmental concerns related to fence construction, "it’s simply false that environmental requirements or issues impeded wall construction," said Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. Gilman believes it’s appropriate to call the fencing a wall because it’s clear that it was supposed to keep people out. Segments built are generally 18-feet high, she said. Rebecca Hamlin, assistant professor of legal studies at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said environmental concerns were raised at the border, but believes money is what has halted additional construction, not environmental impact statements. A 2009 U.S. Government Accountability Office report noted that for fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the Secure Border Initiative program -- designed to secure borders and curb illegal immigration -- received about $3.6 billion. About $2.4 billion of that amount was allocated to complete about 670 miles of vehicle and pedestrian fencing along the roughly 2,000-mile border. That same report found that pedestrian fencing accounted for 140 of the miles Customs and Border Protection had completed by Oct. 31, 2008, averaging $3.9 million a mile. Vehicle fencing costs averaged $1 million a mile. "The per-mile costs to build the fencing varied considerably because of the type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs, among other things," the 2009 report said. Our ruling Trump said, "They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements." The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of an additional 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. While there were environmental concerns related to the construction, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived required environmental reviews in order to proceed with construction. Trump’s statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10493	"The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/mccain-often-absent-on-childrens-issues/	The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail list of "10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)." The e-mail goes after him on issues from domestic policy to foreign policy to personal attributes. It urges recipients to forward the email to "your friends, family and co-workers." Item five addresses children's issues. "The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill." It's true that McCain had the worst score — 10 percent — in the Senate from the Children's Defense Fund for 2007. But it's important to note that McCain's score was so low because he missed eight of 10 votes that the fund evaluates. On the two issues remaining, McCain voted for one (raising the minimum wage) and against one (expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP). For the record, Sen. Barack Obama scored 60 percent, missing four of the critical 10 votes and siding with the group on the six votes he cast. Sen. Hillary Clinton scored 70 percent, missing three votes and agreeing with the group on the seven votes she cast. MoveOn is correct that McCain voted against the children's health bill and defended President Bush's veto of the program. McCain, though, said he voted against the bill because it didn't contain adequate provisions for paying for the expansion. "The American people have rebelled against out-of-control spending. If they can find a legitimate way to pay for it, I would consider it," he said. So McCain may have scored better on the Children's Defense Fund scorecard if he had been there for more of the votes. (Though McCain's history with the group isn't that great, either. In 2006, his score was 10 percent and in 2005 it was 22 percent.) But MoveOn omits the caveat that his vote against SCHIP was based on spending concerns. But these are minor points, and not enough to notch down the Truth-O-Meter too much. We find MoveOn's statement about McCain's rating and his stance on the children's health bill to be True.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2008-04-08T00:00:00	2008-04-05	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-07517	"A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/08/tim-ryan/series-errors-thwarts-rep-tim-ryans-accuracy-milit/	A March 16 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the war in Afghanistan put the spotlight on a widely documented increase in military suicides. During questioning of General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and Michele Flournoy, undersecretary of defense for policy, Rep. Tim Ryan cited figures for military personnel who have contemplated taking their own lives "From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours. A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide," Ryan said at the hearing. PolitiFact Ohio checked the first part of his quote in a separate item and rated it True. This item will just check his assertion that 7.3 percent of personnel in the Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide. We started by trying to verify the existence of the Navy Times report that Ryan mentioned, which was supposed to indicate that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide. When we couldn’t find it among Navy Times articles archived in the Lexis-Nexis database, we contacted editors at Navy Times. They confirmed that the publication never reported such a statistic. The closest thing we found was a December 2009 article on attempted suicides in the military during 2008. It cites a Defense Department survey that found the Navy had a 2.8 percent attempted suicide rate that year, the Army had a 2 percent rate, the Marine Corps had a 2.3 percent rate and the Air Force had a rate of 1.6 percent. It’s important to note, though, that these numbers represent service members who actually tried to kill themselves, not those who thought about suicide, as Ryan said. But Ryan’s statistic, it turns out, evolved from this December 2009 article via a circuitous series of bloopers. First, instead of consulting the original article or the military report from which it drew its information, Ryan got his information from a student-researched blog entry on a website operated by "Project Censored." That blog item said: "According to the Navy Times, 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marine soldiers reported in a survey that they had attempted suicide at one point." The "Project Censored" author used an article from "The World Socialist Web Site" as his main source, and committed a math gaffe in attempting to summarize the article. Instead of finding a combined average for suicide attempts in those three service branches, the student added the percentages together to produce an erroneously high 7.3 percent figure. The total is slightly off from the sum of the Navy Times numbers because the Socialist website incorrectly listed the Navy’s suicide attempt rate as 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent. Finally, Ryan added in his own mistake to the mix by claiming the figure applied to suicidal thoughts instead of suicide attempts. "Congressman Ryan unfortunately misstated the statistics," Ryan spokesman Erick Sanchez acknowledged in an email. Sanchez sent us the original government report that contains the statistics reported by Navy Times. It also contains data on suicidal thoughts by members of the U.S. military. That report said that in 2008, almost 5 percent of Defense Department personnel said they’d seriously considered suicide. The Air Force (3.1 percent) and Coast Guard (2.8 percent) had lower rates of suicidal thoughts than the other service branches, which were all around the 5 percent mark. Although the rate of suicidal thoughts had not increased since 2005, the report found that "all DoD services reported at least a doubling in rates of attempting suicide from 2005 to 2008." It cited an overall military rate of 2.2 percent for attempted suicides. So where does that leave us on the Truth-O-Meter? Through a series of goofs and misrepresentations, data about actual attempted suicides among military personnel became a number cited as the percentage of those who had contemplated suicide. The numbers Ryan cited didn’t come directly from the military. Instead, he relied on material from a blog article that used faulty mathematics to come up with an erroneous percentage. The series of errors took data from a military report on a ridiculous course to create an inaccurate statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, that kind of a claim rates as Pants on Fire.

pomt-08345	Tells David Cicilline, "94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/28/john-loughlin/house-candidate-loughlin-claims-94-percent-carbon-/	We all know about the theory of climate change, the idea that the earth is gradually warming because of pollution. Whenever the weather turns particularly hot or cold, we joke about it, often in supportive or derisive terms depending on our opinion on the issue. Unlike some other Republicans who dismiss global warming, John Loughlin, who is running for Congress in the 1st District, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. However, he said during a September press conference, "I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them, in fact, the vast majority of them, are naturally occurring." He made a similar statement Oct. 19 during a WPRI/Providence Journal debate when challenged on the topic by his Democratic rival, David Cicilline. "I'm not a scientist but I did work for NASA and when I was at NASA we had a scientist who I actually did some of the press release work for by the name of Dr. James Hansen at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen released a peer-reviewed paper in the '70s that talked about global cooling. And then it's only later that he's kind of gotten a conversion to global warming." He went on to tell Cicilline, "I'm saying really the earth is warming, but it's not conclusively caused by man. It's not conclusive. I mean 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature." When people talk about carbon emissions, they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide, the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow. Unfortunately, when levels in the air become too high, it traps heat coming from the sun as part of the so-called "greenhouse effect." (Other gases such as methane and ozone also play a role, as do tiny particles known as aerosols.) The warmer air melts polar caps, raises sea levels and shifts ecosystems toward the poles. Plants and animals that can't adapt risk extinction. Loughlin's 94-percent figure sounds very authoritative and specific. So we emailed Loughlin's campaign on Oct. 21, and called his spokeswoman a day later, to ask for the source. They have not responded. Meanwhile, we emailed a copy of Loughlin's debate comment to Hansen. "I never had any global cooling paper or talk or comment," he wrote back to us. "The change of carbon dioxide, the increase year to year is entirely human-made. There is an up-and-down flux caused by vegetation growing (sucking carbon dioxide from the air) and decaying in the winter (releasing carbon dioxide), which is large -- this fluctuation is natural and does not alter the annual mean increase due to humans. He is speaking nonsense." So Hansen is saying that 0 percent of the increase in climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature, not the 94 percent claimed by Loughlin. We still wondered where Loughlin might have gotten his 94-percent figure. So we contacted William F. Ruddiman, author of a widely used climate textbook who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He agreed with Hansen, saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because fossil-fuel carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature. Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere had roughly 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to Ruddiman. Above-ground vegetation contains about 610 billion tons of carbon and the surface oceans contain about 1,000 billion tons. (There's another 1,550 billion tons or so hidden in the soil and more in the deep ocean, but that doesn't circulate fast enough to play a big role in changes over decades or centuries.) Each year, the atmosphere and ocean exchange about 75 billion tons; another 100 billion tons go back and forth between the air and the vegetation. "In those exchanges, the carbon is just moving back and forth in nature and in equal numbers, so there is no net gain to the atmosphere," Ruddiman said. Now add in the pollution generated by humans. "I think what humans are doing now is something like 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year," said Ruddiman. That amount is small compared with the amount shuttled back and forth between the air, ocean and vegetation, and perhaps half of that gets pulled out of the air. So we did some math. When there's 175 billion tons going into the air from natural sources along with 30 billion tons of pollution (for a total of 205 billion tons), that's 85 percent from natural sources. The only problem: the 175 billion tons comes back out every year, so when critics say humans are having only a small impact on the process, they are misunderstanding -- or misstating -- the process, Ruddiman said. "The amount of carbon dioxide humans are putting into the atmosphere is smaller but it's not balanced, and so it builds up over time and it causes a sizable net gain," Ruddiman explained. "It may be 10 billion tons a year but much of it builds up year after year after year," he said, and persists in the atmosphere, trapping heat like a chemical blanket. Scientists who have used a variety of techniques to track earth's changing climate over hundreds of thousands of years have found data that show carbon dioxide levels during that period never grew faster than 30 parts per million per 1,000 years. Yet the level has risen by that amount in just the last 17 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international organization widely regarded by the scientific community as a leading authority on the topic. The result is the warmer temperatures and melting icecaps widely documented around the globe. And what about volcanoes? People think of them as sending lots of carbon dioxide in the air. It turns out that eruptions are a drop in the bucket, generating 0.2 billion tons annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. We also asked Ruddiman about the concept of global cooling, which critics also focus on. The fact is, in the 1970s, geologists were saying earth was coming out of a warm period and destined for another ice age. Core samples taken from the ocean floor combined with other data had allowed them to track the timing of past ice ages as changes in the earth's orbit exposed the planet to varying amounts of sunlight. But even as scientists were tracking those cycles, which extend over thousands of years, other researchers in the '70s were warning that a carbon dioxide build-up was going to disrupt that cycle and overwhelm the natural cooling trend. "I remember thinking that probably in one thousand to two thousand years, at most, we would see snow start accumulating in the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere," Ruddiman said. "That was reasonable from what we knew from ice age cycles. What very few of us were aware of was the buildup of carbon dioxide. Most of us are geologists, not geochemists," he said, explaining that by the 1980s the problem had become obvious. "The same people who said, 'If nature remains in control we're going into a glaciation in the next 1,000 or 2,000 years' turned around and said, 'Yeah, but nature's not in control. Humans are intervening much faster than nature can do the job and so we're going into a warmer time,' " Ruddiman recalled. "It's been made to sound like scientists are flip-flopping, but it's just the natural evolution of science," he said. "You broaden your point of view as you gain information that changes your conclusions. And that's what happened." Ultimately, the Loughlin campaign did not provide any evidence that nature is responsible for the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the key problem stoking the fears of global warming. And the NASA scientist he mentioned told us Loughlin's comments were "nonsense." There's plenty of room to debate aspects of climate change, such as the best way to prevent climate-related problems, how much money should be spent on prevention, and whether it's worth the investment if other countries aren't willing to seriously limit their carbon emissions. But Loughlin's suggestion that nature is largely responsible for the looming problem is wrong. We rate his claim as False.	None	John Loughlin	None	None	None	2010-10-28T00:01:00	2010-10-19	['None']

pomt-02524	The "U.S. has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/10/cecile-richards/united-states-and-canada-together-lead-industriali/	Asked about differences among Americans on abortion rights, Cecile Richards suggested this country leads in a dubious way. Texas Monthly editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein asked Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America whose mother, Ann, served as governor of Texas: "It’s often said that abortion is an issue on which there’s no room for compromise; there are two sides that fundamentally disagree, and there’s just no coming together. Do you think that’s true?" Richards replied: "Where we see enormous common ground—maybe not among politicians but among people—is that folks want women to have access to birth control; they want young people to have access to sex education that helps them prevent becoming pregnant before they are ready to be parents. "Frankly," Richards continued, "it’s an outrage that the U.S. has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country. So that, I think, is where there is enormous common ground, and we’ve demonstrated that when women have access to family planning services and can choose the family planning that works for them, we can reduce teen pregnancy, we can reduce unintended pregnancy, and we can reduce the abortion rate." Silverstein told us the bulk of the interview took place Dec. 6, 2013, with excerpts debuting in the magazine’s February 2014 edition and online. So, does the U.S. have the highest rate of unintended pregnancies among Western industrialized countries? A word: The United Nations says online that it has no established convention for identifying "developed" and "developing" countries or areas, but in common practice, Japan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Europe are considered developed regions or areas. Guttmacher Institute research By email, Justine Sessions, a Planned Parenthood aide, offered as the basis of Richards’ claim a December 2013 "fact sheet" from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. It states: "The U.S. unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries." According to the sheet, 51-plus percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2008--or 3.4 million of 6.6 million--were unintended, which the sheet defines as mistimed (31 percent) or unwanted (20 percent). That percentage was reached by institute researchers Lawrence Finer and Mia Zolna based on U.S. government data and the institute’s Abortion Patient Survey, according to a Dec. 19, 2013, Guttmacher press release. "Although many unintended pregnancies are accepted or even welcomed," the release said, "40% end in abortion." The rate of unintended pregnancies — that is, factoring in population — is another statistic, and it’s the one Richards referred to. According to the Guttmacher fact sheet, there were 54 unintended U.S. pregnancies in 2008 for every 1,000 women aged 15-44. "In other words," the sheet says, "about 5% of reproductive-age women have an unintended pregnancy each year." The sheet’s reference to unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and other developed countries was footnoted to a December 2010 research article, published in the journal Studies in Family Planning, on global levels of unintended pregnancy as analyzed by Susheela Singh, Guttmacher’s vice president for research, and two colleagues. But that article, emailed to us by Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind, didn’t break down unintended pregnancy rates country by country. This lack of detail made us wonder how the researchers concluded that the U.S. rate significantly exceeds the rates in other Western industrialized nations. Charting unintended pregnancy rates by region Instead, the article presented a chart comparing the prevalence of unintended pregnancies by regions of the world, which the researchers said they estimated using nationally representative and small-scale surveys of 80 countries. "Of the 208 million pregnancies that occurred in 2008, we estimate that 41 percent were unintended," the authors wrote. That was up from 38 percent from an estimate in 1995. Unintended pregnancies were defined as "being comprised of unplanned births, induced abortions and miscarriages." The researches concluded that 48 percent of the 7.2 million pregnancies in 2008 in North America, in this analysis meaning only Canada and the United States, were unintended. As noted, the authors separately said 51 percent of the U.S. pregnancies that year were unintended. Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest unintended pregnancy rate in the report, at 58 percent. But both areas are not developed and industrialized, at least per the U.N.’s characterizations. Other world regions saw fewer occurrences of unintended pregnancy: Europe (44 percent), Africa (39 percent) and Asia (38 percent). By email, Wind said there are no Western industrialized countries in most of the regions with more unintended pregnancies than the U.S., with the exception of Eastern Europe. She noted, too, that the U.S. rate of unintended pregnancy in 2008 was 54 per 1,000 women aged 15-44, "well above" the 48 per 1,000 in Eastern Europe. Given that Richards spoke of the rate of unintended pregnancies, here is the 2010 study’s breakdown of such rates by region: North America (48 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44); Latin America and the Caribbean (72); Europe (38); Asia, not including Japan (49); and Africa (86). Country by country data almost non-existent Guttmacher researcher Gilda Sedgh, asked about unintended pregnancy rates for individual developed countries, told us by email: "Data on unintended pregnancy rates in developed countries are not systematically collected." Referring to the institute’s latest number-crunching, Sedgh added that researchers have preliminarily estimated that in Europe in 2012, there were 43 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44, while in North America there were 51 per 1,000. In the end, we did not identify on-point sources of information on unintended pregnancy rates in specific countries. Wind, the institute spokeswoman, said the absence of country-specific data in the published study doesn’t mean that such data always isn’t available. "Some developed countries publish unplanned birth data, some publish abortion data, and some publish both," Wind emailed. "Because not all countries publish those data, we do our analysis at the regional level. What is true is that there are no published country-specific data that directly address that claim. However, based on our research, we are confident that the US unintended pregnancy rate is higher than that of most other developed countries." At Wind’s suggestion, we reached out to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, which oversees the National Survey of Family Growth. By email, an unidentified spokesperson pointed us to a July 24, 2012, research article published in National Health Statistics Reports. The article, drawing on interviews of 12,279 U.S. women aged 15-44, estimated that 37 percent of domestic births occur due to unintended pregnancies; the researchers did not develop an independent estimate of the prevalence of unintended pregnancies or make comparisons to other countries, though it referenced Guttmacher research in stating that about half of U.S. pregnancies are unintended. Separately, James Trussel, a Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs who co-authored a January 2008 Contraception editorial on reducing unintended pregnancies, told us by email that statistics "do not exist for most countries. Even in the" United Kingdom, "we have estimates only for Edinburgh. That said, the percentage of pregnancies that is unintended is very high in the U.S. (and probably the highest in any Western industrialized society)." Our ruling Richards said the U.S. "has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country." She did not offer nor did we find a breakdown of unintended pregnancy rates for individual Western industrialized nations, evidently because none exist. This gap leaves us with the Guttmacher institute’s conclusion that in 2008, Canada and the U.S., combined, had more unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44 than every region except Asia (not including Japan), Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. None of these regions with higher rates are commonly considered developed and industrialized. We rate Richards’ claim, which lacked this clarification, as Mostly True.

pomt-01925	"In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-31-states-decent-child-care-cost/	President Barack Obama recently headlined a White House Summit on Working Families. During his address, he made a striking -- and for families with young kids, rather terrifying -- claim about how much child care costs. "In most parts of the country, it costs thousands of dollars a year," Obama said in the June 23, 2014, speech. "In fact, in 31 states, decent childcare costs more than in-state college tuition. In 31 states -- in more than half the states." Really? It costs more than college? We decided to take a look. We tracked down the source of the claim -- a 2013 report by Child Care Aware of America, which describes itself as the "nation’s leading voice for child care." After surveying child care providers in all 50 states, the report concludes that "in 2012, in 31 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college." Among the 50 states, the costs for infant care in center-based care ranged from $5,467 in Alabama to $16,430 in Massachusetts. Tuition and fees ranged from $4,278 in Wyoming to $14,576 in New Hampshire. That seems pretty close to what Obama said. (We’re not going to quibble over the definition of "decent" -- while it’s a subjective term, "decent" seems roughly equivalent to "average," which is how the study reported its figures.) Still, Obama’s claim oversimplifies the issue a bit. It’s worth noting some clarifying language in the report --"for an infant in center-based care" -- that is absent from Obama’s statement. This is actually the highest-cost example of the four cases the report looked at. If you look at the cost for a 4-year-old in center-based care -- rather than an infant -- it costs more than in-state college tuition and fees in 19 states. That’s 39 percent fewer states compared with statistics for infant care. (Generally, care for infants is more intensive, so costs tend to go down as children get older.) The report also looked at costs for home-based care, which is often a less expensive option for parents. For infants, the cost of home-based care is higher than college costs in 14 states. That’s a 55 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. And for 4-year-olds, the cost of home-based care is higher than college in 10 states. That’s a 68 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. So Obama chose the most dramatic number of the four presented by the report -- a bit of cherry-picking. Using infant care in centers "as a comparison for the costs of college could be considered cherry-picking," said Stephen Wood, a research analyst for Child Care Aware of America. But he added that her group's study put emphasis on that comparison because it involved "the most in-demand form of early childhood education (infants in centers) and the most in-demand form of post-secondary education (four-year public colleges)." It’s also worth noting that Obama’s claim doesn’t factor in tax credits and federal assistance for child care. For instance, according to the child care group’s study, "about 2.6 million children received federal subsidies through one of several funding sources including the Child Care and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant. Additional public funding that supports early care/education is allocated for programs such as child welfare initiatives and special education." In addition, the report says, "parents and businesses can take advantage of tax credits for supporting child care, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and Dependent Care Assistance Programs." All of these would reduce the cost of child care for many families. Of course, there are also tax credits and federal grants on the college side of the equation, and it’s possible the benefits for college are bigger than those for child care. Still, since we don’t know the impact of discounts either for child care or college costs, it adds another layer of uncertainty into Obama’s seemingly crisp summary. Our ruling Obama said, "In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition." He’s chosen a statistic that originated in a wide-ranging survey of child care costs (albeit one published by an advocacy group). However, Obama has cherry-picked the most dramatic statistic of four presented in the report, allowing him to say 31 states, rather than as few as 10. He also ignores uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits would affect the comparison. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

Republicans won a Florida congressional seat in part by hammering the Democratic candidate on the Affordable Care Act. The same themes are already playing out in Minnesota. Take a recent ad paid for by the American Action Network, a conservative group spearheaded by former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman. The ad is running in the 8th Congressional District, which is represented by democrat Rick Nolan. It centers on cuts to Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered by private companies approved by Medicare. Messages about the program are meant to resonate with elderly voters, who tend to show up on Election Day. “For the second year in a row, the Obama administration has proposed deep rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage seniors rely on.

pomt-07278	The Providence teacher contract "is one of the longest in the country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/24/angel-taveras/providence-mayor-taveras-says-citys-teacher-union-/	Bigger isn't necessarily better. Quality is sometimes better than quantity. Providence Mayor Angel Taveras alluded to that when the city's teachers' contract came up for discussion during the May 15 edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, which was taped May 12. Host Tim White was asking about problems in the School Department and the difficulty of getting rid of bad teachers, citing the case of one woman who was put on paid leave after being accused of drinking on the job and taking students home with her to do her housework. "From your perspective," White asked, "is the villain here an overly restrictive union contract that makes it hard to terminate teachers, or is it bad management that fails to cross the T’s and dot the I’s and get things done?" "I think it's both," the mayor said. "I think it's both in the sense that the contract is very restrictive. It's one of the longest in the country and needs to be changed. That's one thing. But the second thing about it is that we also need to follow through. And some of these things, in terms of following through, they're not easy. But they're necessary. … And that's not just in terminations, but overall." We were intrigued by his statement that the teachers' contract is "one of the longest in the country." We asked our usual question -- "Is that true?" -- but it also prompted us to ask, "Who would keep track of something like that?" So we contacted Taveras' office. Taveras spokesman David Ortiz said the mayor misspoke. He meant to say that it's one of the longest in Rhode Island, not the nation. Asked why the contract length matters, Ortiz said in a statement: "The contract is complex and contains many constraints on management." "For example, the contract has language that now creates the shortest teacher work year in the state, the shortest school instructional day permitted under state regulations, zero mandatory professional development hours built into baseline salary, a requirement that teachers be paid at $25 per hour for professional development, and 20 sick days that are allowed to accrue if unused," said Ortiz. "The mayor's position is that the constraints built into the current contract are a barrier to education reform." Ortiz sent us to the website of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, which has copies of contracts from 32 local school districts. He opened them in a Microsoft Word file and did a word count -- not a precise gauge, but close enough. We did the same and came to the same conclusion he did. Providence's teachers' contract is the second-longest in the database, at 31,888 words, or about 90 pages(depending on the formatting). Only the Central Falls contract is longer, at 33,014 words, or roughly 97 pages. To put that in context, the contracts in Warwick, Exeter-West Greenwich and West Warwick are in the 25,000- to 30,000-word range. New Shoreham and Little Compton have the shortest agreements -- both under 9,000 words or under 30 pages or so. But is it possible that Providence's is one of the longest nationwide? We found a PDF file of the latest contract covering the Los Angeles school system. It runs 349 pages -- nearly four times longer than Providence's 90 or so pages. Boston's is more than 250 pages. Robert Walsh, executive director of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, which does not represent Providence teachers, said the contracts in Worcester and Springfield are well over a hundred pages. Having a long contract "is an interesting but possibly meaningless distinction," said Walsh, because a contract may simply carry over a lot of provisions that are no longer relevant or may act like a personnel handbook. And a contract "that is longer and clearer may be easier to maintain than one that is short and pithy." But Timothy Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, had a different view. "The bigger the contract, the bigger the opportunity for a grievance to be filed," Duffy said. As both sides keep adding to an agreement, "there are probably provisions that conflict with one another" and there are probably more cases in which the school committee has given up some of its management rights to the union. In any event, it seems clear that Providence's teachers' contract is far from one of the longest in the nation, and Taveras' office was quick to say that the mayor misspoke. If he had said it was one of the longest in Rhode Island, we would give him a True. But his statement was far more sweeping than that, so we rule his statement False.

pomt-08046	"I represent the fourth-poorest (congressional) district" in the nation.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/03/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-her-district-fourth-poorest/	Poverty seems to be as much a part of Milwaukee as wind chills in winter. In 2009, the city’s poverty rate was fourth-highest among the nation’s big cities, according to census figures released in September 2010. But in an interview published Dec. 15, 2010, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a four-term Democrat who represents the city, told a Milwaukee weekly newspaper she represents the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country. Could that also be true? Moore made the comment in response to a question from the Shepherd Express about whether there was a rift between congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama: "I’m a congressional Democrat and I don’t have any rift with President Obama at all," Moore said. "I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I’m dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I’m looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district (in the nation)." While the Fourth Congressional District encompasses Milwaukee, it also covers a middle-class swath of Milwaukee County that includes West Allis and Cudahy. Is it really the fourth-poorest district in the nation? Moore spokesman, David Frey, gave us two replies when we asked for evidence to back up Moore’s statement. Initially, Frey said Moore based her comment on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the census figures released in September. They showed 27 percent of Milwaukee residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2009. The headline on that story called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city. However, the first two paragraphs of the article, and a chart that appeared with it, made it clear Milwaukee was the fourth-poorest among big cities -- those with populations above 250,000. Frey later said Moore misspoke in the Shepherd Express interview, and had meant to say she represents America’s fourth-poorest city, not its fourth-poorest congressional district. Frey said Moore has called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city a number of times. That explanation doesn’t quite stack up, either. As noted, the city ranked fourth among large cities, behind Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo. Among all cities covered by the census data -- the comparison Frey said Moore was making -- Milwaukee ranked 46th in poverty. As for the 2009 poverty rates among the nation’s 435 congressional districts, Moore’s Milwaukee-based district -- at 25.6 percent -- ranked 18th. The highest rate was 38 percent, in the New York City congressional district that includes the Bronx. That district is represented by Democrat Jose Serrano. It’s daunting to describe how devastating poverty is in Milwaukee; this item is not aimed at downplaying the city’s ranking. But exaggerating it doesn’t help, either. Milwaukee Ald. Michael Murphy recently claimed the income disparity between the city and suburban Mequon is the highest in the country; and former acting mayor Marvin Pratt, claimed that black male unemployment in Milwaukee is above 50 percent. We found both assertions False. Moore also overstates the case. Her spokesman said Moore meant to say Milwaukee is the nation’s fourth-poorest city, not that her district is the nation’s fourth-poorest congressional district. But even that ranking is correct only when considering the nation’s largest cities. We rate Moore’s statement False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2011-01-03T09:00:00	2010-12-15	['None']

pomt-00570	Since Republicans took over after the 2010 election, "the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/10/dale-kooyenga/dale-kooyenga-says-graduation-rates-have-risen-rep/	Ever since Act 10 passed in 2011, Democrats have argued Republican policies "gutted" public education in Wisconsin. After all, the measure included a cut of $792 million in state aid for schools. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) says the party’s actions have improved educational outcomes in the state. Kooyenga went on conservative radio host Vicki McKenna’s Madison show on May 22, 2015, broadcast on WIBA. He had this to say about education and the debate over the 2015-’17 budget. "If you look at what we've done -- Republicans in Wisconsin -- you know this whole education debate over the last four months, five months. It's all been about inputs, inputs, inputs. Money, money, money, money, money," Kooyenga said. "We should focus on outputs. And here's where we're at in education in Wisconsin. "Five years ago, when Republicans had taken over, the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent." Gov. Scott Walker made a similar claim in 2014 when he said: "graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office." When we checked that claim in April 2014, we rated it Mostly True. Both numbers had gone up some, though the trend pre-dated Walker. What’s more, the claim was pretty much a numbers one -- there was no direct claim by Walker that his policies made the difference. That’s where Kooyenga’s claim differs. Did the numbers Kooyenga cited all rise? And are GOP policies responsible? The numbers According to reports by the state Department of Public Instruction, graduation rates have continued to increase. Here is a look at what the numbers show: 2009-’10 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 Statewide 85.7% 87% 87.5% 88% Black 60.5% 63.8% 62.7% 64.8% Latino 69% 72% 74.3% 74.3% Kooyenga hit the mark on the statewide numbers and the number for black students, but was a little low on the increase for Latino students. He had noted a slightly lower increase in the graduation rate, from 65 percent to 71 percent. "The main premise remains the same," said Rachel Geary, a legislative assistant for Kooyenga. "The grad rate significantly increased closing the gap between minorities and the rest of the state." But what about the assertion that Republican policies are to thank? GOP credit A look at longer-term graduation trends -- and whether the rise predates the arrival of Republican control in Madison in 2011 -- is tricky. Just as Republicans took over, state officials switched the way graduation rates are measured from an old methodology that compared how many students graduated from a freshman class. Individual students, who may transfer in and out of a school, are not tracked, which can muddy the numbers. The new methodology uses a more accurate model that tracks individual students. The calculation was standardized across the country starting in the 2009-’10 school year, so new numbers cannot be directly compared to ones from the earlier system. When we looked back at the trend in graduation rates, the data showed the statewide graduation rate in Wisconsin has been on the rise -- about half a percentage point each year. When we asked Kooyenga for evidence of Republican's influence upon the rise in graduation rates, he acknowledged "many factors, including dozens outside of public policy, have an impact on these metrics." Experts say factors that influence how kids do in school include socioeconomic status, school type and location, and parental involvement. "However, Act 10 was the most significant change to education policy in this state and noticeable improvement in outcomes has been evident every year since enactment," Kooyenga said. "Superintendents have told us that Act 10 has freed up time and resources negotiating contracts, and instead allowed them to innovate and redeploy assets to better achieve their educational objectives." Act 10 reformed collective bargaining and lessened the power of unions for public employees. The bill also included a massive cut to state aid to schools. We rated a claim that the $792 million decrease in funding was the largest in state history True in February 2012. Walker and the GOP argue that districts have used the tools from Act 10 to offset the cuts, like eliminating or altering post-retirement benefits. The controversial budget bill went into effect in 2011, and it's tough to say when the effects of the bills really reached schools. When the bill passed, about two-thirds of schools had already negotiated teaching contracts for the upcoming year. Others have since taken advantage of the flexibility allowed by the law. What if you used 2012-’13 as a better baseline for a post-Act 10 comparison? Was there a significant difference in graduation rates? Not really. Between the 2011-’12 and 2012-’13 school years, statewide graduation rates went up half a percentage point. The percentage of black students who graduated went up by two percentage points. And the Latino rate went unchanged. The last cohort we have data for graduated at the end of the 2012-’13 school year. Likewise, there was a small increase between those years, following the trend. Our rating Kooyenga said graduation rates in the state increased thanks to actions by Republicans, including the passage of Act 10. The numbers did rise, but the trend existed before the GOP took over. What’s more, experts say many other factors are at work and the passage of Act 10 wasn’t followed by significant changes. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2015-06-10T14:26:02	2015-05-22	['Wisconsin', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06457	"We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-four-simultaneous-military-d/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Michele Bachmann noted what she suggested was a landmark moment in American foreign policy. "We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic." Currently, the U.S. has active military deployments of varying types in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and central Africa. The last mission -- which could involve boots on the ground in Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- was announced just days before the debate by President Barack Obama. According to the White House, this latest mission involves "approximately 100" combat-equipped U.S. forces to aid ongoing efforts by African nations to counter a long-running battle with the Lord's Resistance Army, a guerilla group infamous for killing families and forcibly conscripting the remaining children as soldiers. We wondered whether Bachmann was correct that four simultaneous U.S. deployments represented a significant landmark for the use of U.S. forces abroad. So we turned to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, "Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-2006." Because of the start and end date of the document’s data, we don’t have full information on deployments through 2011. But there are more than enough instances throughout recent U.S. history to demonstrate that four deployments is not a high-water mark. We found a few periods prior to 1990 in which the number of separate overseas deployments came close to reaching four -- including 1899, 1912, 1916 and 1919 -- but in each case we took a more cautious path because we couldn’t be 100 percent sure that the specific dates for those deployments overlapped. But beginning in 1993, we found that it was almost always the default that U.S. troops were actively deployed in at least four separate locations. We won’t overwhelm you with a torrent of dates and locations. Instead, we’ll list two periods -- the 1990s and the 2000s -- each with one list of nations where the U.S. had long-term deployments and another list of nations where the U.S. briefly committed troops, such as for a rescue of diplomatic personnel or American civilians. For the 2000s, we’ll also add a special category of nations for which the U.S. disclosed that it had dispatched troops for training and preparation for post-9/11 antiterrorism training and other operations. Long deployments, 1993-2000 Bosnia / Macedonia East Timor Former Yugoslavia / Kosovo Haiti Iraq no-fly zone Short deployments, 1993-2000 Afghanistan (airstrike only) Albania Burundi Central African Republic Kenya Liberia Sierra Leone Somalia Sudan (airstrike only) Tanzania Yemen Long deployments, 2001-06 Afghanistan Bosnia Former Yugoslavia / Kosovo Iraq War Short deployments, 2001-06 Cote D’Ivoire East Timor Haiti Lebanon Liberia Global War on Terror deployments, 2001-06 Djibouti Eritrea Ethiopia Georgia Kenya Phillipines Yemen According to our count, from 1993 to 2006, the number of simultaneous deployments dropped below four only for one year -- 1997. Otherwise, the U.S. was juggling at least four and sometimes eight or nine deployments at once. Not all of these previous deployments were equal in scope. Some lasted years and involved ground troops; some lasted just a few days; some were primarily based on air power. But that's also true today. Afghanistan and Iraq are years-long operations with ground forces, while Libya has been a NATO operation in which the U.S. did not have large numbers of troops on the ground. The mission against the Lord’s Resistance Army, meanwhile, looks like some of the smaller operations from the past two decades. To make sure we weren’t missing context, we asked military historians whether they thought our analysis was sound. The two who responded -- Ted Wilson, a history professor at the University of Kansas, and William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia -- agreed that Bachmann was wrong to suggest that four simultaneous deployments represented any kind of landmark. Our ruling A look through history suggests that, contrary to Bachmann’s claim, having four simultaneous military deployments is not only not a landmark, it’s actually become the norm for the U.S. since 1993.

pomt-00888	Every illegal immigrant "can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/09/john-fredericks/john-fredericks-says-every-illegal-immigrant-can-b/	John Fredericks, a conservative radio talk show host whose program airs across much of Virginia, has been incensed for months that President Barack Obama bypassed Congress to extend legal status to millions of immigrants. Adding to the outrage, Fredericks says, are recent disclosures that all of these immigrants can be eligible for big tax breaks. Here’s a comment Fredericks made on his Feb. 28 show: "Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in." Fredericks made the statement during an interview with U.S. Rep. Bob Hurt, R-5th. Hurt, no fan of Obama, replied, "It’s an absolute nightmare." On the same show, the radio personality repeated himself during an interview with U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. Griffith replied, "I’m fighting like crazy to stop this president and his bad policies that are detrimental to the United States of America." The so-called "amnesty bonuses" have become a talking point in conservative circles. We wondered whether Fredericks is right that, under Obama’s policies, every illegal immigrant could become eligible for up to $38,000 in tax credits -- even if they haven’t paid taxes. The tax credit Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they would qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is scheduled to open for applications this spring but faces a legal challenge from 26 states. Those who qualify for the program would also be able to get a Social Security number because a longstanding policy allows people who have been legally present in the U.S. to obtain the numbers. And with that Social Security number, they would be required to file tax returns and possibly qualify for the earned income tax credit that helps low-income workers. But there’s more. The reclassified immigrants also would be eligible to file or amend tax returns going back three years, provided they can meet income requirements and furnish pay documents. In other words, some will be able to claim four years of credits -- for their current tax filing and three years of back filings. The earned income tax credit slides with the amount of earnings families report and the number of children they have. It’s also adjusted each year for inflation. The maximum amount a family with three or more children can claim this year on their 2014 tax filings is $6,242. The top amount that could be claimed over the last four years, according to IRS documents is $24,320 -- well short of Fredericks’ claim. Of the 28.8 million families that applied for the tax credit on 2012 filings, only 3.5 million -- or 12 percent -- had three or more children, according to IRS figures. To qualify for the maximum credit, those families’ taxable income could have been no greater than about $23,000 a year. Only 1.3 million of those three-child or more families fell into that category, according to computations of IRS data by John Wancheck, who coordinates a program to publicize the earned income tax credit for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. In other words, only 6.4 percent of families applying for the tax credit in 2012 were eligible for the maximum benefit of about $6,000. The average credit was $2,407. So it’s likely, Wancheck said, that only a small percentage of reclassified immigrants would qualify for the maximum, three-child credit any given year, yet alone four years in a row. Wancheck said certain issues may deter immigrants from trying to recoup the credit from past years: Many may not have the tax records necessary to file back returns; others may be reluctant to go through the hassle for what might end up being a small reward. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen recently told Congress that his agency has not estimated the cost of extending the tax credit to reclassified immigrants. So how did Fredericks come up with the $36,000 to $38,000 credit that he said "everyone of these illegals...can be eligible for?" Fredericks sent us an email noting that in 2013, the maximum credit for three children or more was was $6,044. "So two single illegals living together filing separately with 6 or more kids in the household can claim 3 each and it’s 6,044 x 2 = $12,088 x 3 years = $36,264," he wrote. It’s possible that Fredericks’ hypothetical households exist, but odds are there aren’t many of them. As we’ve noted, 6.4 percent of the families that applied for credit in 2012 qualified for the maximum three-child benefit. That’s about one in 16 families that year. The chances that two such families would live together for three years -- sharing income and filing separate tax returns -- are much lower. Tax payments Fredericks, in his radio statement, also said that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for the maximum credit " without paying a dime in." This claim runs into trouble because those who will qualify for the credit would have been paying payroll taxes this year and in any past years they would seek to recoup. Although some illegal immigrants work in the underground economy and do not report their income to the government, others do. The IRS issues those workers an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and accepts their filings without reporting them to immigration authorities. That’s designed to encourage them to pay taxes. A 2011 study by the Department of Treasury estimated 3 million ITIN holders filed federal taxes that year, with 2.3 million getting refunds and 700,000 paying arrears. Stephen Goss, Social Security’s chief actuary, told the Associated Press in February that illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes during the last ten years, even though few will be able to collect benefits when they retire. A final note: As we said earlier, a coalition of 26 states -- not including Virginia -- has filed a suit challenging Obama’s action. It contends that Obama exceeded his presidential authority by granting temporary legal status to immigrants without getting approval from Congress. A U.S. District Court judge in Texas has blocked the immigration program until there is a trial on the suit. The White House has appealed the judge’s action. Our ruling Fredericks says, "Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in." He’s wrong for a number of reasons: The maximum credits any family could receive is $24,320 for the four most recent tax years. "Everyone of these illegals" is not eligible for the maximum credit. To qualify, a family must have at least three children and a taxable income of no more than about $23,000 a year. Only 6.4 percent of families that applied for the credit in 2012 fell into that category. To receive back payments, immigrants would have to produce earning documents from past years. You can’t get the credit "without paying a dime in." You’d have to pay payroll taxes. Fredericks offers a scenario in which two families living together with three children apiece could claim $36,000 in combined credits if they file taxes separately. But this hypothetical situation lies on the margins and doesn’t buttress Fredericks’ claim that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for up to the maximum credit. We rate Fredericks’ statement False.	None	John Fredericks	None	None	None	2015-03-09T01:00:00	2015-02-28	['None']

pomt-09609	Says Kay Bailey Hutchison voted for sanctuary cities.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/rick-perry/perry-says-hutchison-supports-sanctuary-cities/	When the candidates faced off on immigration in the GOP primary debate Thursday night, Gov. Rick Perry accused Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of supporting sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. "Senator," he said, "you voted for sanctuary cities." Hutchison said the charge was "absolutely wrong." Who's right? We decided to check the vote. Perry's campaign pointed us to the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Hutchison voted against an amendment by Sen. Tom Coburn, R.-Okla., to enforce existing border security and immigration laws before granting illegal immigrants amnesty. (The bill itself never passed the Senate.) From a press release Coburn issued, the amendment would have required enforcement of "existing border security and immigration laws before amnesty can be granted to illegal immigrants. These provisions of existing law include: control over maritime borders, full fencing required by law, integrated alien databases, US-VISIT program, biometric ID system, and ending 'sanctuary city' policies." A 1996 provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires states and localities to pass along someone's immigration and citizenship status on request from any government entity. Coburn's amendment tried to insure it would be enforced. From a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress: "Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy under which they don't require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report immigrants who may be illegally present in the country." The Senate rejected the amendment 54-42. Hutchison's campaign said she voted against it because it also prevented local input on the location of a border fence — a project widely opposed in the Rio Grande Valley. "I must protect my constituents," Hutchison said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. Border fence decisions belonged to the Border Patrol, "not the Congress, most of whom have never visited Laredo, Texas." The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which Hutchison voted for, extended reinforced fencing and other barriers, roads, cameras and sensors, along 700 miles of the southern border. Hutchison said that she agreed with with the "purpose" of Coburn's amendment but objected to what she said it would have allowed: government disregard for the opinion of private property owners and cities on the Rio Grande who would be affected by the fence. But by voting to kill the amendment, was she also voting in favor of sanctuary cities? We found no evidence that Coburn considered opposition to his amendment as support for sanctuary cities. Coburn's amendment would have reaffirmed established border and immigration policies. From all evidence, there’s no reasonable way to conclude that Hutchison’s vote against the amendment was a vote in favor of sanctuary cities. Perry's spinning the facts. We rule his claim False.

pomt-08456	Chris Coons has "Marxist beliefs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-claims-chris-coons-has-marxist-/	She's a witch? He's a bearded Marxist? Never a dull moment in the Delaware Senate race between Republican Christine O'Donnell and Democrat Chris Coons. For anyone who took the witchcraft thing seriously (based on comments O'Donnell made on Bill Maher's former show, "Politically Incorrect" in 1999), O'Donnell addressed that with one of the strangest opening lines of a campaign ad, ever: "I am not a witch." Coons meanwhile has been accused of being a "bearded Marxist," based on an article he wrote in college. He hasn't addressed that claim in an ad, but he has taken time to clarify that he is a "clean-shaven capitalist" in several national TV interviews. O'Donnell is apparently not buying it. She repeated the Marxist accusation in an Oct. 13, 2010, debate. "I would be remiss not to bring up the fact that my opponent has recently said that it was studying under a Marxist professor that made him become a Democrat," O'Donnell said. "So when you look at his position on things like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism -- I would argue that there are more people who support my Catholic faith than his Marxist beliefs, and I’m using his own words." The origin of the Marxism charge is an opinion piece Coons wrote for the Amherst College student newspaper during his senior year. The headline: "Chris Coons: The Making Of A Bearded Marxist." This is undoubtedly the kind of thing that makes an opposition researcher scream "Cha-ching!" But you don't have to read too far into the article to get that the "Bearded Marxist" line is hyperbole. The article, which ran in the Amherst Student on May 23, 1985, describes Coons' transformation from "somewhat of a Republican fanatic" -- who helped found the Amherst College Republicans in 1983 -- to an ardent Democrat, largely as a result of his experiences spending a semester in Kenya during his junior year. "I spent the spring of my junior year in Africa on the St. Lawrence Kenya Study Program," Coons wrote. "Going to Kenya was one of the few real decisions I have made; my friends, family, and professors all advised against it, but I went anyway. My friends now joke that something about Kenya, maybe the strange diet, or the tropical sun, changed my personality; Africa to them seems a catalytic converter that takes in clean-shaven, clear-thinking Americans and sends back bearded Marxists." For those who missed the "friends now joke" part, we note that the article is accompanied by a picture of Coons in a jacket and tie with the caption, "A clean-shaven Christopher Coons." Here's how Coons responded when asked about the article during the Oct. 13, 2010, debate: "I hope folks will go and read the article," Coons said. "It’s an article that I wrote as a senior the day of our commencement speech, and the title and the content of that clearly makes it obvious that it was a joke. There was a group of folks who I had shared a room with, my roommates junior year, who are in the Young Republican Club and who thought when I returned from Kenya and registered as a Democrat that doing so was proof that I had gone all the way over to the far left end, and so they jokingly called me a bearded Marxist. If you take five minutes and read the article, it's clear on the face of it, it was a joke. Despite that, my opponent and lots of folks in the right wing media have endlessly spun this. I am not now, nor have I ever been, anything but a clean-shaven capitalist." Said O'Donnell: "Well, I would stand to disagree because, first of all, if you're saying what I said on a comedy show is relevant to this election, then absolutely you writing an article, forget the bearded Marxist comment, you writing an article saying that you learned your beliefs from an articulate, intelligent Marxist professor and that's what made you become a Democrat, that should send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter because then if you compare that statement to your policies ... " "If it were accurate, if it were true, I’d agree." Coons shot back. "But it's not accurate. It's not true." In his 1985 article, Coons did praise a Marxist professor he had in Kenya, but he didn't say that what he learned from the professor is what made him become a Democrat. In fact, Coons said in the article that the seeds for change predated his semester in Kenya. "The point that others ignore is that I was ready to change," Coons wrote. "Experiences at Amherst my first two years made me skeptical and uncomfortable with Republicanism, enough so that I wanted to see the Third World for myself to get some perspective on my beliefs. Certainly Kenya provided a needed catalyst; I saw there poverty and oppression more naked than any in America, and I studied under a bright and eloquent Marxist professor at the University of Nairobi. Nevertheless, it is only too easy to return from Africa glad to be an American and smugly thankful for our wealth and freedom. Instead, Amherst had taught me to question, so in return I questioned Amherst, and America." He also credits several professors at Amherst with challenging his political perspective. "More importantly, during my sophomore year, several professors challenged the basic assumptions about America and world relations with which I had grown up. Cultural Anthropology inspired a fascination with other peoples and undermined the accepted value of progress and cultural superiority of the West. In examining the role of 'myths' in primitive cultures, we also studied the myth of equal opportunity in this country, a myth I had never questioned. "I came to suspect, through these and other courses, that the ideal of America as a 'beacon of freedom and justice, providing hope for the world' was not exactly based on reality." Coons wrote that he came to Kenya wondering, "Can private enterprise and democracy solve the problems of developing nations? Is Marxism an evil ideology, leading millions into totalitarian slavery? These were some of the questions in the back of my mind as I left for Kenya." "I realize that Kenya and America are very different, but experiences like this warned me that my own favorite beliefs in the miracles of free enterprise and the boundless opportunity to be had in America might be largely untrue." Coons' article concluded: "I have spent my senior year re-examining my ideas and have returned to loving America, but in the way of one who has realized its faults and failures and still believes in its promise. The greatest value of Amherst for me, then, has been the role it played in allowing me to question, and to think. I had to see the slums of Nairobi before the slums of New York meant anything at all, but without the experiences of Amherst, I never would have seen either." Nowhere in the article does Coons cop to being a Marxist. You can read it in its entirety here. Nor does his resume suggest Marxism. Coons worked as in-house counsel for his stepfather's fabrics company, W.L Gore & Associates, for eight years. In 2000, he was elected New Castle County Council president; and in 2004 was elected New Castle County executive. So what other evidence to back up O'Donnell's claim that Coons is a Marxist? We didn't hear back from the O'Donnell campaign, but during the debate, O'Donnell said we need look no further than some of Coons' positions, "like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism." We wrote yesterday about Coons proposing to raise property taxes by about 50 percent while acting as the New Castle County Executive. But does raising taxes make you a Marxist? By that measure, were Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush Marxists? O'Donnell has called for the elimination of estate taxes, and Coons has not. But again, does that make him a Marxist? Hardly. What the Communist Manifesto called for was abolishing the right of inheritance, not allowing inheritance and taxing it. Conservatives increasingly have been using labels like socialist and Marxist to attack Democrats. With Coons, the case is irresponsibly thin. Praising a Marxist professor from college as "bright and eloquent" does not make one a Marxist. And any clear-eyed reading of Coons' "The Making of a Bearded Marxist" article would make it obvious the "bearded Marxist" line was a joke playing off the jabs of some of Coons' conservative buddies at college. O'Donnell's claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Christine O'Donnell	None	None	None	2010-10-14T18:13:43	2010-10-13	['Chris_Coons']
pomt-00080	"Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/01/kendra-fershee/west-virginia-poverty-5-higher-us-whole/	Kendra Fershee, a Democrat who is challenging U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., took aim at the poverty rate in a Sept. 19 Facebook post. "Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average," Fershee wrote in the post. "The poor are getting (much) poorer and if you look at what my opponent is posting (stories about how great the economy is, using national statistics) he doesn’t even seem to know that there’s a problem in WV." She added, "Are you ok with our state diving deeper into despair while our elected officials: vote for policy that drives wages lower, push to strip healthcare from poor people and people with pre-existing conditions, and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done? I’m not. This is unacceptable. But WE can fix it on Nov. 6." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether poverty in West Virginia is more than 5 percent higher than the national average. So we took a closer look. The post links to a Sept. 18 article in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel headlined, "Poverty increases in W.Va." According to the article, "About 336,000 West Virginians lived in poverty in 2017, 5.7 percent higher than the national average. West Virginia was among the top four states with poverty rates of 18 percent – Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia." To confirm the newspaper’s data, we turned to the original figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers check out: The U.S poverty rate was 13.4 percent, but the West Virginia poverty rate was 19.1. The difference: 5.7 percentage points. To be precise, however, Fershee should have said that the poverty rate in West Virginia is more than 5 percentage points higher than the United States as a whole -- not 5 percent higher. If it were 5 percent higher, the poverty rate in West Virginia would be about 14.1 percent, not 19.1 percent. So the poverty rate in West Virginia is actually higher than Fershee’s literal words suggested. In an interview, Fershee said that it’s important to note that "the rest of the country is doing better, and West Virginia’s poverty rate has actually worsened," said Fershee. The historical data bears that out. Here’s a chart of the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates going back to 2005. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In 2012, the gap between the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates was 1.9 percentage points. Five years later, the gap was 5.7 points. Our ruling Fershee said, "Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average." Only a slip-up in her mathematical terminology keeps this from being fully accurate. The poverty rate in West Virginia was 5.7 percentage points higher than the national rate, not more than 5 percent higher. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11756	Half of the proposed federal tax breaks ​"would go to the wealthiest 1 percent."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/dec/05/roy-cooper/nc-governor-cherry-picks-stats-showing-tax-breaks-/	North Carolina’s U.S. senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, are among the most vocal proponents of GOP plans to change the federal tax code. The Tar Heel State’s top Democrat, meanwhile, is among the plans’ most high-profile detractors. Gov. Roy Cooper recently criticized House and Senate efforts to cut taxes, saying they overwhelmingly favor groups that need help the least – large corporations and millionaires. While Tillis recently pointed to North Carolina as a positive example for change, Cooper highlighted what he said were the negative consequences of the state tax code and said Congress’ efforts seem "eerily familiar" in his state. The tax reform efforts in NC and in Washington have divided local Republicans and Democrats. "Unfortunately, decisions made by the Republican state legislature have left too many middle class families out of our state’s economic growth," Cooper wrote in a Nov. 30 op-ed published on Medium.com. "Those decisions rigged the system to let those at the top reap most of the rewards." Congressional Republicans, he said, are charting the same course. "In total, it is estimated that half of the tax breaks in this proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent," Cooper wrote. "The Joint Committee on Taxation shows that, on average, taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would end up paying more in taxes." PolitiFact’s recent fact-check of Tillis shows that Cooper is partly right about taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 a year, but he left out the fact that most Americans would get a tax cut initially. Experts say that, by 2027, the Senate plan will leave them paying more in taxes, barring further changes in law. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. Unlike Tillis, Cooper didn’t single out one of the plans. Instead he spoke generally about how "this proposal" would affect the wealthiest Americans. The plan changes by year PolitiFact reached out to Cooper for clarification. Ford Porter, his spokesman, cited analyses of each plan by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center (let’s call it the TPC) found that the Senate plan gives 61.8 percent of the tax cuts to the top 1 percent "once the cuts are phased-in," Porter said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Their analysis of the House bill showed 47 percent (of the cuts) going to the top 1 percent," he added. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Porter is right. But key words to consider are "once the cuts are phased in." The report shows that estimates don’t bear out Cooper’s claim until 2027, because that’s when many of the deductions for lower-income Americans are phased-out. In 2019, the center says the top 1 percent would get 17.6 percent of the Senate plan’s total federal tax change, a share that would rise to 22 percent in 2025. Porter acknowledges that distinction in his email. But Cooper’s op-ed failed to elaborate on his claim, which isn’t true if examined in the years prior to 2027. Change, in dollars What does that look like in financial terms? The Tax Foundation is a conservative-leaning nonprofit organization that examines the link between tax policies and the economy. The foundation found that, under the Senate plan, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would initially keep 1.1 to 1.9 percent more of their income. America’s wealthiest – the one-percenters – would initially keep about 7.5 percent more of their money because of cuts to the corporate tax rate, as well as the income tax rate. By 2027, things change for the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers. The foundation estimates they’ll keep just 0.3 to 0.4 percent more. The top 1 percent, however, would keep 4.5 percent more compared to today’s rates. The TPC has a similar analysis. The center says that in 2019, the Senate plan would cut taxes by an average of $900 for taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $87,000 a year. The average tax cut for the top 1 percent would be $34,000. The House bill similarly phases-out deductions for lower-income Americans, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate for the TPC. In the House bill, for example, "there’s a $300 child and family credit that expires after five years at the end of 2022. That would be for a family of four, that would be a $1,200 tax credit," Rosenberg said. By 2027, the analysis says those middle-income taxpayers would get cuts of less than 0.1 percent while the average "one-percenters" would still enjoy taxes that are 1.4 percent lower than they are right now. Our ruling Cooper said half of the tax breaks in Senate Republicans’ proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. If key changes in the plan remain temporary, Cooper’s claim would come to fruition, but not for 10 years. Cooper’s op-ed doesn’t explain that change. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11589	"A single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-claim-about-chain-migrati/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address called for tighter control of legal immigration and for an end to "chain migration." "Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives," Trump said Jan. 30. "Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children." The White House did not respond on the record for this fact-check, but it appears that Trump meant a distant relative is anyone who is not a spouse or minor child (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services defines "child" as being unmarried and under 21 years old). Neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent to come to the United States. Theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. But there is a long queue for certain relatives seeking to come through family sponsorship. For brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, the waiting period for a visa is over 13 years. Type of relatives that can be sponsored by U.S. citizens and green card holders U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can bring certain family members to the United States to live here permanently. But there are restrictions. No one can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent, according to USCIS. Green card holders can petition for a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters 21 and over. Sponsorship categories expand for U.S. citizens, who can also petition for married children. Sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can include their own children in the petition. If a U.S. citizen is over 21 years old, he or she also can sponsor parents, brothers and sisters to come here on a green card. Additionally, U.S. citizens can also sponsor a fiance or fiancee to come on a nonimmigrant visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Unmarried, under 21-year-old children of a fiance, fiancee or spouse of a U.S. citizen can also be admitted on nonimmigrant visas and later adjust their status. Is there a way that an immigrant ‘can bring in’ an aunt or uncle, indirectly? If an immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she can sponsor a parent. If that parent eventually becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she could sponsor a brother or sister (the aunt or uncle of the original immigrant), noted Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration levels. "You could see that as indirect sponsorship of aunts and uncles," Camarota said. Indirect sponsorship is theoretically possible, but would take a long time, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. An immigrant would first have to become a naturalized citizen — an option available after being a permanent resident for at least five years. As a naturalized citizen, an immigrant can petition for siblings, and the siblings could bring in their spouses and unmarried children. But there are limits on the number of visas issued per year per family category. More than 3.9 million people were in line for a visa as of Nov. 1, 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a "fourth-preference" category, which had 2.3 million people waiting for a visa — the wait period is over 13 years for immigrants from most nations, but even longer for some countries with heavy demand, such as Mexico and the Philippines. Siblings in the Philippines would have to wait at least 23 years for a visa, and Mexican siblings at least 20 years. "As a practical matter, because of these long backlogs there is not as much chain migration as President Trump claims," said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Our ruling Trump said "a single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives." Trump’s team did not go on the record to identify who Trump considered to be "distant relatives," but it appears he’s referring to anyone who is not a spouse or minor child. Green card holders can sponsor a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters over 21 years old. For U.S. citizens, the categories expand to include parents, married children, brothers and sisters. No one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. But theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. Still, there are numerical limits on visas issued per year per family category. For some relatives, the wait period for a visa is over 13 years.

mpws-00038	Gov. Mark Dayton is touting a package of tax cuts he signed into law recently as evidence that his administration is out to help middle class Minnesotans. Democrats say the cuts were possible because the state has a surplus. Republicans say Democrats are trying to make themselves look good during an election year. “This session, the Governor signed into law $508 million in tax relief for middle class families and Minnesota businesses,” says a primer on Dayton’s tax cuts. “These new tax cuts benefit middle class Minnesotans, including seniors, farmers, teachers, working families, and small businesses.” It’s true that Dayton signed a bill that lowered taxes by about $508 million, but he also raised taxes by $2.1 Billion in the previous session. 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-daytons-tax-cut-claims-leave-out-context/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Dayton’s tax cut claims leave out context	April 18, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00228	"At (Mike Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/joe-donnelly/mike-braun-health-care-10000-deductibles/	Incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly painted himself as a guardian of health insurance and Republican opponent Mike Braun as its main threat during their first debate. "I was the final vote to save health care," Donnelly said of his opposition to the so-called skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "At (Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care if $10,000, which is completely unaffordable. He has every time tried to take away pre-existing conditions coverage and supports the lawsuit today that would do that." Braun did not respond to the attack in the debate, but in his rebuttal he said he "took on health care" and "held premiums for 10 years while covering pre-existing conditions." We rated Mostly True an earlier claim from Donnelly that Braun supported ending coverage for pre-existing conditions. But when it comes to his business, Meyer Distributing, does Braun charge $10,000 deductibles? Meyer Distributing is an auto parts distribution company. According to Braun’s campaign, the company had 452 employees in Indiana as of April. The majority make between $10 and $17 an hour. The employee benefits enrollment guide from 2018 confirms family deductibles are $10,000, and $5,000 for individuals. The health plan is valid from March 1, 2018, to Feb. 28, 2019. We were unable to find any other health plans offered, and the Braun campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Meyer offers a high-deductible health plan. That means that health care costs are absorbed by the employee until they reach that set limit (of $5,000 or $10,000). Doctor’s office visits, prescriptions and emergency room visits are not covered until then. Preventive care costs, on the other hand, are fully covered regardless of whether the deductible has been met. Those include annual preventive physicals and tests, routine prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. The individual deductible roughly doubles national averages, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation published on Oct. 3. The 2018 average for individuals was $2,349 and $4,676 for families. Meyer’s plan is still within the limits set by the Affordable Care Act, which caps out-of-pocket costs at $7,350 for an individual plan and $14,700 for a family. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that on average, employers that offer such plans contribute more than $1,000 to employees’ health savings accounts. We found no indication in the guide whether Meyer contributes or not. Premiums at Meyer, however, were lower than the national average. That’s the money employees pay for health care coverage with each paycheck, if enrolled. Workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for individuals, or $198.44 for the employee, spouse and children, which translates to $891.80 and $5,159.44 a year, respectively. The national average worker contribution to the premium is $1,074 for individuals and $4,631 for families. Braun said he has held premiums steady for 10 years. Individual premiums are lower at Meyer than the national average dating back to 2010. Average premiums have been increasing each year, so keeping premiums steady for 10 years would be unusual, according to Pollitz. "Firms have been moderating premium increases by shifting more costs to workers in the form of deductibles," Pollitz said. "That’s a good deal for the worker as long as they don’t get sick, hurt or pregnant." Our ruling Donnelly said, "At (Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000." The high-deductible health plan Braun offered full-time employees in 2018 had deductibles of $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-09811	If you "already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/health-insurance-through-work-stays-place-under-re/	Seeking to jump-start efforts to pass a health care bill, President Barack Obama defended his reform plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress. He sought to reassure Americans they would not lose their current coverage. "First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have," Obama said. "Let me repeat this: Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have." Obama is correct that the plans under consideration do not force those who currently have insurance to change plans. The proposals seek to build on the current system, where many Americans get coverage through work. The plans do, however, implement new consumer protections and introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies. These new rules will surely change the current health care system. The bill in the House of Representatives gives employer-provided insurance five years to come into compliance with new rules, such as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and coverage for preventive care. Right now, employers have the freedom to change or drop coverage, and they will continue to have that freedom under health reform. Doctors, too, can opt in or out of accepting various insurance plans, including Medicare. Because of this inherent instability to the health care system, and because of the new regulations, we rated one of Obama's earlier statements on the effects of reform — "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan" — Half True . Given what we know about reform, it seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when insurers alter their offerings under the new regulations. This would be most likely for any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed to use a national exchange where insurers compete to offer insurance, and prices are expected to be lower. Obama's statement from the speech is more carefully phrased than his earlier statement. In his speech, he said that if you are "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." That is true, there is nothing in the plan that proactively forces these kinds of changes, and the bills clearly intend to leave much of the current health care system in place. We rate Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-09T19:30:35	2009-09-09	['Medicare_(United_States)']

pomt-13843	California’s Proposition 63 would "CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/jul/12/firearms-policy-coalition/will-ca-gun-control-measure-criminalize-sharing-bu/	Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on California’s November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to California’s already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but "criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners." The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales "be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor," according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or "transferring" ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with "any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know" is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. "They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person," Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed California’s Proposition 63 would "Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together." The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalition’s statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would "criminalize" all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know they’re not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06994	Says legislative debate of airport pat-down procedures initiated federal changes in security procedures.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-debate-pat-down-legislation-/	Gov. Rick Perry saw a silver lining in state lawmakers not sending him legislation penalizing airport security officers if they get too physical while searching passengers. As a June special legislative session ended, Perry said in a June 29 press release that "although the airport pat-down bill did not pass, it did initiate a public discussion and some changes in airport security procedures." Did debate at the Texas Capitol drive a national shift? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us toward an earlier Perry statement that referred to a Transportation Security Administration reassessment of pat-down searches of children 12 and younger. The June 23 statement by the governor’s office said the agency’s change of policy "follows Gov. Perry's recent addition of legislation to the (agenda) of the special session of the Texas Legislature to address this issue." Perry added: "TSA's policy change is a step in the right direction to regain the trust of American families." According to an ABC News report, the federal agency had issued a statement the day before, June 22, saying that its chief administrator, John Pistole, "has made a policy decision to give security officers more options for resolving screening anomalies with young children, and we are working to operationalize his decision in airports. This decision will ultimately reduce — though not eliminate — pat downs of children." The news report notes that Perry had recently added the airport security issue to the special session’s agenda; that action occurred June 20. During the regular session that ended in May, legislation making it a criminal offense for airport security officials to touch "the anus, sexual organ, buttocks or breast of another person," even through clothing, had cleared the Texas House before stalling in the Senate. And a June 27 Associated Press news report quotes state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, defending a watered-down version of the pat-down measure under consideration in the special session. Referring to the already-announced federal policy change, Patrick said, "The goal is to get the TSA to change their policy. TSA is going (to) change their policy because Texas is taking the lead." But we couldn’t find independent indications that the Texas debate touched off the federal change. Instead, we found that public outrage began flaring late last fall over the new enhanced pat-down procedures and that TSA officials have been talking about changing the procedures ever since. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said that Pistole "began evaluating risk-based changes to the checkpoint security process, including the process for screening children, shortly after he was sworn into office in July" 2010. Kimball pointed us to a Nov. 21, 2010, statement from Pistole saying, in part, "We are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures, and as we have said from the beginning, we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security." Kimball also noted a March speech by Pistole to an American Bar Association group. Pistole said then: "We want to focus our limited resources on higher-risk passengers, while speeding and enhancing the passenger experience at the airport. I believe what we're working on will provide better security by more effectively deploying our resources, while also improving passengers' travel experiences by potentially streamlining the screening experience for many people." Kimball also pointed out news reports such as an April 12 CNN report topped by mention of the recent pat-down of a 6-year-old girl at the New Orleans airport. The report quotes the agency as saying that Pistole "has tasked the agency with exploring additional ways to focus its resources and move beyond a one-size-fits-all system while maintaining a high level of security. As part of this effort, TSA has been actively reviewing its screening policies and procedures to streamline and improve the screening experience for low-risk populations, such as younger passengers." We pressed Kimball about connections between the pat-down debate in Texas and the agency’s June change of policy. He replied by email that the Legislature's debate "did not have an impact." Perry’s office isn’t convinced. Frazier said by email that the "fact remains that TSA took action a mere two days after the governor's addition (of the anti-groping topic) to the agenda of the special session." She continued: "We've never claimed the addition to the (agenda) was the sole catalyst of TSA’s changes. But as we’ve said before, we do believe that making it a legislative issue in the midst of Americans’ escalating frustration toward TSA’s invasive pat-down searches played a role in the agency’s decision to finally take action, and make changes to its policy that are a step in the right direction." It’s reasonable to say the debate in Austin brought even more attention to pat-downs. But the TSA was already catching flack for the procedures two months before the Legislature convened. And we found no evidence the Texas debate initiated, as Perry puts it, the administration’s policy change. We rate Perry’s statement False.

pomt-05673	"In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/16/texas-democratic-party/texas-democratic-party-says-texas-has-668-latino-e/	Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile. As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas. "Politics is in my blood," the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee. But Rebecca Acuña, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC’s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acuña told the Tribune: "They are delusional if they think they’re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party." Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas? Looked entirely like it -- at first. To our inquiry, Acuña sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials. The chart provided by Acuña says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents. According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as "no party stated." And how does NALEO gather all this? A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says. "The phone verification process proved invaluable," the methodology section says. "Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino." Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. "We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino," Gold said. By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011. At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011. The group’s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation. Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder’s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn’t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership. We asked Gold if it’s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group’s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. "We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown," she said. Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group. With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn’t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011. Our ruling The Texas Democratic Party’s spokeswoman correctly cited two figures from the 2011 NALEO directory suggesting that Latino elected Democrats in Texas greatly outnumber their Republican counterparts. Still, this claim is missing substantive context -- that NALEO did not determine the party memberships of most Latino Texas officeholders. If this were done, the Democratic-Republican ratio might change. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12704	Carbon dioxide is not "a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/10/scott-pruitt/epa-head-scott-pruitt-says-carbon-dioxide-not-prim/	The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming. "Do you believe that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?" CNBC anchor Joe Kernen asked Pruitt in a March 9 interview. "No, I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact," Pruitt responded. "So no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." Scientists around the globe generally conclude that human activity is the leading cause of climate change because humans have exacerbated the Earth’s greenhouse effect, mainly by producing carbon dioxide. Compare Pruitt’s statement with one on his agency’s website, for example: "It is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming," and then, "Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change." Environmental activists opposed Pruitt’s nomination, in part because in his former role as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times over air and water pollution regulations. However, Pruitt has said he believes in climate change and that human activity is contributing to that change, though he is unconvinced of the extent of human-caused factors. "The climate is changing, and human activity impacts that," he said in his Senate confirmation hearing. When we reached the EPA for comment, they did not provide us with information to back up Pruitt’s claim. The normal environment of the earth is that several types of gas stick in the atmosphere and trap excess heat, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide, making a natural "greenhouse." Since the Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s, humans have changed the composition of the greenhouse — leading to climate change — by releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the air primarily through burning fossil fuels. "Pruitt is incorrect. CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. That fact is not in dispute among climate scientists," said Anne Slinn, executive director for research of the Center for Global Change Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that even though the earth has experienced fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels throughout its history, there’s more carbon dioxide now than there has been in at least 400,000 years. The previous peak carbon dioxide concentration was about 300 parts per million, 300,000 years ago. Today, the count is more than 400 parts per million. By the end of the 1970s, before global warming was readily apparent, scientists had already formed a consensus that human-produced carbon dioxide would cause the climate to change. And by the mid-1990s, scientists understood that global warming had already occurred over the past 100 years, and carbon dioxide was a substantial cause, said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Center at the University of California, San Diego. "Administrator Pruitt’s statement means that he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus," said Stephen Pacala, co-director of Princeton University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, pointing to a 2013 report out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We reached numerous climate experts, all of whom reiterated the view that Pruitt’s claim is contrary to the prevailing scientific thought. For a perspective outside the norm, we also reached out to Roger Pielke Sr., an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who has argued that carbon dioxide is one of many human-caused factors contributing to long-term changes in the climate, but it’s not the dominant one. For example, the release of black carbon (soot) or land use changes might have a larger effect on the climate relative to carbon dioxide than is currently believed. In Pielke’s view, a more accurate version of Pruitt’s statement would be: "I would not agree that CO2 is the only contributor to changes and longterm variations in climate." Our ruling Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not "a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." The prevailing scientific consensus is that human production of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution is a leading cause of climate change. Some scientists may quibble over how much of the change can be attributed specifically to carbon dioxide, but there is no doubt that it plays an important role. We rate Pruitt’s claim False.

pomt-08319	"North Dakota's economy is reeling."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/29/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-north-dakotas-economy-reeling-/	The pro-Republican group Crossroads GPS recently began airing ads in at least eight House districts, all using virtually identical language to decry the state of the economy and the Democratic agenda in Congress. Here's the ad for North Dakota, which blasts the stewardship of incumbent Democratic Rep. Earl Pomeroy. Pomeroy faces a stiff challenge this year from Republican Rick Berg. "North Dakota's economy is reeling, and Congressman Earl Pomeroy is making it worse," says the ad, which was released Oct. 25, 2010. "While he should be helping us, he's supporting Nancy Pelosi and her failed agenda, voting for billions in new debt and reckless spending, including Pelosi's $800 billion stimulus boondoggle, filled with sweetheart deals and handouts to special interests. Reckless spending, massive debt, helping Pelosi, not us. Earl Pomeroy, wrong for North Dakota." We were tipped off that something was amiss when Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress, published an article on Oct. 28, 2010, that noted that the Pomeroy camp was challenging the description of North Dakota's economy as "reeling." With barely disguised glee, a Pomeroy spokesman, Brenden Timpe, fired a barb at Karl Rove, who helped organize Crossroads GPS and its affiliate, American Crossroads. "Next time Karl Rove wants to funnel secret money to North Dakota to influence our elections, he ought to visit our state first or at least pick up one of our newspapers," Timpe said. "If he did, he would know that North Dakota’s economy is doing quite well, thank you very much, and Earl has been a strong partner in that progress." How well is North Dakota doing as the rest of the country muddles through a rough patch for the economy? On a relative basis at least, quite well indeed, thanks to a surge in natural resource extraction and relatively little decline in a housing market that never really boomed. Here are some statistical benchmarks we located. -- Unemployment. Today, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 3.7 percent. That's just over one-third -- yes, that's one-third -- of the national unemployment rate of 9.6 percent. And this low unemployment rate is nothing new. North Dakota's annual unemployment rate for 2009 also ranked as the best in the nation at 4.3 percent, compared to a 9.3 percent rate nationally. In 2008, North Dakota ranked second (3.2 percent, compared to 5.8 percent nationally). In 2007, it ranked eighth (3.1 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally). And in 2006, it ranked seventh (3.2 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally). -- Personal income. Total personal income in North Dakota rose 23 percent between 2006 and 2009, compared to 8 percent nationally. It rose by 12 percent in North Dakota between 2007 and 2009, compared to 2 percent nationally. And it fell by 1 percent between 2008 and 2009, compared to a national decline of 2 percent. So personal income in North Dakota did fall between 2008 and 2009, but it fell more slowly than the national rate, and it followed on two years of personal income growth, far ahead of the national rate. The story is much the same for per capita personal income. It rose by 21 percent between 2006 and 2009 and by 10 percent between 2007 and 2009 before falling by 2 percent between 2008 and 2009. -- Gross domestic product. GDP information by state is not available for 2009, so the full impact of the recession is not yet measurable. But the data that's available shows that the state enjoyed a nice boom between 2006 and 2008. State GDP rose by 12 percent between 2006 and 2007, compared to 1.9 percent nationally. And it rose by 9 percent between 2007 and 2008, compared to zero increase nationally. So on this score, North Dakota did well indeed. When we asked Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, if the group had any defense for its characterization, he said, "Unemployment is up significantly in the last two years in North Dakota, and much of that is due to the massive debt created by (President Barack) Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Earl Pomeroy." But let's put it into context: The unemployment rate in North Dakota rose from 3.4 percent two years ago, in September 2008, to 3.7 percent in September 2010. The number of unemployed North Dakotans has risen from 12,365 to 13,714 -- a total of 1,349 people, or less than 1 percent of the civilian, non-institutionalized population in the state. We think most Americans would be happier with that kind of economy than the one in their own state. Judging by the ads on Crossroads GPS' website, we think the Pomeroy camp's charge that the ad is "cookie cutter" is accurate. At the very least, Crossroads was careless in the degree to which it adapted its ads to each state's specific context. In these sorts of economic times, it verges on the ridiculous to say that North Dakota's economy is "reeling." We rate the ad Pants on Fire!

pomt-14140	Says he "started" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/04/ron-johnson/incomplete-claim-sen-ron-johnson-started-pacur-his/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is trailing but gaining on Democratic challenger Russ Feingold in the latest poll, announced April 29, 2016 he is launching a tour of Wisconsin as part of his re-election campaign. A routine notice. Until this line in his news release: "Ron’s statewide tour will include stops at Pacur, the Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company he started in 1979." The statement suggests the company was started only by Johnson, or at least that he was main person who launched it. But that seems to contradict the established history of Pacur (pronounced liked packer), and is in conflict with some of Johnson’s own statements. It’s long been widely reported that Johnson was there at the beginning of Pacur. But with analysts saying he is among the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in the November 2016 elections, did Johnson’s campaign overstate his role in starting the company? After all, the name Pacur comes from Pat Curler -- Johnson’s brother-in-law. Rewriting history Questions first arose when Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice reported that Johnson had rewritten his own company history on Aug. 25, 2010. That was less than three weeks before the GOP primary and about 10 weeks before Johnson upset Feingold, an 18-year incumbent, in the 2010 Senate election. For nearly nine years, Bice wrote, Pacur carried this online description of its beginning: Founded in 1977, Pacur occupies a facility constructed specifically for sheet extrusion, which provides polyester and polypropylene sheet and rollstock to converters, distributors, and end users. The revised description, now carrying an asterisk, said the founding occurred two years later, in 1979. The asterisk pointed out that Pacur had a predecessor -- Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies -- that came into existence in 1977 before it was renamed and restructured in 1979. In other words, Pacur grew out of an existing company, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies. That company was owned by Curler, the brother of Johnson’s wife. Johnson’s statements Johnson’s own statements haven't always been as credit-taking as the line in the news release. Some examples from the 2010 campaign: The Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson said he began working as Pacur's accountant and co-founder in July or August of 1979. The article stated that both companies were led by Curler, and that Curler was Johnson's initial boss. Pacur "was an opportunity for (Curler) to get into business for himself, and I just kind of came along for the ride as the accountant," Johnson said in another Journal Sentinel article. Johnson had been calling himself a co-founder of the company, but later acknowledged he joined several months after Pacur was established, the Associated Press reported. He started as a machine operator and accountant and eventually became its president, the article said. More recent statements also reinforce the idea that Johnson, who bought Pacur in 1997, didn't start the company alone. Johnson’s official Senate website says he started the company with Curler. So did a tweet Johnson sent in in March 2016. Defending the statement in the press release, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us Johnson "helped build Pacur into a great Wisconsin success story, and we've never said anything counter to how it all began." Our rating Announcing a statewide tour in his campaign for reelection, a Johnson news release said Johnson "started" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns. The claim contradicts Pacur’s own company history and Johnson’s prior statements, which make it clear he helped start Pacur with his brother-in-law, who was more involved in the founding. Johnson didn't do it alone. The news release doesn’t indicate an attempt by Johnson to rewrite history, but he is responsible for his campaign statements, and this one left out important details.

pomt-14339	"Virginia now is the number one exporter of (agricultural) products to Cuba. We have now jumped to number one."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/24/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-right-va-sends-most-agricultural-product/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe sees Cuba as a land of opportunity. Amid President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba this past week, McAuliffe said in an interview that Virginia already has made impressive headway in tapping the island nation’s export market. "Virginia now is the number one exporter of ag (agricultural) products to Cuba," McAuliffe said during a March 21 MSNBC interview. "We have now jumped to number one." In January, the governor returned from a trip to Cuba aimed at bolstering the commonwealth’s commercial ties with the nation. The U.S. still has a decades-long embargo on most trade with Cuba. But a 2000 law allows limited exports of agricultural products and medical equipment. In 2014, Obama re-established formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. McAuliffe supports ending the trade embargo. Brian Coy, the governor’s spokesman, pointed us to a Feb. 12 news release where McAuliffe announced that last year Virginia exported $41.6 million in agricultural goods to Cuba, all of it soybeans and soybean meal. In past years, Virginia also has shipped apples, poultry and beef. McAuliffe said the 2015 export tally was the most that any state had sent to Cuba that year. We tracked down the same trade figures through an online database provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It shows that in 2015, Virginia’s $41.6 million indeed was the most of any state, followed by Georgia, which had $30.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba; and Florida, which had $29.9 million in exports. Rounding out the top five agricultural exporters to Cuba were Alabama and Louisiana. Altogether, the U.S. exported nearly $150 million in agricultural goods to Cuba last year. A 2015 article from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond noted Virginia’s farm exports accounted for 28 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports last year, compared with the 21 percent share for Georgia and 20 percent share for Florida. Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Louisiana generally have dominated the share of U.S. exports to Cuba since 2011. McAuliffe is correct that the 2015 figures are a turnabout of sorts for Virginia. In 2012, the state had $65.6 million in agricultural exports to Cuba, and that fell to $24.9 million in 2014, ranking it fifth behind those other four Southern states. Last year was the first time Virginia reached the goal of becoming the top agricultural exporter to Cuba, said Todd Haymore, the state’s secretary of agriculture and forestry. Haymore told us Virginia and other Southern states’ proximity to Cuba provides an advantage in tapping the Cuban market. Other factors helped, he said. For example, Georgia has focused on expanding an agricultural export facility in Savannah, Haymore said. Florida, meanwhile, has extensive port operations, the secretary said. Haymore said a "significant" share of Virginia’s agricultural exports to Cuba were produced in the commonwealth, although he added that Virginia’s ports also ship products that originate from other states, including Maryland and North Carolina. This year, it looks like Virginia has some serious competition if it wants to retain its billing as the top agricultural exporter to Cuba. Figures from January, the only month for which export figures are available so far this year, show that Louisiana sent $17.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba that month, and Alabama sent $2.1 million. Virginia’s $1.7 million ranked third. While Virginia has seen its exports to Cuba go up and down and then back up in recent years, it’s been a different story for U.S. trade to the island nation. The total value of all U.S. exports to Cuba actually has been waning, even amid White House overtures to open trade. U.S. exports to Cuba dropped from $464.5 million in 2012 to $180.3 million last year, according to figures from the U.S. Commerce Department. Our ruling McAuliffe said Virginia is the top exporter of agricultural products to Cuba. The numbers from the latest year available back his claim. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12607	"I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/03/jon-ossoff/jon-ossoff-national-security-background/	In Georgia’s closely watched congressional special election, the surprisingly strong Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, has touted his policy experience in national security -- and taken heat for allegedly embellishing it. Ossoff is running to succeed Republican Tom Price in the U.S. House, after Price’s confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. Historically, Price’s affluent, suburban Atlanta district has been solidly Republican. However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election. Polls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations. The question of Ossoff’s national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. "A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector," the release reads. Ossoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast. However, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience. We decided to take a closer look. The timeline After the criticism emerged, Ossoff’s campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is: • January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009. • January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant. • April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign. • September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office. • March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act. • Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office. This timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years. Why this raises legitimate questions However, it’s important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff’s first two years on Johnson’s staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn’t received his undergraduate degree yet. Moreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here’s how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: "Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed." In other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker’s constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary. In 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service. And what do staff assistants do? According to the Congressional Management Foundation, a staff assistant "handles word processing, filing, faxing; responds to general constituent requests; processes tour and flag requests; staffs the front reception area, greets visitors and answers telephones." In other words, a typical legislative correspondent is getting just $1,300 a year more than the (usually equally junior) staffer manning the reception desk. Why Ossoff’s situation may have been different Ossoff’s former supervisors, however, maintain that Ossoff had substantially more responsibility than a typical legislative correspondent. Daraka Satcher, Johnson’s chief of staff from 2007 to 2009, told PolitiFact that the congressman was newly elected to the House and "was focused more on domestic issues than national security." Meanwhile, Satcher and Johnson recognized that Ossoff, with his foreign-service school background, was precocious. "Putting just any college student in that situation would be malpractice, but honestly, Jon was not a typical college student," Satcher said. "He handled the issues, so we felt very comfortable" with the unusual arrangement. Satcher said that he himself had some experience on national security issues from his previous work on Capitol Hill, so he was able to backstop Ossoff when needed. Johnson, the congressman, backed up Satcher’s description. "I had no military assets in my district and was not a military guy," Johnson told PolitiFact, "Jon’s level of information on the issue was much deeper than mine at that time. While he was a legislative correspondent, he was learning how to be a legislative assistant." Johnson’s office added that Ossoff played a key role in the House’s June 18, 2007, passage of H.Con.Res.80, a non-binding resolution about the civil war in northern Uganda. That occurred just a few months after Ossoff joined the office. Johnson said that Ossoff also handled some more mundane duties in the office, such as some information technology assignments. Still, he added, "to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that’s entirely, 100 percent correct." Is this version of events credible? Of course, in addition to being Democrats, both Johnson and Satcher have an incentive to see their former staffer win a seat in Congress. So we tried to determine independently whether the scenario they describe is plausible. We reached out to half a dozen staffers who we determined had worked for House co-sponsors of the Uganda resolution, but we did not hear back from anyone who was able to comment either way. We did, however, run everything we had learned past the staff at LegiStorm, a company founded by Jock Friedly, a former investigative and congressional reporter. The company, which is nonpartisan, collects and analyzes data about Congress. They are perhaps best known for collecting publicly available salary information about Capitol Hill staffers. Friedly and a researcher on his staff, Keturah Hetrick, pored over the available information for PolitiFact and concluded that there was nothing to contradict Ossoff’s version of events. They said that "it’s not a stretch" for Ossoff to have handled substantive foreign-policy issues despite his low-level position. "Legislative correspondents are rarely going to be the primary staffer handling a given legislative issue, but they will also handle some policy work," Hetrick said. What Johnson and Satcher said "sounds totally plausible," she said. At the same time, she added, official documentation is silent on whether Ossoff was officially Johnson’s primary foreign affairs staffer between 2007 and 2009. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said Ossoff’s statement amounts to "resume inflation," though, in his opinion, a "rather benign" example. "Legislative correspondent is a junior staff position, but it at least requires that the staffer know enough about his boss's policy positions that he can write letters, both to constituents and executive agencies, that are accurate and in some cases nuanced," he said. A better phrasing, Ornstein said, would have been that he spent "five years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress, including work on national security." Our ruling Ossoff said, "I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress." This description certainly applies to his final three years on Capitol Hill, which were spent in middle- to senior-level foreign policy posts. Whether it applies to his first two years working for the lawmaker is less clear cut. His former supervisors insist that due to unusual circumstances within the office, Ossoff handled foreign-policy duties above his pay grade during that time. An independent expert told us that the explanation is plausible. That said, Ossoff at the time was an undergraduate student holding a part-time position that, in the Capitol Hill pecking order, was entry-level. That adds relevant context, and he left it out.

pomt-12019	Vermont had to "scrap" its single-payer health insurance program because it was "going bankrupt."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/20/sean-duffy/vermont-single-payer-was-scrapped-because-it-was-g/	Perturbed by technical difficulties during his Facebook Live town hall on Sept. 14, 2017, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy blamed "bad government wi-fi." But for the most part the video stream allowed the Wisconsin Republican to answer viewers’ questions. One asked his opinion of a national single-payer health care plan introduced the previous day by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. The proposal is prominently supported by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. Duffy panned it, saying: The single-payer program was tried in Vermont, where Bernie Sanders is from. They had to scrap it, it was way too much money, they were going bankrupt. It turns out Vermont was the first state to adopt single-payer legislation. But the program wasn’t going bankrupt when it was abandoned. It couldn’t. It had never been implemented at all. What single-payer is, what is its appeal Generally speaking under single-payer, everyone, or at least most people, would get health coverage from the federal government (the single payer) and it would pay all the bills. Details can vary, of course. For example, Sanders’ national proposal would eliminate nearly all private insurance. Single-payer hasn’t necessarily enjoyed widespread support. In 2014, during an interview on Milwaukee radio, four-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader said most Americans "since Harry Truman days" have supported single-payer health insurance. Our rating was False. There were individual poll results dating back to 1945 indicating majority support, but overall the results were mixed, at best. One issue is cost. As PolitiFact National reported, Sanders has pegged the cost of his national single-payer plan -- "no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies" -- at $1.38 trillion per year. Other estimates are as much as double that amount. But all of that involves single-payer at the national level. Getting back to Duffy, what happened in Sanders’ home state? The Vermont experience Vermont adopted single-payer legislation in 2011. It required then-Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, to submit a detailed financial plan by 2013. But the plan was abandoned in 2014 without ever being implemented, or even funded. Even the two news articles Duffy’s office cited to back up his statement make that clear. 1. The introduction to a National Public Radio piece that aired the day before Duffy’s statement explains it was about "why Vermont was unable to establish a single-payer health care system." Linda Blumberg, an Urban Institute health insurance and health reform expert, told NPR that leaders in Vermont determined the taxes needed "would not be politically palatable." 2. A December 2014 Politico article said that when Shumlin, who was first elected in 2010 after running on single-payer, pulled the plug he "admitted what critics had said all along: He couldn’t pay for it." We found similar reports. The Daily Beast said Shumlin dropped single-payer after an estimate said it would cost $4.3 billion a year, almost the size of the state’s entire $4.9 billion budget. The Washington Post reported that Shumlin said he could not "responsibly support" an 11.5 percent payroll tax hike on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent that his administration said would be required. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard University practice of public health professor John McDonough pointed out that the decision to drop single-payer was as much about politics as finances. While studies showed the taxes would have been high, they also showed that the plan was economically viable (as the Cornell Policy Review also noted). But when Shumlin barely was re-elected in 2014, as McDonough put it, "a clear public mandate for his health care agenda was nowhere in evidence." So, it’s clear that cost was cited as the reason Vermont did not implement single-payer, even though it was predicted that the tax revenue would have made the program viable. That’s not the same as single-payer being in place and then dumped because it was heading for bankruptcy. In fact, no one knows how single-payer in Vermont would have performed had it been put in place. Our rating Duffy said Vermont had to "scrap" its single-payer health insurance program because it was "going bankrupt." Vermont adopted legislation for single-payer in 2011. But by 2014, Vermont’s governor abandoned the plan, saying the tax increases it needed would have been too high. In short, single-payer in Vermont didn’t go bankrupt; it was never even funded or implemented. We rate Duffy’s statement False.

pomt-02471	Says Alaska Sen. Mark Begich supported President Barack Obama’s economic policies "97 percent of the time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/21/dan-sullivan/begich-supports-97-percent-obamas-economic-policy-/	U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat, brands himself as being "as independent as Alaska." Unsurprisingly, Republicans in the primary field for the 2014 midterm election versus Begich beg to differ. One such candidate, former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, argued in a campaign email that Begich’s votes are in line with President Barack Obama’s positions on economic issues. "Instead of standing up to President Obama’s reckless economic policies, Mark Begich has supported them 97 percent of the time," the email read. "By rubber-stamping overspending and over-regulation, Begich and Obama are stifling our nation’s economic growth and standing in the way of job creation." Begich, Alaska’s junior senator, faces re-election for the first time in November. The leading Republican challengers are Sullivan and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Sullivan briefly served as attorney general. Since November 2010, he’s been commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. This is his first run for public office. PolitiFact wanted to know if Begich and Obama really agree on economic issues 97 percent of the time. Let’s crunch some numbers Sullivan’s campaign office pointed us toward CQ Weekly’s presidential position votes report. That’s from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. That analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes where Obama "took a clear position," Begich’s vote matched the president’s stance 97 percent of the time. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes, or about 37 percent. We found the same trends across CQ reports since Begich took office in 2009. CQ put him voting with Obama over 90 percent of the time for each year served. This data looked at all votes, not just votes on economic policy. Also, all Democrats received 90 percent and higher ratings in the 2014 report. That shows that, in general, Democratic senators tend to vote with their president. CQ’s Roll Call, on the other hand, offered a different picture of Begich’s reputation in a profile of the race: "Since entering the Senate, Begich, a former Anchorage mayor, has struck an independent pitch and continues to highlight his focus on Alaska issues, even when they swim upstream from the administration’s priorities." That independence was reflected in a different congressional rating we looked at from OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service that tracks how often each senator votes with the majority of his or her caucus. OpenCongress then ranks the results within each party, giving a more detailed take on where individual senators fall on an ideological spectrum. In 2013, for example, OpenCongress said Begich voted with the majority of Democrats 87.1 percent of the time. That’s based on all 291 Senate votes. OpenCongress ranked Begich at 45th for 2013 when it comes to voting with his party. That shows that Begich is among the most independent senators currently serving. Both the CQ and OpenCongress data focus on senators’ overall voting record, not specifically on economic policy, as Sullivan’s claim said. On economic policy, Begich voted against the March 2013 Senate budget proposal passed by nearly every other Democrat. Begich has also opposed Democratic measures in favor of free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, and legislation that would put more taxes on the oil and gas industry. "National Democrats often try to pay for something with oil and gas taxes," Begich told Politico in January. "And I have to explain that ain’t happening: That ain’t happening over my dead body." Our ruling Sullivan’s campaign email claimed Begich supports Obama’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. The statistic the campaign offered looked at all Senate legislation, not just economic policy. Most Democrats scored 90 percent or higher. In another vote analysis that ranked Democrats according to party loyalty, Begich ranked only 45th. Notably, he’s crossed his party on economic issues like yearly budgeting and oil taxes. Sullivan’s claim hinges on one statistic in a way that doesn’t accurately reflect Begich’s voting record on economic policy. We rated this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03360	The Hispanic population in Gwinnett and Henry counties has increased by 153 percent and 339 percent, respectively, since 2000 while Republican presidential candidates are getting a smaller percentage of the vote in those counties.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/15/karl-rove/hispanic-growth-georgia-counties-shows-need-better/	Karl Rove, the chief political strategist behind George W. Bush’s two White House victories, has been telling anyone who’d listen that the Republican Party must do better with nonwhites if it wants to get a Republican back in the Oval Office. Rove said that at the Georgia GOP’s convention in May, with details about how Republicans have done well among Hispanic voters in Texas by aggressively recruiting Hispanic candidates for office and conducting other outreach efforts. He offered some statistics to outline the potential trouble for Georgia Republicans if they do not employ a similar approach here. "If the GOP leaves nonwhite voters to the Democrats, then its margins in safe congressional districts and red states will dwindle — not overnight, but over years and decades," Rowe wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. "For example, the Hispanic population in Georgia's Gwinnett County increased by 153 percent from 2000 to 2010 while the GOP's presidential vote in the county dropped to 54 percent in 2012 from 63.7 percent in 2000. In Henry County, south of Atlanta, the Hispanic population increased by 339 percent over the same decade. The GOP's presidential vote dropped to 51.2 percent in 2012 from 66.4 percent in 2000. Republicans ignore changes like these at their peril." PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t seen such detailed numbers, so we wondered whether Rove was accurate and was there any context missing. Gwinnett and Henry counties had an explosion in population growth in recent decades. Gwinnett’s population has increased nearly fivefold since 1980, from 166,903 residents to the 2010 U.S. census estimate of 805,321. Henry, meanwhile, consistently made the Top 10 list of America’s fastest-growing counties in the early 2000s. Henry’s population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, from 119,341 to 203,923. The once-rural counties in the Atlanta area have been reliable Republican terrain in statewide and national elections, and Rove wants it to stay that way. Hispanics represent a significant portion of the population increase. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in March 2011 that Henry County’s Hispanic population had increased by 338 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2,693 up to 11,813. Gwinnett’s Hispanic population grew from 64,136 in 2000 to 162,035 in 2010, the AJC reported. That’s an increase of nearly 153 percent. The percentage increases we found were almost the same as what Rove wrote in his op-ed. So far, so good for Rove’s claim. As for the recent performance of Republican presidential candidates, Rove was on target as well, according to our review of Georgia secretary of state records. In 2000, Bush, the Republican nominee for president, won approximately 64.2 percent of the vote in Gwinnett County. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney pulled 53.9 percent of Gwinnett voters. In Henry County, Bush garnered 66.5 percent of the vote in 2000 while Romney won 51.2 percent of the vote in 2012. Rove implies a correlation between the increase of Hispanic residents in Gwinnett and Henry and the performance of Republican presidential nominees in those counties, even though he doesn’t draw a direct connection. Most exit polls show about one-third of Hispanic voters nationwide cast their ballots for Bush in 2000, which was considered a good showing for a Republican. Bush courted Hispanic voters by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail in 2000 and distancing himself from GOP immigration positions unpopular among most Hispanics. The nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center reported Romney did not receive the same level of support in 2012, pulling in about 27 percent of Hispanic voters. Polls showed many Hispanic voters were dismayed by Romney’s position and the Republican Party platform on immigration reform, particularly their stance on tougher border patrols. If Hispanic voters in the two counties simply liked Bush’s policies better than Romney’s, could that have accounted for the county’s overall decrease in support for the GOP in 2012? Kristin Davison, Rove’s chief of staff, referred us to past comments in which Rove said Republicans can do better with Hispanic voters with the right policies and better messaging. Census numbers, though, cast doubt on whether Hispanics had enough clout in the two counties to sway the presidential vote outcome. By 2010, Hispanics formed about a fifth of Gwinnett’s population, up from about 11 percent in 2000. In Henry County, Hispanics made up just under 6 percent of the population in 2010, compared with 2 percent in 2000. But the voting-age population of Hispanics in each county was smaller, and many Hispanic adults weren’t registered to vote. William Boone, a longtime political science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the black vote is a critical element that must be considered when examining presidential election voting patterns in Georgia. Boone observed Rove’s lone reference to African-American voters was in the final paragraph of his op-ed. "I think what is missing from his equation is the black vote is increasing in Gwinnett, in Henry, in Rockdale (County) and throughout the state," said Boone, who noted that black voter turnout is greater than Hispanic voter turnout in Georgia. Census numbers indicate that the African-American population in the two counties was large enough and active enough at the polls that they could have had a significant influence on the presidential election. In Gwinnett, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 percent of the population in 2010, up from just over 13 percent in 2000. The number of African-American Gwinnett residents who voted tripled between the 2000 and 2012 elections, state records show. In Henry, African-Americans made up almost 37 percent of the population in 2010, up from about 15 percent in 2000. In Henry, the increase in those who voted was sixfold, records show. In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted in those counties was 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the number of Hispanics who voted, state records show. Georgia did not track how many Hispanics voted in 2000. Exit polls found Democrat Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president, won about 95 percent of the black vote nationwide in 2012. Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s candidate in 2000, won 92 percent of the black vote. Davison said Rove doesn’t believe that nationwide exit poll results can be applied to specific counties. Still, Davison stressed that Rove’s overall point was that the GOP needs to do better among all racial groups. "So, if Republicans rely solely on white voters ... these counties will likely no longer be safe GOP counties as the nonwhite population continues to grow," Davison said. Rove’s numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought. African-American voters, who got cursory mention in his remarks, may have had a larger influence on the performance of GOP presidential candidates in those counties. That context is necessary to fully consider why GOP candidates did not do as well in Gwinnett and Henry counties. We rate Rove’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08032	Says the state's Medicaid waiver proposal "has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/jan/06/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-state-medicaid-proposal-has-la/	It's no secret that Texas Gov. Rick Perry thinks states can do some things better than the federal government, including coordinating health care for its poorest residents. In a Dec. 19 interview with Kathleen McKinley, whose blog appears on the Houston Chronicle's website, Perry said the state has good ideas for delivering care effectively. As an example, he pointed to a proposal that Texas submitted to the federal government with the goal of reducing the number of uninsured residents by "restructuring federal Medicaid funding." Medicaid uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to low-income Americans. Perry went on: "Unfortunately, this waiver, which presents a strategic alternative to continued reliance on government-run health care programs, has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years." Perry's description of the waiver proposal's status rang a bell here at PolitiFact Texas. In the spring, we rated as False a statement Perry made in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that Texas has been waiting for more than two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to "create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today." We confirmed that Texas had sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in April 2008 to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. However, in August 2008, during George W. Bush's presidency, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that "a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic" — making it impossible for the federal agency to approve the proposal as written. Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth, without the state submitting a revised proposal and with no ultimate resolution. A federal official told us April 22 that the ball was in the state's court, saying that as of that time, the waiver request wasn't considered complete. Our story also quoted a state official saying that the proposal would probably need to be adjusted afresh to the just-approved federal overhaul of health care. Eight months later, Perry appeared to be making the same claim, that the federal government — not the state — was responsible for the waiver request's stalled-out status. We wondered whether anything had changed since we last investigated this topic. Not from the state's perspective. "We still consider the proposal to be pending," said Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas health commission. Not from the view of the federal government, which still considers the proposal incomplete. Mary Kahn, a spokeswoman for CMS, told us that the agency had "not yet received a revised proposal from the state." She declined to comment on Perry's statement that it's languishing in a file cabinet. Perry's office did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking elaboration on the governor's recent characterization. Summing up: Perry’s statement echoes a claim we rated False eight months ago. Significantly, the state has not revised its request to meet federal requirements, making this rerun worse than inaccurate. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06361	A state bill would end a longstanding requirement that local governments repair highways and sidewalks -- and block injured citizens from suing over neglected maintenance.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/04/wisconsin-association-justice/wisconsin-association-justice-says-state-bill-woul/	As the 2011 Wisconsin Legislature neared completion of its work, a group of trial lawyers attacked a batch of Republican-sponsored legislation it contends will "erase basic rights." The Wisconsin Association for Justice -- formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers -- railed against limits on attorneys fees in consumer cases, and immunity for doctors and drug makers in injury cases. We previously ruled Mostly True a health care advocate's claim that one of the bills "grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products." This time we’ll examine the trial lawyers’ claim in an Oct. 31, 2011, news release regarding Senate Bill 125/Assembly Bill 180. The group said the proposal "makes local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law, and injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages … The state law has been in place for 162 years." That sounds like a major change of lanes. Let’s pop the hood. First, a bit of history. Over several decades, it’s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government. How much tougher? In a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that "so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception." "Justice," wrote Prosser, "has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit." Generally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That’s because of state laws and court rulings. A notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state "highway defects" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury. The bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the "automatic" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt. Here’s what’s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don’t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes. They don’t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law. Notably, the law creates a "right to recover" damages from government. Many of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that’s how strong the law is. If the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway "reasonably safe for public travel," according to jury instructions in place since 1974. "With winter conditions, it’s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day," said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work. He’s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state’s highest courts. The money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn’t include all counties, or other municipalities. Let’s turn back to the statement. Asked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill. The bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that. So would that mean citizens could "no longer sue" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed? They couldn’t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed. The two sides also agree localities’ legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs. The bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant’s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges. What about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads? Jacobs, of the trial lawyers’ group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute. "What good is a right without a remedy?" Jacobs asked. Even the counties’ attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone. The Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: "Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges" if the bill passed. But in its public news release, the group’s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required. Phillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: "The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county." And for towns, 82.03: "The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction." So the locals still would have the obligation to repair. Let’s patch this up and move on. A trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to "make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law." It continued: "Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages." The bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen. But the group’s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11370	BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years!	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/30/blog-posting/donald-trump-just-ended-welfare-immigrants-s-false/	A website claiming President Donald Trump ended welfare for immigrants ignores critical facts as much as Trump did when he announced this was his intention. "BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years! – Let The Riots ERUPT!" said the headline of a March 29 post on americatb.com. In a nearly 1,000-word post, americatb.com recaps Trump’s desire for limits on federal benefits for immigrants, for a merit-based immigration system and for an end to "chain migration." The story itself isn’t as affirmative as its headline, claiming Trump is "about to" ban immigrants from federal benefits. "President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years," the americatb.com post said. "The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Americatb.com doesn’t indicate who’s behind the website or what its mission is, and it doesn’t list contact information. Trump in June 2017 did say he wanted new immigration rules that would bar new immigrants from public benefits for a period of at least five years. But as we pointed out back then, there’s already a federal law that does that. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 said immigrants who entered the United States on or after Aug. 22, 1996, would not be eligible for federal "means-tested" public benefits for five years, starting on the date of their entry into the United States with a status meeting the definition of "qualified alien," which includes lawful permanent residents. The law did outline several exemptions and said certain groups were not subject to the five-year restriction, including refugees and asylees, military veterans and active-duty military members, along with their spouses and unmarried dependent children. The americatb.com post accurately cited remarks Trump made in an August 2017 weekly address: "Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country." Trump’s weekly address alluded to the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. Their bill does include a provision to prevent immigrants admitted under their proposed skills-based points system from receiving federal means-tested public benefits for five years. But as fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have noted, while the RAISE Act tightens eligibility requirements, many would still remain eligible. The RAISE Act’s provision also only applies to those admitted under the skills-based system, which as Cotton has said, currently represents a small fraction of immigrants legally admitted per year. (The RAISE Act also seeks to limit family-based immigration.) Americatb.com’s post mixes in opinions and hypotheticals ("Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all") but no evidence to back it’s claim that Trump "just ended welfare" for immigrants. We rate americatb.com’s claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-03-30T12:33:21	2018-03-29	['None']
pomt-09424	Rubio admitted he "would have accepted the stimulus money."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/16/charlie-crist/crist-says-rubio-has-said-he-would-have-accepted-s/	It's a move straight out of the campaign playbook: If your opponent criticizes you for something, accuse him of doing the same thing. That's what Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is trying to do to opponent Marco Rubio about supporting the $862 billion economic stimulus package. Rubio has repeatedly criticized Gov. Crist for supporting the plan, which used tax cuts and federal spending to try to jump-start the economy. Rubio has said that Crist "breathed air into the sails of the failed Democrat plan, while deflating Republican efforts to rally behind an alternative." To turn the tables, Crist's campaign issued a satirical news release written as a speech that Rubio supposedly would give to the Conservative Political Action Conference. In it, Rubio would acknowledge that he had said in a recent interview that "I would have accepted the stimulus money." The news release was satire, but the point was serious -- that Rubio said he would have accepted stimulus money. We were surprised by that because Rubio has been so critical of the stimulus, so we decided to see what he had actually said. The Crist campaign is referring to a Rubio interview by Keith Cate of WFLA-TV in Tampa on Dec. 9, 2009. Asked whether "he would not have accepted the stimulus money," Rubio said that "ultimately I would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now." That's not exactly a hearty endorsement, but Rubio is definitely saying that he would take at least some of the money. When the statement set off blog frenzy, the Rubio campaign tried to explain. Alex Burgos, Rubio's spokesman, told Politico that "There’s a big different (sic) between what Charlie Crist did by accepting the Obama stimulus as the best that Congress could do, actively promoting it, advocating for it among his fellow Republicans ... and what other governors ultimately did — governors like Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Sarah Palin, Haley Barbor — by reluctantly accepting federal funds after the fact." Rubio told National Journal's Hotline on Call that "advocating for the stimulus plan and accepting those dollars are not the same. The stimulus was a disaster and I would have fought it in every way possible." As far as we can tell, Rubio has been consistent with his position that there is a distinction between accepting money and actually endorsing the stimulus. Speaking with The Weekly Standard in May 2009, Rubio said that "It's one thing to say you'll accept the funds from the federal government ... it's another to actively advocate those policies, which I think are disastrous for America." And indeed, even in the aforementioned interview, when asked whether he would have attended the presidential visit from Barack Obama -- referring to a February 2009 town hall meeting in Fort Myers, which Crist attended -- Rubio said he would have avoided it "because that rally was in support of a specific plan." To recap: Crist's campaign claimed that Rubio admitted that he would have accepted the stimulus money. And indeed, in the WFLA interview, Rubio said he "would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now."

pomt-11274	After the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised in Maine, the state "reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/26/james-tedisco/ny-may-raise-wages-tipped-workers-heres-what-happe/	New York state leaders are thinking about raising the minimum wage for workers who earn tips in addition to their hourly rate. Sen. James Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady County, says that idea didn’t work when it was tried in Maine two years ago. "The state of Maine passed an initiative that abolished the tip credit," Tedisco wrote in a blog post, "but less than a year later reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure after they saw a significant decrease in earnings." The state Department of Labor will decide later this year whether to end a practice that allows employers to pay tipped employees less than the state’s minimum wage. Tedisco is against the idea, saying it could do more harm than good for the state’s restaurant industry. He says restaurant workers in Maine were able to reverse an identical proposal in their state. Is he right about what happened? What’s happening in New York state The state Department of Labor is holding hearings across the state through June to consider raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The proposal would not ban tipping. Tipped workers currently make between $7.50 and $10.85 an hour without tips depending on where they live and the industry they work in. The minimum wage for everyone else varies between $10.40 and $13.50 based on location and industry. Tips are meant to make up the difference between what tipped workers earn and the statewide minimum wage. Employers have to fill the gap if tips do not. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo believes the proposal may help employees who struggle to make the minimum wage with tips. If the Department of Labor agrees, the agency can raise the minimum wage for tipped employees without approval from voters or the state legislature. They already did once in 2015. What happened in Maine Maine tried to do the same thing in 2016 — sort of. In a 2016 ballot initiative, Maine approved increasing the state’s minimum wage as well as gradually raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. The measure passed by a slim margin. By the time the new minimum wage took effect at the start of 2017, restaurant workers had already organized a campaign to restore the lower wage for tipped workers. They argued that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave a tip. Fear became reality for many workers, according to Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, who co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to oppose the wage increase. "Individuals were coming into our restaurant and simply asking us, ‘You make minimum wage, do you still think I should tip the same percentage?’ " Chaisson said. He was one of hundreds of restaurant owners and workers who showed up at the state capitol in Maine that April for a public hearing on the wage increase. "Several of us had brought pay stubs forward from the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 showing we had actually lost money in the same identical quarter from year to year," Chaisson said. In June 2017, the Maine legislature passed a new law making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. One of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Roger Katz, gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law. "Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened," Katz said in a statement. "Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system." Our ruling Tedisco said the measure raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine was reversed in less than a year. Tedisco is right. Voters in Maine raised the minimum wage for tipped workers through a ballot initiative. State lawmakers reversed that decision less than a year later after pressure from restaurant workers who were against the wage increase. We rate his claim True.

pomt-11705	Says of the diversity visa lottery program, "they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin," and "the worst of the worst" are selected.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/20/donald-trump/pick-them-bin-donald-trump-mischaracterizes-divers/	President Donald Trump's claims about bad people coming into the United States have expanded to include not just people who get here illegally, but also immigrants who arrive legally after being vetted by the U.S. government. Trump told graduates at the FBI National Academy that two recent terrorist attacks in New York City were perpetrated by individuals who came to the United States via a "dysfunctional immigration system," one through family sponsorship and the other through the diversity visa lottery program. Trump said: "They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he’s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you’re going to the United States. Okay. What a system — lottery system." Trump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: "When we take people in a lottery, they're not putting their best people in the lottery. It's common sense. They're not saying, 'Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.' No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that's what we get in many cases." Trump’s recent comments parallel his Pants on Fire claim as presidential candidate that the Mexican government sends "the bad ones" over to the United States. In this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don't send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa. The White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check. Trump’s criticism of the diversity visa lottery Trump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes. He’s said the visa lottery "presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security" and has pointed as an example Sayfullo Saipov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring a dozen other in an October vehicular attack in New York City. He’s pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges. The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It's not foreign governments who run the lottery, it's administered by the U.S. State Department. Here’s its current description of the program: • Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall; • Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer; • Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa; • The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases; • Applicants who pass the vetting process are awarded the diversity visa, which is usually valid for up to six months from date of issuance. "No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies," the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact. "National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications," the agency added. The ‘worst of the worst’? Trump’s comment that the worst are coming not only ignores vetting done by the State Department, but also lottery entry requirements of at least a high school education or its equivalent, or two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. "In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly," said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Trump said countries are not "giving us" their best people. But that's a flawed statement. Countries do not "give" immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. "Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa," Cohen said. "The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed." Cohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, "which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests." "The diversity visa program is a true lottery. There is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry," Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School wrote in an op-ed for the New York Daily News. Our ruling Trump said of the diversity visa lottery program, "they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin," and "the worst of the worst" are selected. Trump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010. But Trump’s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don't "give us" immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Lottery entrants must meet educational and work experience requirements, and winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa. We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05229	The new Hartsfield-Jackson international terminal was "on time and on budget."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/06/kasim-reed/reed-airport-terminal-opened-time-and-budget/	To hear airport boosters tell it, the story of the recent completion of the new international terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson airport ends with a Happily Ever After. The Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal is one of the largest in the country, and it takes advantage of expected growth in international travel at the world’s busiest airport. Passengers will receive the best in service inside its glistening corridors, they say. When city leaders announced its opening date, they could not contain their enthusiasm. "I am . . . pleased to announce today that the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal will open for global business and travel on Wednesday, May 16, on time and on budget," Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said during a speech in the weeks before the terminal’s opening. The audience applauded. PolitiFact Georgia grew concerned. "On time and on budget"? PolitiFact Georgia recently gave airport spokesman John Kennedy a Pants on Fire rating after he said the terminal was completed "within budget." So what about the mayor’s "on time and on budget" claim? We found that airport boosters have made a habit of describing what was a daytime drama as a fairy tale. As we’ve said before, planning for the international terminal began more than a decade ago, well before Reed took office as mayor in January 2010. Leaders hoped to double the size of the international complex. Stories printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million. Leaders said it could be finished as early as 2004, according to AJC stories. Those plans soon went awry. Construction prices rose, and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, so did the price of security measures. Delta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and the terminal’s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport said its plans would bust the proposed $700 million budget. By May 2006, auditors concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal’s price tag was spiraling out of control. A year later, the expected price was as high as $1.5 billion, even though it would be 400,000 square feet smaller than planned. Now on to Reed’s "on time and on budget" claim. Reed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs argued that the mayor’s statement is accurate because the terminal met goals established during his time in office. "Mayor Reed’s statement is true and accurate in that it reflects the city’s management of the international terminal since his inauguration on Jan. 4, 2010," Jacobs said. One month after he took office, the airlines set a budget of about $1.413 billion, an amount Jacobs said was the only true budget for the terminal. If Reed specified that the terminal met a budget goal set while he was mayor, Jacobs would have a point. But that’s not what he said. Furthermore, when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million -- regardless of the technicalities. Now let’s consider whether the terminal opened on time. The following account of airport delays comes from years of stories published in the AJC: The Atlanta City Council voted to name the terminal after former Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson in 2003, soon after his death. That year, it was expected to open in 2006. In May 2005, airport officials said that costs were rising for the new terminal, and its opening would be delayed until 2009. After the design team was fired, the terminal opening was delayed until 2010. But by 2009, planners projected an early 2012 opening. This date was just about right. The airport opened May 16. Reed’s claim that the terminal opened on time was correct because it began operating as the mayor promised, Jacobs said. "Mayor Reed and his administration never veered from saying that under our leadership, the international terminal would open in spring 2012. We did so," Jacobs said. It’s true that the delays did not take place under Reed’s watch, but no matter how you slice it, the terminal opened years later than originally planned. If officials say it will open in 2006, taxpayers expect it to open in 2006. Reed doesn’t deserve blame for the delays, or the cost overruns. But the mayor is accountable for the highly inaccurate claim that the terminal was finished "on time and on budget." Reed earns our lowest rating on this one, Pants on Fire.

pomt-00829	Says according to recent polls, no Republican candidate "is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/25/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-he-has-best-shot-beating-hillary-cl/	Among the potential Republican contenders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says he is best-positioned to take on likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. In an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who asked about his chances at a win, Paul said, "I think when you see my polling, the polling that's out there so far, nobody is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself." "Also though, when you poll people not just against each other, but against the other side, that shows which candidate has the best chance of picking up the independent vote," he added. "And right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her." We wondered if Paul really is doing the best in polls against Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 general election match-up. Paul’s office directed us to a recent CNN/ORC poll that asked participants whether they would vote for Clinton or various Republican candidates in the general election. Indeed, more people said they would vote for Paul over Clinton than they would vote for other Republican candidates over Clinton. In a Paul-Clinton race, 43 percent said they would pick Paul, while 54 percent said they would pick Clinton, according to the CNN/ORC poll. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came in second place behind Paul, with 42 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 55 percent. However, there are a few contextual issues we’d like to point out. First, the margin of error in the CNN poll is plus or minus three percentage points. Every Republican candidate in this poll came in between 40 percent and 43 percent against Clinton. So taking into account that three-point margin of error, the Republican candidates had more or less the same results, meaning there isn't a clear winner. Additionally, the CNN poll is only one of several polls. Of the seven polls collected by PollingReport.com, a nonpartisan public opinion site, that pit Paul against Clinton, this CNN/ORC is the only one where Paul has a lead among Republicans. This table shows results of the CNN poll and three other recent polls. The percentage that would vote for the Republican candidate is on the left, and the percentage that would vote for Clinton is on the right. The Republican with the best chance against Clinton is bolded in each column. The polls did not ask about every candidate. Candidate (vs. Clinton) CNN 3/13-15 Marist 3/1-4 Quinnipiac 2/26-3/2 Fox 1/25-27 Rand Paul 43% to 54% 40% to 51% 41% to 47% 44% to 47% Jeb Bush 40% to 55% 42% to 49% 42% to 45% 43% to 48% Chris Christie 40% to 55% n/a 39% to 46% 42% to 48% Ted Cruz n/a 39% to 53% 38% to 48% n/a Scott Walker 40% to 55% 44% to 48% 39% to 48% n/a Ben Carson 40% to 56% n/a n/a n/a Mike Huckabee 41% to 55% n/a 40% to 47% n/a Marco Rubio 42% to 55% 42% to 49% 41% to 46% n/a Rick Perry n/a 42% to 51% n/a n/a Mitt Romney n/a n/a n/a 46% to 46% As you can see, each poll has a different winner in the match-up against Clinton. So there’s no obvious frontrunner in this regard, with the possible exception of failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the Fox News poll, where he received the highest percentage of the vote against Clinton among all the poll results (46 percent to 46 percent). But Romney has decided not to run this cycle. Additionally, all of the Republicans are coming within a couple points of each other when compared to Clinton, such as Paul with 43 percent and Rubio with 42 percent in the CNN poll. This downplays Paul’s assertion that "nobody’s doing better" than him. "I doubt any respectable pollsters would say a single percentage point lead suggests that he is ‘doing better’ " than other candidates against Clinton, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Foundation. Bowman added the Republicans’ results hover around 40 percent in each of these polls because that’s about the percentage of Americans who are Republican or lean right, and it’s fair to assume that any Republican candidate will get core party support. "So, any Republican will probably get around 40 percent of the vote to start," she said, noting that it is still too early to tell which specific candidate would do best against Clinton 18 months from now. "It is probably easier at this point to see if someone is just a non-starter, if he or she is significantly below that threshold." We posed Bowman’s analysis to Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, and she said, "We all recognize that polling data can be collected a number of different ways and can produce various outcomes. The specific poll Sen. Paul was citing, along with the outlet that conducted the poll publicly declared that Sen. Paul comes closest to beating Hillary Clinton." It’s also worth noting that in every single one of these match-ups, Clinton wins. (The one exception is the tied Romney-Clinton results in the Fox poll.) In the CNN/ORC poll that Paul cites as showing he’s got the best chance at beating Clinton, she is still ahead by 11 percentage points. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has the best chance against Clinton in the Marist poll, is behind Clinton by 4 percentage points in that poll. Our ruling Paul said that according to recent polls, no Republican candidate "is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself." The big picture shows nearly any Republican candidate getting approximately 40 percent of the vote when matched up against Clinton, so it’s hard to argue that any particular candidate is in the lead in this regard. One poll shows Paul with the highest support among Republicans against Clinton. But the size of the margin of error allows for the possibility that Paul might, in reality, be behind other Republican candidates. Additionally that is the only poll that shows Paul with a lead. Because it’s hard to say if any candidate, so far out from the 2016 election, is the clear frontrunner in a hypothetical race against Clinton, we rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11768	"For years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-no-tax-cuts-passed-reagan/	During a speech in St. Charles, Mo., to promote Republican tax legislation in Congress, President Donald Trump tried to offer some historical context. "You know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan," Trump said on Nov. 29. That’s flat wrong. Under three presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- Congress enacted nine tax bills worth in the tens of billions of dollars in revenue reductions over four years. Here’s the list, compiled from Treasury Department data. Year President Name Average annual revenue reduction over first four years, current dollars 1997 Bill Clinton Tax Relief Act of 1997 $13.2 billion 2001 George W. Bush Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act $74.4 billion 2002 George W. Bush Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act $28 billion 2003 George W. Bush Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act $69.2 billion 2004 George W. Bush Working Families Tax Relief Act $25.9 billion 2005 George W. Bush Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Ac $22.6 billion 2008 George W. Bush Economic Stimulus Act $33.7 billion 2009 Barack Obama American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act $76.6 billion 2012 Barack Obama American Taxpayer Relief Act $320.6 billion These measures were not obscure pieces of legislation. The list includes the two big Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, arguably the signature domestic policy achievements of his presidency. Among other things, these bills cut rates for the top bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. The list also includes the extension of many of those tax cuts in advance of their scheduled expiration in 2013 under Obama -- a high-stakes legislative situation known as the "fiscal cliff." (The top-bracket rate was one that did not continue; it rose again to 39.6 percent.) Trump's statement is ridiculously wrong -- since 1997, nine major tax bills have passed with tens of billions of dollars in cuts. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

"Breaking: Malia Obama expelled from Harvard," read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on TheNewYorkEvening.com, a known fake news website. The same post appears almost word for word on plenty of other websites, too. Facebook users flagged the story as possibly being bogus, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds. The post said Harvard chancellor Malcolm Little said Malia, 18, "was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends." The school’s strict drug policy meant she was out, the article read, and the Obama family was considering filing a discrimination suit. Again, this story is fake, because there haven’t been any reports that Malia Obama was kicked out. But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult — she isn’t going to school there yet. The White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would take a gap year before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like hang out with boys in Manhattan. As for the post’s other details, Harvard does prohibit drugs and alcohol on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn’t have a chancellor, it has a president, and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust. More importantly, the post originally appeared April 9 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." Point being, Malia wasn’t caught smoking weed in a Boston hotel, and didn’t get booted from a school she isn’t even attending yet. Don’t expect to see her having to settle for Brown anytime soon.

pomt-00451	The Trump campaign "didn’t know" that Natalia Veselnitskaya "was a representative of the Russian government. ... I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-gets-facts-wrong-about-trump-tower-meetin/	Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s attorney, said that members of Trump’s campaign had no reason to believe a key participant in the controversial Trump Tower meeting was working on behalf of the Russian government. Giuliani even suggested they may not have known she was Russian. "You asked me did they show an intention to do anything with Russians?" Giuliani told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. "All they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing. "I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time," Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview. Giuliani’s claim is starkly at odds with the facts. 'Russian government attorney' Emails between Donald Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published on Twitter — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com On June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later. In emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton. "The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father," Goldstone wrote. "This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump," he added, noting that a "Russian government attorney" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. The younger Trump replied: "If it’s what you say I love it." Trump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Days later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting. The key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump Jr. as a "Russian government attorney." Veselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients. Veselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting — and contrary to Giuliani’s claim — she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign. This fact may prove legally significant. While experts cautioned against drawing any premature legal conclusions, they told us the Trump Tower interaction raised serious concerns about whether U.S. federal election law was broken. Our ruling Giuliani said the Trump campaign "didn’t know" that Natalia Veselnitskaya "was a representative of the Russian government" or even Russian. Emails between Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion. Those emails show Trump senior’s business associate Rob Goldstone telling the younger Trump that a "Russian government attorney" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. to supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton. The younger Trump replied: "If it’s what you say I love it" — and several days later, the meeting took place. We rate this Pants on Fire!

pomt-12874	"If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/29/donald-trump/no-evidence-trump-claim-it-was-impossible-syrian-c/	On the same day as he announced a halt on entries from Syria and six other predominantly Muslim countries, President Donald Trump claimed the United States was discriminating against Christians in its refugee admission policy. Trump’s executive order declaring the ban includes an exemption for persecuted religious minorities. In an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Trump explained: "If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible." This is a claim we heard from Trump during the 2016 election, and it’s inaccurate. Christians make up a very small fraction of Syrians admitted under the refugee program, but they have been able to enter the United States. There is no evidence that this is an outcome of discriminatory policy. Refugee admissions skew in favor of Christians in other countries. Admissions numbers From Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria. According to federal data, this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.) So, right off the bat, Trump is wrong that it was "impossible" to enter the United States as a Christian. Christians do make up a small fraction of refugee admissions compared with their makeup in the overall population of Syria. (We’ll explain why that may be later.) But they did come in; it was not "impossible," as Trump said. Muslims made up about 98 percent of Syrian refugees, compared with about 87 percent of Syria’s population, as of Jan. 12, 2017, according to the CIA World Factbook. Christians, meanwhile, were 10 percent of the population but just 1 percent of refugees. (The Pew Research Center meanwhile says about 5 percent of Syrians are Christians.) This pattern, however, doesn’t exist for the other countries targeted by Trump’s ban. In some cases, the reverse is true: The proportion of Christian refugee admissions are greater than the proportion of Christians living the country. Here’s a breakdown of refugee admissions by country and religion in the time frame (Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017): Christian refugees Christian population Muslim refugees Muslim population Syria 1% 10% 98% 87% Iran 49% 0.9%* 9% 99%* Iraq 26% 0.8% 71% 99% Sudan 13% 5%* 79% 91%* Somalia 0.2% 0.2%* 99.8% 99.8%* Libya 0%** 2.7% 100%** 97% Yemen 27% 0.2%* 60% 99.1%* *These figures come from the Pew Research Center’s 2015 Religion and Public Life Project, given incomplete data from the CIA World Fact Book. **The United States has accepted a total of 10 Libyan refugees from Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017. Experts say no evidence of religious discrimination When we looked into Trump’s claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump’s accusation is off base. A year and half later, there’s still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry. David Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population. But he said, "there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn’t reflect a general hostility to Christians." One possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker reported, is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations’ refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.) The UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations. In October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres offered a few other theories. Christians in Syria "have been less systematically victimized than they were in Iraq," he said. "Most of the Syrian Christians have moved to Lebanon. And in Lebanon, the first thing that happened to me when I met with the Lebanese president ... when I asked him to start a resettlement program from Lebanon, (he said), don’t resettle Christians because they are vital for us." Ann Richard, then-assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration, suggested in a congressional hearing in December 2015 that Christian Syrians aren’t looking to move out of the country. "A disproportionate number of Syrians staying in the country are Christian. Now why is this? It’s because a higher percentage of them support Assad and feel safer with him there," she said (around 2:23:50 mark). Regardless of the disparity in Syria, experts did not agree with Trump’s suggestion that Christians face additional hurdles. "The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims," Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, told us previously. Martin pointed out that since 2004, Christians have made up about 46 percent of refugee admissions from Iraq. That’s disportionate to the country’s total Christian population by a factor of about 58. Geoffrey Mock, a Middle East specialist for Amnesty International USA, said Amnesty has documented a myriad of human rights violations in the refugee resettlement process, but not religious discrimination "because we haven’t see any of it from the U.S. side." Our ruling Trump said, "If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible." Hundreds of Syrian Christians have entered the United States through the refugee admissions program. Thousands more Christians from other countries targeted by Trump’s ban have also entered. During former President Barack Obama's tenure, there was no formal policy that discriminated against Christians. People who watch the refugee process closely said there was no actual discrimination against Christians, either. With nothing to support this claim, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1da0489-11fc-4450-bf0d-6d8317cfd7a4	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-01-29T16:50:38	2017-01-27	['Islam', 'Christian']
pomt-05298	"Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/21/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-commerce-claims-20-million-people-will-los/	Alan Grayson’s four-year-old quip about Republicans’ plan for healthcare reform -- remember his "die quickly" rant? -- is getting new life this election cycle. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is using it against him in a TV attack ad airing in May 2012. Grayson, who represented House District 8 until Dan Webster unseated him in 2010, is running for a new Orlando seat. The commercial is part of a broader campaign by the lobbying group targeting Democrats over their support of "Obamacare," including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here). This commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record, repeating his explosive lines on the floor. Narrator: "Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare’s biggest cheerleaders. He’d say anything." Grayson: "Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly." Narrator: "Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage." Another record appears with Grayson’s face on it, labeled "Obamacare Unconstitutional." Narrator: "And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?" PolitiFact Florida fact-checked the ad’s claim that a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional and found it Mostly True. For this story we’re focused on the ad’s first claim that Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage. It’s familiar ground for us, with mixed rulings depending on the context. When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare," we rated the statement Half True. When the chamber claimed "20 million people could lose their current coverage" -- and suggested that included seniors who rely on Medicare -- in its anti-Nelson ad, we rated it Pants on Fire! The claim in this commercial’s context is pretty straight-forward. We’ll explain. The 20-million figure is a projection from nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office. You should know CBO has also projected the law will lead to new coverage for about 30 million uninsured Americans. The real issue here is a shift in how some people will get their health insurance. The RNC previously directed us to a March 2012 study by the CBO that aimed to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO’s best guess was that between 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. CBO supplemented its projection with four alternative scenarios. Among the scenarios: One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The others resulted in a decrease of 10 million, a decrease of 12 million, and -- here it is! -- a decline of 20 million. (Read this fact-check for more details about the CBO report.) Priebus was partially accurate in his op-ed, but this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered. So Priebus -- and now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- has engaged in cherry-picking. There’s more context to consider. Not everyone who "loses" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to the CBO, some people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans; they are choosing to switch. Plus, the 20 million figure does not account for the 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before but will get coverage after passage of the law because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. Our ruling The U.S. Chamber said, "Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage." It's a claim that is oft-repeated and much exaggerated. The chamber employs a worst-case projection by a nonpartisan research agency. The agency’s other forecasts are lower, but you wouldn’t know that from watching the ad. And unlike Priebus, the group does not specify that the type of insurance potentially affected is a specific type of insurance -- "employer-based" insurance. Plus, this 20 million estimate only counts people who receive coverage from their employer -- and not those who might receive better coverage elsewhere. Most importantly, this figure does not represent uninsured people who will get coverage because of the law. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02351	You can buy lobster with food stamps.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/21/greg-morris/food-stamp-lobster-claim-true-extent-unclear/	A food fight recently erupted in the Georgia Legislature over food stamps -- with a morsel of information tossed out by one lawmaker that was too tasty for the Truth-O-Meter to pass up. Before a Senate committee, state Rep. Greg Morris, a Republican from Vidalia, was battling for a bill he authored that would require food stamp recipients to be drug-tested. Morris was asked why no one else spoke in favor of his legislation, House Bill 772, as opposed to representatives of legal groups and other organizations who said they were against it. "What lobbyists are there for just the average worker who’s a taxpayer?" Morris said. "They’re economizing and buying inexpensive cuts of meat, when with (food stamps) you can buy lobster." So, food stamp recipients can purchase lobster. Is this true? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d put on a lobster bib and do taste-testing as we researched this claim. A medium-tail lobster costs $7 for 5 ounces at some local supermarkets, so it’s not cheap. Our bosses said lobster was not in the budget. We trudged along. Nearly one in five Georgians, about 1.7 million people, receive food stamps (a program actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and 16,000 receive welfare (called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), according to the Georgia Department of Human Services. Many of those are children, who would not be drug-tested under the bill. A revised version of HB 772 was passed by both chambers of the Georgia Legislature on Thursday, the final day of the session. HB 772 now heads to Gov. Nathan Deal for his signature. Morris did not return a call for comment. The lawmaker’s angst may stem from several Fox News Channel reports about an aspiring musician who used the federal benefits to buy the high-end seafood. The cable outlet showed a day in the life of California resident Jason Greenslate, who was 29 and unemployed and receiving SNAP benefits when Fox News met him. His day began with surfing. Next, he discussed plans for a party with friends. After that, Greenslate made a trip to the supermarket where he bought a rainbow roll of salmon, eel and other ingredients, coconut water and lobster that Greenslate observed was "on special." The lobster he purchased appeared to have a sale price on the wrapper. Greenslate used his food stamp card at the checkout counter. "All paid for by our wonderful tax dollars," he said on camera. Greenslate later met with three friends and cooked the lobster on a grill. "EBT lobster," he said before taking a bite. Electronic Benefits Transfer is the system that transfers the federal funds to food stamp cards. The number of Americans in SNAP has more than doubled in the past decade, from about 21 million people in 2003 to nearly 48 million in 2013, U.S. Food and Drug Administration data shows. The number of SNAP recipients has risen each year since 2000. The amount of money given in benefits has more than tripled from $21 billion in 2003 to $76 billion in 2013. Greenslate said he receives about $190 a month for food stamps, which is about $60 more than the national average benefit per person. He’s been pilloried by some of the network’s commentators for what they describe as his carefree outlook on accepting federal benefits and purchasing luxury food. In a subsequent interview, Greenslate explained he’ll buy food like lobster if he can get a deal on it. "I’ll eat whatever is on sale," he said. Tales of hipsters and middle-income Americans now down on their luck buying Japanese eggplant or lemon grass with their EBT cards have been reported by news outlets in recent years. Conversely, some politicians have attempted to show the difficulty of living on food stamps by writing about the tough decisions they’ve had to make about what food to purchase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has no restrictions on SNAP recipients buying luxury items such as steak and seafood. They also can purchase food and soft drinks that are less nutritious, such as ice cream. Alcohol, beer, cigarettes and wine are prohibited. Live animals are off the list as well. The USDA said in a 2007 report that it resisted restrictions of most foods because it says it would be difficult to regulate, considering there are more than 300,000 food products in the country. The federal agency also was worried that further restrictions would embarrass some recipients and discourage them from applying to SNAP. So are there many other food stamp recipients buying lobster? It’s unclear. Messages to the USDA were not returned. Last April, the USDA released a study of the dietary habits of some SNAP recipients once they joined the program. It found they ate more whole fruit and less of some vegetables, such as carrots. The recipients ate food with less sodium and saturated fat. It did not have a breakdown of their consumption of lobster. Most other studies found little or no change in the waistlines of recipients, contrary to thinking that food stamp use leads to obesity. Comedian Jon Stewart said Fox News is exaggerating the scope of the situation. "Congratulations on finding your food stamp abuse Bigfoot," Stewart said on his Comedy Central television show, referring to Greenslate. "That one guy you found is certainly not someone the food stamp program itself would point to as its greatest success story. But we make fun of you not for finding him, but for pretending that he somehow represents literally millions of Americans." To sum up, Morris said that you can buy lobster with food stamps. It’s unknown how many other food stamp recipients are cracking open this yummy seafood from its shell. As the Fox News video showed, there is at least one person receiving those federal benefits who bought lobster. The man did say he does so if it’s on sale. From what we’ve seen, there are few people buying such high-end items. But it is possible, just as Morris said. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-02989	Says Damascus’ disincorporation would produce "NO significant tax savings."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/18/steve-spinnett/damascus-disincorporation-would-produce-no-signifi/	For much of its nearly decade-long existence as a city, Damascus has been at war with itself. Even before voters in 2004 made Damascus Oregon’s first new city in 22 years, battle lines were being drawn. On one side were those who contended that incorporation would be the best way to ensure a strong local voice given the Metro regional government’s 2002 decision to bring thousands of acres around Damascus inside the region’s urban growth boundary. On the other were those who liked the area’s rural nature and wanted it to be left alone. Infighting has continued ever since. Lawsuits, threatened recall campaigns, mass resignations from citizen advisory panels and simmering feuds among City Council members remain commonplace. Now, Damascus’ chances of thriving as a city may be dissolving. Voters on Nov. 5 will cast ballots on Measure 3-433. If more than half of the city’s registered voters say yes, the city of 10,700 will disincorporate. Passions are running high on both sides, with lawn signs favoring one camp or the other dotting the Clackamas County countryside. Mayor Steve Spinnett opposes disincorporation. He sides with property owners, such as himself, who think maintaining the city is the best way to ensure development of their land. Among the claims he made in a Voters’ Pamphlet statement against pulling the plug is that disincorporation will produce "NO significant tax savings!" Given that pocketbook issues such as property taxes and other fees typically play critical roles in local government decisions, PolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether that’s true. The county put out a fact sheet answering some of the many technical questions arising from Measure 3-433. On the question of what happens to property taxes if Damascus incorporates, the sheet states, "There would be a net decrease." That’s because, starting with next year’s tax statements, the city’s current rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of assessed value would disappear. Damascus residents now also pay an additional $2.40 per $1,000 of assessed value to cover the services they receive from Clackamas County. That brings their current total property tax rate to $5.50. With the median Clackamas County residence valued at just over $224,000, according to the assessor’s office, that equates to an annual property tax bill of $1,232. From there, things get a bit more complicated. Subtract the $3.10 from $5.50, and you get a tax rate of $2.40. Under disincorporation, that would rise by 24 percent to $2.98 per $1,000 of assessed value since the county has a higher base tax rate in unincorporated areas. But even at the $2.98 figure, "former" Damascus residents would still end up paying 46 percent less in property taxes than they would if they continue as a municipality. That $1,232 tax bill on the median house would drop to $667. Spinnett, in a telephone interview, acknowledged that property taxes will drop at least some if voters opt for disincorporation. "Maybe it depends on your definition of the word significant," he said, referring to his Voters’ Pamphlet statement. "But, yes, when city taxes go away, you’ll see a reduction in your property taxes." But the analysis shouldn’t stop there, he said. Scrapping the city also means scrapping the handful of government-limiting features he and others fought to add to the City Charter. Those include a spending cap, no-new-tax provisions and a prohibition on city collection of the fees most cities charge to cover the cost of new development. Another 72 cents per $1,000 of assessed value could end up being tacked on, he said, if residents request annexation to the sheriff’s enhanced law enforcement district. Absent that, the County Board of Commissioners and the sheriff would need to evaluate how to respond to the loss of the $1 million a year the county now receives from Damascus for law enforcement services. Finally, he said, disincorporation would require the city to transfer its remaining cash and fixed assets to the county. Spinnett put those figures at $5.5 million and $2 million, respectively. "You add all those together, and whatever savings people might see on their property taxes is going to be largely wiped out," Spinnett said. "It’s a mixed bag, at best." Spinnett is probably correct that Clackamas County may start imposing fees for some new development in the area, but those so-called system development charges -- paid by developers -- have nothing to do with property tax collections. And while remaining city assets would, by law, be turned over to the county, "those are completely divorced from the tax rate," said Dan Chandler, the county strategic policy adviser who wrote the fact sheet. Last, although voters countywide may cast ballots sometime late next year on an increased vehicle registration fee for road maintenance, Clackamas County has shown considerable reluctance in recent years to approve anything resembling a new tax. Thus, it seems unlikely that a flood of countywide bonds, levies and local improvement districts would materialize. Simple math shows that if Damascus voters follow up their 2004 historic vote to incorporate with another historic vote to disincorporate, homeowners will see their property tax bills fall -- by 46 percent at the median level. That is a significant savings.	None	Steve Spinnett	None	None	None	2013-10-18T15:58:59	2013-09-03	['None']
pomt-09495	Bill McCollum voted four times to raise his own pay, by a total of $51,000, and earns a congressional pension worth more than $75,000 a year.	true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mccollum-voted-raise-congres/	The 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign intensified this week, as allies of Republican Bill McCollum and Democrat Alex Sink exchanged television ads designed to highlight aspects of their rival's record that voters might not be happy with. On Feb. 23, 2010, we analyzed an anti-Sink ad placed by the Republican Governors Association. We ruled that the ad -- focusing on her tenure as a highly compensated bank executive during a time of job losses at her company -- was Mostly True. Today we look at an anti-McCollum response ad aired by the Florida Democratic Party. The ad begins with footage of McCollum telling reporters, "I'm proud of my record of having been a congressman." A voice-over continues, "Really? Well, Bill McCollum, you cost the rest of us billions. He voted four times to raise his own pay. $51,000. Our tax money pays his congressional pension. Over $75,000 dollars a year. The national debt skyrocketed. $4.7 trillion. McCollum voted for debt-limit increases five times. Bill McCollum. Just another Washington politician Florida can't afford." We'll address the debt questions in a separate item. Here we'll tackle the issues of congressional pay raises and pensions. Congressional pay raises In a footnote to the advertisement, the Florida Democratic Party provided bill numbers and dates showing the votes that enabled congressional salaries to increase. We checked the four votes -- in 1989, 1997, 1999 and 2000 -- with roll call records and confirmed that McCollum did vote yes in all four cases. In the case of the 1989 bill -- which combined landmark ethics reforms with a pay raise of more than 30 percent over two years -- McCollum praised the bill when it was introduced, saying that it's "not about a pay raise -- it's about good government. ... It's about changing the ethical climate of Congress." As for the amount of the salary increase, the ad actually understates it. Before the 1989 vote, congressional salaries were $89,500. On Jan. 1, 2001 -- two days before McCollum's final term officially ended -- congressional salaries went up to $145,100. That's a difference of $55,600, a bit higher than the $51,000 stated in the ad. The McCollum campaign points out that on several of these votes, a majority of Florida's Democratic Congressional delegation voted the same way McCollum did, and we think that's fair context to add. But looking specifically at the Democratic ad's charge, this part of the claim is accurate. Congressional pension The pensions issue is even more straightforward. The Florida Democratic Party sent us copies of three financial disclosure forms signed by McCollum, who is 65. The first was filed in 2005, when McCollum was a candidate for state attorney general, an office he won and continues to occupy. It reports that McCollum earned $76,704 in a federal pension, which covers his service in Congress. (This is distinct from his military pension, which earned him $13,455 that year; McCollum served in the Navy and the Naval Reserve from 1969 to 1992.) His 2006 report showed a federal pension worth $77,612, while his 2008 report showed a $77,280 federal pension. All three filings showed congressional pensions worth "over $75,000 dollars a year." So this claim is accurate as well. Both claims are supported by the evidence, so we're assigning it a rating of True.

pomt-14303	"There have not been any public safety issues" in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/01/chris-sgro/equality-nc-director-no-public-safety-risks-cities/	In the fight to defend Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law. "There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities," Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte’s bill was overturned. Conservatives weren’t swayed, though. Before Charlotte’s bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned. Mostly, opponents said opening up women’s restrooms to transgender women – people who are biologically male but identify as female – will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms. Online, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase "don’t let our girls become victims" and "keep children safe." N.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited "privacy and safety concerns" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte’s bill on his own. A popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, "The danger is real from sexual predators in women’s restrooms." On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators. So who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro’s side. That’s not to say that people don’t have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte’s ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women’s room might trigger painful memories. But still, Sgro said, Charlotte’s bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism – it just would’ve let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they’re more comfortable in. "Transgender people are not predators," he said. Examples to prove Sgro wrong? The entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people. A dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms. We asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women’s locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. The man didn’t identify as transgender and didn’t appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn’t charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated. The liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza. Maza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina’s new law passed that "A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom." Maza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn’t reported a single incident of "harassment or inappropriate behavior" related to transgender students and bathrooms. But we still weren’t satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada. In that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women’s shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an "indefinite" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison. Hambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America. After spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women’s bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman. It’s unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would’ve been legal for a transgender woman to use the women’s room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape. In 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women’s locker room and trying to talk to children. Again, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would’ve had any legal claim to being in a women’s room by virtue of being a transgender woman. The blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn’t find proof of any convictions in those cases. Our ruling Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that "There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. We haven’t found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. There was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U.S., there have been a few yet-unproven allegations. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-15330	"The $5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-5-billion-website-obamacare-neve/	Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman who has shaken up the Republican presidential race, has been attacking both Republicans and Democrats in his speeches and interviews. At one point in a July 11, 2015, speech in Phoenix, he took aim at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He singled out the healthcare.gov website, which was unveiled in the fall of 2013 with a panoply of bugs and glitches, calling it "the $5 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked. Still doesn't work." It’s a year and a half after the website’s troubled launch, and it’s been awhile since we’ve taken a look at how the website is doing and what it has cost to build. So we decided to see if Trump has any basis either for saying that the healthcare.gov website cost $5 billion or that it "still doesn’t work." (Trump’s camp didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.) Let’s take each of these claims in turn. Did the website cost $5 billion? The cost of the website has been a bone of contention ever since its launch, partly because federal contracting is complex, involving some 60 major contracts. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker grappled with this question over the course of two separate reports that included several interim updates as new data surfaced. Officially, the Department of Health and Human Services says the website cost $834 million. That’s the number offered by then-HHS Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell at a Senate hearing on May 8, 2014. As of Feb. 28, 2014, Burwell told lawmakers, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the part of HHS responsible for the website -- "has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on marketplace-related (information technology) contracts and interagency agreements." Not everyone has taken that figure at face value. Bloomberg Government undertook a study that used a more generous definition of the relevant federal spending. In the study, released in September 2014, researchers included several additional costs beyond the government’s official estimate -- $387 million in spending by the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies beyond HHS, as well as a $300 million contract to process paper applications, and additional spending by HHS after the cutoff for Burwell’s estimate. Using this broader net, Bloomberg Government came up with a figure of $2.1 billion. That’s bigger than the official estimate, but it’s still not as large as what Trump said. We asked the Bloomberg Government study’s author, Peter Gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago. He was skeptical, saying that even if you add on a five-year follow-up contract with the firm Accenture, it should "only get you about halfway to $5 billion." So Trump’s figure seems exaggerated. However, we have a hunch about where it came from, and while it’s wrong, it’s easy to see how someone could have made the mistake. Using a provision of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has spent nearly $5 billion in a series of grants to states to establish health care exchanges, according to tabulations made by both the Congressional Research Service and the Kaiser Family Foundation. This $5 billion statistic was widely reported and pops up easily during Google searches. This would seem to suggest that the government had spent $5 billion on healthcare.gov. But that’s not quite correct, experts told PolitiFact. Rather, these grants were designed to boost state efforts under the law -- not the federal site -- and paid for a wide variety of things other than websites, including helping insurers prepare to join the exchanges, offering assistance through telephone hotlines, establishing marketing and outreach efforts for potential beneficiaries, and hiring "navigators" who help beneficiaries obtain care. Both Gosselin and Jennifer Tolbert, the director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, agreed that it would be incorrect to simply assume that the $5 billion in health insurance exchange grants is tantamount to spending on the website in the way Trump expressed it. "It’s a different pot of money," Tolbert said. "It’s entirely separate from the money used to build the healthcare.gov website." Is it true that healthcare.gov 'still doesn’t work'? This part of Trump’s claim is easier to debunk. The proof is in the millions of Americans who have used the healthcare.gov website to obtain insurance coverage. According to the most recent data released by HHS, covering the open-enrollment period between November 2014 to February 2015, a total of 11.7 million Americans selected or were automatically enrolled in an insurance plan for 2015 using the online marketplaces. Of that, 8.84 million signed up through the federal marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- with the remainder signing up through state-run websites. (These figures are not limited to those who have already made their first premium payment.) So, clearly, the site is working. This isn’t to say the system is working 100 percent perfectly. "There are some remaining issues, especially for certain populations, such as immigrants and people for whom it's difficult to verify their identity or income using electronic data," Tolbert said. "This can include people who have not been in the country very long or who haven’t yet worked long enough to establish a work and income history." Still, the site appears to be functioning well in most cases. "Since the troublesome launch of healthcare.gov, (the government) has taken various actions to address the problems that impeded the initial use of the website and its supporting systems," the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ investigative arm, concluded in a March 2015 report. "Operationally, the website works for the most part," said Tolbert of Kaiser. "It’s in much better shape than it was during the first few months of open enrollment." Our ruling Trump said "the $5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work." But experts say that, using the most reasonable definitions, Trump overstates the amount of money spent to create and fix healthcare.gov, and his claim that the website isn’t working -- and never did -- is debunked by the fact that millions of Americans have signed up for insurance through the site, even if some more limited glitches remain. We rate the claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-14T15:00:00	2015-07-11	['None']
pomt-04151	"Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/28/ginny-burdick/are-there-cartridge-limits-large-game-bird-hunting/	The morning after a gunman killed two people and wounded a third at a Clackamas mall, state Sen. Ginny Burdick sent an email to colleagues saying that she planned to introduce legislation to limit the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The shooter, according to news reports, had been able to fire multiple rounds before his gun jammed. "Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting," wrote the Portland Democrat, a longtime advocate of gun control. "If we limit capacity for hunting animals, why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors?" Lobbyists for gun shop owners and firearms advocacy groups immediately pounced on her idea, saying that a prohibition on magazine capacity would not stop future shootings. They called Burdick’s proposal terrible, and opportunistic too. It’s not the job of PolitiFact Oregon to make a ruling on firearms regulations or policy. So we won’t. But we were curious about the numbers in Burdick’s statement and felt it appropriate to check: Does Oregon have a five-cartridge limit for large game hunters, and three for birds? We turned to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which licenses and regulates hunting and fishing on public and private land. Agency spokesman David Lane confirmed that the state senator is correct. There are limits, after which the hunter or shooter would need to reload cartridges or shots. "It is both for social and for biological reasons," Lane said. "The social being that when somebody takes aim at an animal, they use their shots judiciously … they’re not indiscriminately shooting with the possibility of hitting other animals. It’s a wounded loss issue." Now, what Burdick is proposing regarding magazines is not new. We had a federal weapons ban for a decade before it expired in 2004. Part of that law limited magazines to 10 rounds. Burdick told PolitiFact Oregon that a shooter can be taken down in the few seconds needed to reload. "It’s simple. It’s clear, and I think it would do some good," she said of her proposal. We could stop here, but we know you love information as much as we do. So we reached out to Kevin Starrett, as well. He is executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, a group that calls itself Oregon’s "only no compromise gun lobby." In a spirited interview, he batted the 10-round limit as arbitrary and said reloading magazines can be quick and easy. He said there are countless reasons why a person would want a 30-round magazine, including for sport shooting and to defend themselves and others when trouble breaks. Like someone trying to stop another school or shopping mall shooting. Would you want a limit on rounds then? he asked rhetorically. That’s a question for policy makers, not fact checkers. There are limits on how hunters shoot wildlife and game in Oregon, even if there are people who think that should have no bearing on the right to bear arms. Burdick’s statement is accurate. We rate her statement True.	None	Ginny Burdick	None	None	None	2012-12-28T00:00:00	2012-12-12	['None']
pomt-02808	"Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/27/allen-west/allen-west-more-black-black-murders-six-months-86-/	Some claims just catch the eye and Fox News contributor Allen West delivered one on his personal blog this week. "Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years," West, a former one-term congressman from Florida, wrote. We decided to see if the numbers back West up. West’s office directed us to an item from Kevin Jackson who blogs at Black Sphere. Jackson wrote about "Dixiecrats who hated black people, and who were responsible for the 3,446 deaths by the Klan in 86 years." For the moment, let’s assume that number is correct and compare it to the data on black homicide victims. Here we need to make an estimate so we’ll walk through our process. The Uniform Crime Reports gathered by the FBI show that 2,412 blacks died at the hand of another black person in 2012. That is the total for the year (not six months), but that number omits homicides where the race of the murderer is unknown. That is a huge data gap that somewhat complicates matters. The same FBI data, however, shows that most deaths occur within the same racial group. According to 2012 data, 91 percent of black deaths were caused by black criminals and 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. The total number of black homicides in 2012 was 6,454, according to the FBI. If the percentages hold, that would mean 5,874 homicides were committed by black criminals in all of 2012, or roughly 2,936 in a six-month span. Race of victim Total homicides Total-Race known White offender Black offender White 5,855 3,128 2,614 431 Black 6,454 2,648 193 2,412 Source: Uniform Crime Reports 2012 On its face, West’s claim is wrong but not by a huge amount, and in previous years, he would have been closer. The number of black homicides has fallen steadily over the past seven years. If we had run the numbers in 2006, he would have been about 100 deaths short of being correct. As it is, he is off by about 15 percent. But West’s claim has another error. The source West cites, Kevin Jackson, blames the Klan, but when Jackson emailed us with his source, an article on the conservative website Townhall.com, we found something a bit different. The article said "According to a Tuskegee Institute study, between the years 1882 and 1968, 3,446 blacks were lynched at the hands of whites." It did not name the Ku Klux Klan and talked only of lynching, not all homicides. The Tuskegee Institute -- now Tuskegee University -- started documenting lynching cases in the 1890s, according to Richard Sutch, an editor of the Historical Statistics of the United States. The work is generally considered accurate, as Sutch told NPR. "Many historians approached that data very skeptically," Sutch said. So scholars "went back and they literally read every newspaper in a chosen southern state, and said we're going to record every instance of lynchings that are reported in these newspapers, and then they marched state by state by state. "And what they found was not that the Tuskegee figures were wrong, but that the Tuskegee figures were essentially correct, and this amazed some people because the Tuskegee figures were showing that there were as many as 120, 150 lynchings per year in the southern United States. That's a lynching every week, more than once a week. It's just a steady drumbeat of violent oppression." We found copies of the Tuskegee work that confirms between 3,445 and 3,446 black documented lynchings (and another 1,300 lynchings of whites.) The archive, however, does not track KKK involvement. There is no question that blacks were at least twice as likely as whites to be the victims of lynchings, nor is there any doubt that the southern states accounted for most of these deaths. One study put the southern share at 90 percent. That doesn’t mean the Klan was behind them. On that point, the historical record is unclear. For starters, historian Michael Pfeifer at the City University of New York says the Klan had three phases. Pfeifer wrote a book on mob violence, Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1847-1947. "We simply don’t have good statistics on how many African Americans the Ku Klux Klan murdered in the 1860s and 1870s when the 'first' Klan was active," Pfeifer told PunditFact. "Evidence suggests, though, that the Reconstruction Klan murdered hundreds and perhaps several thousand blacks." That would seem to push the Klan death toll even higher, but Pfeifer says there’s reason to question the Klan’s role in the decades that followed. "The Klan was not active during most of the years of the ‘lynching frenzy’ of the late 19th and early 20th century South," Pfeifer said. "White lynchers in the Jim Crow-era from the 1890s through the 1910s carried on many of the same white supremacist values as the Ku Klux Klan had in the 1860s and 1870s, but it is not accurate to say that the Klan was involved in lynching in the 1890s and early 1900s." The Ku Klux Klan is a potent symbol of racism but the deadly violence against blacks, and, we should note, against more than 1,000 Jews, Catholics and other whites, came from a much wider group of Southern society in that period. Our ruling West said black people kill more blacks in six months than the KKK did in 86 years. Based on the evidence West provided, the claim essentially boils down to a comparison between the number of black-on-black homicides and the number of lynchings from 1882-1968. Using 2012 FBI data and information from the Tuskegee Institute -- neither of which is perfect -- West is somewhat off in his numbers. There were approximately 2,936 black-on-black homicides in six months of 2012 and 3,446 black lynchings from 1882-1896. But West also is wrong to ascribe the historical killing of blacks to the Ku Klux Klan, experts told us. There is no clear tally of Klan murders. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01606	The prosecutor who brought the indictment of Texas Gov. Rick Perry "has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/31/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-prosecutor-who-brought-rick-perry-i/	CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley consulted an interesting source to discuss Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s indictment on charges of abusing his power: former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a fellow Texas Republican who has been embroiled in a criminal election law violation for the past 12 years. Perry’s charges are nothing short of a political witch hunt, DeLay said, just like his own. Crowley pushed back on the suggestion. "The point is the prosecutor who brought the indictment is not a Democrat in any way anybody can see, and in fact has ties to Republicans," Crowley said. "That’s not true. Candy, that’s not true," DeLay said. "He has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats." "And he has ties to Republicans, yes?" Crowley asked. "Well yeah, but that has nothing to do with this," DeLay said. "What has to do with this is you take a law and you twist it so you can get the indictment. That is prosecutorial misconduct, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat." We wanted to look into the special prosecutor’s political connections, since Crowley and DeLay seemed to be on different pages. True colors The special prosecutor, who was not identified on air, is San Antonio lawyer Michael McCrum. A grand jury indicted Perry based on charges brought forth by McCrum that Perry misused his power, after Perry threatened to veto the budget of an Austin prosecutor if she did not resign after her DUI was caught on tape. Our partners at PolitiFact Texas laid out the legal history of the case against Perry, noting how the prosecutor, Lehmberg, recused herself from the case, and the public integrity unit she leads was uninvolved in picking McCrum. McCrum was selected by Judge Bert Richardson, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush. Richardson and McCrum both worked as prosecutors in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. McCrum has been tight-lipped in press accounts and did not respond to our request for an interview. Solomon Wisenberg, a former Texas prosecutor who worked with McCrum and considers him an "old friend," called the allegation against McCrum "pathetic on its face." "Mike would not be engaged in a political witch hunt. The idea that he’s politically motivated is ridiculous," Wisenberg said. "I don’t really consider him as a political person." The records show McCrum has steered clear of partisanship, even as he has attracted support from both sides of the aisle over 25 years. In 1989, McCrum served as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Texas, according to his resume. In 2000, McCrum opened his own private practice in San Antonio, focusing on criminal defense. In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated McCrum to be the U.S. attorney in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. His nomination was called a "consensus choice" by justice trade publication Main Justice, and Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison and House Democrats supported McCrum for the job. But McCrum withdrew his name in 2010, as the prolonged nomination process stalled his law practice, according to the Wall Street Journal. The White House did not provide comment. McCrum does not appear to vote in primaries and has donated to candidates of both parties. The Austin-American Statesman detailed McCrum’s political donations: In 2007, he contributed $300 to a Republican 4th Court of Appeals candidate, $500 to a former Democratic congressman, and $500 to Republican Bert Richardson’s unsuccessful re-election bid as state district judge. This record of bipartisanship is not unusual nor undesired in special prosecutors, said Wisenberg, who considers himself a conservative and opposes the prosecution against DeLay. He pointed out that special prosecutor Ken Starr, famous for investigating President Bill Clinton, also had ties to both parties, and DeLay did not oppose him. The ruling DeLay said it’s "not true" that McCrum isn’t a Democrat, saying "he has ties to Obama (and) he has ties to Democrats." McCrum has loose ties to Obama and Democrats -- and he has Republican ones, too. News reports and McCrum’s political record show he is not expressly partisan, having contributing a few hundred dollars to a few people on both sides of the aisle. There's a sliver of truth in DeLay's statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12029	Democrats "setup" and "manipulated" the political violence in Charlottesville	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/sep/15/dana-rohrabacher/rohrabacher-repeats-bogus-claim-democrats-orchestr/	California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, repeated a debunked conspiracy theory this week that top Democrats "setup" and "manipulated" the political violence at last month’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. In August, PolitiFact national took a deep look at this inflammatory claim, which started with controversial commentator Alex Jones of Infowars.com. Jones said emails show Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and billionaire investor George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to "control" and keep people "desperate." After an exhaustive examination of relevant leaked emails, it found no evidence of Jones’ theory and rated it Pants On Fire, the most severe false rating. See the full fact check here. The violence in Charlottesville culminated with the death of Heather D. Heyer, 32. She was killed and at least 19 others were injured after the driver of a Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally. Authorities charged a 20-year-old man from Ohio, James A. Fields Jr., with second-degree murder. Fields had marched in the white nationalist rally. Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman and former speechwriter for President Reagan, has garnered controversy in recent months for his pro-Russia stance amid intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election. Democrats have targeted his congressional seat in 2018. Rohrabacher’s claim Below are Rohrabacher’s conspiracy theory comments made in a San Francisco Chronicle article on Sept. 14, 2017. The article says Rohrabacher is "deep" into the theory that "Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va." Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former "Hillary and Bernie supporter" got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there. "It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors," Rohrabacher said. "It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation" and to "put our president on the spot." PolitiFact California asked Rohrabacher’s spokesman Ken Grubbs for any evidence supporting the claim. Grubbs told us the congressman saw a FoxNews.com article in which Jason Kessler, the organizer of the "Unite the Right" white nationalist rally says "he voted for Obama and was involved in Occupy Wall Street." The article says Kessler voted for Obama in 2008 and "once attended an Occupy Wall Street rally in Charlottesville." It offers no evidence -- nor does it even discuss the idea -- that Democrats "setup" a group of "Civil War re-enactors" and manipulated a confrontation, as Rohrabacher claims. PolitiFact’s conclusion PolitiFact national found Jones’ comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats. It found no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out. PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire. PolitiFact California, after examining the same facts, found California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, doubled-down on the same bogus claim. We rate his claim Pants On Fire, as well.

pomt-08984	"Since February 2009, our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-has-presided-over-private-/	As the House Republican leader, Ohio’s John Boehner seizes every opportunity to counter any message that President Barack Obama attempts to convey. When Obama touted his efforts to resuscitate the economy during a July 8, 2010, appearance in Kansas City, Missouri, Boehner posted his counterpoint titled "Where are the Jobs, Mr. President?" in a column on the conservative TownHall website. And, on the day Obama was scheduled to speak at an electric battery plant in Holland, Mich., he hit back again with an op-ed in the Detroit News July 15. "Since February 2009 (when the economic stimulus bill was passed) our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs," Boehner wrote. With the administration simultaneously putting a more favorable spin on its record of job creation, we thought it would be worth checking each side's facts. Boehner’s office said his column was based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases monthly figures on nationwide employment and unemployment. We'll take Boehner's two claims in order. • Has the economy lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs since February 2009? Yes. First we should note that Boehner was specific about the statistic he was using -- private-sector jobs, not total jobs. So we’ve used that statistic to judge his claim. According to BLS, 110,961,000 Americans were employed in the private sector in January 2009. By June 2010 -- the most recent month available -- that number had fallen to 107,700,000. That's a drop of 3.26 million jobs -- or "roughly 3 million" in Boehner’s words. By beginning his count in January 2009 -- even though the bill was passed in February 2009 -- Boehner’s number takes into account all the job losses from February. You could instead start counting in February 2009; in that case, the number of jobs lost would be somewhat further from Boehner’s claim -- 2.55 million jobs. It’s worth noting that the biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 726,000 and 753,000 jobs disappeared. The losses slowed down into last summer and fall, and gains were recorded for the first five months of 2010. • Has the federal government payroll grown by more than 400,000 jobs since February 2009? Yes -- but with a major asterisk. In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By June 2010, there were 3,208,000 -- an increase of 405,000. Here's the asterisk: The June numbers are inflated by temporary Census workers whose jobs are slated to end in a matter of months. By way of comparison, we used BLS estimates of the temporary Census work force to adjust the monthly employment figures. Doing so drops the January 2009 federal employment level by 5,000 to 2,798,000, while the June 2010 level drops by 339,000 to 2,869,000. That reduces the federal employment increase to 71,000 -- far less than the 400,000 Boehner cited. While technically accurate, Boehner's statistics are misleading because the government workforce is inflated by the temporary census workers. For this reason, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03304	"I was banned from talking about" Bill Ayers during the 2008 presidential campaign.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/30/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-gop-banned-mention-ayers-08/	Sarah Palin still speaks bitterly about 2008. The former Republican vice-presidential candidate spoke on Fox News recently about current matters such as the raid on the American diplomatic outpost in Libya and the IRS vetting of nonprofit applications when she turned back to the 2008 presidential campaign. "I was banned from talking about Jeremiah Wright and Obama's friend, Bill Ayers, the character that he befriended and kicked off his political campaign in the guy's living room," Palin said. "Couldn't talk about that." Palin pointed a finger at who she thought was to blame. "I was not allowed to talk about things like that because those elitists, those who are the brainiacs in the GOP machine running John McCain's campaign at the time, said that the media would eat us alive if we brought up these things." For those who might not remember, Bill Ayers lived in Barack Obama’s Chicago neighborhood and was an early supporter when Obama first ran for the Illinois state Senate. What made Ayers interesting in 2008 was that in the 1960s, he was one of the founders of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings at a New York City police station, the Capitol, and the Pentagon. There were no injuries. Obama’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, brought up Ayers during the primary, but the issue failed to gain much traction. When Palin said she was banned from mentioning Ayers, we at PolitiFact were a bit surprised. That’s because we fact-checked her claim about Ayers in early October 2008. We had video of Palin talking about him at a rally in Clearwater, Fla. Three days before, the New York Times had carried a front-page story about Obama and Ayers; Palin mentioned the story. "He was a domestic terrorist," Palin said. "And part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow. "And there’s even more to the story," Palin said. "Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top adviser said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago." Back then, we rated Palin’s statement Mostly True. Was this a case of Palin going rogue? Not likely. About a week later, McCain himself raised the shadow of Ayers briefly during his final debate with Obama. "Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship," McCain said. The final proof that none of this was off-the-cuff and in fact was coming from those "braniacs in the GOP machine" as Palin put it, came in the form of robo-calls. On Oct. 18, 2008, the Washington Post reported that voters in Virginia, Ohio and Florida were picking up the phone and hearing this from the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee. "Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans." It’s possible that Palin had wanted to talk about Ayers earlier in the campaign. We reached out to her Political Action Committee for clarification but did not hear back. But her words on Fox News gave no indication of anything but a ban. Our ruling Palin said she was banned from talking about one-time domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, but the record shows the complete and utter opposite. Not only did Palin talk about Ayers, so did the man at the top of the ticket, as did a recorded message from the RNC that went out to voters in battleground states. When the public record and the candidate’s own words speak so strongly against a statement, we have little choice. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13427	Says "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/20/americans-prosperity-florida/us-rep-patrick-murphys-policies-will-raise-utility/	An anti-regulation group is accusing U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of wanting to use the Senate to adopt policies that would raise the cost of just about everything, starting with your utility bills. "Vote against Patrick Murphy," reads a mailer we received Sept. 12, 2016, from Americans for Prosperity Florida. "We can’t afford his ‘Pay More’ agenda." The flier cautions electricity and grocery prices will go up as wages go down with Murphy in the Senate. "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!" the flier warns. The group behind the attack is the Florida affiliate of the main political committee for the anti-tax industrialists and billionaires Charles and David Koch. We wondered just what Murphy would be planning that would make utility costs go up $500 annually. There’s a tenuous link between what the Jupiter Democrat supports and the future of energy costs, but it’s not nearly as charged as AFP claimed. Shockingly high The "Pay More" Murphy nickname, which is being used by AFP in other attacks, is borne of Murphy’s support for President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The plan was a proposed environmental rule announced by the White House in August 2015. The new regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction. We’ll get back to why this is important in a moment.) The idea was largely to promote cleaner sources of energy than coal-fired power plants, fostering more renewable energy while pushing utilities to upgrade existing infrastructure. But the U.S. Supreme Court put the rule on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, in the face of opposition from corporations and industry groups. Murphy has publicly supported its implementation, signing an amicus brief supporting the plan and calling the court’s decision to block the rule "misguided." But as a congressman, Murphy has no direct say over the fate of the final rule, which was created by the Obama administration and would be enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency. So what’s this about surging utility prices? Critics of the Clean Power Plan say it would be expensive for utilities to comply with the new emissions standards, and those costs would be passed on to consumers. An array of reports that examine just how much customers may end up paying resulted. AFP’s mailer points to one specific study from a firm called Energy Ventures Analysis. That study said that by 2020, the average Floridian’s annual gas and electric bills could potentially go up by a combined $464 from what they were in 2012. AFP rounded that up to $500, and made the connection that since Murphy supports the plan, he wants your bill to go up. That’s already a stretch, since Murphy has little to do with the Clean Power Plan. But there’s much more to all these analyses, which make a wide range of assertions about how the plan could affect utility customers. Energy Ventures Analysis’ estimate is near the top end of the scale, but the firm told us it’s already outdated. The analysis was done on the proposed Clean Power Plan from 2014 we mentioned before. Revisions have been made to the rule since the initial proposal. A lot has happened in the energy sector since then. Gas prices have dropped, utility rates have changed, electricity demand has largely decreased, and solar and wind energy is in wider use today, among other factors. "If they (AFP) are linking it to our website, that’s from some time ago, during the original proposal, and that has now changed," Energy Ventures Analysis principal Thomas Hewson told PolitiFact Florida. Because of all the factors involved, predictions on how the plan would affect utility rates are in constant flux, he said. Hewson added that the company had since revisited the Clean Power Plan in a 2015 report for the National Mining Association. Energy Ventures Analysis hasn’t re-evaluated utility rates on a state-by-state basis, Hewson said. The National Mining Association study was about wholesale electricity prices, although it did say those would go up in Florida. Their estimates are on the high end of how much the Clean Power Plan would cost and have been attacked by groups that favor renewable energy. The Natural Resources Defense Council called Energy Ventures Analysis, which has some ties to the coal industry, a "fossil industry mouthpiece." Few other studies look at the specific impact on individual states, although most say the plan’s results largely depend on how utilities in individual states supply their power and charge their customers. Those decisions are usually made on a state level, and can drastically change how the Clean Power Plan’s standards come into play. Some of the rosier reports are the complete opposite of the Energy Venture Analysis study. The group Advanced Energy Economy predicted there will be no real change to energy prices at all in Florida. The EPA’s own analysis predicted that the plan will eventually result in electricity prices going down, although most groups predict a modest increase. "Our modeling shows average annual changes in Florida retail prices of less than 1 percent between the baseline and the policy," said Dallas Burtraw, senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy. "Our results are consistent with those from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Nicholas Institute (at Duke University)." Our ruling Americans For Prosperity Florida said, "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!" The group is attempting to link Murphy’s support for the Clean Power Plan to the possibility of higher gas and electric rates for consumers. But Murphy has no control over the rule, and the study AFP cited is disputed and outdated. Economic impacts of the Clean Power Plan, which is currently on hold by order of the U.S. Supreme Court, are a hotly debated subject with no clear result.

pomt-14300	"I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-meet-press-wall-street-atta/	As challenger Bernie Sanders continues to hit Hillary Clinton over her Wall Street ties in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton noted that she and the financial sector are more enemies than friends. On Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd played Clinton a clip of Sanders joking on the campaign trail that her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs must have been written in Shakespearean prose. "I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against," she responded. "So I find this, again, a kind of, you know, circuitous way to raise questions about my record." Is it true that Clinton is the sole target of Wall Street this cycle? The Clinton campaign referred us to our own fact-check of an attack ad sponsored by the hedge fund-backed conservative super PAC, Future45. While this supports Clinton’s point that the financial sector has spent money against her, it doesn’t back the notion that Wall Street has only attacked her. We consulted with Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics and Nancy Watzman of the Political TV Ad Archive. Their data shows that Clinton’s statement is inaccurate. The trouble with her claim is Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers aren’t a monolithic group. Some have even expressed their support for Clinton and Sanders, and their donations are dispersed among Republican and Democratic groups. While Clinton has been the target of more attack ads than Sanders, more money from the financial industry has been spent hitting each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the candidate subject to the most Wall Street-funded hits is actually Donald Trump. Ad blitzes against Clinton primarily come from three conservative groups. In addition to the ad we fact-checked, Future45 has run six others against Clinton. Wall Street donations account for half of the group’s funding. American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, has sponsored eight anti-Clinton ads and the Mitt Romney-affiliated group America Rising has released 10 ads attacking her, two of which also target Sanders. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the financial industry is responsible for roughly half of the Rove’s group total donations and two-thirds of the Romney group’s. Future45 has also sponsored one ad against Sanders. ESA Fund, a conservative super PAC, is 56 percent funded by the financial sector and has aired one anti-Sanders ad in Iowa. And last summer, Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC, went after Sanders’ record on guns. A fifth of its donations come from Wall Street. Clinton’s own affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, took a third of its donations from the financial sector. It has aired 11 ads against Trump and spent more than $61,000 targeting the Republican frontrunner. (Update: Priorities USA Action said that the 11 videos it produced only appeared on the Internet.) But that pales in comparison to the amount of money and airtime Trump’s fellow Republicans have devoted to slamming him. Conservative groups have spent more than $28 million opposing Trump. Our Principles PAC, launched by a former Romney aide, has spent more than $14 million against Trump and sponsored at least 27 ads attacking him. A third of the group’s funding comes from Wall Street. Marco Rubio’s affiliated super PAC, Conservative Solutions, aired seven anti-Trump ads and received about 40 percent of its funding from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of 11 attack ads by Ted Cruz’s Keep the Promise I super PAC (hedge fund manager Robert Mercer was responsible for $11 million of its $11,036,250 total donations), and 12 by Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise, which is half funded by Wall Street. Here are the 10 groups with the largest share of Wall Street donations and their opposition opponents, compiled with help from Maguire and Watzman: Name Wall Street support* Opposition ads** Keep the Promise I 99.7 percent 11 against Rubio, 7 against Trump, 6 against Clinton America Rising 68.2 percent 10 against Clinton, 2 against Sanders Citizen Super PAC 61.0 percent 1 against Trump Future45 58.0 percent 7 against Clinton, 1 against Sanders America Leads 53.1 percent 2 against Clinton, 1 against John Kasich American Crossroads 53.1 percent 8 against Clinton, 1 against Trump Right to Rise 51.1 percent 12 against Rubio, 9 against Trump, 5 against Kasich, 4 against Clinton, 2 against Cruz, 2 against Chris Christie Patriot Voices PAC 47 percent 1 against Clinton New Day for America 46 percent 10 against Trump, 5 against Cruz, 4 against Clinton, 4 against Bush, 3 against Rubio, 2 against Christie Conservative Solutions PAC 39.8 percent 9 against Bush, 8 against Trump, 7 against Ted Cruz, 6 against Clinton, 2 against Christie, 1 against Kasich * Includes financial, insurance and real estate donations. ** Many of these ads target multiple candidates at once, so the counts overlap. Some of these ads are clearly ads attacking a candidate, while others compare one candidate favorably against others. As you’ll notice, Sanders — who rails against Wall Street daily — has been largely spared by the attack ads. That’s because the finance sector takes Clinton seriously and Sanders less so, according to John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote the book In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaigns. "Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination," Geer said. "Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?" Our ruling Clinton said, "I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against." Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are running ads against Clinton. But to say she’s the only one being attacked by people associated with the financial sector is preposterous. The financial sector has contributed to both sides of the aisles, including to Clinton’s own campaign. Groups backed by Wall Street have run attack ads against virtually every candidate.

pomt-01349	Rick Scott says he supported in-state tuition for Dreamers while Charlie Crist was against it.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-supported-state-tuition-dreamer/	Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist argued about immigration reform during their third and final debate. Scott defended his record in the debate, arguing that he had helped out a certain group of illegal immigrants afford college -- "dreamers." "Dreamers," named for the as-yet unpassed DREAM Act, are illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. After Congress failed to pass the bill, President Barack Obama in June 2012 announced a two-year moratorium on the deportation of some children who had been brought to United States illegally by their parents. "Let’s look at what I did do that Charlie said was the wrong thing to do," Scott said. "I said if you grow up in our state, you should get the same in-state tuition as your peers. Charlie said when the Legislature didn’t pass it before, that they did the right thing. So Charlie was against that, but we did the right thing, because whatever country you grew up in, if you live in Florida you ought to have the same right (to) in-state tuition as your peers." However, Scott is omitting part of his own record -- and part of Crist’s record -- about "dreamers" and in-state tuition. In-state tuition battles In April 2014 when it appeared that the Legislature under Gov. Scott would approve in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants, the Republican Party of Florida said in an email that "In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." (That was back when Crist was a Republican; he’s now running as a Democrat to win back his old office.) As support for its claim, the state party's email cited a 2006 Miami Herald article about Crist, who was then serving as state attorney general. The Herald article said that "Crist, like (his GOP rival for governor CFO Tom) Gallagher, said state lawmakers did the ‘right thing’ earlier this year when they rejected a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates as Florida residents. But Crist, also like Gallagher, said he supported a proposal to let illegal immigrants get drivers' licenses. It didn't pass two years ago, despite support from Gov. Jeb Bush." That year, a proposal to give certain Florida residents who were illegal immigrants in-state tuition divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from then-Senate President Tom Lee. Ultimately, the proposal failed. (Bush had said he supported giving in-state tuition to those children if they’d lived in Florida at least two years, but he added that he felt it wasn’t the year to deal with it, so the controversial provision was removed from an education bill.) When we looked at this question previously, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida didn’t point to any additional statements by Crist as support for the claim. So we searched for other statements by Crist about giving in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants. We found little else prior to his current campaign as a Democrat. We did not locate any bills to grant in-state tuition to "dreamers" that reached Crist’s desk during his tenure as governor 2007 and 2011. We did find an August 2006 article in the Tampa Bay Times that included a one-word "yes" or "no" answer from gubernatorial candidates to several questions, including: "Should we allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at our universities?" The answer for Crist? "No." That provides support for Scott’s claim. However, both candidates have had a zigzagging approach to the issue, which complicates the neat story line Scott tried to communicate in the CNN debate. Scott omitted that during the 2014 campaign, Crist has supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. "We must immediately pass legislation that allows the children of undocumented parents to attend Florida colleges and universities at in-state tuition levels," Crist wrote on the immigration page of his campaign website. "It simply isn’t fair to punish children of undocumented parents." At the same time, Scott omitted that he changed his opinion about the issue, earning him a Full Flop from PolitiFact Florida. In September 2011, Scott told the conservative website Newsmax that "with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, I completely oppose it." That changed by 2014 when, after a decade of failed attempts, it appeared that the Legislature might pass the bill. In mid-April, Scott made his support clear. In a joint statement with former Republican Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, Scott said, "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move S.B. 1400 forward." Our ruling Scott said he supported in-state tuition for "dreamers" while Crist was against it. There’s some truth to that claim, but the reality is that both candidates have flip-flopped on the issue, manking such a clear-cut comparison problematic. In reality, Scott was against in-state tuition for "dreamers" in 2011 but came for it in 2014. Crist opposed it in 2006 but voiced his support during this current campaign. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-21T22:04:55	2014-10-21	['Charlie_Crist']

pomt-07224	Says "for the first time ever," Texas lawmakers are not funding student population growth.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/03/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-not-funding-enrollment-grow/	The Democratic state senator whose filibuster kept lawmakers from advancing a plan determining how much schools will get in state aid in 2012-13 told colleagues she was standing up for history. Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth said the House-approved plan "sets a new normal that says for the first time, we are not going to fund student population growth," according to a news article posted online May 30 by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Davis opened her filibuster by saying the plan "will mean the very first time ever in the history of funding public schools that we are not going to fund student population growth. Let me say that again. For the first time ever, we are not funding student population growth." Got it. But did she get the lack of precedent right? First, some background: The 2012-13 state budget already sent to Gov. Rick Perry allocates $4 billion less in state funds than districts would get under existing funding formulas to accommodate enrollment growth . According to a Legislative Budget Board summary, that reduced "funding level assumes passage of legislation that adjusts school district and charter school payments to the level of available appropriations." Put another way, the budget is premised on lawmakers divvying up per-student aid in amounts that overlook the state’s expectation that 170,000 additional students will be enrolled by the end of August 2013, according to a February background report on state budget issues by the House Research Organization. Davis talked the share-the-pain proposal to death May 29, the day before the regular legislative session ended. Perry immediately called a 30-day special session on topics including the school aid changes. And how did Davis conclude this is the first time enrollment increases aren’t covered? Earlier this year, the senator asked budget board staff to look into "whether or not the state has historically funded enrollment growth in the Foundation School Program," the state’s primary source for allocating money to Texas schools in an equitable manner. Since 1984-85, the April 29 memo from LBB analyst Jennifer Schiess to Davis says, "the state has appropriated sufficient funds to fully fund state obligations, including enrollment growth, under the school finance formulas in effect at the time of appropriation." Davis’s office publicized the memo on May 3. The memo also states: "This analysis should not be interpreted to imply that at any point prior to the 1984-85 biennium the state failed to meet this obligation. Data required for analysis going further back is simply not readily available for a timely response." Anthony Spangler, Davis’s spokesman, told us that the staff did not follow up with deeper historical analysis. Separately, experts say school funding has depended in part on student enrollment counts at least since passage of the landmark Gilmer-Aikin laws of 1949 modernizing the school system and creating the Foundation School Program. Even before then--and continuing in 2012-13--the state sent an allotment of money per student from income earned on the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund. The 2010-11 Available School Fund allotment is $455 per student, according to the Texas Education Agency. Then again, a primer on Texas school finance revised by the Texas Association of School Boards in 1996 says that in earlier years--even back to 1854--state education aid was distributed on a "per-capita" basis. Meaning? Austin lobbyist Dan Casey, its author, told us in an interview that funding was connected to pupil counts. He pointed out that a 1925 book, "The Development of Education in Texas," states that until lawmakers in 1903 offered more money for "manual training" classes, "Texas had always adhered to the policy of distributing state educational funds on the per capita basis." Our sense? For the first time in more than 25 years, the budget approved by legislators does not fully account for enrollment increases. Prior to 1984, information to prove or disprove Davis' statement is more fuzzy, but it's clear that Texas has allocated education funding on a per-student basis since the 19th century.

pomt-02221	"In the last couple of days, notices were sent (by officials in Ukraine) to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/18/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-jews-eastern-ukraine-told-register/	Editor’s note: After receiving reader feedback on this rating, we expanded the "our ruling" section on April 21, 2014, to more fully explain our reasoning for the rating. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke from Geneva on Thursday with appalling news about religious intolerance in the Ukrainian-Russian crisis. "In the last couple of days, notices were sent to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews," Kerry said. "In the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque." On Facebook and Twitter, the public feared the history of the Holocaust was repeating itself. At PolitiFact, we’re used to finding inconsistencies in media coverage of Ukraine, so we wanted to take a closer look at the situation. We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register. The story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk’s government building. Almost two weeks later, USA Today reported, "Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine." Citing an Israeli news article, USA Today reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to "register" with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they’d be forced out of the country. On the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry's office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks. Almost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren’t really coming from any kind of authority. The separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People’s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it. Reporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered. PolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after the story and shared his reporting with us. "You walk down the street with a beard and kippah," said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. "And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk." Donetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier’s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like Vox and the New Republic have also questioned its validity. A New York Times report from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday. Both sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict. An April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don’t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders. The pro-Russia rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported. Our ruling Kerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn’t seem to have been issued by any authority. No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets’ legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren’t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering. Kerry’s comments included none of that context. It’s possible Kerry’s comments were drawn from what he considered to be legitimate news reports, but those earlier reports didn’t include the full picture of what was going on. Anyone listening to Kerry’s remarks would think that the requests were coming from some sort of authority on the ground that had the means to enforce its request, and that’s not the case. Kerry’s remarks did not accurately convey the situation on the ground in Ukraine. For these reasons, we rate his statement False.

pomt-10868	"I'm the first person who really took up the issue of the war. Four years ago I said that there was no proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and, actually... did an analysis which disproved the cause for the war."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/28/dennis-kucinich/kucinich-opposed-the-war-early-but-first/	On the topic of the conflict in Iraq, Dennis Kucinich holds the high ground among his Democratic rivals who oppose the war with his 2002 vote against authorizing military action against Saddam Hussein. Of the Democrats running for president who were in Congress at the time, Kucinich is the only one who voted against the war resolution. But to earn the crown as the "first" -- whatever that means, and Kucinich's campaign wouldn't clarify -- is a more nuanced privilege. Was he the first person? No. Was he the first Congressman? No. Was he the first presidential candidate? No (Correct answer: Republican Ron Paul). Was he the first Democratic presidential candidate? Yes. According to the Congressional Record, the Cleveland Democrat first spoke against the war in the context of Iraq in remarks made March 20, 2002. Kucinich advocated peace and warned against the slippery slope of nuclear weapons. (Paul spoke out on Nov. 29, 2001 saying "the argument that (Saddam) Hussein is producing weapons of mass destruction is the reddest of all herrings," according to the Congressional Record.) But Kucinich earned the title as the leader of the anti-war movement in late August 2002 after holding a widely reported Capitol Hill briefing where he called for more "discussion about why we should not go to war," according to an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He then began building a congressional coalition against the war. "Unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is unjustified, unwarranted and illegal," said Kucinich, according to The Washington Times on Sept. 20, 2002. "The administration has failed to make the case that Iraq poses an imminent or immediate threat to the United States." Kucinich solidified his position as the opposition headmaster Oct. 3, 2002, when he took the floor of the House to present an eight-page, point-by-point analysis refuting the joint resolution on Iraq in the days before the vote.

pomt-09416	"As Florida's CFO, I shut down Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine and other victims of this con man."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/18/alex-sink/sink-claims-she-refunded-12-million-insurance-frau/	CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, is appealing to Florida’s elderly by putting the spotlight on a two-year crackdown on an investment scam and refund to a Delray Beach woman. Sink wrote about the episode in a fundraising e-mail to supporters. "As Florida’s CFO, I shut down [Larry] Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine [Passinissi] and other victims of this con man,'' she said in an e-mail addressed to "Dear Friend." It said: "Please contribute $25, or whatever you can, right now to help me keep fighting for Floridians like Josephine." Sink’s e-mail contains several claims, but we're focusing on two: Whether the CFO's office shut down the investment "scam" and whether it returned $1.2 million to Passinissi and the others. Sink has been claiming credit for the crackdown and using it to promote her Safeguard Our Seniors Task Force since her office put out a release on Sept. 28, 2009, under the headline "CFO Sink Returns $1.2 Million to Delray Beach Seniors Scammed out of Life Savings." The Miami Herald wrote a brief item about the episode at the time that called it insurance fraud and likewise characterized it as Sink returning $1.2 million to four Delray Beach seniors "after they were allegedly misled into buying equity indexed deferred annuities." It said Larry Yale Krakow, who sold the investment products to them, was suspended from selling insurance and was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine. A deferred annuity is an investment product packaged with an insurance policy, in which an insurance company guarantees an income stream to the investor starting at a specified future date in return for a lump sum or series of payments. But the products are usually considered inappropriate for seniors because they tie up needed income. The Herald noted that annuities scams involving seniors have been a growing problem in Florida. And that the Department of Financial Services launched 267 senior annuity investigations in the fiscal year ending June 30. Kevin Cate, Sink's press secretary at the Florida Department of Financial Services, provided us with links to the Florida statutes that illustrate the CFO's authority on the topic. The law also notes the rights of victims not to be identified. He faxed us the 2008 and 2009 settlement agreements that resolved four citizens' complaints against the Allianz insurance company, which Krakow purportedly represented, brought by the Florida Department of Insurance Division of Legal Services. Each had the seniors' identities redacted, but a summary page showed the range in reimbursements. The smallest was $19,319.27, while the largest was for one investor with nine annuities valued at $932,837.09. His summary page also noted that, with subsequent settlements, the figure was more than $1.5 million, which was slightly higher than Sink had said. Sink’s office handled the case through its Division of Insurance Fraud, which is part of the Department of Financial Services. Reached by telephone, Passinissi confirmed the refund. She said her share of it was $270,000. A former owner of a private employment agency, Passinissi, 74, said she tried to get her money out of the annuity in 2008 by contacting the insurance firm itself -- to no avail. She mentioned her plight to a banker she knew, who sent her to Sink. Passinissi said she called and then wrote Sink directly -- and enclosed documents to illustrate the problem. Passinissi is happy to see Sink take credit. "She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Don’t worry we’ll get to the bottom of it.' After that she sent a person to get a deposition from me, to get the facts," Passinissi said. As CFO, Sink oversees the Department of Financial Services, which investigated the complaints and arranged for people such as Passinissi to recoup their money. Sink's claim actually understates the amount that was recouped (she said $1.2 million when it ultimately totaled $1.5 million), but we find she can rightly claim credit for the department's work. So we rate Sink’s claim to be True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-03-18T14:11:29	2010-03-13	['Kraków']
pomt-08368	Says Peter DeFazio votes with Nancy Pelosi 86 percent of the time.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/26/concerned-taxpayers-america/concerned-taxpayers-claim-peter-defazio-votes-nanc/	Concerned Taxpayers of America is the lofty and nicely generic name of an independent expenditure group funded by two very rich people on the East Coast. The group has spent at least $300,000 for several TV ads attacking U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio and backing Republican challenger Art Robinson. The latest commercial is as cute as the cartoon kids on South Park. There’s DeFazio behind the wheel of his 1963 Dodge Dart as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in the passenger seat, exhorts him, "Turn left! Turn left!" and "Spend more! Tax more! Faster!" Again, very catchy -- and geared to generate maximum outrage in a congressional district that disdains Washington, D.C. But we were curious about the ad’s claims. Has DeFazio voted with Pelosi 86 percent of the time? Does he take directions, besides driving, from the speaker from San Francisco? PolitiFact Oregon always thought DeFazio, the state’s longest serving sitting congressman, really wasn’t big on party politics or groupthink. Democrats in other states have been hit with the same attack as Republicans try to capitalize on Pelosi’s unpopularity in swing districts. The attacks usually cite as evidence The Washington Post votes database or, as in this case, something called the National Republican Trust PAC. Go there and you’ll find "The Pelosi Index," which rates House members on how closely they hew to the speaker. There’s the Statue of Liberty at one end and Pelosi on the other, and anything above 75 percent is "tyranny." DeFazio’s counsel asked KEZI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Eugene, to stop airing the ads, arguing that the website doesn’t compare all votes between DeFazio and Pelosi. The letter read, in part: "Instead, it fabricates a percentage based on only 14 votes that it cherry-picked, out of hundreds cast by Rep. DeFazio. And it ignores the fact that, of those 14 selectively chosen votes, Speaker Pelosi did not even cast a vote on 3 of them." (The station briefly stopped airing the ad to conduct a review, but has since resumed.) Pelosi, as speaker, doesn’t vote much. She’s cast 94 votes in the 111th Congress, which opened January 2009. But regular member DeFazio does, and we thought it useful to check how he’s rated by the The Washington Post database. Here’s what we found: DeFazio has cast 1,508 votes this session, voting with the majority of his party 96.6 percent of the time. The average for Democrats is 92.2 percent, so DeFazio is higher than the average, although lower than the other Oregon House Democrats. Earl Blumenauer and David Wu are at 97 percent, and Kurt Schrader is at 97.1 percent. So the number is high, but remember, these tally all votes cast, even the mundane ones. And The Post database shows the percentage a lawmaker "agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members," not just Pelosi. Since PolitiFact Oregon has nothing but time, we ran our own comparison between DeFazio and Pelosi. We eliminated 24 of Pelosi’s 94 votes because they were roll calls or resolutions that both parties agreed on. That left 70 substantive votes, of which DeFazio disagreed on six. Percentage-wise, that’s 91 percent. So on both counts, DeFazio rates higher than the 86 percent figure cited in the commercial. But we needed to flesh out the disagreements -- because they are blowout disagreements -- and this gets to the larger question of whether DeFazio is indeed someone who’s just following Pelosi’s lead. DeFazio voted against a signature cap and trade climate bill pushed by Pelosi last year, saying it had too much carrot and not enough stick. And he was one of only seven House Democrats to vote against President Barack Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package in February 2009. Passage of the stimulus was one of the Democrats’ signature initiatives. DeFazio did vote for Obama’s health care plan, but only after finagling better Medicare reimbursement rates for Oregon. Defying party leadership, he opposed the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street in 2008 and voted against it in a follow-up bill in 2009. Most recently, he and a dozen House Democrats joined Republicans in voting against a business-lending act that he deemed too expensive for taxpayers without lending enough help to small businesses. In short, not a very good Pelosi lapdog. Finally, we checked National Journal’s annual rankings from 2009, just for fun. DeFazio had a 61.5 percent liberal voting record and a 38.5 percent conservative voting record. Again, he was the least liberal of Oregon’s four House Democrats. To summarize, DeFazio has diverged sharply from Democratic leadership on key issues, especially economic ones. To imply that Pelosi is really in the driver’s seat when it comes to DeFazio’s votes is false. But it’s true that agrees with his party most of the time. We rate this Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-11494	"Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/feb/27/tim-ryan/after-parkland-shooting-ohio-congressman-said-70-8/	Some lawmakers are pushing for changes to gun laws including universal background checks following the fatal mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who drew attention after the Las Vegas massacre in October when he announced he would donate to gun control groups roughly $20,000 that the NRA’s political action committee gave him over the years. Ryan received an A grade from the NRA earlier in his career but later broke from the group. "Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check," Ryan said on CNN’s New Day Feb. 20, days after the shooting in South Florida that left 17 people dead. Polls have consistently showed broad support for a universal background check. National polls in 2016 and 2017 found between 84 and 94 percent of respondents supported background checks. But what about NRA members? What NRA members say about a universal background check While federal law requires background checks for sales from federally licensed dealers, unlicensed, private sellers are not required to conduct background checks — although states can create their own laws. Some gun control advocates want a nationwide standard to close loopholes. Ryan’s spokesman cited a 2015 poll of gun owners by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, conducted on behalf of two liberal groups: MoveOn.org Civic Action and the Center for American Progress. The poll surveyed 816 gun owners. According to the poll, 24 percent of the respondents identified themselves as NRA members. That means of the total of 816 gun owners, 196 self-identified as NRA members. Of all 816 gun owners, 83 percent responded that they supported a criminal background check for everyone who wants to buy a firearm. For the 196 who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. The margin of error for the NRA sample is 7 percentage points, said Jim Williams, an analyst for Public Policy Polling. "Given that the support for background checks among the NRA subsample is so overwhelming, it’s still far outside the margin of error for that subset," he said. We also found an additional poll that included NRA members taking a position on background checks. Pew Research Center conducted a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April 2017. The unweighted sample size in the survey included 262 respondents who identified as NRA members. The poll included a breakdown of replies from Republican gun owners who were and were not members of the NRA. The poll showed based on weighted data that 52 percent of NRA members favored background checks for private gun sales compared with 75 percent of nonmembers. PolitiFact has previously looked at polls as far back as 2013 that found majority support among NRA members or households where someone was a member of the NRA. For example, a poll done by Johns Hopkins University and conducted online among 2,703 adults — including 169 respondents who identified as a member of the NRA — through GfK Knowledge Networks. The poll found that 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was 7 percentage points.) After our 2015 fact-check of a claim related to that poll, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker contacted PolitiFact contending that the poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. It is common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group. The NRA didn’t respond for this fact-check. We also previously looked at a poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in 2012 commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s group. That poll showed 74 percent of respondents who identified as NRA members favored background checks. The poll included 945 gun owners, half of whom said they were current or lapsed members of the NRA and the others non-NRA members. What polling experts said about the polls Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll and a professor at the University of Arkansas, said that the polls do not reflect a large enough sample of NRA members to reach the conclusion that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support background checks. While it’s tempting to take a national sample and try to drill down, when looking at a smaller subset such as NRA members "you end up generalizing and that can be dangerous," she said. Ideally, a poll would include somewhere between 750 and 1,000 NRA members, she said. "You would need an independent polling organization to either oversample NRA members or have a big enough national sample to get you to at least 500, but preferably closer to 750 NRA members who can stand as a sample on their own," she said. We interviewed some polling experts who said that additional polls would help shed more light on the views of NRA members and that there are caveats about these polls’ methodologies. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told PolitiFact that the smaller the actual subgroup in the national population, the lower the precision and the larger the margin of error. However, if several polls show a majority of NRA members favor background checks, that increases the confidence in the findings. Some of our polling experts raised some criticisms about methodology. Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Polling Center, said he is dubious of any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) polling as the one done by Public Policy Polling. "They have incredibly low response rates and there is evidence that only the most politically motivated people really want to talk to a computer about their opinions," he said. Williams, of Public Policy Polling, defended the methodology and said IVR polling can cut down on social desirability bias — people telling a human questioner the answer they think they are "supposed" to say. Our ruling Ryan said that "70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check." Ryan is citing a poll from Public Policy Polling, conducted in 2015 for liberal groups. That poll found that among the respondents who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. Other polls we looked at showed that between 52 and 74 percent of NRA members supported background checks. These polls are imperfect because they include small samples of NRA members, but they all suggest a majority of NRA members support background checks. New polling of larger numbers of NRA members would shed more light on the views of NRA members on background checks. With all that in mind, we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-00295	Most of Kathy Manning’s donors are from out-of-state.	true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/26/ted-budd/budd-claims-most-mannings-donors-arent-north-carol/	U.S. Rep. Ted Budd and his Democratic challenger, Kathy Manning, had raised almost $3.1 million combined in their congressional race in North Carolina’s 13th district as of June. Manning has outraised Budd by almost $800,000 according to the Federal Election Commission. Budd has said on social media that most of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. "Most of Kathy Manning’s support is coming from out-of-state liberal donors," Budd tweeted on Aug. 30. He posted a similar claim on Facebook as well. In both posts, Budd cites an Axios article. The article says 55.5 percent of Manning’s campaign donors are from outside of North Carolina. The article also notes 28 percent of Budd’s donors live outside of the state. Harry Stevens, a visual journalist at Axios, confirmed the data used for the article includes all the individual contributions listed on the FEC’s site. Their analysis does not include any donations made by political action committees. PolitiFact reached out to Budd’s office to see if he has any other evidence to back his claim, but has not heard back. This isn’t the first time a politician has made this kind of claim about their opponent’s donors. PolitiFact also reported on U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson from Ohio saying most of his opponent’s donors were out-of-state liberals. What PolitiFact is checking This fact check will be looking at the share of Manning’s donors who are from out-of-state. Budd’s statement specifically says Manning’s donors are "out-of-state liberals," but PolitiFact isn’t checking how many of the donors are liberal. That’s subjective, and the FEC does not keep track of how donors self-identify politically when recording donations. The Axios article Budd cites only analyzes individual contributions, and does not take PAC donations into consideration. PolitiFact will only look at individual contributions, as well. We are not analyzing any donations made by PACs. Who are Manning’s donors? Over 1,700 individuals have donated to Manning’s campaign. Many of them are doctors, lawyers and retirees. Based on information from the FEC and Open Secrets, run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, it does in fact appear that most of Manning’s donors are not from North Carolina. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Just 45 percent of Manning’s donors are in North Carolina, based on the dataset from the FEC. There are donors who gave money to Manning’s campaign more than once. We took that into consideration in analyzing the information by not including any repeat donors. What about ActBlue donors? On the FEC’s site, it appears at first glance that only a quarter of Manning’s donors are from North Carolina. There’s an explanation for that, and it’s called ActBlue. That’s a Massachusetts company which developed a fundraising software tool for Democratic candidates to use. Manning’s contribution page says it is powered by ActBlue. When the FEC makes note of campaign donations, it also lists every individual donation made through ActBlue. But not all of those donors are actually from West Somerville, Mass. It doesn’t stop there. The FEC essentially lists these donors as having made another donation outside of ActBlue. In reality, it is the same donation, and it can be confusing. Imagine having a monthly subscription to your local newspaper. You look at your bank account, and it says you’ve been charged for the month. You go about the rest of your week all jolly because you have unlimited access to local news. Until you look at your bank account the following week, and you think you got charged again for your newspaper subscription. You call your bank to try to make sense of what has happened. Turns out the newspaper company was giving you a heads up about the upcoming subscription charge the previous week, and you were actually charged just once. That’s how the FEC’s reports on ActBlue basically work. The donation was made once, but it’s listed twice under two different names. A Texas Republican congressman accused his opponent of getting more donations from Massachusetts than Texas by counting these as separate donations, but PolitiFact rated that claim Pants on Fire. The ActBlue donations do not change the fact that 55 percent of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. Our ruling After combing through all of the publicly listed donations on the FEC’s site, it is true that most of Manning’s donors are from outside of North Carolina. We took the ActBlue donations into consideration, and they do not change the outcome. We rate this claim True.

pomt-14429	"Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/09/conservative-solutions-pac/super-pac-ad-tying-trump-kkk-misses-mark/	Florida’s upcoming winner-take-all Republican primary is increasingly seen as the anti-Donald Trump faction’s last hope to stop the New York billionaire's march to the nomination. Numerous outside groups and super PACs are flooding the state’s airwaves with anti-Trump ads, including one tying him to the Ku Klux Klan. An ad from Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, includes clips of CNN’s Jake Tapper and Trump. Tapper: "I asked Donald Trump three times if he would disavow the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan." Trump: "Well, I have to look at the group." Narrator: "Trump refuses to denounce the KKK. Think about that — for president?" Because the ad has aired more than 430 times in Florida, according to Political TV Ad Archive, we thought it was worth taking a closer look. We gave the billionaire businessman a Pants on Fire rating for claiming to not to know anything about Duke. But it’s a stretch to say Trump "refuses to denounce the KKK" given his record of denouncements before and after the Tapper interview. The ad cites a Time article recapping Trump’s Feb. 28 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, where Trump dodged multiple questions from Tapper asking if he’d disavow the support of white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke (he would later blame a "bad earpiece" for his noncommittal answers). Trump’s history with Duke has been pretty well documented by PolitiFact and fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org. In a 1991 interview with CNN’s Larry King, Trump said he "hated" what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented. King: "Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him." Trump: "I hate —" King: "Four hundred New Yorkers contributed." Trump: "I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States." King: "Anger?" Trump: "It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble." In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted the support of Duke, a "Klansman." "This is not company I wish to keep," he said at the time. Trump also called Duke "a bigot, a racist, a problem," in a 2000 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer. Although Trump disavowed Duke and the KKK in the past, his criticism has been less pointed in 2016. In August 2015, Trump answered a question by Bloomberg’s John Heilemann asking if he would repudiate David Duke’s supportive comments of Trump’s campaign by saying, "I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate." The story popped up again after Buzzfeed reported on Feb. 25 that Duke was urging his supporters to vote for Trump, saying on his radio show that failure to do so would be "treason to your heritage." Asked about the endorsement the next day at a press conference, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it. "I didn’t even know he endorsed me," he said. "David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?" After the interview with Tapper, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a "bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years." It’s worth noting that Duke, despite his support for white nationalism and former membership in neo-Nazi and openly racist groups, hasn’t been associated with the Klan for more than 40 years. Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the racist group in 1974, but left the organization in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence and his inability to stop members of other chapters from doing "stupid or violent things." The modern-day Klan is a hodgepodge of dozens of independent chapters spread throughout the country with a total membership around 5,000, according to the Anti-Defamation League. There’s no central Klan organization that represents every chapter, but Arkansas-based Knights Party spokeswoman Rachel Pendergraft told Politico in December that Trump was a major talking point in the group’s recruitment efforts. Our ruling A pro-Rubio super PAC said, "Trump refuses to denounce the KKK." Trump hasn’t gone after the KKK and white nationalists like Duke with the same fervor as his opponents, but it’s inaccurate to make a blanket statement based on a single interview given his history of rejecting white supremacists.

"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism," said a headline on potus-press.com. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The site claimed that "just hours" after ABC canceled the show due to a racist tweet from Barr, "the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show." But there have been no legitimate reports about Fox Networks Group taking the show after its ABC cancellation. Fox Networks Group is an operating unit of 21st Century Fox, home to cable and broadcasting networks, including Fox News Channel, Fox Sports and FX. The post also attributes a made-up quote to Brian Sullivan, president and chief operating officer of Fox Networks Group. Sullivan is falsely quoted welcoming Barr to Fox. The story also falsely claimed President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations to Fox for picking up the show. Newsweek reported that some Roseanne fans tweeted expressing hope that Fox picks up the show. But that still hasn’t happened. Potus Press’ story has its origin in satire, but there’s nothing obvious on the post to clue readers into the fact that the post is meant as a joke. The story concluded with an H/T or "hat tip" and link to Extra News Feed, which posted the same story on May 30, filed under "Truth in Satire." Extra News Feed’s Twitter biography said it’s a "newsfeed w/ the same political rants you see on Facebook but they’re well written. we publish half satire & half essays. you decide which is which." Potus Press describes itself as an "independent source of information" in its "About Us" page, while noting that most of its content comes from other sites. "We encourage critical thinking, having a view outside the box and getting your facts straight. Not only that we give you all the sources within all of our articles, but we also advise you to take nothing for granted, verifying each information that you get.

Unless Potus Press readers click the link at the end of the story, there is no label or tag identifying the post as satire. One of the commenters on the story wrote, "I am so happy to hear this."

pomt-01181	"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/07/diego-arene-morley/brown-u-student-leader-more-african-american-men-p/	A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. "There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850," said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on. We also reached out to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and "free coloreds," was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That’s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850. Our ruling Arene-Morley said that "There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850." Our research found that U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1.68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1.88 million with local jails factored in. Given that evidence, we rate Arene-Morley’s claim True.

pomt-07455	"In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/19/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-new-state-labor-law-doesnt-cu/	Opponents and supporters of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law are preparing for a possible referendum in November that would decide whether the controversial measure stays on the books. So it’s no surprise Republican Gov. John Kasich, a proponent of Senate Bill 5, immediately began defending the law after he signed it on the last day of March. The law will sharply reduce public workers’ collective bargaining rights. Unions have declared the law an attack on Ohio’s middle class. Kasich rejects the argument that it will damage public workers’ livelihoods. "In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care," Kasich said March 31 in a interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Network. Campaigns for and against SB 5 are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars to sway voters should opponents of the new law collect enough signatures to put the referendum on the ballot. Kasich himself sent an e-mail to supporters promoting passage of SB 5 and seeking campaign donations. With such a passionate debate on the horizon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Kasich’s characterization of SB 5. Before we get into the specifics of Kasich’s claim, it is important to remember a few things: SB 5 does not alter any existing contracts. The law will not take effect until after the fall election if enough signatures are gathered by a June 30 deadline to put the referendum on the ballot. If that deadline passes and signatures are short of the required 231,147, the law takes effect in July. Now let’s begin. We’ll break this down into thirds, examining how SB 5 affects pensions, health care and worker salaries. We relied on interviews and an analysis of the 444-page bill by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission to reach our conclusions. Impact on pensions Kasich was correct when he said the bill does not take away worker pensions. The new law could affect amount employees contribute toward their pension plans. It does not change pension benefits in any way, nor does it grant management new authority to do so. Many public workers contribute 10 percent of their salary toward their pension while the employer contributes 14 percent of the a worker’s salary. Some unions, however, have negotiated deals where the employer pays a portion of the employee contribution. If an employer agreed to pay 2 percent of the worker share, for example, it would pay 16 percent of the worker’s salary and the worker would pay 8 percent. Senate Bill 5 prohibits the practice, known as a "pension pick-up." So Kasich is correct to say the bill does not "take away" any worker’s pension. Some workers who benefited from pension pick-ups, however, would have to pay more of their pension contributions under SB 5. Impact on health care Kasich says the bill does not "destroy" workers’ health care. The governor is correct here too because the bill does not change health care benefits. It limits the share of the premiums that the public employer can pay toward those benefits. The new law bars public employers from paying more than 85 percent of health care coverage costs. That leaves at least 15 percent to employees. State workers currently pay 15 percent of their health care costs, but many other public workers pay less. While SB 5 will shift health care costs onto some workers, it does not "destroy" benefits. Impact on wages The shifts in pension and health care contributions could have a direct effect on wages. If the new law shifts a bigger share of retirement and health care costs onto workers, they’ll want higher wages to make up the difference so their take home pay remains intact. Kasich said "we don’t cut anybody’s salary." In a literal sense, he is correct. SB 5 does not set new salaries for public workers. But the new law effectively wipes out salary schedules in past labor contracts and directs cities and unions to agree to new salary structures that assign pay raises based on job performance. Kasich other supporters often tout the leverage the new law provides local governments to control labor costs. Management gains a new edge under SB 5 through the reduction of public workers’ collective bargaining rights, a ban on striking and a new system to resolve labor disputes that favors employers. So while Kasich has said the bill does not cut workers’ pay, he also has promoted SB 5 as a tool to control labor costs. Which is it? Critics say the answer is obvious. "Something has to give somewhere," said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for We Are Ohio, an anti-SB 5 group collecting signatures to put the bill on the fall ballot. "The only possible way for these local governments to save money is to eliminate jobs or reduce wages. There’s no other way." Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols insisted the bill "doesn’t prescribe wages," so it is inaccurate to conclude SB 5 cuts workers pay. But reduced pay is a near certainty in some communities. Kasich says the bill "didn’t cut anybody’s wages," but some key points are missing from that statement: Workers who have to pick up an increased portion of their health care and pension premiums will see less take-home pay in their checks unless their public employer raises wages to cover the heightened premiums -- a doubtful proposition if the new law is truely a tool to control labor costs. Cities across the state are looking to cut costs – and SB 5 gives mayors and school boards the leverage to cut pay as they negotiate with their workers in the future. Those are important pieces of information needed to put Kasich’s statement in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as Half True.

pomt-06318	"We cut a record $15 billion from our state budget."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-leaders-cut-15-billion-state/	Proclaiming himself a "doer, not a talker," Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry makes two claims about his accomplishments as the Texas governor in a television ad that has been broadcast in Iowa and New Hampshire. "In Texas, we created 40 percent of the new jobs in the entire country since June of 2009," Perry says. "And we cut a record $15 billion from our state budget." We’ve checked numerous claims about Texas job growth, including one by Perry in June 2011 that 48 percent of all jobs created in the United States since June 2009 were in the Lone Star State. Half True, we said, pointing out that there are many ways to slice and dice employment statistics. Also, experts have advised us that a state’s job performance — be they gains or losses — shouldn’t be pinned on the top officeholder. Too many factors are in play for a single state official to merit credit or blame. For this article, we wondered whether a record $15 billion was cut from the state budget, as Perry says. As backup for that claim, Perry’s campaign pointed to a May 2011 report on the two-year state budget that the Texas Legislature approved and Perry signed into law this year. The budget covers fiscal 2012, which began Sept. 1, 2011, and fiscal 2013. The report by the Legislative Budget Board — whose staff members analyze state appropriations — compares spending in the 2012-13 budget ($172.3 billion), including state and federal money, with that in the previous budget cycle ($187.5 billion). The difference is $15.2 billion. (Since Perry’s ad began airing, the board has released updated budget figures that are slightly different from those in the May 2011 report. That information was not available to the Perry campaign, however, so our research focuses on the earlier report.) The $15 billion reduction amount stands alone for the past half-century, according to John Barton, a spokesman for the budget board’s staff. From 1951 through 2009, Barton said, no Legislature budgeted less spending from all sources than what had been spent in the previous budget. Before then, he said, Texas lawmakers did not write a single budget covering all state agencies. So, there’s a basis for Perry’s "record" $15 billion boast. Next, we looked at the figures behind it and found three factors that seem to diminish Perry’s claim. Let’s take them one by one. First, Perry’s cited spending reductions were primarily federal funds, most of them being one-time stimulus dollars that lawmakers knew wouldn’t be available for the 2012-13 budget cycle. According to the LBB report, federal funding dropped 25 percent, compared with a 2 percent cut in state general revenue spending — the expenditures over which the governor and lawmakers have the most sway. In raw figures, federal funding fell by $18.2 billion while state general revenue spending dropped $1.6 billion. (Increases in other spending categories offset some of those losses, bringing the net reduction to $15.2 billion.) More than half the drop in federal money, $11.8 billion of it, traces to the absence of one-time federal economic stimulus aid that Congress approved in 2009, Barton told us. Texas lawmakers used that money primarily for education and health care costs in the 2010-11 budget. Second, the 2012-13 budget is expected to grow, which will drive down Perry’s $15 billion reduction figure. It was much-reported during this year’s legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover all of the projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. That means that absent major changes in demand for services or program costs, the Legislature will have to pony up more money for Medicaid — a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans — before the end of the 2013 fiscal year. In its May 2011 report, the budget board staff estimated that lawmakers would need to infuse the program with an additional $4.4 billion in state dollars. If the $4.4 billion in state aid is added on, the federal government will send the state an estimated $5.3 billion in federal Medicaid "matching" funds, according to Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. So, total spending in the 2012-13 Texas budget could increase by nearly $10 billion, although Goodman cautioned that actual Medicaid spending will probably vary from the projections reached this year based on factors such as the size of the state’s caseload and medical costs. An extra $10 billion in spending for 2012-13 would bring the total budget to about $182 billion and reduce Perry’s budget cut to about $5.5 billion. Third, it was also well-reported that lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts a few days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle. Considering these factors, the cuts in the 2012-13 budget don’t look as large as Perry touts in his campaign ad. Counting the effects of postponing Medicaid and public school expenditures and including additional federal aid that would roll in if the state commits more to Medicaid, the 2012-13 budget may actually be closer to $184.3 billion. Compare that total to the $187.5 billion spending figure for 2010-11 in the LBB report, and the budget cut shrinks to about $3.2 billion. There is another perspective on the question of how much the Legislature cut the budget this year. Eva DeLuna Castro, an analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Austin think tank, told us that any analysis by her organization would also consider as cuts the difference between 2012-13 appropriations and the amount of money the state would have had to spent to maintain current service levels in its programs, including the cost of school-age population growth. DeLuna Castro said that in this vein, the budget cuts for 2012-13 were "closer to $22 billion." We also looked into what experts at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin think tank, have said about the 2012-13 budget. In a May 26, 2011, statement, Talmadge Heflin, director of the foundation’s Center for Fiscal Policy, praised Texas as "leading the way in showing that government can be made smaller." He also noted, however, that $12 billion of the $15 billion reduction "comes from the expiration of the federal stimulus package." Heflin continued: "Just as those one-time stimulus funds artificially inflated the current budget, the end of those funds makes it look like the Texas Legislature cut deeper than it really did." Our ruling Nobody disputes that the latest Texas budget spends considerably less than the previous one — and Perry’s $15 billion figure has a basis. However, much of the ballyhooed reduction reflects the loss of one-time federal stimulus aid — a "cut" originating in Congress and one that was not in Perry’s control. Put another way, the budget he signed into law trimmed state spending (which the governor can directly influence) by $1.6 billion. Also, Perry’s calculation doesn’t acknowledge the state’s underfunding of Medicaid and a delayed education payment — which, if counted, would knock the budget cut down to about $3 billion in total, $12 billion less than what Perry celebrates.

pomt-03537	Fewer Democrats were on the Georgia general election ballot in 2012 than in more than 100 years.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/29/bryan-long/ballot-claim-hard-prove-over-100-years/	You can’t win if you don’t play. That mantra holds true for the lottery and for politics, or so says one Georgia politico. Bryan Long, executive director of the group Better Georgia, expressed this sentiment to the head of Georgia’s Democratic Party, Mike Berlon, last month during an Atlanta Press Club event. With retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat up for grabs, Berlon would rather the party support a single candidate for an uncontested primary. That doesn’t sit too well with some of the party’s leaders, who chided Berlon for not putting up Democratic candidates to run in some key 2012 state races. "When we ran the numbers, we saw fewer Democrats on the ballot in this last election than in more than 100 years," Long said. "If your goal was to increase the turnout in all these counties, I’m not sure how by having fewer Democrats run would meet that goal." One hundred years is a long time and a lot of races to count. We decided to check out Long’s claim and see whether old state ballots contained more Democratic candidates. Long left a public relations job to start Better Georgia, an affiliate of the ProgressNow network. Employees of the left-leaning group call themselves political troublemakers and highlight GOP policies with which they disagree. For full disclosure, Long is a former Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who has also reported for CNN. We first saw the exchange between Long and Berlon reported on the AJC’s Political Insider blog. Long also provided us with his full quote from the event. He also provided his research of the past seven statewide elections, from 2000 to 2012, with data compiled from the Georgia secretary of state’s website. Long’s chart showed the total number of Democrats on the general election ballot for the state House and Senate for those years. We reviewed his provided numbers on the state website and found that within a few candidates in some years, Long’s data were mostly accurate. Year House Senate Total Democratic candidates 2012 86 26 112 2010 118 34 152 2008 99 35 134 2006 110 36 146 2004 123 43 166 2002 132 42 174 2000 133 42 175 "Even with the state’s increasing diversity, the number of Democratic candidates has decreased," Long told us. "Demographics don’t win elections. It’s about putting candidates on the field to challenge for those seats." Long did not provide 100-year data to support his claim. He based his statement on the decreasing number of Democrats on the ballot (with a minor exception in 2010) since 2002, when Sonny Perdue was elected governor. "Before that (2002) it’s an assumption because the Democrats were in control of everything," Long said. "The Democrats were the majority party." But the pure numbers don’t really mean anything in terms of candidates, Berlon told us. "It’s problematic to run a candidate in every race when you are the party not in power," he said. "... We’ve been targeting races we think we can win because we have a limited amount of resources." We went further with our research, reviewing the numbers as far back as 1988, the earliest data available on the secretary of state’s elections website. Those figures -- with the exception of 1994 and 1992, which were not available online -- showed that Democratic ballot representation didn’t fall below the 171 candidates in 1998. But Long’s comment went back 100 years, and around here we aim to be totally accurate, so we also went back 100 years -- at least we tried to. We pored over all the volumes of the Georgia Official and Statistical Register from 1923 to 1990 for more information. The register included ballot information for 1980-1990, 1970-1974 and 1966. State legislative data for all other years was not included, and elections officials were researching whether the information was available elsewhere. For the years that were available, the Democratic candidates on the state ballots numbered in the 200s, up to 256 candidates in 1966. Until 2002, Democrats held about 60 percent of the state’s legislative seats, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, who tracks state political trends. In the 1980s Democrats held about 80 percent of the General Assembly’s seats. But it’s not uncommon for the minority party to have a harder time recruiting candidates, Bullock said. So does Long’s claim pass the test of time? He said that Georgia’s 2012 general election ballot included fewer Democratic candidates for the state House and Senate than in the past 100 years. State elections data that are available for the previous 46 years confirm Long’s claim. Data before this point were not readily available to check. And there is a 42-year gap when information is not available. Long’s overall point that 2012 was a light year for Democrats is correct. But he overreaches when he tries to stretch those numbers back a century. A lot of context -- and years -- are missing from his statement. We rated his claim Half True.

pomt-08838	Exporters are using a federal loophole to "deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur" to U.S. consumers.	true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/11/hank-johnson/congressman-jumps-fur-flap/	Hank Johnson has a reputation for making eyebrow-raising statements, first as a DeKalb County commissioner and now as a U.S. congressman. Remember the one a few months ago where Johnson said he was worried about the island of Guam becoming so overpopulated that it would tip over and capsize? It was a metaphor, he said, as the mockery mounted. "I wasn't really suggesting that the island of Guam would literally tip over," Johnson wrote in a statement in April. Tongues started wagging again in recent weeks after Johnson fired off another head-scratcher. Johnson, a Democrat, had offered his support for legislation to end a federal loophole that does not require manufacturers to label fur and fake fur garments that cost less than $150. "Exporters use this loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur as though they were made from faux fur or the fur of other animals," Johnson wrote in comments submitted for the Congressional Record. The congressman added that it is illegal to import, export, sell or advertise domestic dog fur in this country. Johnson is running for re-election against Republican Liz Carter in Georgia's 4th Congressional District, which includes most of DeKalb and portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale counties. So is the use of cats and dogs for fur really a problem, or is Johnson barking up the wrong tree? It is indeed a problem, one high-ranking animal rights leader told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Michael Markarian, chief operating officer of the Humane Society of the United States, said some dog and cat fur still comes undetected into the U.S., particularly from China. About one in eight fur garments falls below the labeling standard, said U.S. Rep Jim Moran (D-Va.). The Humane Society recently tested 38 fur-trimmed jackets. Three had fur from domestic dogs, Markarian said. Some were from raccoon dogs, a canine species specific to Asia, the Humane Society official said. Those canines, Markarian said, are often skinned alive. "We really feel that this is still a problem and consumers need to have more confidence in what they're buying," Markarian said. Markarian said legislation is needed because more fur-rimmed jackets are being sold here and advertised as faux fur. It's not, he said. The Humane Society reached out-of-court settlements in March with Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to stop advertising garments as faux fur that are trimmed with coyote or dog pelts. The settlements came after a District of Columbia judge in February fined Neiman Marcus $25,000 for advertising items as faux that were actually trimmed with raccoon dog, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Investigators for an animal rights group, meanwhile, recorded footage of what is said to be a raccoon dog being skinned alive in China as part of the fur trade. Chinese officials have vowed to stop the trade of cat and dog fur, calling it "illegal and barbaric," according to news reports. The Chinese State Forestry Administration pledged in 2005 to strengthen animal welfare regulations on animals farmed for fur. Congress passed legislation in 2000 that prohibits importing or exporting dog and cat fur. But animal rights activists say some manufacturers are still finding ways around the law. Moran, the congressman from Virginia, is the lead sponsor of legislation that would remove the loophole, which was created in 1951. The resolution unanimously passed the House of Representatives on July 28. Johnson was one of 170 sponsors. It has not gone before the U.S. Senate. Johnson's comments caught us off-guard, but the issue of cats and dogs being used as fur and their inhumane treatment is a problem. We rate his statement on the issue as True.

pomt-07132	Milwaukee’s police chief can fire officers "for basically no cause."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/16/robin-vos/wisconsin-rep-robin-vos-says-milwaukees-police-chi/	In Madison, plenty of familiar fights are being fought as Republicans who control the Legislature seek to undo changes approved when Democrats were in charge. An unexpected issue -- pay for fired Milwaukee police officers -- joined the list when Republicans introduced a budget amendment that would require city taxpayers to pay wages and benefits for some fired cops while they appealed their dismissals. That had long been the practice in Milwaukee. In some cases, dismissed officers collected pay for years while their appeals dragged on. They kept it even if their firing ultimately was upheld by the Fire and Police Commission. That changed in the wake of the Frank Jude beating case. In 2004, Jude was attacked by off-duty Milwaukee police officers after he left a party on the south side. Nine officers were fired for their role in incident, and public outrage mounted as officers received pay while they fought their dismissals. In 2008, the Legislature cut off pay immediately for officers who were fired for behavior that resulted in serious charges. At that time, city officials said taxpayers had paid fired officers $4.4 million in pay and benefits since 1990, including $400,000 alone for the officers involved in the Jude case. In 2009, the law was expanded, cutting off pay for officers fired for other reasons, such as department rule violations. That covers nearly all fired officers, because rule violations such as lying are the most common reason for firing. The new amendment, to return to the 2008 system, which focused on serious infractions, was authored by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee. The issue is a hot button one: The union representing officers has traditionally fought to have dismissed cops kept on the payroll as long as possible. Meanwhile, the chief’s authority is diminished when a cop he fires remains on the payroll. When the amendment was adopted at a June 2, 2011, committee meeting, Vos said the change was needed because Milwaukee is the only city that allows its police chief to fire officers "for basically no cause." He continued: "That’s an awful lot of power we don’t grant to any other police chief in the state." That caught our attention, especially since the earlier changes were billed as putting Milwaukee more in line with other communities. Does the Milwaukee police chief really have such unbridled powers? Can he really fire someone for no reason? The short answer: No. The longer answer: State law spells out how the Milwaukee Police Department is organized and managed. They key provision on this point: "No member of the police force or fire department may be discharged or suspended for a term exceeding 30 days by the chief of either of the departments except for cause and after trial under this section." Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn put it another way: "Maybe he’s confused between just cause and just ‘cause." As in, "just because." State law spells out seven standards that must be met before a Milwaukee police officer can be fired. They include such things as whether the chief has "substantial evidence" that a rule was broken, has conducted a fair investigation and whether the officer knew that his or her actions could have serious consequences. A fired officer has 10 days to file an appeal with the Fire and Police Commission. Asked about the statement, Vos aide Kit Beyer said: "He misspoke. He hasn’t said it since then." When Vos returned our call, he said: "Do I understand that you have to have a reason (to fire an officer)? "Yes." What is Vos trying to accomplish with the amendment? He says fired police officers should be treated the same throughout the state. Officers elsewhere are suspended with pay by the chief and the firing is done by the local fire and police commission, he said. In Milwaukee, the chief fires an officer and then the officer could suffer months without pay and benefits while waiting for his appeal to be heard, Vos said. But the amendment does not change the sequence in Milwaukee to match other communities. It simply requires that officers fired for rules violations be paid during appeal. Vos argues keeping them on the payroll would encourage the fire and police commission to swiftly resolve the matter. However, city officials say when that system was in place it encouraged officers to drag out the appeals process. The net effect of the amendment is financial, said Michael Tobin, executive director of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission. "It will allow most (fired) officers to remain on the payroll, because most are charged with rule violations" rather than crimes, Tobin said. Since taking over as chief in January 2008, Flynn has dismissed about 20 officers, almost all for rule violations. Tobin said the amendment would allow the officers to collect at least an additional two months of pay and benefits, because the commission must wait 60 days before scheduling an appeals hearing. Those charged with more serious offenses would not receive pay. So what’s our verdict? Vos argued state law must be changed because the Milwaukee chief can fire officers for no cause. That’s False … even Vos acknowledged it.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2011-06-16T15:30:08	2011-06-02	['None']
pomt-11650	"In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/jan/12/gwen-graham/did-ron-desantis-cast-deciding-vote-against-legisl/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham called out her newest Republican opponent Ron DeSantis for going to bat for oil drilling off Florida’s coast. Her Jan. 4 tweet came as the White House prepared to announce a new offshore drilling plan that originally included Florida among states that would see expanded drilling. (The White House later walked it back to exempt Florida at the urging of Gov. Rick Scott.) When DeSantis had the opportunity to keep drilling out of Florida, Graham said, he went against it. "In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling," Graham tweeted. "Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet included a link to a close vote on a 2013 amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (HR 2231), which never became law. Was DeSantis, whose district includes several east coast beaches, really "the deciding vote" on an effort to keep drilling out of the state? The short answer: It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as "the deciding vote" with close calls in Congress. DeSantis’ stance on drilling DeSantis’ specific position on drilling is squishy. Most recently, DeSantis embraced Scott's opposition to Trump's plan. "In Florida our coastline is so important to our economy, it’s important to property values, it’s important to tourism," DeSantis said on Fox & Friends. "And we need to protect our coastline." Other actions speak to support for the coast, including a December 2015 letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management against seismic airgun exploration and a letter in opposition to the 2017 Interior Department executive order that advanced offshore oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. There’s also his vote in favor of a failed amendment that would have banned seismic testing in areas bordering Florida. He was one of 24 Republicans to vote for the testing ban. He also voted for a Graham amendement that would have restricted funds being used for the research, investigation, or study of offshore drilling. But that's not to say that DeSantis has always voted against drilling. DeSantis' down vote The 210-209 vote in Graham's tweet happened years earlier. In the summer of 2013, then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, proposed an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act pushed by House Republicans. The larger bill aimed to expand U.S. offshore energy production by directing the U.S. Interior Department secretary to implement a five-year oil and gas leasing program off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Grayson’s amendment would have ensured the ability of Florida or any state to prohibit the use of drilling within its boundaries. At the time, Grayson said the amendment would have avoided the possibility of the federal government overriding states' rights to decide. When it came to a vote, Grayson’s amendment failed by one vote, and DeSantis voted against the amendment. The larger bill passed the House but did move past the Democratic-controlled Senate. Does that mean he was the "deciding vote?" There’s no doubt that DeSantis’ vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the "deciding vote" label could just as easily be applied to any other lawmaker who voted on his side — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) That’s the general rule. We wondered if DeSantis did anything to justify being singled out, such as holding his support until the last moment. We couldn’t spot from C-SPAN footage whether DeSantis was one of the members who changed his mind at the literal last minute. Even if he were, however, he would not have been the only lawmaker to do so. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer argued it is noteworthy that DeSantis was in the minority of Florida Republicans who voted against this amendment. Seven Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, voted against the amendment, while nine Republicans voted for the amendment. Is Grayson’s amendment significant? DeSantis’ team didn’t argue his vote, but they did take issue with Graham’s framing of the measure as a vote "against our state’s right to protect Florida waters from drilling." Many Republicans didn’t see it that way, arguing Grayson’s measure would not have actually changed Florida’s control of its coast. "Since the underlying bill did nothing to alter the existing relationship between the federal and state governments, the amendment itself contained no substantive policy that would have changed the ability of Florida to prevent development of waters within its jurisdiction," said DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick. Fusick said the balance of power between the federal and state government was already determined by the Submerged Lands Act (which sets federal government ownership of submerged lands after the first three miles from the state’s coast) and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which also applies to land beyond three miles offshore), which were both enacted in 1953. Holly Parker, the Florida regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, said that if Grayson’s amendment only applied to state waters, then it would seem to be a duplication of an existing right. However, she said it’s possible that the broader failed legislation would have changed that. "Now, if the underlying legislation somehow impeded those state rights and this amendment was an attempt to clarify or delineate the rights of a state to regulate those submerged (lands), that would be different," Parker said. Athan Manuel, the director of the Sierra Club’s Land’s Protection Program, said he thinks it's possible that the bill could have changed the separation of powers. Regardless, he said, the point of Grayson’s amendment was to be "extra clear" that Florida had a say in what happened. "Maybe it wasn’t as necessary, but it's important to send the right message," Manuel said. "If he wanted to vote against drilling, he should have voted for the Grayson amendment." Our ruling Graham said DeSantis casted the "deciding vote against" the state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. There’s no question that DeSantis’ vote on an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was crucial, but saying DeSantis was the deciding vote goes too far. Technically, any of the 209 other people who voted against the bill could be considered the "deciding vote." Furthermore, the significance of Grayson’s amendment is a subject of debate. Democrats saw it as securing Florida’s right to protect Florida waters, whereas Republicans say the amendment wouldn’t have changed the powers of the state. With everything considered, we rate this claim Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gwen Graham	None	None	None	2018-01-12T10:53:35	2018-01-04	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-09190	"The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/30/colin-powell/obama-has-increased-troops-afghanistan/	Appearing on ABC News' This Week, retired Gen. Colin Powell answered questions about whether the U.S. had enough troops in Afghanistan. Host Jake Tapper reminded Powell of the military thinking that many call "the Powell doctrine," the idea that military operations should have large enough troop deployments to achieve their objectives. Tapper described it first as "overwhelming" force, but Powell said it is better described as "decisive" force. Is the Obama administration "adhering to the Powell doctrine?" Tapper asked. Powell didn't give a yes or no answer, instead explaining, "The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that. So 68,000 troops were added to it. That is a significant number. And, remember, they're not going after a fixed enemy. They're trying to control ground. They're trying to give some comfort to people that their life is going to get better." Powell said the rest will be up to the government and people of Afghanistan. "The challenge here -- and the president will have to face this late next year, as he said he would -- is, okay, we have had this additional input of 68,000 soldiers, bringing it to over 100,000 soldiers. We have done what we said we were going to do. Have the Afghans done what they must do, build an army that is capable, an army that is connected to the central government, an army that the people believe in? And do we have a police force that is not corrupt? And do we have a government in Kabul that is really reaching out and connecting the people together into some kind of political system that people believe in?" We wanted to fact-check Powell's statement that Obama has added 68,000 troops, "not just the 30,000 you hear." After weeks of deliberations, Obama in late 2009 decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. He announced his decision in a major address at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., on Dec. 1, 2009. But Obama had sent more troops to Afghanistan long before that, to fulfill a campaign promise. On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama issued an order to send two additional brigades -- each with about 2,500 troops -- to Afghanistan. With those troops plus other additions, the total deployment steadily increased from the roughly 34,000 that were in Afghanistan when Obama took office. Last week, the Pentagon announced there were 94,000 troops in Afghanistan. The number was a milestone because it was the first time troops there had exceeded the number of troops in Iraq, which now has 92,000. (At the height of the Iraq war, there were between 130,000 and 172,000 troops there.) About 4,000 more troops are expected to deploy to Afghanistan by the summer, bringing the total to 98,000. So 98,000 minus the 34,000 that were there when Obama took office gives us 64,000 troops, a little shy of the 68,000 Powell mentioned. But he might be counting additional NATO troops from countries that include Britain, France, Germany and Italy. NATO countries pledged an additional 5,000 troops last year, but the numbers have fluctuated as actual deployments have occurred. One thing we've learned about fact-checking troop numbers: Troops rotate in and out of countries on a regular schedule, which means troop levels are approximate numbers and change as time goes by. Still, we find Powell's numbers very close to the mark. Obama took office with about 34,000 troops. There are now 94,000 troops and closing in on 98,000 troops by summer. When you count small additions by NATO, that gets us close to 68,000. We rate his statement True.	None	Colin Powell	None	None	None	2010-05-30T14:41:17	2010-05-30	['None']

pomt-11706	BREAKING: Illegal Muslim From Iran Arrested For Starting California Wildfire	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/dec/20/usa-front/pants-fire-fabricated-claim-about-muslim-immigrant/	Facebook users recently spotted a suspicious article about the deadly Northern California wildfires, through the social network’s initiative that allows readers to flag fake news. Given the steady flow of misleading and intentionally false claims about the cause of the fires, PolitiFact California decided to fact-check the article, which appears to have been posted Dec. 11, 2017. It’s from the website USA In Front and includes a sensational headline: BREAKING: ILLEGAL MUSLIM FROM IRAN ARRESTED FOR STARTING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE The article lists "a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam" as "the actual person responsible for the fire," citing Fox News as the source of the information. We found the network never reported that. Before we examine the story and what appears to be its clearly false assertion, here’s some background on the destruction of the fires. The wind-driven blazes that started Oct. 8, 2017 are the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. They killed 42 people across Northern California and destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings. Much of the damage was centered in Napa and Sonoma counties. Our research We started our fact-check by contacting the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the agency in charge of investigating the cause of the blazes. Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said there have been no arrests, contradicting the claim in the article. "All the major fires that occurred in October are still being investigated. No arrests have been made in reference to the October siege," McLean wrote. We reached out to USA In Front for comment but did not hear back. The website lists its owner as USA In Front Inc., though we were unable to find out where it is based. The site appears to allow users to create an account and submit content. It includes articles on news and politics with a right-wing bent with headlines such as "Poll: Should Barack Obama Lose His Presidential Pension?" to "Meet The Most Liberal, Fiscally Irresponsible, and Pro-Death Republican in Texas." Article’s origin We found the story about the arrest of a Muslim man did not start with USA In Front. In October, the fact-checking website Snopes.com, found this tale originated on a site, FreedomJunkshun, that describes its content as satire. Snopes found "none of the details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist." But what started on the satirical site didn’t stay there. The story circulated around the web, and was posted word-for-word on sites such as World Today 365 and USA In Front. Those websites presented the story as news without any mention of its satirical origin. When we first examined the article, we noticed a few red flags: It does not have a byline, so there’s no direct way to contact the person that wrote the story. Unlike traditional, credible news articles, the story does not have a date or dateline. Additionally, the article fails to cite any specific people as sources. This is not the only time USA In Front has been flagged. The national PolitiFact handed out a Pants On Fire earlier this month for the site’s made-up story that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer had an affair with a teenage cheerleader. PolitiFact maintains a list of more than 300 websites, as of November 2017, where it’s found deliberately false or fake stories. The national website describes it this way: "This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one." Breitbart’s false claim The story posted on USA In Front has some parallels to a claim in a Breitbart article PolitiFact California rated False in October. Breitbart’s article said an undocumented immigrant from Mexico "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." In reality, an undocumented man had been arrested for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials called out Breitbart for fueling the false rumors. State fire authorities said they had not identified an arson suspect nor determined whether arson was the cause of the fires. Breitbart’s article, or versions of it, quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. After fact-checkers pointed out the false claim, Breitbart added an "update" saying the man was not suspected of starting the deadly fires. Our ruling A story recently posted on the website USA In Front claimed a Muslim man had been arrested for starting the deadly Northern California wildfires. The website and others presented the claim as if it were news, though it originated as a false tale on a satirical website. A spokesman for the state’s fire agency, Cal Fire, told us there had been no arrests and that the cause of the fires remains under investigation. The article on USA In Front is another example of the many fabricated claims tied to the deadly blazes. It lacks a byline, any specific sources and any disclaimer about its origin as satire. We didn’t hear back from the website. Posting the story without this key warning is reckless and perpetuates false and damaging information. We rate the claim in the USA In Front article Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Editor’s Note: In December 2016, PolitiFact.com joined a coalition of fact-checkers who agreed to work with Facebook to try to slow the spread of misinformation in people’s news feeds. The above article by PolitiFact California is a result of that partnership. Facebook introduced a new tool after the 2016 campaign that allows users to mark a post as a "false news story," and if enough do, the post is sent to fact-checkers such as PolitiFact, Snopes and Factcheck.org. If the fact-checkers find the story to be "false," a warning label is attached to the original post in Facebook’s news feed, and Facebook’s algorithm makes it more difficult for the disputed post to spread virally.

pomt-13816	"95 percent of the world’s customers are … beyond our shores."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/15/joe-biden/touting-trade-joe-biden-says-95-percent-worlds-con/	International trade has become a big issue in the 2016 presidential race, and now the sitting vice president, Joe Biden, has devoted a speech to it as well. Speaking on July 13 in San Diego, Biden reminded his audience that the United States needs to -- and has been -- cracking down on unfair practices by its trading partners. However, Biden also made a case for the benefits of foreign trade -- an argument that the two presidential candidates, and especially Republican Donald Trump, have not often made this campaign season. At one point in his speech, Biden cited the sheer number of customers outside U.S. borders. "We need to sell to customers abroad. 95 percent of the world’s customers are over there. They’re beyond our shores,  95 percent of the world’s customers," he said. This is a commonly cited figure by advocates of expanding international trade, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And it’s rooted in legitimate statistics. But it glosses over some important context. Where the number comes from The 95 percent figure is drawn directly from global population figures. According to the World Bank, the United States has a population of 321.4 million, compared to 7.3 billion for the world as a whole. So the United States’ population represents about 4.4 percent of the world’s population, leaving 95.6 percent of people outside the United States’ borders. That’s very close to the figure Biden offered. Why the statistic doesn’t tell the whole story However, for the purposes of buying American products -- which was the point of Biden’s remark -- not all residents of the world are equal. The vast majority of people across the world are quite poor and will not generally be in the market for American products. Determining how many "customers" there might be for American products is tricky. But one estimate published by the World Bank broke down the world’s population into rich (incomes typical of Italy and above), middle class (incomes between Brazil and Italy), and poor (incomes below that of Brazil). The study included affluent residents of poor countries in its count of "rich" and "middle class" people. That report estimated that in 2000, about 10.5 percent of the world’s population was rich and another 7.6 percent was middle class. By contrast, 82 percent were poor. Here’s the full chart: Of course, some of that 82 percent might be able to afford the occasional U.S. product, whether it’s a bottle of Coke, some bread made from U.S. grain, or a summer blockbuster movie. That uncertainty about the definition of "poor" and whether even very poor people can afford some U.S. products some of the time make us reluctant to suggest an alternate, more accurate figure. Still, even a narrower World Bank calculation -- based on defining "extreme poverty" as $1.90 in income per day adjusted for purchasing power by country -- came up with 12.73 percent of the world’s population living in "extreme poverty" in 2013. That’s not a lot of money to spend on imported products. And raising the cutoff for the definition of "extreme poverty" would produce larger percentages of people in that category. Pluses and minuses of using the 95 percent figure The vice president’s office acknowledged this critique and told PolitiFact that it likes to use the term "potential customers," arguing that beneficial trade agreements can help turn non-consumers of U.S. products into consumers of U.S. products, especially over the long term as trading relationships deepen and incomes rise. And even under the current status quo, some experts cautioned against dismissing the 95 percent figure. " 'Customers' is about population, not income, and while I'd agree that a lot of them won't be very big customers -- the 10 percent or so of the planet's population who live on less than $1.90 a day aren't lining up to buy Boeing 777s -- many of the world's very poorest people do buy food, and the United States is a very big agricultural exporter, including to developing countries," Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "So, they may not be the biggest customers, but they will be customers nonetheless." Our ruling Biden said, "95 percent of the world’s customers are … beyond our shores." He’s right if you count the number of people across the globe who live outside the borders of the United States. However, since many members of that 95 percent are quite poor, framing the question as Biden did gives an overstated sense of how much that 95 percent will be consuming U.S. exports in the near future.

pomt-13830	"A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-says-20-veterans-commit-sui/	Topping Donald Trump’s 10-point plan to help U.S. military veterans is a pledge to improve their mental health services. "A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans," the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said during a July 11 speech in Virginia Beach, where he excoriated the Department of Veterans Affairs and laid out reforms. We wondered whether Trump’s sad suicide number is correct. His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency’s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day. The count updates a much-cited VA estimate that an average of 22 veterans killed themselves each day in 2010. The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states. Notably absent were California and Texas - two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. The VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump’s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to "older veterans." For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation’s veterans are 50 or older. On the other hand, the VA found that younger veterans had the highest rate of suicides. Those ages 18 to 29 had a suicide rate of 77 per 100,000 in 2014. Veterans ages 50 to 59, by comparison, had a rate of 39 per 100,000. In all age groups, the VA found that the percentage of veterans who take their lives was substantially higher than that of adults who never served in the military. The rate for non-veterans ages 18 to 29, for example, was 12.8 per 100,000. The rate for non-vets ages 50 to 59 was 18.6 per 100,000. The 2014 suicide rate for all veterans was 35.3 per 100,000; the rate for all adult non-vets was 15.2 per 100,000. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, the VA concluded that veterans have a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults. Is the situation improving? During a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA’s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn’t view the new number as a sign of progress. Shulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising. VA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period. According to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn’t use those services increased 38.6 percent. Critics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country. Shulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so "ingrained" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it’s correct. Our ruling Trump said, "A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans." His claim is supported by recent research by the VA and we rate the statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c79ae1-2a18-49c8-a325-8e1146fc012e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-14T11:18:12	2016-07-11	['None']

pomt-10080	"Senator McCain would pay for part of his (health care) plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/obama-knows-mccains-intentions-better-than-mccain/	(Published Oct. 20, 2008) Though both presidential candidates have spoken at length about how they would change the American health system, they’ve carefully avoided offering many specifics about Medicare, the government’s huge health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. For good reason: Medicare is financially unprepared for the surge of retiring baby boomers, meaning future administrations and Congresses will have to consider making tough tradoffs, like cutting benefits or raising taxes. That’s hardly the kind of stuff a politician would willingly highlight in stump speeches or on a campaign Web site. It is the sort of thing you just might accuse your opponent of favoring. And Barack Obama in recent days has tried to do just that, portraying John McCain’s health plan as filled with looming spending cuts for Medicare’s nearly 45-million beneficiaries. "It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth. $882-billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived health care plan, even as Medicare already faces a looming shortfall," Obama said in an Oct. 17, 2008, speech in Roanoke, Va. He repeated the charge the next day, in St. Louis, declaring that under McCain’s plan, “you would have fewer places to get care, and less freedom to choose your doctors. You’ll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.” The Obama campaign also has turned the charge into a TV ad. Obama might be hitting hard on a sensitive topic, but in the process, he’s offering more specifics about McCain’s plan than McCain has. The $882-billion in cuts Obama cites comes from an analysis of McCain’s plan by the Center for American Progress Fund, a left-leaning think tank headed by John D. Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Clinton. The analysis, in turn, is based on an estimate by the independent Tax Policy Center that finds McCain’s overall health plan would cost the government $1.3-trillion over 10 years — a figure the McCain campaign doesn’t dispute. Because McCain’s campaign says the health plan would be “budget neutral” — meaning it would be paid for by savings from Medicare and Medicaid — the Center for American Progress automatically assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs. The center performed a series of calculations to determine how much McCain would have to reduce both programs’ projected spending growth, and concluded McCain would have to pare the program by roughly 13 percent over a decade, or $882-billion. All fine, except that McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps. McCain’s senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin has talked about further policy changes, including extending tax credits so some low-income Americans wouldn’t have to enroll in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. But he has stressed that the cost of these changes could be covered without cutting benefits or services. McCain’s campaign responded to Obama's Roanoke remarks, saying the Democratic front-runner was committing “Medicare malpractice” and spreading lies by perpetuating the Center for American Progress Fund analysis. It’s unclear whether McCain could extract sufficient savings using the methods he’s outlined to achieve his "budget neutral" goal. Still, the Center for American Progress Fund analysis flatly assumes McCain will cut Medicare benefits and services when McCain has not even broached the idea in speeches or statements. Obama is overstepping by repeating the analysis’ conclusion and portraying the dollar amount of the cuts as part and parcel of McCain’s plan. We rule his claim False.

pomt-09030	"When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/07/doug-macginnitie/secretary-state-hopeful-doug-macginnitie-said-repu/	The barnyard brawl otherwise known as the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state reached a new political milestone: its first attack ad. And guess what? Secretary of State Brian Kemp, your rival Doug MacGinnitie says you should be ashamed. MacGinnitie's commercial, which he posted on YouTube, emerged in an online skirmish over which of the two Republicans is a better Republican. On June 9, Kemp posted on YouTube a speech he made during a Cobb County GOP breakfast in which he accused MacGinnitie of failing to vote in a Republican primary for two decades. We ruled that claim False in an earlier item. MacGinnitie, a former Sandy Springs city councilman, fired back June 23 with an attack ad on his campaign's YouTube page. It said that Kemp, a Gov. Sonny Perdue appointee who said he helped build the GOP in Georgia, voted in Democratic primaries. "When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats," a voice said on the YouTube video. Kemp defected three times: 1996, 1998 and 2000, according to the announcer. "Saying one thing and doing another -- that’s hypocrisy. You should be ashamed," it concludes. A Republican candidate voted for a Democrat? Say it ain't so. We requested Kemp's voting history from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, which keeps election records. They show Kemp did cast votes in three state Democratic primaries: 1996, 1998 and 2000. This means that Kemp voted three times for Democrats, as the commercial said. But those same records also show those votes were exceptions to the rule. Kemp has voted 33 times since 1992. Of his votes in primary elections, eight were in Republican contests: the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential primaries; and the 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 state primaries. Kemp also voted in three other Republican races: two state primary runoffs (2002 and 2006) and a special election in 2007. Kemp voted in Democratic primaries to have a say in local politics, campaign consultant Joel McElhannon said. He lives in Clarke County, where Athens is located. Historically, the area has been so heavily Democratic that many conservatives run as Democrats, McElhannon said. Some races are decided in the Democratic primary. "To have input in local offices like County Commission -- where decisions are made that directly impact his businesses and his family’s quality of life -- Brian voted in a few Democrat primaries in the '90s to support conservative, pro-business local candidates running in those Democrat primaries," McElhannon wrote in an e-mail. Elections records support the Kemp campaign's assessment. In the 2000 general primary, in which Kemp chose a Democratic ballot, there were no Republican challengers in several races, according to Athens-Clarke County Board of Elections records. They included contests for sheriff, two county commissioner seats and two state House slots. Although Democrats have become less dominant in Clarke during the past decade, they remain a driving force in local politics. In the 2008 Clarke general primary, Kemp was among only 39 percent of voters who chose a Republican ballot, according to Georgia secretary of state records. Sixty-one percent of voters selected a Democratic ballot. While MacGinnitie is correct that Kemp voted in three Democratic primaries, his conclusion that his opponent is guilty of "hypocrisy" is misleading. It ignores the political dynamics of Kemp's home county as well the bulk of his voting history. We rate MacGinnitie's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12140	On Foxconn deal, "3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/11/melissa-sargent/wisconsin-offering-pay-taiwan-tech-firm-foxconn-1-/	When Republican Gov. Scott Walker said iPhone manufacturer Foxconn was bringing 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin, we drew the line on his exuberance at Half True. Even the Taiwanese company itself has said only there is potential for 13,000 jobs, and that its initial plans call for 3,000. But some Democrats, including state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, have also been overly effusive in criticizing the up to $3 billion in incentives Walker wants to give Foxconn. Sargent, who made news in early 2017 for proposals to legalize marijuana and eliminate the state’s "tampon tax," posted this tweet on Aug. 2, 2017 -- a week after Foxconn announced in the East Room at the White House that it had chosen Wisconsin for its first major American factory: 3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job. #foxconn She had already made the claim in her official newsletter. The idea that the state would pay incentives to Foxconn worth more than $1 million per job might sound absurd on its face. And as we’ll see, Sargent took down her tweet. But we are talking some colossal numbers here. Half-a-million dollars per job, anyone? No, it’s not $1 million per job Under the deal it made with the state, Foxconn agrees to invest $10 billion to construct a facility in Wisconsin and create up to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin agrees to, among other things, provide up to $3 billion in incentives. Sargent’s staff told us her $1 million-per-job claim was based on a column posted on the Bloomberg Businessweek website that was written by Tim Culpan. Culpan is a Taiwan-based technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly, a commentary site. He wrote that Wisconsin "is paying as much as $1 million per job." Culpan’s $1 million claim was widely circulated -- by state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers, who is weighing a run for governor in 2018; state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse; and a host of national media, including Vanity Fair, a Washington Post columnist, The Atlantic and others. If you take $3 billion in incentives -- the amount cited in Sargent’s tweet -- and divide it by 3,000 jobs, you get $1 million per job. But the $3 billion is the maximum -- to be paid only if Foxconn meets several requirements, including creating 13,000 jobs. If fewer jobs are created, the incentives paid are less. So, what is the cost per job? What the per-job cost might be The $3 billion -- up to $200 million per year for 15 years -- would amount to nearly 50 times the previous record paid by Wisconsin taxpayers, when the state in 2010 offered $65 million in subsidies to keep Mercury Marine from moving a factory from Fond du Lac to Oklahoma. The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates it would take 25 years for taxpayers to recover the bulk of that -- the $2.85 billion the state would be paying Foxconn in cash. (The other $150 million would be provided through a sales tax exemption.) As for the per-job cost, we turned to an analysis by the Wisconsin Budget Project. The project is part of Kids Forward, formerly known as the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a left-leaning nonprofit. The $2.85 billion in cash payments, according to the analysis, would amount to $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created. An important note: As the analysis and Culpan noted, and as economist Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research told us, the more Foxconn gears its plant for robotics, the fewer jobs it will create -- and thus the per-job cost of the incentives will be higher. Asked about Sargent’s taking down her tweet, one of her staff members told us the Bloomberg column "was early," and that as more details of the incentive package were released, "it became clear that estimates were more nuanced, and Melissa removed the tweet to prevent any confusion or misinformation." The news reporting, however, had been clear: up to $3 billion in incentives only if 13,000 jobs were created, not 3,000. The staffer, citing the Wisconsin Budget Project analysis, also told us there will be costs to taxpayers beyond the $3 billion, such as local government spending on infrastructure improvements and state borrowing for Interstate 94 improvements. But Sargent’s tweet referred only to the $3 billion in incentives, not those other potential costs. Our rating In a tweet she later took down, Sargent said that on the Foxconn deal, "3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job." The per-job cost could never reach $1 million if only 3,000 jobs are created; the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created. An analysis projects the per-job cost at $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created. We rate Sargent’s statement False.

pomt-00761	"Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/15/tim-cook/apples-tim-cook-texas-considering-law-punish-clerk/	A Texas lawmaker’s attempt to restrict the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses drew backlash all the way from Silicon Valley. In an op-ed article for The Washington Post, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook suggested certain states are being transparent in their efforts to discriminate against others, particularly those of the LGBT community. Cook, who announced he was gay in October 2014, used Texas as an example: "Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year." Cook was also speaking out against Indiana’s "Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which was signed into state law at the end of March by Republican Gov. Mike Pence. The law sparked a national outcry over whether it permitted businesses the ability to discriminate against customers based on religious beliefs, criticism that quieted after Indiana lawmakers amended the legislation to include specific protections for gays and lesbians. But this doesn’t mean other similar bills haven’t been filed in other state legislators including Texas. And is such legislation under consideration in the Lone Star state? Apple doesn't elaborate To our inquiry, Apple Inc. spokeswoman Rachel Wolf declined to say where Cook got his information or to otherwise comment. But we have a hunch Cook was referring to House Bill 623, filed by state Rep. Cecil Bell, R-Magnolia, on Jan. 7, 2015 and drew more than 40 House Republican co-authors though no senator filed a companion. Bell’s HB 623, titled the "Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act," would block pay, pension and benefits of state or local government employees who issue a same-sex marriage license. Of course, hundreds of proposals are offered by legislators that don’t get voted on. And, given Apple Inc.’s silence, we don’t know how Cook decided this proposal was "being considered." In contrast, legislative records indicate HB 623 was referred to a House committee Feb 23 but as of April 14, 2015, more than two weeks after Cook spoke, hadn’t been set for a hearing, though Bell earlier told us he’d requested one. Bell told the Texas Tribune in January 2015 that he filed the proposal to prevent any federal court or federal action from allowing gay marriage in Texas. "The federal government is trying to act to create moral standards, and that’s just not acceptable," Bell said. By phone, Bell told us Cook’s description was a "correct assessment" of HB 623. He said county clerks are currently not authorized to issue same-sex marriage licenses in Texas, where the Constitution was amended in 2005 to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Bell said those same employees should not be compensated for doing activities that are against state law. "As with any job, we are subject to the laws that we’re working under," Bell said. HB 623 v. SCOTUS Next, we wondered if a state law can outflank a Supreme Court ruling. Along those lines, we hunted other perspectives. Here’s what’s coming up: On April 28, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a 150-minute argument regarding four gay marriage cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee challenging a law in each state. Then, before the court’s current term ends in June 2015, the justices are expected to make a ruling — potentially on whether gays and lesbians have the constitutional right to marry or states have the authority to decide restrictions one by one. Asked for his assessment, Jonathan Saenz of the conservative Texas Values group, which says it seeks "to preserve and advance a culture of family values," told us the court might stop short of a sweeping move. "No one knows how" the court will rule or even if it will rule, Saenz emailed. Also, he said, its "ruling may not settle or clarify anything." Another take: A January 2015 USA Today news article suggested that if the justices determine gays have a right to marry based on the 14th Amendment, and that states have to recognize these marriages when licensed by other states, then Texas’ gay marriage ban would no longer be upheld in federal court. Significantly, as hinted by Cook, Bell’s proposal includes language to supersede the Supreme Court, if necessary. Specifically, section "H" of his proposal states: "The State is not subject to suit in law or equity pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the United States Constitution for complying with the provisions of this section, regardless of a contrary federal court ruling." Dan Quinn of the liberal Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as "monitoring far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders," suggested this means that under HB 623, even if the Supreme Court endorses same-sex marriage, a Texas county clerk who issues a same-sex marriage license would face state penalties. "The intention here is to pass laws that would subvert a Supreme Court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban," Quinn said. Earlier, Bell told us if HB 623 makes it into law, litigation might prove necessary to resolve whether Texas government employees could be penalized for issuing same-sex marriage licenses even after the U.S. Supreme Court’s endorsement of gay marriage. "Conjecturally, it will call another lawsuit to determine the interaction between state laws and the power of the U.S. Supreme Court," Bell said. Not so fast, lawyers on opposite sides of the Supreme Court fight told us by phone. Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, which says it’s the nation’s largest LGBT civil rights organization, and Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor, each said that if the justices agree on a constitutional right to gay marriage, that judgment would apply in every state, regardless of state laws declaring otherwise. Wardle, who led in writing a March 2015 brief to the court pointing out the limited number of nations that allow gay marriage, said of the Texas proposal’s section H: "In all candor, that’s some state legislator-politician’s dream. It’s not reality. The states cannot say we are going to order our courts to not follow the Constitution." Warbelow called the section a kind of "court stripping," generally meaning an effort to eliminate a court’s duties. State legislators can try to do this for state, but not federal, courts, she said. Our ruling Cook said: "Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year." Cook fairly summarized Bell’s legislation. But clarification was missing in that the proposal wasn’t "being considered" by lawmakers either then or when we completed our review a couple of weeks later. Like a lot of bills, HB 623 awaited legislative attention. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-07774	"State employees haven't received a raise in five or six years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/22/florida-department-corrections-worker/state-worker-fires-back-gov-rick-scott-says-worker/	Some of the more than 100,000 faceless state workers that Florida Gov. Rick Scott has targeted as ways to slash government spending are standing up and pushing back. Scott has proposed cutting the state government payroll by roughly 10 percent over two years, wants employees to redirect 5 percent of their salary to retirement benefits, and is asking employees to accept cuts to their health care benefits. "If you work in the private sector, here's the things you have to do: Your overhead has to come down each and every year as a percentage of revenues. Every year," Scott said in defense of his budget proposal for 2011-13. "That has not happened in state government." But state government workers already have been asked to sacrifice plenty, some say. On Feb. 21, 2011, during a meet-and-greet with Department of Corrections workers in Tallahassee, Scott faced a pointed question from a corrections department employee about the proposed cuts. "You said to hold you accountable," the employee, speaking from the audience, said to Scott. "State employees have seen, since the Bush administration, a reduction in state employees. I have been with this agency for many years. And I've seen where our staff has been significantly cut. We are required to do more with less. State employees haven't received a raise in five or six years. You're asking us to contribute to our pension plan and contribute more to our insurance. My question is simple: What have you required for the wealthiest Floridians to contribute to the state revenues?" Scott didn't directly answer the question in his response, according to the St. Petersburg Times, and instead offered a quick lesson in capitalism. You can listen to the exchange here. The plight of state employees certainly has been an issue in Wisconsin, where Republican Gov. Scott Walker is trying to remove collective bargaining rights for many state workers, resulting in massive protests and counter-protests. The issue hasn't reached such a fever pitch in Florida, but Scott's proposals are being met with resistance from union groups and many legislators. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we plan to spend significant time checking claims about state workers, their benefits, and Scott's and the Legislature's plans. In this case, we wanted to check the claim by the state worker -- who was not identified in news stories -- that "state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years." The answer comes from the Florida Department of Management Services, which in effect serves as the state human resources agency. The department tracks general pay raises for state employees as part of its annual workforce report. State workers received a 3 percent general pay adjustment on Oct. 1, 2006, their last general wage increase. State workers did receive a $1,000 lump-sum bonus on Nov. 1, 2007, and eligible Florida Highway Patrol law enforcement employees received a 5 percent raise effective Oct. 1, 2008. There were no pay adjustments included in the 2009-10 or 2010-11 budget. Employees remain eligible for possible merit pay increases. As of June 30, 2010, the Department of Management Services reported that of the 105,031 people working in the state personnel system, more than 74,000 -- about 70 percent of them -- worked at a yearly salary of less than $40,000. A state employee asking a pointed question about Scott's proposal to cut benefits for state workers noted that state workers haven't received a raise in "five or six years." The last general pay adjustment for state employees occurred on Oct. 1, 2006, almost four years and five months ago. And state employees did receive a lump-sum $1,000 bonus in 2007, though that did not affect their salary rate. Those two details add more context to the worker's claim.

pomt-03784	On changing the rules governing judicial conflicts of interest	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/29/ed-fallone/roggensack-says-fallone-changed-positions-recusal/	In a campaign with few flash points, the March 22, 2013 exchange between Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack and challenger Ed Fallone qualified as a standout moment. At a debate organized by the State Bar of Wisconsin and We the People/Wisconsin, Fallone repeated his criticism of Roggensack for helping change a rule so that getting a campaign contribution from a litigant is not enough on its own to force a judge to step down from a case. Roggensack defended the rule change -- but also accused Fallone, a law professor at Marquette University, of changing his position from acceptance of the rule to aggressive criticism of it. "I do think his position is a bit different tonight," Roggensack said, comparing statements Fallone made in January to his criticism at the debate and in his TV ads. Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to measure whether a political figure has changed positions. It’s not a measure of whether any change is good politics or good policy, just whether the person has been consistent. The rule in question was written after several years of intense election activity in Supreme Court races featuring big spending and fundraising by candidates and major TV ad buys by ideological interest groups for or against the candidates. In late 2008, the court began considering the standards for when a justice should recuse himself or herself from hearing a case. In 2009, on a 4-3 vote it decided endorsements, campaign contributions and independently run ads in themselves are not enough to force a judge off of a case. The judicial ethics code still requires recusal if the judge has personal bias toward a litigant, has business ties to lawyers in a case, has a financial stake in the outcome, a relative is involved or the judge has taken a public position on the issue. Roggensack defended the rule, saying it would block mischief by donors who later want to force a judge off a case. Judges, she noted, can still voluntarily remove themselves. Fallone says lawyers should be able to make a recusal motion solely because of concern over a campaign donation. Another important bit: Roggensack said in the 2013 campaign that the change was in line with the court’s earlier ruling in Donohoo v. Action Wisconsin. In that 2008 case, one side sought to have then-Justice Louis Butler removed from a case because Butler’s campaign had received a $300 donation from a lawyer for the other side, and was endorsed by another lawyer. The court ruled, with no dissenters, that neither the endorsements nor the contributions meant that Justice Butler was disqualified by law from participating in the case. Now let’s review Fallone’s public statements on recusal. In 2011, before his entry into the race, Fallone signed a petition to recall Gov. Scott Walker. When he decided to run, the move prompted some to say he would be precluded from hearing matters related to Walker or even state government in general. Fallone disagreed, saying that justices can engage in various forms of political activity without having to recuse themselves from a case. In a blog post, he touched on campaign contributions. "If the judge has received something of value from a party or an attorney, then they should recuse themselves because they are presumed to be in that person’s debt." He added: "However, campaign contributions received by a judge from a party or their lawyer don’t count as something of value unless the contributions are disproportionately large." So, that’s our starting position. Fallone entered the race in December 2012 and started actively campaigning in January 2013. When he did, he criticized the court and said people have "lost faith that it is independent of politics and special interests." His comments on recusal in general were cautious; Fallone warned that "there’s been a lot of gamesmanship" in trying to force justices off of cases for their political ties -- something that echoed the point Roggensack made when the rule took effect.. Roggensack points to a Fallone interview taped early in his campaign by Wisconsin Eye as evidence of a Fallone flip flop. In that January 16, 2013 interview, Wisconsin Eye senior producer Steve Walters asked Fallone to speak about the "debate over whether lawyers who contribute should force a justice off the case." Here is the exchange: Fallone: "The court has considered that issue. And the current rule is that the justices need not recuse themselves because they’ve been endorsed by a particular person or organization, or received a contribution from that organization." Walters: "Is that a fair standard? Would you change it?" Fallone: "I’m not running for the court to change those standards. Were I running for the Legislature, were I still an academic full-time, I might speak out as to my preference, but right now, I think that the court has spoken, the rules are in place. It’s something that at some point the U.S. Supreme Court has said, notwithstanding the Wisconsin rule, that at some point contributions can create a perception of bias that may implicate due process concerns..." End of comment. About three weeks later, just before the primary, Fallone directly discussed the Roggensack-supported rule at a candidate forum. Notably, that Feb. 7, 2013, appearance was the first time Fallone and Roggensack had debated. "That rule has opened the door for special interest spending on judicial elections, and it certainly creates the perception if not the reality that justice is for sale," Fallone said. "That was a rule that was supported by Justice Roggensack, and after I’m elected to the court I will work with my colleagues to amend or repeal that rule." Fallone said the rule change "allows a party in a pending case to make campaign contributions to a judge sitting on the case and prevents the opposing parties from challenging the impartiality of the judge solely on the basis of those campaign contributions." On Feb. 28, 2013, shortly after advancing past the primary, Fallone’s campaign issued a news release saying Fallone "throughout his campaign" has stated publicly he will work to overturn the rule. Turning his attention to defeating Roggensack, he dialed up the volume on his criticism and complaints about court partisanship. In a TV ad, he said Roggensack had "risked the integrity of the court." An on-screen graphic displayed the phrase, "Legalized Bribery," citing a newspaper editorial about the rule. Back on Wisconsin Eye, this time on March 19, Walters asked about the ad’s accusations and Fallone’s objections to the rule. Fallone responded: "This is the problem with campaign cash from special interest groups, flooding into our judicial races. The way to regulate it right now, as a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the only way to get control on it is to allow it to become the basis of a recusal motion." He added: "If the party feels that the judge in their case might be biased or influenced because they’ve received campaign contributions … or independent spending on their behalf -- from the people on the other side of the case -- that party could ask the judge to step down. And that’s the way the law was, that’s the way the Supreme Court rules were, in Wisconsin. The ‘Roggensack rule’ was pushed, was a change that Justice Roggensack voted for, and defended very prominently..." Stop the tape. That’s the chronology of what happened. Let’s take stock. Did Fallone take one position in mid-January and dramatically reverse himself just a few weeks later on his way toward making a big deal out of the recusal issue in March? He said no, at the March 22, 2013, debate, and in an interview with us. His explanation: He was referring in the January Wisconsin Eye interview to the Donohoo ruling, not the Roggensack-backed rule. This gets technical. The Donohoo ruling, in the case involving Justice Butler, was a test of whether justices would decide a fellow justice should not hear a case. Fallone thinks the court was correct to decide not to force a fellow justice to step aside, so he told us he spoke favorably about the status quo in the Wisconsin Eye interview. In contrast, Fallone said he objects to the rule Roggensack voted for because it goes much further than Donohoo by making it essentially futile for lawyers even to ask judges to step down voluntarily if the issue is just a campaign donation, even a large one. Fallone said his recollection was that Walters’ question in January on Wisconsin Eye was "related to whether or not the justice … could make the determination of impartiality or whether the other justices could make that determination," he said at the March 22, 2013, forum after Roggensack accused him of flopping. However, the video shows Walters does not present the question that way. He does use the word "force," though, which Fallone says made him think about the Donohoo case. Fallone’s other recollection about the January interview was that "I did not speak to the issue of recusal based on campaign contributions by a party or lawyer in the case." The Wisconsin Eye video, though, shows that Walters did in fact ask directly about campaign contributions by lawyers. Political strategy may have played a role in how he couched his answer. Fallone was cryptic when we talked to him about it, saying: "there was one race before the primary and another one after." In January, Vince Megna, the third candidate in the primary, was running a nakedly partisan race while Fallone was trying to portray himself as above the fray. Our rating At PolitiFact, we award a Full Flop when an official makes a "major reversal of position" that is a complete flip-flop. We don’t think that fits here. Fallone sharply criticized the rule both in both the primary election and in the general election, and he went after Roggensack on it the first chance he had in a face-to-face meeting. But did he partially change his position or make inconsistent statements, which would earn him a Half Flip? A plain reading of the Wisconsin Eye interview is that Fallone didn’t express a problem at all with the Supreme Court’s take on recusals. In response to a pretty general, and pretty clear, question, he offered a sweeping endorsement of the status quo, which includes the rule backed by Roggensack. So the answer is strikingly inconsistent with his rhetoric only a few weeks later. For that, we think this merits a Half Flip.	None	Ed Fallone	None	None	None	2013-03-29T14:36:40	2013-03-22	['None']

pomt-05195	"Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/12/samuel-wurzelbacher/samuel-joe-plumber-wurzelbacher-says-marcy-kaptur-/	Almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion under most circumstances, abortion remains a political hot button. Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher, the Republican congressional candidate in Ohio's 9th District, demonstrates that in a news release, video and series of Twitter tweets aimed at Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur. "I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur has the same belief system as someone in the Chinese politburo or that she thinks it's OK to kill unborn babies. And I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur believes in gendercide," he says in the campaign video. "But Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl." That's an emotional pitch. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Wurzlbacher’s campaign said the vote was on H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, or "PRENDA." The bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, would have made it a federal crime with a five-year prison sentence to perform or force a woman to undergo a gender-selection abortion -- a practice that is most common in some Asian countries where families that want sons abort female fetuses. Under the bill, doctors, nurses and medical personnel who do not report suspected gender-related abortions would also face prison and a fine. The male partner and parents of the woman having the abortion would be able to sue for damages. The woman would be exempt from prosecution or civil suit. Republicans said in debate that gender-selection abortion amounts to "gendercide" and a "war on women" because it is female fetuses that are most often targeted -- rhetoric that effectively turned the tables on Democrats who previously knocked Republicans for their stances on the Violence Against Women Act and who are pushing legislation requiring equal pay for men and women. The bill's backers supported their charge of "gendercide," the Christian Science Monitor reported, by citing a study showing that an analysis of the third child born to Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents in the U.S. "strongly suggest[s]" prenatal sex selection. But a review of the legislation by the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and rights, argues that such practices are not widespread in the United States and that the studies to support the bill cannot prove that gender-selection abortions are a significant problem, even in particular immigrant communities. "What is conclusively known," wrote Guttmacher's Sneha Barot, "is that the U.S. sex ratio at birth in 2005 stood at 105 boys to 100 girls, squarely within biologically normal parameters." In a vote on May 31, the House bill won a majority of representatives -- 246 votes in favor and 168 against -- but failed because it was considered under a suspension of House rules. That procedure, normally used for non-controversial measures, limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Franks said in a news interview before the vote that he expected the measure to fail, but that it was a strategic goal to force Democrats to vote against it. "I think we’re doing the right thing strategically," he told The Washington Post, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if GOP candidates and conservative groups used the vote to attack Democratic opponents. Franks was correct on that point. In one subsequent statement, Wurzelbacher described Kaptur as "supporting abortions based on gender and skin color." We contacted Kaptur's campaign. Spokesman Steve Fought said the congresswoman opposed the bill because of privacy issues it raised and its potential consequences. "How do you prove someone had a gender-based abortion?" he asked, asserting that the proof would involve medical personnel knowing a woman's reason for an abortion and whether and when she knew the sex of a fetus. Knowing the gender of a fetus would involve sonograms, he said. Medical personnel fearing the possibility of prosecution could reduce the use of sonograms, against the health interest of fetuses, children and mothers -- particularly in the Asian and immigrant communities the bill targets. "It was an eminently bad piece of legislation that was introduced strictly for political posturing, under suspension of the rules and not through committee," Fought said. "The video proves that point. It was a show bill. They wanted to get people on the record voting against it so they can demagogue it." Where does that leave us? Wurzelbacher’s statement is accurate. Kaptur did vote against PRENDA. The bill would ban gender-selection abortions. But additional information is needed for clarification. Kaptur's record on abortion has been consistent. In a story about this vote, Roll Call, a Washington publication, described her as a Democrat who opposes abortion. But in this case, her staff said, concerns about other effects and consequences of the legislation played a role in her vote. And, the bill’s leading sponsor acknowledged that political strategy drove the process under which it was considered. On the Truth-O-Meter, Wurzelbacher's claim rates Mostly True.

The decision to hold on to nearly $10 million in campaign donations prompted cries that Crist was flip-flopping -- like this statement from the Republican Party of Florida, or this video on the campaign website for Republican senate candidate Marco Rubio. While Crist may have earned a Full-Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for switching parties to bolster his Senate bid, we wondered whether Crist flip-flopped on giving refunds. Let's start with what Crist said about refunding donations before he made his independent run official on April 29, 2010. April 26, speaking to reporters in Miami. Reporter: Will you return Republican donor money, Republican Party money since you received that money as a Republican? Crist: You know, I think that's a decision that you have to make if you made a decision to go independent. I haven't made that decision yet. Crist also had this response for St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith when asked about refunding the donations:"Anybody has the right and the opportunity to ask. I think we spent it though." Next we'll look at what he said after announcing he would leave the Republican Party. Four days later, Crist appeared before a national audience on MSNBC's Morning Joe. April 30, interview with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Scarborough: "There are a lot of Republicans that are going to be asking you to give them the money back they gave you when you were running as a Republican, are you going to give them that money back or are you going to keep it?" Crist: "Well, No. 1, nobody's asked me yet. Not one person has asked me yet. And I think they realize that the reality is they gave it to my campaign, they gave it to me in order to espouse the ideas I believe in." Scarborough: "If they ask for money back, will you give it back to them or will you keep it for the campaign?" Crist: "Ah, probably give it back to them. It's not that big a deal. What really matters is we're able to communicate our message." So it's pretty clear in those comments that Crist favors returning the donations. But before we make our Flip-O-Meter ruling, here's what Crist said about two weeks later: May 12, speaking to reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections office when registering as no party affiliation. "People gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause," Crist told reporters. "That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida." The same day, Crist campaign spokeswoman Michelle Todd made it clear to reporters that the money was non-refundable at this point. "We have never made an official statement before," Todd said, in an interview with Miami Herald political reporter Beth Reinhard. "It is now the official statement. They donated to the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign and it's still the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign." Crist explained his decision a day later in a meeting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board. He was asked if there would have been any downside to returning the money: "Probably wouldn't be. ... I want it. I need it. I want to win." And one last note, as he opened his campaign headquarters in St. Petersburg on May 15, Crist was heckled by someone in the crowd who asked, "What about the guys who gave you money when you were a Republican?!" "I'm going to keep it!" Crist cheerfully responded, drawing roars of approval. (Watch the St. Petersburg Times' video here and check out his wink around 3:10 into the clip.) We should point out that Crist has returned some campaign donations, according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission, but for a different reason. He returned $76,250 in donations from the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to a bankruptcy trustee, and another $9,600 from Rothstein and his wife to the U.S. Marshall's office. Also, Republican donor Al Hoffman got his $4,800 returned in February because of allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer. So in less than three weeks, Crist went from telling reporters he had yet to make a decision on running for indepedent, to running as an independent and "probably" giving the money back, to "officially" declaring he would keep the money. Our main issue is Crist's use of the word "probably" during his Morning Joe interview. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines probably as "insofar as seems reasonably true, factual, or to be expected: without much doubt." Crist said he would "probably give it back to them," leading donors to believe that as the dictionary states it was "to be expected" or "without much doubt" that they would see some of their cash back from Crist. We find Crist completely changed his position from entertaining the idea of giving the money back, to definitely not giving the money back. Our verdict: Full Flop.

pomt-01664	Says Keene, N.H., requested a "military-grade armored personnel truck," citing their annual Pumpkin Festival as "a possible target" for terrorists.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/aug/20/john-oliver/right-there-application/	With protests continuing in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting of an unarmed teenager, police have rolled out an arsenal of weapons, vehicles and riot gear to help quell any unrest in the St. Louis suburb. While local officials say they’re trying to maintain safety and protect property, the sight of police officers in combat gear has sparked a national conversation about whether the police need to be outfitted with military-grade equipment. HBO television host John Oliver took aim at the militarization of civilian police forces in his Sunday night show, Last Week Tonight, that aired August 17. Oliver said federal funding for anti-terrorism efforts has been doled out on such a massive scale that even Keene -- with fewer than 30,000 residents -- secured a military-grade truck for its police department. "This has happened on such a scale that it’s enabled small towns like Keene, N.H., to apply for a BearCat, a military-grade armored personnel truck, which they needed because, as their application argued, ‘the terrorism threat is far-reaching and often unforeseen,’ and cited as a possible target their annual Pumpkin Festival." He mused that the armored vehicle would be an effective deterrent for pumpkin smashers. "Good luck easily out-maneuvering that, teenagers with baseball bats!" he said. We wondered whether Oliver was playing straight with the facts, even as he played the episode for laughs. Did the Keene Police Department really cite a terrorism threat at the Pumpkin Festival when it asked for federal money? We checked with Oliver’s staff, but they’re on a two-week break and unable to respond. First, some background on the Pumpkin Festival. It’s held each year in October and draws as many as 70,000 people to downtown Keene. It is best known for the city’s ongoing attempts to set the world record for the most lit jack-o’-lanterns in one place. So what does an iconic New England fall festival have to do with armored vehicles and terrorism? Keene’s city council accepted a federal grant in 2012 to purchase the armored personnel carrier, named a "BearCat" by its manufacturer. At the time, a city councilor called the $285,933 vehicle a "poster child of waste." The BearCat hit the streets on Nov. 20, 2012, after a contentious debate among Keene residents about its necessity. Funding came from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through a grant managed by the New Hampshire Department of Safety. During public meetings leading up to the purchase, it appears there was little conversation about the threat of terrorism in southern New Hampshire. The discussion centered mainly around how the vehicle would be deployed during routine law enforcement procedures, such as evacuating residents during a flood or policing the campus of Keene State College. "The original reason for filing the grant application was to acquire the piece of equipment in case there was some kind of crisis -- some kind of emergency that required the use of that type of equipment," said Keene Mayor Kendall Lane, who was serving on the city council at the time. He said in his recollection, the BearCat has been deployed only twice since it was acquired. In both instances, police were dealing with potentially armed subjects. Lane said Keene didn't cite the Pumpkin Fest as the only reason to get the BearCat, and for that reason, he believes Oliver’s bit was a little misleading. "It was humorous, but you know, the implication was that the Pumpkin Fest attracts a few hundred people in a rural part of America that would never be subject to a terrorist act. It was humorous. It was funny, but it was miscast." By our reading, though, Oliver is correct that the Keene Police Department’s written application for federal funds focused mainly on terrorism -- aligning with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security. Keene’s Pumpkin Festival is among several annual events that draw large crowds and are "susceptible to terrorist attacks," the application states. Keene Police Chief Kenneth Meola also mentioned the threat of terrorism during a meeting with Keene State College students in February 2012. "Do I think al-Qaeda is going to target Pumpkin Fest? No, but are there fringe groups that want to make a statement? Yes, and we should prepare for that," he said. "It is a target in the New Hampshire region." Jim Massery, government sales manager for the Massachusetts company that manufactures the vehicles, also alluded to the threat of terrorism during an interview with Huffington Post. "We don’t know what the terrorists are thinking," said Massery, of Lenco Armored Vehicles. "No one predicted that terrorists would take over airplanes on Sept. 11. If a group of terrorists decide to shoot up a shopping mall in a town like Keene, wouldn't you rather be prepared?" While the Department of Homeland Security perceived a significant enough threat in Keene to authorize funds for the BearCat, Oliver isn’t the only commentator who has second-guessed the decision. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, detailed Keene's vehicle purchase in his 2012 report on misguided and wasteful spending in terror-prevention grant programs. The American Civil Liberties Union also devoted a section of its comprehensive June 2014 report on the militarization of American police departments to Keene’s BearCat. "Not even Keene city officials believed that the city actually needed the BearCat to thwart terrorism," the ACLU report reads. "To explain why the police included the word ‘terrorism’ on their application for federal funding for this purchase, a city council member said, ‘Our application talked about the danger of domestic terrorism, but that’s just something you put in the grant application to get the money. What red-blooded American cop isn’t going to be excited about getting a toy like this? That’s what it comes down to.’" Our ruling Oliver said the Keene Police Department cited its annual Pumpkin Festival as a potential target for terrorism when it applied for grant money to buy an armored personnel truck. Keene’s mayor says the city had a variety of reasons for seeking the BearCat, but Oliver was correct to state that the city cited the Pumpkin Festival as a possible target for terrorists. We rate Oliver’s claim True.	None	John Oliver	None	None	None	2014-08-20T11:21:17	2014-08-17	['None']
pomt-04488	"In one year, (President Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-provided-90-billion/	In the battle of big numbers at the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney used one five times to attack President Barack Obama’s energy policy: $90 billion. That was the price tag of "breaks to the green energy world" Obama provided "in one year," Romney said. Later, he elaborated the president had put that money "into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1." So, tens of billions funneled from the Obama administration to troubled companies for alternative energy — in one year. Really? We asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion. Five times The number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill. According to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for "clean energy investments." Here’s how Romney used the number in the debate. Obama had attacked $4 billion a year in "corporate welfare" for the oil industry. (His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of "tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production." PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.) Romney fired back: First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. … And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. So, Romney contrasted a "tax break" of a few billion for oil companies with "breaks" worth tens of billions for "green energy." Later in the debate, he got more specific: But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. Finally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have "gone out of business." You put $90 billion into green jobs. And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. It’s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn’t fare well. ‘One year’ of ‘breaks’ Back to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy. Were there $90 billion in "breaks"? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in — some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant "tax breaks" like those for oil and gas. Rather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending. "The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks," said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent? Meanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money — such as for high-speed rail — states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011. So, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year. ‘Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1’ We’ll assume Romney meant "solar and wind" and "Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1," as merely examples of Obama’s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus. But even as examples, they’re problematic. "Solar and wind" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion. Solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn’t use it all. Fisker and Tesla — troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush — had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion. So, just what did make up the $90 billion? The Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here’s the majority of it: • About a third of the money, $29 billion, was for energy efficiency, such as "$5 billion to pay for energy efficiency retrofits in low-income homes." States and local governments directed a lot of the money. Grabell’s book on the stimulus says about 600,000 low-income homes were made more energy efficient — with, say, new furnaces, thermostats, windows, insulation or repairs. • About 20 percent of the money, $18 billion, was for traditional transit and high-speed rail. The money went to more than 30 states for infrastructure projects. • More than 10 percent of it, $10 billion, was marked for modernization of the electrical grid. Utilities used the money to install digital meters to track energy usage in real time, and for things like sensors and substation devices, Grabell reported. That’s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney’s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies. Less than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy. Those investments are more in line with Romney’s characterization. But they represent less than half the "$90 billion" he repeatedly mentioned. Why does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, "and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business." It’s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year — a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney’s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported. And the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors. "A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business," said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? "Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. " Our ruling Romney used the number "$90 billion" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, "In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1." That is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn’t provided in one year, wasn’t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn’t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn’t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn’t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla. In reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure . We rate his claim False.

pomt-12220	"Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: ‘The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/19/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republicans-mislead-ad-linking-bill-nelson-elizabe/	Republicans are attempting to link U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has pushed for single-payer health care. A Facebook ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee ties Nelson, D-Fla., to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. "Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough," states the Facebook ad, which started July 5. Then it quotes Warren saying "the next step is single payer." The text on the screen continues: "Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time. Tell Sen. Nelson no to government health care!" Republicans are targeting Nelson because he faces re-election in 2018 in a state won by President Donald Trump and he is likely to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott, a key advocate of repealing the Affordable Care Act. In June, Warren told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats should run on single payer in 2018. It’s possible to view the ad and get the impression that Nelson has supported single payer, a system in which government would provide health care coverage for everyone similar to Canada. A spokeswoman for the NRSC disagreed with that interpretation. She said that the line is a reference to Nelson agreeing with Warren on a majority of votes. The NRSC’s press release announcing the ad raises the question if Nelson will "support Warren’s socialized health care plan." "It’s a fair question, seeing Warren is advocating for Democrats up in 2018 to run on single payer," Katie Martin, NRSC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. We’ll examine the ad’s entire text and issue an overall rating. Nelson said little about single payer Nelson has scarcely mentioned "single payer" at all in the years leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or even since that time. At an October 2005 speech to the Tiger Bay Club of St. Petersburg, the Tampa Tribune paraphrased Nelson’s answer to a question about health care. The Tribune wrote that Nelson said he opposed a universal, single-payer health care program, but that employers should not be the main source of health insurance for individuals. Large groups of consumers organized into purchasing units should replace employers as group insurance purchasers, he said. Some Democrats pushed for a single-payer system leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. (There was a time when Barack Obama supported it, too.) But there wasn’t enough support for that route. In the summer of 2009, Nelson said little about the pending legislation, drawing heat from some Democratic activists. By the fall, he sounded cautiously supportive and called the bill a "starting point." Nelson actually pushed back against those who said the health proposal would end up turning into single payer. For example, during a Senate Committee on Finance markup of the bill on Sept. 29, 2009, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued that "the government plan will eventually lead us to a de facto single-payer system of health care." Nelson disagreed with Grassley’s conclusion. "Now you just made a statement that it will lead to a single payer. How in the world do you make that leap?" Nelson said. Nelson’s office declined to comment for this fact-check; however, on the day the NRSC ad appeared, Nelson addressed the question of his view on single payer while meeting with college students in Orlando. "When people say, ‘Are you for single payer,’ I’m having enough trouble right now just keeping the ACA," Nelson said. "America is not ready for single payer, but America is ready — and has — the ACA. People are trying to take that away and take health care away from 22 million people." Nelson has said he would not vote for the Republican’s Senate health care plan and has called for bipartisan fixes. The legislation has failed to garner sufficient Republican support to proceed. Comparing voting records The NRSC sent us a screengrab of CQ data showing a comparison of Warren’s voting record with Nelson’s record between January 2013 and June 27, 2017. The data shows that Nelson and Warren voted the same way on 1,126 votes out of 1,250, or 90 percent. The fact that members of the same party agree with each other on issues that reach a vote isn’t a surprise in an increasingly partisan atmosphere. However, the issues that reach a vote don’t tell the full story about a senator’s beliefs, University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger said. "The Senate votes on a carefully selected sort of issues, biased toward extremely conservative ideas (to mollify Ted Cruz types), consensus proposals, or middle-of-the-road Democratic proposals," Koger said. "Indeed, one of the reasons the Senate has been dysfunctional is that both parties fight hard to keep many issues from coming to a roll call vote." Voting together on a carefully screened set of issues does not imply agreement on controversial proposals. Our ruling The NRSC said, "Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: 'The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time." The ad suggests that Nelson supports Warren on most things, including a single-payer health care system. Actually, Nelson has said he doesn’t support single payer and wants to focus on preserving current law. His voting record is similar to Warren’s, but members of the same party increasingly vote alike due to a lack of bipartisan votes in the Senate. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04651	"This would be the largest casino in the United States."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/11/its-still-bad-idea/would-proposed-casino-wood-village-be-countrys-lar/	One of the priciest state measure campaigns this fall will be over a proposed private casino in Wood Village in population-rich Multnomah County.Supporters of the state’s first non-tribal casino say it would provide money for schools as well a nearby entertainment center for the family. A similar idea failed with voters two years ago. A coalition of critics calling itself the It's Still a Bad Idea committee called an inaugural press event on Monday to denounce what it calls a "slick campaign" by casino advocates to "mislead voters," according to a press release. The campaign is funded largely by Oregon tribes, which operate their own casinos and could lose money to the private venture. At the event, campaign spokeswoman Cynara Lilly told reporters that The Grange, as it’s called, "would be the largest casino in the United States." Really? In little old Wood Village? That didn’t sound right. Maybe it would be the largest in Oregon, but we knew enough about mega-casinos to know that sounded overblown. First, we checked with Lilly, to make sure we had quoted her correctly. We had, but she wanted to make a clarification. "I did mis-speak," she said to PolitiFact Oregon. "Technically, this would not be the largest casino in the United States. It would be the second largest. It would be the largest in the West." She specified not square footage, but the number of slot machines and gambling tables. That still sounded on the high side. The Grange proposes a 130,000 square-foot casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 gambling tables. That would top the number of video slot machines at Oregon’s largest tribal casino -- the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino-- but 2,200 is pretty much the norm for the big players in Las Vegas. So what gives? And here’s where we get to the fine print. The Grange developers have a business plan for a casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 card tables, but the language in Measure 83 would allow for up to 3,500 slot machines and 150 gaming tables. (Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for Grange developers, said they will build the proposed amount as that’s what the market will bear and they don’t anticipate that changing.) A 3,500-machine casino would be larger than the posh Bellagio in Las Vegas, which has more than 100,000 square feet with 2,400 slot machines. Or Mandalay Bay in Vegas, which has more than 2,000 slot machines. But it would pale next to the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, which has 6,000 slot machines, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tampa, Fla., which "features more than 5,000 slot machines, 110 table games and 50 poker tables." The WinStar World Casino in Oklahoma has 500,000 square feet of "gaming floor" with about 6,700 electronic games and 76 tables. You get the point. Many of these mega-casinos are in the midwest and in the east, so Lilly is on the rightish track when she tells PolitiFact Oregon that a Wood Village casino with 3,500 slot machines would be the largest casino on the West Coast. Certainly it would contain more than twice the floor size of Spirit Mountain Casino. Here’s the problem with that: (1) That’s not what she said at the press event, which was called to counter what they call a deceptive campaign waged by casino advocates, and (2) Grange developers aren’t building a casino with 3,500 video poker machines and 150 card tables. We know! Some of you are probably thinking, how could PolitiFact Oregon be so naive? How could we be so gullible? What’s to stop the private casino people from pitching a smaller casino, then building a larger one? Well, all we can say is that developers would still have to get local permits to build a casino with more slot machines and, according to one legal reading, legislators can change the statutory maximum. In any case, casino opponents are right to call out the larger numbers in the measure. Voters should have that information. But we can’t measure a proposed casino on the maximum number allowed when backers are selling a smaller number. PolitiFact Florida had the same issue in 2011 and fact checkers there went with the developer’s stated number when assessing a claim about a proposed 800,000 square-foot casino in Miami. We follow precedent and go with what the developers say, and we return to the statement. Campaigns bear a special responsibility when making statements for or against anything. They have to have their facts straight, and they have to know what they’re talking about. We understand that people sometimes slip, but campaign people can’t afford to do that. Especially when they have called a press conference to counter deceptive campaigning by the other side. Lilly said that the proposed casino in Wood Village would be the largest in the country, which is not only inaccurate, but downright ridiculous. Her revised statement that the proposed casino would be the second largest in the country isn’t even close to accurate either. That shows a reckless disregard for accuracy.

"Like many times before, President Obama is manipulating the system to get his way: presenting this to the American people as a ‘deal’ instead of what it really is – a treaty to circumvent needing approval by Congress," Westmoreland said. "President Obama and Secretary (John) Kerry also showed a lack of leadership and strength in agreeing to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct." Politifact has fact-checked several claims about the pact, which is an executive agreement, not a treaty subject to congressional approval. For example, we rated False a statement from Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz that said the deal "trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves." This time, a reader from Westmoreland’s congressional district asked Politifact Georgia to truth-test the statement that Obama and Kerry had agreed "to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct." "My understanding is that Iran must meet certain requirements through verification before these sanctions are lifted," the reader wrote. "Can you please investigate this claim?" The historic agreement was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States and was backed by 41 Senate Democrats. It calls for Iran to significantly limit its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for being relieved of economically crippling international sanctions. (Executive agreements, such as this, do not require congressional approval. But many in Congress were upset at this and insisted that the House and Senate have weigh-in. Earlier this year, a law was passed mandating a vote on a resolution of disapproval. Had it passed by two-thirds, it could have blocked the [resident’s legal authority to waive sanctions on Iran in exchange for actions to curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities.But the resolution did not receive the necessary 60-vote majority that is necessary in the Senate to be formally considered; in the House, there were not enough votes in favor of disapproval to overcome a presidential veto. Therefore, the resolution of disapproval failed in both Houses and the deal is going forward.) Opponents say the deal lacks long-term assurances that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. and one of three countries still identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism -- won’t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions and any involvement in terrorism in exchange for having the sanctions lifted. Supporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the short term. They say the U.S. had to make concessions because many of its allies had grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against oil-rich Iran. Initially, we weren’t entirely certain what Westmoreland meant by "conduct." Was it the country’s nuclear policy? Foreign policies? Human rights record? We zeroed in on the nuclear threat after Leigh Claffey, the communications director for Westmoreland, responded when we told her a reader had asked us to fact-check the accuracy of the statement. Claffey said Westmoreland’s statement was based, in part, on the fact that the U.S. does not have any inspectors on the ground to receive firsthand knowledge or confirmation that the Iranians have changed their ways. The U.S. also is not part of the inspection process, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear nonproliferation commitments, is not permitted access to all Iranian sites, she said. Claffey also forwarded us links to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s "21 reasons the Iran deal is a bad deal" and to an opinion piece in The New York Times calling it "the worst agreement in U.S. Diplomatic history." Additionally, she cited a statement from the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracy that read, in part, that "the fatal flaw" of the pact is its sunset clauses, which permit "critical nuclear, arms, and ballistic missile restrictions to disappear over a five- to 15-year period." Long list of requirements Greg Terryn, a research and policy associate with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, said Westmoreland "is mistaken." "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the pact) specifically delays the lifting of any sanctions until the IAEA has verified that Iran is living up to its commitments under the agreement," Terryn said. In the language of the deal, this is described as Adoption Day -- the day Iran must begin working toward its commitments under the agreement, Terryn said. Implementation Day is the day the U.S., United Nations and European Union must waive the implementation of certain sanctions, he said. "Implementation Day only comes about when the IAEA verifies that Iran has fulfilled its initial obligations under the agreement," Terryn said. The agreement lists 82 specific items about its nuclear program that Iran has to change to satisfy the international community. These include reducing the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium down to 300 kg and removing the core of the reactor at Arak and filling it with concrete. Ultimately, the deal rolls back Iran’s nuclear program for more than a decade, pushing back the time it would take Iran to enrich enough nuclear material for one nuclear weapon from a few months to at least one year, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. We contacted several other nuclear-policy experts, only one of whom thought Westmoreland’s statement had merit. "The problem is there are tiers of sanctions -- the United Nations sanctions, the United States sanctions -- and the sanctions are being lifted upfront without Iran having to change its conduct, without Iran having to abide by the agreement itself," said Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Technically, the way the agreement is written, they do not have to change their conduct." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonprofit Arms Control Association in Washington D.C., said the pact "definitely requires Iran to effect radical changes in the conduct and capacity of Iran’s nuclear program before there is any sanctions relief." "There will be no sanctions relief — whatsoever — before ‘Implementation Day,’ and to get to that point Iran must take very substantial steps and put in place tough restrictions that will block its ability to produce nuclear bomb material, allow much more intrusive inspections, and answer questions from the IAEA about past experiments with ‘possible military dimensions,’ " Kimball said. Shawn l. Ramirez, an assistant professor of political science at Emory University, said "numerous ‘proofs’ of compliance with the terms of the agreement are required of Iran over time to actually lift the sanctions." "In fact," Ramirez said, "restoring the sanctions cannot be undone unless all five members of the UN Security Council agree to continue to suspend sanctions — the U.S. has locked in its veto power to punish Iran if Iran doesn’t comply." Our ruling U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said that President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry agreed to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct. The Iran deal may be less than perfect. And there’s certainly reason to be dubious of Iran, one of only three nations that remain on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. But most experts say the agreement does require Iran to make significant changes before some, if not all, sanctions are removed and pushes back the timeframe on Iran’s ability to make a bomb. We rate Westmoreland’s statement False.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2015-10-13T00:00:00	2015-09-11	['Barack_Obama', 'Iran', 'John_Kerry']
pomt-01707	Says GOP primary opponents Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a "compromise vote that cost $788 million" in higher electricity costs.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/10/duey-stroebel/stroebel-says-compromise-vote-opponents-cost-788-m/	Republicans running for Congress in east-central Wisconsin are competing for the title of most uncompromising conservative. Take candidate Duey Stroebel’s attack on fellow state lawmakers Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham in the hotly contested Aug. 12. 2014 GOP primary. The online ad features Grothman explaining, during a candidate forum, a vote he cast in the state Senate that required utilities to sell more electricity generated from wind and other technologies. "There was a bad mandate in the state of Wisconsin," Grothman says in the clip. "Sometimes when you’re in Madison you’re stuck with taking a compromise vote." A snarky-sounding narrator jumps in: "Compromise? A compromise vote that cost $788 million? If career politicians Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham are willing to compromise on conservative principles in Madison, what would they compromise on in Washington?" Did Grothman and Leibham, both state senators, support a change that cost consumers $788 million? In 2006, both voted for a bill requiring electric providers to increase the amount of renewable electricity they sell by two percentage points above their current level by 2010, and by six percentage points above their current level by 2015. The legislation established a statewide goal that 10 percent of all electricity sales in Wisconsin be from renewable resources by 2015. That goal was met in 2013, two years early, the state Public Service Commission announced. (Legislative records show that in 1998 Grothman voted for the original mandate, which set a 2.2 percent goal. Leibham was not yet in the Legislature. Stroebel, a state representative, was elected in 2011.) So, no doubt about their votes. Was the 2006 vote a compromise? The vote on the measure came at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature, but Democrat Jim Doyle was in the governor’s chair. A Republican sponsor, state Sen. Robert Cowles of Green Bay, credited passage to compromises made by utilities and manufacturers to customer and environmental groups. A combination of high energy prices, the improvement of wind- and solar-power technologies and political will helped, he said at the time, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories. Grothman says the vote prevented a mandate that would have been set at higher than 10 percent, but Renew Wisconsin policy director Michael Vickerman recalls that no higher number was on the table. The measure passed 32-1 in the state Senate (and unanimously in the Assembly). State Sen. Tom Reynolds, R- West Allis, cast the lone no vote, saying the legislation would drive up energy bills. Cowles countered it would lead to $2 billion in investments from energy companies that would drive down the cost of producing renewable energy. In 2012, Grothman appeared to sour on the mandate, saying he wanted to freeze it at 2012 levels because windmills had become controversial among residents in his district. What about the price tag? To back up the $788 million figure, the Stroebel ad cites a March 2013 study released by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank. With some Democrats proposing a 25 percent requirement, WPRI said it was timely to study what it calls the "often forgotten" costs of using more renewable energy. To do the research, WPRI turned to The Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based research group interested in limited government. It tangled with environmental groups in Wisconsin in 2009 after criticizing the cost of efforts to fight climate change. The Beacon study did not tally the actual cost to that point to consumers of the renewable mandate. Instead, it used forecasting techniques and various assumptions to predict what the mandate would cost in the four years from 2013 to 2016. The conclusion: $788 million. Paul Bachman, Beacon Hill’s research director and co-author of the study, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the number could be smaller than $788 million because after the study was completed, the state announced that utilities had reached the 10 percent goal earlier than expected. The Beacon study had assumed renewable energy sales would continue to increase as the 2015 deadline approached. The state Public Service Commission in 2014 commented on the impact of that 10 percent goal being met early. "A solid argument could be made that any additional renewable energy added to electric provider portfolios past 2013 will not be driven by (the state mandate)," the agency said. The impact of the mandate should level off or perhaps even decrease at some point, the PSC said. So the $788 million, just a projection to begin with, may well turn out to be high. But that and other numbers in the study appear to be in the ballpark, at least, based on the state Public Service Commission’s studies of actual costs that have been incurred so far. Actual costs studied The PSC’s own studies look backward in time at the costs of the renewables mandate. The cost of the mandate was $532 million over the five years from 2008 through 2012, the agency has calculated, said Andrew Kell, an analyst in the PSC’s division of regional energy markets. In 2012 alone it was about $184 million. One last issue. The ad’s shorthand phrasing -- "compromise vote that cost $788 million" -- could suggest that the legislation already has cost $788 million. But even if we consider just the actual costs so far, the $788 million figure might be on target. Why? Because the mandate’s been in place since 1998 -- 15 years. Considering that the $532 million figure covers just 5 years, it’s reasonable to assume the 15-year total is higher. Our rating Stroebel’s ad says Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a "compromise vote that cost $788 million" in higher electricity costs. They cast that vote, and higher costs have followed. The claim needs some clarification, though, because of the many factors involved in determining the actual cost and whether the claim, as stated, referred to past or future costs. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Duey Stroebel	None	None	None	2014-08-10T05:00:00	2014-07-30	['None']
pomt-03057	The shutdown is projected to result in "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-federal-shutdown-10-/	Now that we’re living in a federal government shutdown, what’s the hit to the economy? U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wagged her calculator at the GOP and cited a whopping figure on Twitter. "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week and this is what the R's had to say?" tweeted Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, who also serves as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. We wanted to check her number: How much will the shutdown cost the economy? Predictions about economic shutdown Wasserman Schultz’s numbers are the same as those from the White House. A White House spokesman said the $10 billion figure came from an August report from the investment group Goldman Sachs. We also found similar estimates from Moody’s and IHS. These financial firms agree that the impact depends on how long the shutdown goes on. The impact gets worse the longer a closure lasts. "A brief shutdown would delay, not cancel, most spending," said the Goldman Sachs report. "In a brief shutdown, it is likely that only federal employee compensation would be lost — most of the other activity would just be delayed and made up later. A longer shutdown ― the longest shutdown on record in late 1995 and early 1996 lasted about three weeks — would affect a greater share of federal activities." The report includes three scenarios based on a two-day, one-week and three-week shutdown. It predicts a $2.6 billion economic loss for a two-day shutdown, $10.4 billion for a week and $36.8 billion for three weeks. Moody’s found that a shutdown lasting three to four weeks would cost $55 billion, with costs accelerating as time goes on. Moody’s takes into account the losses from federal workers not getting paid, the delay of housing and small business loans, the hit to tourism spending and the interruptions for contractors. "To be clear, these are rough estimates of what we think impacts will be," Moody’s analyst Brian Kessler told PolitiFact. "There is just a ridiculously large number of moving parts." Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, testified before the Joint Economic Committee about the shutdown in September. "A shutdown that lasts only three or four days would have modest economic consequences, costing the economy approximately 0.2 percentage point of annualized real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. ... However, shutting the government down for three or four weeks would do significant economic damage, reducing real GDP by 1.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter. And this likely understates the economic fallout, as it does not fully account for the impact of such a lengthy shutdown on consumer, business and investor psychology." IHS calculated a loss of $1.6 billion for one week as a result of furloughs, with the impact increasing for a longer shutdown. "The spending habits of government employees probably would not change if the shutdown was short-lived, particularly if they believed that they would receive back wages, as in 1995," states the September IHS report. "Any uncertainty about compensation, however, could increase the impact on consumer spending. Meanwhile, incomes would be maintained for Social Security beneficiaries. Medicare payments would also continue, so spending on health care services would not be harmed and hospitals and doctors would receive payments." Other experts weighing in on the estimates We also read studies about previous shutdowns and media reports analyzing the potential hit to the economy. We interviewed Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute; Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research. Our experts generally agreed on one key point: The economic hit will depend on how long the shutdown lasts. Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us that it "extremely difficult to quantify" the impact on the economy of a shutdown. "Sure, analysts can calculate the direct costs of furloughing federal employees," Peuquet told PolitiFact in an email. "But once you factor in the impacts on thousands of federal contractors, the time and resources lost preparing for and implementing the shutdown, the added economic uncertainty of how lawmakers will resolve this, how the Federal Reserve may respond if the shutdown continues for an extended period, and then the ensuing economic reverberations of these changes, it is a very imprecise exercise." DeHaven of Cato emphasized that these analyses from economists are just estimates and that the actual impact on the economy could be different. "If you go back and look at previous shutdowns, there was no long-term effect...," DeHaven said. "For Wasserman Schultz or the White House to tweet out this going to cost X amount of money to me is nonsense. You could talk about the cost associated due to government creating uncertainty in the economy for a lot of things Washington is doing." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded that the cost of shutdowns in fiscal year 1996 was $1.4 billion -- most of that was for back pay to furloughed workers, according to University of Maryland political science professor Roy Meyers. In 1995, the government first closed from Nov. 14-19 and then again from Dec. 16-Jan.6. But Peuquet and Meyers told us that there are some factors that could make the shutdown economic hit different today, which means we can’t simply add an inflation factor to the mid 1990s shutdowns. Back then, several appropriations bills had already been enacted -- allowing spending in several areas of the federal government. This time, those bills haven’t been enacted. The federal government also relies more heavily on contractors than it did in the 1990s, and they are unlikely to get back pay. "We are still learning a lot of this as we go," Peuquet said. Another factor to consider: The economy is much worse now than it was in the mid 1990s. "This one is going to be bigger in terms of daily costs...," Meyers told PolitiFact. "The economy is weaker. It can’t handle as much of a shock as it could handle in ‘95-’96." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said the shutdown is projected to result in "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week." That number comes from an investment report from Goldman Sachs. We found other estimates from financial firms that were slightly larger and slightly smaller than the $10 billion figure, but they were in the same ballpark. A key point here, though, is that these are estimates. Experts agree that caution and caveats are needed: There is much uncertainty about the economic impact, including the timing and length of the shutdown. For instance, if the shutdown is short and workers get paid back wages, the impact could ultimately be modest. If the shutdown continues for several weeks, the price tag could escalate exponentially.

pomt-12043	The new Illinois school funding formula "created a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program…"	half-true	/illinois/statements/2017/sep/12/karen-lewis/call-it-what-you-want-karen-lewis-calls-illinois-s/	For many public education advocates in Illinois, Aug. 31 was a historic day. When Gov. Bruce Rauner put his signature on Senate Bill 1947, he set in motion a plan designed to end Illinois’ status as home to the most unfair school funding system in the nation. But for the Chicago Teachers Union, the good news was tempered by the inclusion in the new plan of the Invest in Kids Act -- a five-year pilot program that will allow up to $75 million in tax credits per year for donors to scholarship funds for private elementary and high schools. This, the union says, amounts to an Illinois prototype for public funding of a private school voucher system like those in 14 states and the District of Columbia. "Unfortunately, Illinois legislators have voted to 'reform' the worst school funding system in the country with a ticking time bomb of a voucher scheme, and the Illinois Democratic Party has crossed a line which no spin or talk of 'compromise' can ever erase," the CTU said in an Aug. 28 press release. After Rauner signed the new formula into law, the union reiterated its opposition to the scholarship portion. "Instead of raising revenue, the mayor and the governor have attached a parasitic voucher program to the bill to create a tax shelter that will benefit big corporations and billionaire patrons like Ken Griffin," read an Aug. 31 CTU blog post. And as CTU President Karen Lewis welcomed members back to classrooms on Sept. 4, she prefaced her praise of the new formula with yet another condemnation of the scholarship plan as a "voucher program." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "While we’re disappointed that our lawmakers caved to right-wing ideologue Bruce Rauner and created a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program, we believe the new evidence-based school funding formula is a step in the right direction—as we have always said—and brings us closer to at last adequately designating public dollars to fund the schools that Chicago’s students deserve," Lewis wrote in a blog post. The union consistently describes the scholarship plan as a voucher program and a tax shelter that will benefit the wealthy. But is that description accurate? We took a look. Voucher vetting To the CTU, there is no distinction between calling the Invest in Kids Act a "scholarship" program or a "voucher" program. Use of the term "scholarship" is merely a "scheme to get around the constitutional and public relations issues associated with vouchers," said Kurt Hilgendorf, CTU’s policy advisor. "But make no mistake, the mechanism is functionally the same," Hilgendorf said. "Public funds are shifted to private, predominantly religious schools – in Illinois, $375 million over the next five years -- only through a series of clearinghouses in a legal fiction that creates the illusion of no state support for religion." The "clearinghouses" to which Hilgendorf refers are "scholarship granting organizations" -- not-for-profit entities that will be sanctioned by the Illinois Department of Revenue to receive donations and distribute scholarships. Under the Illinois plan, donors will receive state income tax credit for 75 percent of their donations to scholarship funds up to $1 million. The state will grant a maximum of $75 million in scholarship tax credits per year. But they still are tax credits, and that is an important distinction here. "A traditional voucher program uses state funds and so it needs a state appropriation," said Josh Cunningham, who follows school choice programs nationwide for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those programs are different than scholarship plans like the one enacted in Illinois, which Cunningham said "rely on private donations to private organizations. And in exchange for those donations the donors receive a tax credit and that's kind of the incentive to fund the program." The terminology can be confusing. Indiana, for example, has a true voucher system called the Choice Scholarship Program. In the 2016-2017 school year, it distributed $142.2 million in private school tuition vouchers to more than 34,000 students, about 3 percent of its total statewide enrollment. But it also includes a donor-funded scholarship program that provides a 50 percent tax credit and is capped at $12.5 million in tax credits annually. Here’s a look at the numbers from Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program from its 2017 annual report: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "The most simple way of differentiating between (scholarships and vouchers) is the scholarship tax credit requires individuals or corporations to donate to a scholarship granting organization…," said Robert Gilligan, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Illinois and one of the designers of the Illinois plan. "No donations, no program, no scholarship. So this relies on the goodwill of people and corporations proactively doing this." The Catholic Conference and other school choice advocates tried in 2011 to get a true voucher program through the General Assembly and failed, Gilligan said. He believes the scholarship structure might ultimately be a better program than the one sought six years ago. "From where I sit right now and based on conversations with my colleagues in other states, this scholarship tax credit seems to be working," Gilligan said. "It seems to be working in the states that have tried it and I think that was one of the reasons that people did take to heart and we were talking about this." Gimme shelter Lewis also refers to the program as a "tax shelter for the wealthy," an accusation made by CTU in the Aug. 31 post that referred to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, who has donated heavily to Rauner’s campaign fund. The plan offers a 75 percent state tax credit for any donor, with a maximum of $750,000 for those who donate $1 million. Donors will reserve their tax credits by registering on a website that will be operated by the Department of Revenue. For the first six months of the year, the credits will be distributed "in a manner geographically proportionate to enrollment in recognized non-public schools in Illinois," according to the statute." If the entire $75 million in credits is not claimed under that formula by June 1, the rest will be granted on a first come, first served basis. Thus the statute ensures that potential donors in all parts of the state will have a chance to get in on the program for the first five months of the year. But there’s no such protection based on the size of donations. So, theoretically, 100 donors giving $1 million each to scholarship granting organizations throughout the state could quickly gobble up all the allowable tax credits. Under that scenario, Lewis would be correct in her "tax shelter for the wealthy" claim. Our ruling The Chicago Teachers Union describes Illinois’ impending private school tax credit scholarship plan as a "voucher program" that amounts to a "tax shelter for the wealthy." It’s clear that "voucher program" to the CTU means any system in which public dollars directly or indirectly reach private schools. By that definition, CTU is correct regarding Illinois’ Invest in Kids Act. But those who follow the issue make a distinction between voucher programs -- in which states directly appropriate funds for private school tuition -- and scholarship credit programs funded with private money and incentivized with tax credits. Illinois’ scholarship program has safeguards to ensure that potential donors from all parts of the state can contribute, but it doesn’t have protections against wealthy donors quickly claiming all $75 million of its tax credits. Lewis’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00110	Says "sleazy Keith Ellison and shady Dean Phillips both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal" and that Phillips is "charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/29/erik-paulsen/no-dean-phillips-was-not-involved-sexual-harassmen/	A television ad in Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District attempts to tie Democratic candidate Dean Phillips to a congressman accused of domestic abuse. Phillips’ opponent, Republican congressman Erik Paulsen, aired the ad that starts off by saying "sleazy Keith Ellison and shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal," making it appear as if the two men are involved in the same scandal. Ellison is accused of domestic abuse by his former girlfriend. The congressman is currently running for Minnesota attorney general and has denied the allegations. But the focus here is the claim that Phillps is "charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies," as the ad’s narrator goes on to say. The full text: "Sleazy Keith Ellison and Shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal. Ellison accused of physical abuse. Phillips charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies. Sued over and over again. A whistleblower says he told Phillips' board of the abuse, warning the harassment was a serious problem that was being covered up. Keith Ellison. Dean Phillips. They are the problem. Dean Phillips, your time is up." Phillips is airing a rebuttal ad calling Paulsen's attack false. We wanted to sort out the facts. We found that Phillips is not connected to Ellison’s case, and the allegation against him is based on a decades-old lawsuit filed against an organization where he was once a board member. The ad makes the suggestion that Phillips has been "sued over and over" and was "charged" with ignoring sexual harassment at his companies. We found no evidence that supports either claim. To be clear: Phillips is not involved in the domestic abuse allegations levied against Ellison by a former girlfriend, nor is Phillips involved in any sexual harassment case. The Allina Health lawsuit The Paulsen campaign points to a February 2007 Star Tribune article that discusses a lawsuit brought against Allina Health by seven nurses who said they were sexually harassed by a doctor at one of the health group’s clinics. The case was settled out of court. The news account quotes a letter that was sent by another doctor to an Allina board member. The doctor vouched for the lawsuit, saying the harassment was a serious problem at the clinic and is being "covered up by the Allina administration." Phillips served on the board of directors from 2005 to 2011, and while the board advises Allina, it doesn’t "run the company" as the ad implies. There is also no evidence the note was actually sent to Phillips, and his campaign says he has no memory of receiving such a letter or having any board discussions about the harassment case. Shortly after the ad aired, Lori Peterson, the attorney who represented the women, contacted the Paulsen campaign requesting they take it down. She has not gotten a response, Peterson said, and sent the campaign another note Friday. "You have been asked, for weeks, to stop using my clients in your ads. You have misrepresented their experiences, lied about your opponent, and further traumatized these women," Peterson wrote. "You have dragged these women into your campaign against their will and you won’t even respond to their requests that you stop." She goes on to say that her clients want nothing to do with Paulsen’s campaign, and that she has told him repeatedly that Dean Phillips "had nothing to do with this case. No allegations were made about him and he had no involvement in the litigation." Our ruling Paulsen attempts to tie Phillips to another Democratic candidate involved in a domestic abuse case and says he "ignored sexual harassment allegations at his companies." But Phillips has nothing to do with the accusations against Ellison. Phillips served on the board of a health organization that was sued over sexual harassment allegations in 2007, but the lawyer in that case said he had nothing to do with it. There is also no evidence that proves he was informed or received a letter about the harassment. Paulsen’s ad misleads viewers by connecting Phillips to a domestic abuse case he is not involved in, and implies some sort of formal action was taken against Phillips ("charged with ignoring") at a company he runs, neither of which are true. We rate it False.

pomt-12130	Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is "the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/	Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that when it comes to the $10 billion, 20 million-square-foot factory being promised to Wisconsin, some statements border on the extreme. Foxconn "is bringing" 13,000 jobs. Half True. 3,000 Foxconn jobs would cost Wisconsin $3 billion, or $1 million per job. False. Now comes a claim, made in response to a boast by Gov. Scott Walker, that the $3 billion incentives offer is the largest of its kind. The exchange occurred Aug. 7, 2017 exchange on Twitter, a week and a half after Foxconn, the maker of iPhones and other electronics, announced it would be coming to Wisconsin. Walker tweeted: Our bold reforms have prepared WI for Foxconn & thousands of jobs. Hard-working families will reap the benefits! #WIWinning One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, retorted: You are willing to give the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company. You got #foxconned, big guy. Wisconsin clearly isn’t offering a gift. The incentives are tied to Foxconn making investments in the plant and in payroll. But the best available source indicates the $3 billion would be the largest ever subsidy provided by a state to a foreign company. One Wisconsin Now’s evidence To back its claim, One Wisconsin Now cited June 2017 data from Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that calls itself "a leading monitor and critic of company-specific subsidy deals," and has called the the Foxconn deal "a sure loser for Wisconsin taxpayers." We checked with a number of experts on subsidies and none said they knew of any other compilation of subsidies. The experts include Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance; Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project; and economists Michael Leeds of Temple University, Charley Ballard of Michigan State University, Jeffrey Michael of the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., Sean Snaith at the University of Central Florida; Ball State University’s Michael Hicks; and Tim Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Hicks, who heads Ball State’s Center for Business and Economic Research, told us that while he hasn’t always agreed with analyses done by Good Jobs First, the group’s data on subsidies is solid. And Bartik said it is the best such database he knows. Here are the top 12 subsidies given to companies by states, cities or counties, according to Good Jobs First: Recipient company Parent company Subsidy (in billions) Year State City County Boeing Boeing $8.7 2013 WA Alcoa Alcoa $5.6 2007 NY Massena Boeing Boeing $3.24 2003 WA Everett General Motors General Motors $2.34 2009 MI Orion Township Oakland Ford Motor Ford Motor $2.3 2010 MI statewide Sempra Energy Sempra Energy $2.19 2013 LA Hackberry Cameron Nike Nike $2.02 2012 OR Beaverton Washington Intel Intel $2 2004 NM Rio Rancho Sandoval Intel Intel $2 2014 OR Hillsboro Washington Lake Charles LNG Export Company, LLC Energy Transfer $1.79 2015 LA Lake Charles Calcasieu Cheniere Energy Cheniere Energy $1.69 2010 LA Cameron Cameron Parish Royal Dutch Shell Royal Dutch Shell $1.65 2012 PA The top 11 subsidies are all for American companies. At No. 12 is the estimated $1.65 billion in tax credits Pennsylvania approved for Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Netherlands. That package of tax breaks over 25 years was aimed at getting the company to build an ethane refinery that would include a minimum investment of $1 billion and employ at least 2,500 people. Using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, $1.65 billion in 2012 was worth about $2.39 billion as of July 2017 -- so, still well below Wisconsin’s $3 billion offer to Foxconn. (The Good Jobs First database does not take inflation into account.) But there are at least two important points to consider. 1. The $3 billion wouldn’t be a gift, as One Wisconsin Now calls it. That’s the maximum amount the state would pay Foxconn, and only if the company spends roughly $18 billion -- about $9 billion for payroll and $9 billion in capital investments. 2. It’s difficult to calculate the value of the jobs that the various incentives are aimed at creating -- or keeping. Some jobs pay more than others, of course. And some businesses are more likely than others to attract suppliers that might, in turn, create more jobs in a state. Supporters of the Foxconn deal say Wisconsin would win a keystone manufacturer that would bring world-leading technology and attract suppliers that would create their own jobs. Critics say it amounts to a multibillion-dollar bet on a company that makes screens — a product subject to constant market-disrupting competition and innovation. Our rating One Wisconsin Now says Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is "the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company." The $3 billion wouldn’t be given -- it would be paid, in increments, based on how much Foxconn spends on capital investments and payroll. But the only compilation of government subsidies we found shows that the Foxconn offer would exceed the highest subsidy provided to a foreign company -- $1.65 billion in 2012, made by Pennsylvania to Dutch Royal Shell, based in The Netherlands. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.

pomt-13868	Says Ron Johnson justifies his support of trade agreements by saying the U.S. has the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for displaced workers, but then he "voted to eliminate it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/06/russ-feingold/testing-russ-feingold-claim-about-opponent-ron-joh/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson tells viewers in a new television ad, "I respect you enough to tell you the truth." But his Democratic challenger has suggested otherwise. At a Milwaukee campaign event in May 2016, Russ Feingold said Johnson touted a worker protection program called Trade Adjustment Assistance to justify his support for free trade agreements — even though Johnson had sought to eliminate the program. Feingold said: "Let's be very clear. Senator Johnson says — to excuse his position on trade agreements — he says, well, we have the TAA. Guess who voted to eliminate it." When Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program. Is Feingold right? How the program works The Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job. In Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhanced vocational training through the state’s technical colleges in programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. Proponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs — a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries. Johnson has voiced general support for free trade, while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator and has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Feingold’s claim has two parts: Did Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements? When we asked Feingold’s campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in a May 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article: "Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced." Despite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers. Indeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is "ineffective and duplicative" and in need of "major reforms." Johnson’s campaign also pointed to a House Budget Committee report that said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies. There are "dozens of programs to help people who need assistance," Reisinger said. Did Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program? Johnson voted in September 2011 against a bill to reauthorize the program, although the measure passed despite his opposition. Feingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help. Those grants were part of the 2009 economic stimulus package, which was approved before Johnson was in office. But Johnson voted for legislation in 2011 that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed. At the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he offered the measure because of concerns with TAA’s effectiveness and because stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary. Our rating Feingold said Johnson had referred to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to defend his position on trade agreements — but had voted against the TAA. However, Johnson referred only generally to worker "protections," not to the TAA specifically. He did vote against reauthorizing the program in 2011 and also voted around the same time to pare down funding, which would have had the effect of cutting a career training program. Our definition for Mostly False is "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/44c310bb-c766-4443-845a-8caafb23aa40	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-07-06T05:00:00	2016-05-09	['United_States']
pomt-02537	Says President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 "by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/06/george-will/presidential-election-results-rep-cw-bill-youngs-o/	Conservative pundit George Will honed in on Florida’s Pinellas County for a column about the closely watched special election to fill the shoes of the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Headlining the March 11 race are Democrat Alex Sink and Republican David Jolly. Reporters covering the race usually call it a toss-up district, pointing out President Barack Obama had "narrow" wins in 2008 and 2012. (Young typically won by comfortable margins; he was a 40-plus year incumbent.) Will described Obama’s wins differently -- and incorrectly. "Obama carried this Gulf Coast district, a one-county constituency near Tampa, by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012." Florida’s 13th Congressional District covers most of Pinellas County, but not all of it. The district stretches from South Pinellas to Dunedin, excluding pieces of southern and downtown St. Petersburg. Will’s column links to election returns from Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections for 2008 and 2012. But he was trying to explain how the congressional district -- and not the county -- voted in those presidential races. The fact that it doesn’t cover the entire county is an important distinction. If the entire county was included, the district would lean more to the left, as Will’s links show. Voting data by congressional district is available, but a lot harder to uncover because it must be tabulated by the precincts in the district (and those change every 10 years). Neither the Florida Department of State nor the Pinellas County elections supervisor’s office keep it. We had luck with the Florida Legislature, which in 2012 wrapped up its once-a-decade redistricting process. The Florida House developed a Web tool called My District Builder that allows data-savvy users to play with the demographic and political information of constituents in various congressional and legislative districts. The election data comes from the Florida Department of State and local elections supervisors. Using this tool, we found: In 2008, Obama earned 51.32 percent of the vote in Young’s old seat (District 10) and Republican candidate Sen. John McCain got 47.14 percent. That’s a margin of 4.18 percentage points. In 2012, Obama garnered 49.95 percent of the CD-13 vote versus Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s 48.49 percent, a margin of almost 1.5 percentage points. Other efforts to analyze the presidential vote by congressional district in 2008 and 2012 produce similar findings, including CNN, NBC News and the liberal Daily Kos. We also consulted David Wasserman, House editor of The Cook Political Report, which has voting data by congressional district prepared by PolitiData. Because the boundaries of Young’s district varied in the elections in question, Wasserman argues it is more fair to compare the 2008 votes of constituents who live in present-day District 13 (versus turnout for then-District 10) with the 2012 returns there. The results are not significantly different from what we found in our exercise with My District Builder (and certainly a lot closer than Will’s.) In 2008, 51.33 percent of voters living within the boundaries of current-day District 13 chose Obama, and 47.54 percent chose McCain -- a difference of nearly 3.8 points. In 2012, 50.25 percent of voters chose Obama and 48.77 chose Romney -- a difference of 1.48 points. Because Will relied on the number of voter registrations in the county and not the district, his column also errantly suggests that Democrats outnumber Republicans in Congressional District 13. He wrote, "This is a purple but not a polarized district, with 37 percent Democrat and 36 percent Republican." Those numbers are wrong, too. The party breakdown for the district is 37.1 percent Republican and 34.6 percent Democrat, said Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections. We reached out to Will and his researcher for comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Will wrote that Obama carried the 13th Congressional District "by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012." He was using countywide election returns. Using returns from the actual congressional district show a much smaller margin of victory for Obama in both presidential elections. Obama carried the district by about 4 points in 2008 and about 1.5 points 2012. We rate Will’s statement False.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2014-02-06T18:34:30	2014-02-06	['None']

pomt-08074	Says that "on average, Democratic congressional districts received 81 percent more stimulus funds than Republican districts."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-democratic-districts/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, slammed the federal government's spending habits under President Barack Obama in a Nov. 22 op-ed piece in the Austin American-Statesman, singling out the roughly $800 billion stimulus plan that passed last year. After asserting that the program is wasteful, Hutchison said: "It has been reported that, on average, Democratic congressional districts received 81 percent more stimulus funds than Republican districts." She went on: "Unelected bureaucrats in Washington ... shouldn't be empowered to distribute taxpayer dollars with little or no intimate knowledge of a state or community's need — or, worse, guided by a political agenda that will serve some and neglect others." First, just because Hutchison describes this statistic as "reported" doesn't let her off the hook when making claims to her constituents. So, we took the hint from several readers who asked us to truth-test Hutchison's "81 percent" statement. Next, some background: The stimulus, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, includes tax cuts and spending programs designed to pump money into the economy, create jobs and end the recession. The Obama administration created Recovery.gov so the public could track the stimulus spending, which is being spread out over 10 years. The website keeps tabs on only about a third of the money: the $275 billion that is being paid out by federal agencies through contracts, grants and loans to state and local governments, nonprofit groups and private companies. Not included are the tax breaks to individuals and businesses, additional money being sent to states for education and health care, and direct aid to individuals such as unemployment benefits. Hutchison spokeswoman Courtney Sanders told us the 81 percent statistic came from a report by Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which describes itself as a "source for market-oriented ideas." Sanders sent us de Rugy's March 31 National Review Online blog post summarizing her statistical analysis of contract and grant data that recipients reported to Recovery.gov from February through September 2009. The total spending in de Rugy's analysis: $170 billion, which constitutes 21 percent of stimulus dollars overall. As part of her analysis, Rugy sorted the awards by congressional district and labeled each district based on the political party of its U.S. House member. One of her findings: "The average dollars awarded per Republican district is $260,675,663, while the average dollars awarded per Democratic district is $471,533,539." Those numbers reflect a Democratic average that is 81 percent greater than the Republican one. Her work was quickly challenged by blogger Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, a site devoted to analyzing political numbers that became part of The New York Times' website in August 2010. In his April 1 post, Silver wrote that de Rugy’s study "purporting to find a connection between stimulus spending and the partisanship of a district suffers from an obvious flaw" by overlooking an important factor in stimulus fund distribution: the location of each state’s capital city. Silver notes that according to de Rugy’s tally, the four districts that received the largest amounts of stimulus funding contain all or part of the capitals of the nation’s four biggest states: California, Texas, New York and Florida. "This … makes perfect sense," Silver's post says. "A lot of stimulus funds are distributed to state agencies, which are then responsible for allocating and administering the funds to the presumed benefit of citizens throughout the state. These state agencies, of course, are usually located in or near the state capital." According to Silver, de Rugy's data show that the 18 congressional districts that received the most stimulus funding contain part or all of a capital city. Of those 18 districts, only three are represented by a Republican, including the Texas 21st, whose congressman is Lamar Smith of San Antonio. His district, which ranked third in stimulus funding, includes the Texas Capitol complex and the University of Texas at Austin. Another Austin-area district, Democrat Lloyd Doggett’s 25th, which contains part of downtown, ranks 14th. None of the 30 other Texas districts made the top 50 list. According to Silver, the 78 congressional districts across the United States that contain part or all of a capital collectively received $118 billion, compared with $48 billion for the 357 districts that are not home to capitals. Silver wrote that districts with state capitals "are much more likely to elect Democrats to Congress" because they are usually urban; are home to large numbers of government workers (who "may be more sympathetic to bigger government"); have highly educated populations; and often are home to large state universities. Silver suggested that de Rugy adjust her analysis to take into account whether a district contains a capital. She did, and on April 7 blogged on National Review Online that "even after taking out the money spent through state capitals," Democratic districts still received 30 percent more stimulus funds, on average, than Republican districts. De Rugy's research assistant at the Mercatus Center, Jakina Debnam, told us that after removing capital districts from the analysis, the average for Democratic and Republican districts fell to $143 million and $111 million, respectively, giving Democratic districts a 29 percent edge. De Rugy raised the partisanship issue again in a Sept. 24 National Review Online post about a paper by two Georgia State University political scientists, Jeffrey Lazarus and Jason Reifler, who also analyzed the distribution of stimulus contracts and grants by congressional district. "They find that the partisan bias does exist," de Rugy's post says. "More interestingly, they explain how and why it happens." In their paper, Lazarus and Reifler confirm that Democratic districts got more stimulus money than Republican ones. But they contend that the results reflect majority rule; Democrats were in the majority in the House and Senate when the stimulus plan passed. "Congressional majority parties routinely shape legislation to distribute federal funds according to their own policy priorities, and to politically benefit their own members," the article says. An example of those priorities in the stimulus package, Lazarus told us, was the desire to improve health care. "So districts with a lot of hospitals got extra money," thanks to the stimulus, he said — and the districts with more hospitals are in urban areas that tend to be represented by Democrats. Next, we briefed Sanders, Hutchison's spokeswoman, on the de Rugy analysis that excluded state-capital congressional districts. Sanders stuck by the 81 percent figure which, she noted, has not been retracted by de Rugy. Still, we wondered why Hutchison's op-ed piece left the impression that she was talking about all stimulus funds, not just a portion of them. Sanders' response: "The op-ed does not say that — that's your interpretation." To the Truth-O-Meter: Hutchison's statement accurately draws from a researcher's analysis showing that 81 percent of $170 billion in stimulus grants and contracts went to congressional districts represented by Democrats. However, after an analyst suggested that stimulus data from districts with state capitals tended to skew the results, the researcher re-ran her analysis while excluding those districts. Using that methodology, Democratic districts on average received 29 percent more stimulus funds than GOP districts — not 81 percent. Hutchison also fails to note that the $170 billion being scrutinized is about one-fifth of total stimulus spending, not the whole package. We rate Hutchison's statement Half True.

pomt-07528	Says House Republicans rejected a straightforward measure that would prevent members of Congress and the president from being paid during a government shutdown.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/barbara-boxer/congress-cant-agree-cutting-its-own-pay-event-gove/	We’ve found something Republicans and Democrats say they agree on: If Congress shuts down, members of Congress should not be paid during the closure. Current law says they get their paychecks, shut down or no. Yet when someone actually proposes changing the law, things start to get a little, well, weird. We figured it was time for a fact-check when Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., accused House Republicans of voting down language she had proposed to stop the congressional paychecks. Instead, she said, the Republicans adopted a bill containing a provision designed to ensure that it would die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. "Attaching their pay measure to a bill that has no prayer of ever becoming law shows House Republicans are not serious about ‘no budget, no pay,’" Boxer said Friday. "This is nothing more than an April Fools’ Day gimmick." Back in February, Boxer announced she was introducing legislation to stop members of Congress from being paid during a shutdown. "Failing to keep the government open because of politics, or because there’s no will to compromise, is a failure of government," Boxer said. "If the government is forced to shutdown, members of Congress and the president should be treated like all other federal employees: We should not be paid. And to take it one step further, we should not be paid retroactively once the government re-opens." It’s strange but true: Members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, even though most other federal employees do not. Also exempt from a pay freeze are the president, presidential appointees, certain legislative branch employees and employees either doing emergency work or ensuring an orderly shutdown, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in the past federal employees were paid retroactively once shutdowns ended. Boxer’s bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 1. Now let’s look and see what’s happened over in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The House voted on Friday, April 1, 2011, to stop pay for members of Congress as part of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. But the act also contained a provision that the Democrats in the Senate were sure to reject. The act says that if the Senate doesn’t approve a budget, then the provisions of the House budget bill already rejected by the Senate "are hereby enacted into law." The original Republican budget proposal had been rejected by the Senate on a 44-56 vote back on March 9. So House Republicans are asking the Senate to approve a bill that says if the Senate didn’t approve another bill, the House version of the budget becomes law. That would appear to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says both chambers must approve laws which then must be signed by the president. We’ve never heard of anything like this before, and we were frankly perplexed by the idea. We asked majority leader Eric Cantor’s office for a comment on this, but we didn’t hear back. So we turned to longtime government watcher Norm Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "First of all, it is farcical," Ornstein said. "Of course, no bill can be ‘deemed’ into law without passage by both houses in identical form and the signature of the president (or a veto overridden by two-thirds of both houses). … I have never seen anything like this, for good reason." "This is all about one thing and one thing only: trying to shift blame if there is a shutdown," he added. Getting back to Boxer’s statement, she said the House had a chance to vote on a more straightforward "no budget, no pay" bill, without the references to one-chamber approval of the House budget bill. There was a motion to substitute the text of Boxer’s bill and remove references to H.R. 1, the house budget bill. But the motion, proposed by Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., failed on a largely party line vote, with Republicans voting no and Democrats voting yes. Finally, there’s one more issue at work here, and it’s a significant one: It might be unconstitutional for Congress to cut its own pay or that of the president. Article II, Section 1 says the president’s compensation "shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected." The 27th amendment, meanwhile, says, "No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened." So the whole argument over "no budget, no pay" may be moot anyway. So to sum up: The House passed a bill to stop pay for members during a shutdown. But the measure clearly had a poison pill provision on a different topic -- the budget itself, which is the cause of the impasse in the first place. The House did have a chance to vote on something similar to Boxer’s bill, but it turned it down on a near party-line vote. So Boxer is correct on that point. There’s still a question whether her bill is would pass constitutional muster. We won’t find out, though, because the two chambers seem unlikely to agree on legislation. Given that impasse, we rate Boxer’s statement Mostly True.	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2011-04-06T10:46:10	2011-04-01	['United_States_Congress', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13239	"Gov. (Pat) McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund. And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/19/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-took-500000-disaster-r/	As flooding from Hurricane Matthew continues to ravage much of eastern North Carolina, even days after the storm subsided, the state’s preparedness has become a political fight. Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger for governor who is also the state’s attorney general, accused Republican Gov. Pat McCrory of a short-sighted move to divert emergency funds into defending a partisan controversy. "Gov. McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund," Cooper said during their Oct. 11 debate. "And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2." HB2, or the "bathroom bill" as it’s commonly known, has become one of the defining issues of this election. There are several parts to it, including restricting bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings and excluding LGBT people from discrimination protections. We’ve written many fact-checks on HB2, including whether it took away any existing rights, how unique North Carolina’s LGBT protections (or lack thereof) are now, and the risk of sexual predators due to transgender-friendly bathroom rules. For all our fact checks on the law, see here. McCrory signed HB2 in March. Since then private citizens have sued, and so has the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues it violates civil rights laws. Cooper, as attorney general, has refused to defend HB2 in court. He says he believes it’s unconstitutional. We fact-checked whether he’s allowed to do that here. With Cooper out, the state will have to hire other lawyers – unless the legislature repeals HB2, which Cooper has urged but which legislative leaders have so far refused to do. And that’s what brings us to this claim. Cooper said McCrory pulled $500,000 from disaster funds to use for those lawyers, but McCrory retorted it wasn’t true. "We haven’t spent one dollar of the disaster relief money. We were approved to by the legislature, and I made a statement: We will not spend any of that money. (Cooper) knows that. He’s being deceptive to the public of North Carolina." McCrory’s campaign later called Cooper’s claim "the lie of the night." Starting with the basics Cooper is right about the amount of money. A new law ordered the transfer of $500,000 of disaster relief money to McCrory’s office for "costs incurred from litigation related to" HB2. Cooper said McCrory "took" that money, but "took" has multiple meanings. One is more active, like "grabbed. " The other is more passive, like "accepted." It might also refer to a certain foolish hobbit, but we won’t get into that. So we need to ask if McCrory actively took the money, passively took the money, or both. Let’s start with passive taking. Did McCrory accept the money? Did he object to it? Veto power Cooper’s main argument during the debate was that McCrory didn’t object to the money being moved, since he allowed the bill in question to become law. "The governor could’ve vetoed this legislation that took this $500,000 out of the Disaster Relief Fund, but he did not," Cooper said. "He did not veto it." The money came to McCrory on July 1 in a bill making multiple changes and corrections to the state budget. McCrory said he didn’t veto the bill because he didn’t want to risk stopping other important changes if his veto succeeded. But that excuse doesn’t hold water. The legislature could’ve easily overridden his veto, which requires a 60-percent majority to do. This bill received 46 of 50 votes in the Senate (92 percent) and 89 of 120 votes in the House (74 percent). McCrory has issued six vetoes as governor, four of which have been overridden. His latest came less than a month before this budget bill. At the time, he said it would probably be overridden but "part of the reason to veto a bill is to make sure the public is aware of exactly what’s in a bill." And less than a week before the funding bill came to his desk, he threatened to veto another bill over several parts that he didn’t like; the legislature rewrote those parts in response. However, after McCrory let the funding bill become law, he did almost immediately say he had no intention of actually using the money – a statement he repeated again at the debate. Show me the money So McCrory accepted the money with no strong formal objections, like a veto. We also know that McCrory asked for $500,000 to be set aside for lawyers for HB2 – that it wasn’t just imposed on him by the legislature. But both McCrory’s general counsel, Bob Stephens, and the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger have said McCrory just asked for the money in general and never specifically suggested pulling it from disaster relief funds – so the legislature bears responsibility for that choice. But where’s the money now? The budget changes say that the $500,000 from the disaster relief fund "shall be transferred to the Governor's Office" for HB2’s legal costs. However, Berger’s office told us the money has yet to actually be transferred, despite the apparently authoritative wording of the law. "As a practical matter, $500,000 has not been moved from the disaster relief fund," said Berger spokeswoman Shelly Carver. She added: "Further, the governor has said he will not spend any disaster relief funds on legal expenses, which is within his discretion." But similarly, McCrory also has the discretion to move the money in the future if he wants. And what’s less clear is whether the money could still move even against his wishes, since the law says the funds "shall transfer" to his office. The word "shall" is tricky in legal writing and we simply don’t know exactly how it might be interpreted here. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in 1995 that "though shall generally means must, legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, shall to mean should, will or even may." Our ruling Cooper said "Governor McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund" to spend on lawyers to defend the controversial HB2 legislation. McCrory did ask for the money, although there’s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief – an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state. The money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper’s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future. And although he has said he won’t, he also didn’t attempt to stop the money from being moved out of disaster relief by using his veto power. Cooper’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/efeebeee-92f2-47c8-8826-dab5f32e372e	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-10-19T09:54:13	2016-10-11	['None']
pomt-13908	"The major immigration issue was about Poles, and Bulgarians, and Romanians," and that they weren’t contributing economically. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/26/david-miliband/david-miliband-link-between-jobs-immigration-and-b/	Backers of the British vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit, might see a rosy economic future, but the immediate effects have been rough to say the least. The value of the pound tumbled, as did stock markets worldwide, and the International Monetary Fund downgraded the United Kingdom’s prospects of growth. Popular anger with a 10-year influx of European workers was a major driver behind the "Leave" vote, former British lawmaker David Miliband told NBC host Chuck Todd. There was a strong sense that immigrants, particularly those from the former Eastern Bloc, were taking advantage of Britain’s welfare services. For the largest group, Poles, Miliband said that wasn’t the case. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits," he said on Meet the Press on June 26, 2016. Miliband is certainly correct that an influx of immigrants from countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania (and their reliance on government services) was a central theme in the "leave" movement. He’s also correct that Poles working in the United Kingdom are less likely than natives of the United Kingdom to find themselves unemployed, according to the latest numbers we could find. Britain’s Office of National Statistics conducts the country’s quarterly Labour Force Survey. According to Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, in the last quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate for Poles was 3.5 percent, while the national rate stood at 5 percent. Sumption cautioned us on the numbers, noting that as in the United States, the unemployment rate is based on a survey. And with a relatively small amount of Poles living, and thus working, in the United Kingdom (a bit under 800,000 vs. the total population of 64 million), the data is somewhat thin. "The numbers hop around a bit from quarter to quarter," Sumption cautioned. That’s due to the small number of Poles in the survey, "but it has always been the case that Poles have lower unemployment than Brits." The gap has been consistent. We used the labor survey from the first quarter of 2015 and got results similar to Sumption. (We looked at the unemployment rate of British nationals, not the average rate for the nation as a whole.) First quarter 2015 Employed Unemployed British 94.80% 5.20% Polish 95.90% 4.10% Further confirmation comes from a 2011 Office of National Statistics report that found Polish unemployment was 5.5 percent back when the overall British rate was 7.8 percent. The problem with low unemployment While Miliband had his numbers right, his statistic missed one of the major complaints against the Poles -- that their presence makes life harder for the average British worker. When Poland along with seven other Eastern and Central European countries joined the European Union in 2004, the United Kingdom was one of only three nations that allowed the newcomers to come and work immediately. Over the years, more than half a million Poles arrived. In the 2010 European parliament elections, the pushback in Britain was palpable. The UK Independence Party, a right-leaning group, made immigration control a key issue, running ads that claimed immigrants were driving wages down. Our fact-checking colleagues in the United Kingdom, Full Fact, reported that such complaints had merit. They found that a 1 percent increase in the population of migrants was tied to a drop of .3 percent to .6 percent in wages. On the other hand, there was no clear relationship to say that immigrants took jobs away from native British workers. Our ruling Miliband said, "The major immigration issue was about Poles, and Bulgarians, and Romanians," and that they weren’t contributing economically. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits." The official government numbers back him up. The most recent data we found had Poles with a 3.5 percent rate,compared to 5 percent for the nation as a whole. The gap has been consistent for at least several years.

pomt-04657	"After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/10/barack-obama/obama-fuel-standards-inaction/	President Barack Obama claimed a record of accomplishment as he accepted the Democratic nomination to run for a second term — including a victory on one issue he said hadn’t been touched in three decades. "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas," he told delegates to the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012. We rated Obama’s original presidential campaign pledge to raise fuel economy standards a Promise Kept. But we wondered, was it true that "after 30 years of inaction," fuel standards will double for cars and trucks by 2025? That might be news to President George W. Bush. What Obama did In August 2011, the Obama administration issued new federal fuel economy rules that set an average fuel efficiency goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year. That’s nearly twice the 27.6 miles per gallon standard for 2011, for cars and for trucks. So far, so good. But we paused at Obama’s claim that his administration took action "after 30 years of inaction." Mileage standards in the United States have been in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo. Back then, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which boosted the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. "Corporate average fuel economy," or CAFE, standards reached 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 — then hovered there. Obama’s speech might have left you thinking nothing else happened until his administration took charge. But in 2007, Bush signed the Energy Independence and Securities Act, which required "substantial, continuing increases in fuel economy standards," according to a helpful history lesson at auto information site Edmunds.com. Bush noted at his signing ceremony that the law marked the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards since they were enacted — something he had asked for. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were "the first in more than 30 years." And that law laid the groundwork for Obama’s rule changes. Bush’s administration left for Obama’s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn’t yet done "because of the uncertainty gripping car companies," Reuters reported. "A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started," Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January. That’s not what Obama’s sweeping oversimplification suggested. The president also said that "by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas." That’s what the new rules require. Edmunds.com reports that "regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan's goals." There’s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025. Still, 13 automakers in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they’ll be able to achieve the gains. Our ruling Obama said, "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas." The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade. But the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We’ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they’ll get it done. But he’s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08122	Sheldon Whitehouse and 18 other senators "voted to censor the internet."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/10/blog-posting/bloggers-say-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-voted-censor-i/	As the WikiLeaks controversy rages and concerns about web censorship in China percolate, another Internet debate has erupted closer to home. Bloggers, legal scholars, tech gurus and a host of others have accused 19 U.S. senators, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse among them, of voting to censor the Internet. The claims are intense -- hundreds of them sprinkled all over the Internet -- and they are angry. The vote they're talking about happened Nov. 18, when the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the "Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act," a bill they say would help the Justice Department crack down on websites that "sell or distribute" counterfeit or illegally copied goods, such as music or prescription medication. If passed, the law would allow the U.S. attorney general to seek a court order to block a web address "dedicated to infringing activities," in other words, sites whose only function is to traffic in counterfeit or unauthorized goods. If and only if a judge were to agree, the federal government could order the Internet provider to essentially remove that site from public view. The site wouldn't actually be gone. It would still be available through its I.P. address, a numerical identification code, for users savvy enough to find it that way. The goal of the infringement bill is to curb online piracy and protect intellectual property by policing sites that violate the policy, according to its co-sponsor and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. "Rogue websites are essentially digital stores selling illegal and sometimes dangerous products. If they existed in the physical world, the store would be shuttered immediately and the proprietors arrested," Leahy wrote in a Dec. 7 commentary in The Hill, a congressional publication. "There is no excuse for this behavior simply because it happens online and owners operate overseas. The internet needs to be free -- not lawless." The bill awaits consideration by the full Senate, which probably won't take up the issue before the lame-duck session ends. But that didn't stop the buzz on the blogosphere. That same day, Wired.com posted a story under the headline "Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee." Techdirt, a leading technology blog, offered its own version: "The 19 Senators who voted to censor the Internet." Buttressing those allegations was a strongly worded letter to the committee from a group of 49 prominent law professors who offered a grim assessment: "For the first time, the United States would be requiring Internet service providers to block speech because of its content." First amendment groups and others expressed similar opposition. The bill may be meant to target counterfeiters and pirates, but skeptics say they worry that, regardless of the original intent, it could create a framework that might one day allow zealous judges to block sites such as YouTube and Facebook, where users may unwittingly share copyrighted material. The threat to free speech is hard to ignore, they say. "The genesis of law is to go after the worst of the worst offenders, but I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line," said David L. Hudson Jr., a scholar at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. Those opposed say the legislation would also allow the Justice Department to blacklist websites with limited judicial review, blocking access to them through "prior restraint" before it is determined that the site is operating unlawfully. Above all, critics say the bill threatens the very freedoms that make the Internet's flow of ideas so valuable. "One thing people are really worried about is a worst case scenario -- for example, a politically biased AG using the bill if it became law to shut down a website just because he or she doesn’t agree with it," said Roger Williams University School of Law Assistant Prof. Zoe Argento, who was among the professors who signed the letter to Congress. Argento cited the potential example of a blogger reprinting large portions of former President George W. Bush's new memoir for the purposes of criticizing it. A politically motivated attorney general could use the law to block the website, as opposed to going through the traditional process of a legal challenge where both sides are heard. On the other side of this very heated issue, supporters, among them the entertainment industry and even the American Newspaper Association, say something must be done to protect intellectual property from online thieves. As of now, there are only a few means of recourse against such infringement: going after the individuals -- college students, etc. -- who purchased counterfeit materials, or by suing Internet service providers, thereby engaging in a protracted civil court battle. The infringement legislation, they say, will allow them to use the federal justice system to go straight to the source of a costly problem. They dismiss concerns about the bill's so-called slippery slope, stressing the rigorous judicial review that all cases would have to undergo to ensure that the law applies. Websites can be blocked only if the U.S. attorney general can prove that it "has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than" to traffic in infringed or counterfeit goods. In instances when copyrighted material has been stolen, the original, legitimate site will not be touched. "The law is meant to go after offenders who are the worst of the worst violators of intellectual property law. They are profiting off others work and the Supreme Court has held that such violations are not protected speech," said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for Whitehouse. Leahy in his commentary piece agreed. "Some have argued the conduct should be excused as free speech because it happens on the Internet," he wrote. "That argument contradicts the basic tenet of copyright law, which, as Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor explained, is the very 'engine of free expression.' " Even if you believe the bill is flawed, said Villanova School of Law Associate Prof. Michael Risch, "when you view it in the most technical way, it's not censorship because the website is still up, you can still get to it through the I.P. address." Now back to the initial claim. It's clear the 19 senators voted unanimously to approve the bill, but does that constitute censoring the Internet? We argue that it does not. Censorship is defined as the deletion of speech or content considered objectionable. For example, when the Chinese blocked websites related to Tiananmen Square, that was censorship. In this case, the sites this law could be applied to do not offer free speech of any kind, they distribute stolen or counterfeit goods. Even if you don't agree with that interpretation, consider what Hudson of the First Amendment Center told us: "I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line." The key there is the phrase "down the line." That may well be true. The threat of censorship could loom. But we simply do not know that for sure. And that was not the intention of the senators who voted in favor of the bill. Had the bloggers proclaimed that the vote "could lead to censorship," they'd be offering an opinion and we'd let them off the hook. But they didn't qualify their statements. They made bold allegations that relied on conjecture, not fact, thereby declaring that the bill will immediately censor the Internet. It will not. We find this statement False.

pomt-11910	An undocumented immigrant "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."	false	/california/statements/2017/oct/20/breitbart/breitbarts-false-and-inflammatory-claim-about-dead/	As authorities continued to investigate the cause of Northern California’s deadly wildfires this week, they refuted what they described as false claims started by the conservative website Breitbart about their investigation. A Breitbart article on Oct. 17, 2017 said Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." Sonoma County sheriff's officials tell a much different story and have called the Breitbart report "completely false." Even so, the article quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. The series of wind-driven fires that started Oct. 8, 2017 has destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings and killed at least 42 people across Northern California. It is the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. While there’s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages. We decided to fact check Breitbart’s controversial claim that Gonzalez is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities. Our research We started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a press conference on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart’s article was published. The sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting "a small fire" that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff's officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A statement by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Here’s the sheriff’s statement at the press conference: "There’s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires. That’s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don’t even know if it’s arson." Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017. Cal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency. Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire’s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was "ongoing" and that it has "not yet determined any specific causes." He declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff’s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires. "There’s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame," Berlant said. "When we have an arson suspect, that’s going to be made public immediately." Berlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities. "Completely false, bad, wrong information" Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart’s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. Crum told BuzzFeed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are "completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way." Crum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez's race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him. "After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls," he added. "There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves." The Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment. In the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued "a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail" for Gonzalez. Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a statement posted online on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request. He added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said. The sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a statement this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff’s office related to Gonzalez. Our ruling An article on the conservative website Breitbart recently claimed that Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who federal officials have indicated is an undocumented immigrant, "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordono said deputies arrested Gonzalez for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. The sheriff added that "there is no indication he is related to these fires at all." A Cal Fire spokesman said the agency has not identified an arson suspect nor has it determined whether arson was the cause of the deadly fires. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials have pointed to Breitbart for fueling false rumors about their investigation. At this point, there’s been no suspect identified and no arrests made tied to these deadly fires, contrary to the website’s inaccurate and irresponsible claim. We rate Breitbart’s claim False.

pomt-07759	The richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/25/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-says-richest-400-taxpayers-taxed-lower-/	Are the rich undertaxed? The answer often depends on who is speaking and how they choose to look at it. Those who argue that the rich are actually overtaxed may say, for example, that the people whose incomes are in the top 1 percent pay roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. (Others who have this opinion argue that the burden on the rich is even higher. PolitiFact.com examined those claims in 2010.) At a Feb. 13 community dinner at the Pilgrim Senior Center, in Warwick, Sen Sheldon Whitehouse offered a different perspective to argue that the richest aren't overtaxed at all. "The IRS recently reported that the 400 biggest income earners in the country were making $334 million each, and were paying 16.6 percent in taxes," he said. According to an account of the meeting in The Warwick Beacon, Whitehouse went on to say that, most people wouldn’t have a tax rate that low unless their income was $28,100 or below. "A hospital orderly making $29,000 a year is therefore paying a higher rate of taxes on their income than someone making $344 million," the Beacon quoted Whitehouse as saying. We decided to check elements of both statements -- the rate the rich paid and the lower income level that would trigger a similar rate. When we asked Whitehouse's staff for the source of the 16.6 percent figure, they sent us to an IRS website that has statistics on the tax returns of the 400 individual taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross incomes. The most recent tax year available is 2007. (According to a transcript provided to us by the Whitehouse staff, the senator actually said he thought the report was from 2009.) One other clarification is important. The IRS is reporting on the top 400 individual tax returns, which could include a couple filing jointly. The IRS report says that, in 2007, the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns was $344 million. The average income tax paid per return was $57 million -- an average of 16.6 percent, as Whitehouse said. So on that point, he was right. Out of curiosity, members of PolitiFact Rhode Island checked our returns for 2007. We found that our tax rates were even lower than 16.6 percent, and we make a lot more than Whitehouse's hypothetical $29,000-a-year hospital orderly. So we checked Whitehouse's example, using tax rates, standard deductions and personal exemptions for both 2007 and 2010. We discovered that Whitehouse was off -- way off. That unmarried orderly filing a simple single return would be taxed at a rate of 9.1 percent in 2007 and 8.7 percent in 2010, not more than 16.6. Then, using IRS tax tables and schedules, we did some math to determine how much income a single person filing the simplest tax return would need before his tax rate exceeded that of the richest Americans. To hit a tax rate of 16.6 percent, that orderly would need to have made about $68,750 in 2007 and $73,500 in 2010, we calculated. When we showed our numbers to Whitehouse's staff, they said our results were misleading because we failed to include taxes for Medicare (1.45 percent) and Social Security (6.2 percent on the first $106,000 of income). "The vast majority of the income of the 400 wealthiest Americans is not subject to payroll taxes, whereas a worker with annual income around $29,000 would have to pay payroll taxes on all of their income," a statement from Whitehouse’s office said. "Leaving this data out of any comparison will paint a very uneven picture of the total taxes paid by working-class Americans." Although IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes are not factored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people. According to calculations by Whitehouse’s office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16.72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16.79 percent. In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report. When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does. We rate his statement as Mostly True.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2011-02-25T00:00:01	2011-02-13	['None']

pomt-05142	"Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties in U.S. are illegals."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-60-percent-public-housing/	One of the strongest charges aimed at illegal immigrants is that not only have they broken the law, but they are relying heavily on government handouts. A PolitiFact reader sent us a link to a Facebook post that lists many such claims of unlawful residents benefiting from federal programs. Among them was the claim that, "Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals." The post went up on June 10 and since then has been shared over 3,900 times. To assess this statement, we looked at the total number of people using HUD subsidized housing. According to HUD’s website, the count was about 9.6 million in 2009, the most recent year for which they have data. That includes public housing, rent vouchers, Section 8 and a couple of other programs. If the 60 percent claim were accurate, then there would be about 5.8 million illegal immigrants living in HUD properties. There are about 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States according to a 2010 Pew Hispanic Center estimate. "It seems implausible on its face," says Chris Herbert, Research Director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. "It would mean that about half of all the illegal immigrants in the country lived in assisted housing." If the practice were so widespread, Herbert says, it would come up often -- and he’s never heard any discussion of it. We checked with another of the country’s leading housing policy groups, the Furman Center For Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, and they too drew a blank. We asked HUD ourselves. A spokesman could find no published report on illegal immigrants in HUD housing. HUD does require information on citizenship when people apply for assistance. Public housing and vouchers represent the bulk of HUD’s subsidized housing. The agency says 96 percent of those residents are citizens and about 4 percent are legal immigrants. "The claim that 60 percent are illegal is certainly nonsensical," says Brian Sullivan, a HUD spokesman. Applicants for subsidized housing must be citizens or legal immigrants. Sullivan notes that undocumented immigrants are allowed to live in subsidized housing if at least one member of the household is in the country legally. Typically, this happens when undocumented parents have a child in the U.S. Anyone born here is automatically a citizen and the parents could then rent in a HUD-subsidized property. In these cases, HUD reduces the subsidy for each undocumented person in the unit. Sullivan says, "The taxpayer would not be on the hook for assisting in their housing." We found one article that references an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants living in subsidized units. An item from the Associated Press says HUD pegged the number at about 30,000. That would be about 0.3 percent of all HUD residents -- a tiny fraction of 60 percent. An unconfirmed blog post in circulation on the Web mentions that Arizona HUD officials estimated that perhaps 10 percent of its occupants are in the country illegally. To be complete, we should note that whatever housing benefits an illegal immigrant might enjoy -- such as being allowed to live in a HUD unit because a family member is a citizen -- those benefits don’t count in certain kinds of deportation hearings. The government can deport someone if it determines they are a "public charge" which is defined as someone who is "primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence." HUD housing is not part of that calculation. Clearly, there are some illegal immigrants living in HUD housing and there are rules that might allow them to stay, but in no way do the numbers match the claim that 60 percent of HUD housing residents are "illegals." Our ruling The Facebook post says "Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals." The closest but unverified estimate we could find for illegal occupants in HUD housing is less than 1 percent nationwide. The claim of 60 percent is ridiculously false. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06079	Eliminating "Obamacare" ... "saves $95 billion a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-repealing-health-law-sav/	One of Mitt Romney’s favorite talking points is the need to shrink the federal government. The former Massachusetts governor says he will cut government spending and reduce taxes if elected president. Where would he start? With the national health reform plan signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. "The number one to cut is Obamacare. That saves $95 billion a year," Romney said in a primary debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012. That savings figure is one he has cited before, and we found it to be incorrect. The national health care law leaves in place existing insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. It includes an individual mandate, requiring almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine. And employers that don't offer health insurance to their employees will have to pay fines, with a few exceptions. For backup to his savings claim, Romney’s campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of proposed laws. In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, "the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act," a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011. On page 5 of that report, the CBO projected $95 billion less in outlays in 2016 if the law is repealed. But it’s important to note that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit. The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding Medicaid. But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare. And, it generated revenues by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the "Cadillac" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers. In other words, fully repealing the law would also repeal mechanisms that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes. When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed. Our ruling Romney said repealing the health care law would save $95 billion a year. But that only accounts for outlays in one year, 2016. Because of the revenue sources that the law established, repealing it actually adds significantly to the deficit over the long haul, according to the CBO. We rate Romney’s statement False.

pomt-10815	"I'm probably one of the four or five best-known Americans in the world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/24/rudy-giuliani/famous-but-not-that-famous/	Rudy Giuliani has been a world traveler since he ended his term as New York City mayor to become a security consultant. He says he's made 91 trips to 35 countries in the past five years. On a whirlwind tour of the United Kingdom recently, he met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and schmoozed Ronald Reagan's old friend Margaret Thatcher. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II gave him an honorary knighthood for his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks. He must have been feeling particularly well-loved when he bragged to reporters in London that he was one of the "four or five" most famous Americans in the world. Reporters were quick to ask: Who else is on the list? "Bill Clinton … Hillary," Rudy began, before aides (wisely?) pulled him away. He might want to add those two guys from his own party: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. We know Giuliani is from New York, and if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. But still … top five? In the world? We turned to the world of scientific polling. Polling the globe is a daunting proposition. But representatives of both the Gallup World Poll and the Pew Global Attitudes Project said they have never queried the world on who among us Americans is best known. We asked Giuliani's campaign staff, but they didn't offer anything to back up the claim. Opinionmakers across the Web guffawed at the notion that Giuliani ranks so high and were willing to offer other ideas. The New York Daily News suggested Brangelina, Madonna and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Wonkette, a political gossip blog, offered suggestions from George Washington to Michael Jackson. Chris Reed, a San Diego Union-Tribune blogger, said Colin Powell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and slew of other celebs are more famous. (Fair warning: Reed calls his blog "America's Finest Blog.") We here at PolitiFact finally turned to an unscientific — but world-famous — measure of celebrity: Google hits. Here's what we found: "George W. Bush": 36.4-million hits "Oprah": 21.9-million hits "Tom Cruise": 10.1-million hits "Angelina Jolie": 9.9-million hits "Brad Pitt": 7.2-million hits "Hillary Clinton": 5.8-million hits "Bill Clinton": 5.8-million hits "Dick Cheney": 2.5-million hits "Arnold Schwarzenegger": 2.3-million hits "Rudy Giuliani": 2.1-million hits. That puts Giuliani at No. 10. And we didn't even include Madonna, because we couldn't figure out how to weed out the religious and artwork references. For all of the above reasons, we rate this claim "pants on fire."	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-09-24T00:00:00	2007-09-19	['United_States']

pomt-06269	Says she "brought together business, labor and hospitals to give 94,000 Oregon children health care."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/26/eileen-brady/how-big-role-did-eileen-brady-play-expanding-child/	In her bid to be Portland’s next mayor, Eileen Brady has been getting a lot of mileage out of her work on health care reform. Her campaign website calls her service on the Oregon Health Fund Board -- the board tasked with reworking the state’s system -- "perhaps Eileen’s most important public service role." That theme keeps popping up again and again. Most recently, we spotted it in a Facebook ad, which said "On the Oregon Health Fund Board, Eileen brought together business, labor and hospitals to give 94,000 Oregon children health care." She also brought the board up in her announcement speech back in early September. "In 2009 Governor Kulongoski appointed me as vice chair of the Oregon Health Fund Board ... Today, as the result of the work we did on that board and the Legislature’s commitment we were able to provide health insurance to an additional 94,000 kids," she said. "During this process I came to know insurance executives, hospital leaders, labor leaders, and activists. And I helped find the common ground that enabled us to put our differences aside and put our children first." We wondered whether the claim that she brought together these constituencies was true. Brady’s spokesman John Isaacs, happy to help us reach a True rating on this fact check, sent us a long list of folks to get in touch with who would be happy to vouch for her leadership skills. "I expect that you will call each of these people," he wrote. Not so surprisingly, they all gave Brady rave reviews. Tom Chamberlain, president of the AFL-CIO and a member of the board, said he and Brady pushed for a consensus-style committee process in which "we got input from everybody." Still, he said, "when Eileen and I presented that, I don't recall a lot of push back." As for the general idea that Brady helped build agreement between groups, Chamberlain said "that's fair to say," adding that as a vice chair of the committee, "she probably deserves a little more credit." "All of us worked really hard and all of us went to town-hall-like meetings all over the state," Chamberlain said. Brady, he said, carried her own weight and might have gone to more meetings than anybody else, though he couldn’t remember for certain. Next up was Alan Bates, a Democratic senator from Medford, and one of two authors of the bill that created the board on which Brady sat. After the committee had crafted their proposal, Bates said, he took Eileen with him to a meeting of the Senate’s Republican caucus. "Eileen stepped up as a business leader and on a very emotional and solid basis really sold them," he said. "Eileen was really germane to getting that done." Bates, it should be noted, has endorsed Brady. As has Jonathan Ater, who served as the other vice chair on the Oregon Health Fund Board. Naturally, then, Ater had good things to say about Brady. "I do not think the Legislature would have been able to adopt a children's health insurance program unless there had been a very substantial consensus built up," he said. "I think Eileen was a critical part of bridging that discussion." The difficult thing with a statement like this is that we can’t base a ruling off personal accounts alone -- particularly personal accounts from supporters. It’s also hard to parse out exactly how essential any one person was. What we can do, though, is offer some context. The road to health care reform in Oregon has been a pretty twisty one, involving hundreds of people and meetings over the course of many years. The specific change that Brady touts on Facebook and in her speech has roots stretching back several years. In June 2007, Sen. Bates and Sen. Ben Westlund, D-Bend, manged to get the Healthy Oregon Act through the state Legislature. That act, the product of an 18-month effort that included hearings across Oregon, set "essential health care benefits for all Oregonians." It also allocated money for creating a seven-member Oregon Health Fund Board, which would turn the concepts outlined in the legislation into a workable plan. Brady was appointed to that board. After more than a year’s worth of work and dozens of meetings, the board presented then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski with a fleshed-out plan. The Oregonian reported at the time that "the panel crafted its plan during the past year with volunteer committee help from doctors, hospitals, insurers and others in the health care industry and testimony from more than 1,000 Oregonians across the state." Included in that plan was a recommendation for a 1 percent tax on hospitals and health insurance providers to increase the number of children and low-income adults on the Oregon Health Plan. The Legislature approved the legislation in 2009 and children have been enrolling since. Given the long and involved history, it would be an overstatement to say that Brady was so integral to all of this that it wouldn’t have happened without her. That said, her position as vice chair of the board that ultimately suggested the provider tax to expand children’s health care is nothing to sneeze at. The board had to balance the needs and desires of several constituencies and Brady was one of the leaders during those talks. The history, stretching back to when Bates and Westlund first traveled the state to put together their initial act, is important additional information, but the comment that Brady "helped find the common ground" can’t really be disputed. We find this one Mostly True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.	None	Eileen Brady	None	None	None	2011-11-26T07:45:36	2011-11-15	['Oregon']

pomt-09323	"A filibuster has never really been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/jeffrey-toobin/toobin-says-supreme-court-nominee-has-never-been-f/	The announcement by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens that he plans to retire later this year has raised the curtain on a new confirmation battle -- and with it the possibility of a Republican filibuster of President Barack Obama's nominee to succeed the long-serving justice. In public comments, key Republican senators have been carefully noncommittal about how far they'll go. Against this backdrop, legal affairs analyst Jeffrey Toobin told Stephen Colbert on the April 12, 2010, edition of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report that "a filibuster has never really been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice." We decided to check the history books to see if that was true. There's little question that filibusters against a Supreme Court nomination are unusual. But we did find one example that would seem to fit Toobin's description: President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice in 1968. In June 1968 -- just five months before the election to succeed Johnson -- then-Chief Justice Earl Warren told the president that he planned to retire soon. Fearing a victory by Republican Richard Nixon in the November election, Johnson, a Democrat, acted quickly to nominate a successor to the liberal chief justice. The president chose Fortas, a longtime friend. Many members of the Republican minority, joined by some conservative Southern Democrats, mobilized against the Fortas nomination for a variety of reasons, including his liberal record, his "crony"-like ties to Johnson, and the hope that Nixon would win and appoint someone else. Initially, it looked like Fortas' nomination would squeak by the Senate. But he hemorrhaged support after revelations that he'd attended White House staff meetings as a sitting justice, informed the president about secret Supreme Court deliberations and been paid for a series of lectures at American University by a collection of private-sector interests whose business could come before the court. When Fortas' nomination went to the floor on Sept. 24, it wasn't clear whether he had the votes to be confirmed. Some news accounts at the time described the opposition as a filibuster. For a 2005 Washington Post article that looked back on the confirmation battle, congressional reporter Charles Babington tracked down some of the original coverage and found a page-one story in the Post that declared, "Fortas Debate Opens with a Filibuster." It went on to describe the day's actions as a "full-dress Republican-led filibuster." Meanwhile, the New York Times said that Fortas' opponents "began a historic filibuster today." Under Senate rules at the time, breaking through a filibuster and proceeding to an up-or-down vote -- a process called securing cloture -- required the votes of 67 senators, assuming that all 100 senators were present and voting. (That number was later reduced to 60, where it stands today.) On Oct. 1, following four days of debate, the Senate held a cloture vote. The final tally was 45 senators in favor of cloture and 43 against -- well short of the 59 required to proceed to a final vote, given that only 88 senators were present and voting. Seeing the writing on the wall, Johnson -- a master of Senate strategy from his tenure as majority leader -- withdrew Fortas' nomination for chief justice. Sure sounds like a filibuster, right? Yes, but there are some nuances. During a partisan conflict in the mid 2000s about judicial filibusters, Republicans argued that the Fortas case -- then being used as a frequent Democratic talking point -- wasn't really a filibuster after all. C. Boyden Gray, former chief counsel to President George H.W. Bush, wrote in a 2003 op-ed that "four days of debate on a nomination for chief justice is hardly a filibuster." He cited the closing floor speech of none other than Sen. Robert Griffin, R-Mich., the leader of the fight against Fortas. Griffin asked, "When is a filibuster, Mr. President? ... There have been no dilatory quorum calls or other dilatory tactics employed. The speakers who have taken the floor have addressed themselves to the subject before the Senate, and a most interesting and useful discussion has been recorded in the Congressional Record." Griffin reportedly wrote a letter in 2003 reiterating his belief that he and his allies had not engaged in a filibuster. A 2002 report by the Congressional Research Service -- the authoritative, nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- provides a bit of support for this argument, noting that the mere fact that a cloture vote has been taken does not necessarily prove that an actual filibuster was under way. "Supporters of a nomination may move for cloture, in order to speed action, even when opponents may not consider themselves to be conducting a filibuster against it, or when they may have only threatened, but not actually conducted, a filibuster," the report says. "Since filibusters may be conducted through a variety of tactics, there are no specific actions that definitively indicate the occurrence of a filibuster, much less of a mere threat to filibuster." That said, CRS didn't say it wasn't a filibuster, either. And many scholars agree with the press coverage at the time that Fortas' opponents did, at the very least, threaten a filibuster, and quite likely undertook one outright. "It was understood as a filibuster at the time," Laura Kalman, a professor of history at the University of California at Santa Barbara and author of Abe Fortas: A Biography, told MSNBC in 2005, adding that "both Abe Fortas and LBJ are spinning in their graves at the notion there was no filibuster." Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a 2004 column that saying the opposition didn't really filibuster "is like arguing, 'Yes, I shot him, but I can’t be charged with murder because he would have died of cancer anyhow.'" In an interview for this article, Ornstein acknowledged that the peculiarities of the Fortas episode do suggest that it merits "an asterisk," but he added that he still believes it's accurate to call it "a successful filibuster." The official guardians of Senate history don't mince words. The Senate Historical Office's Web site headlines its recap of the nomination fight, "Filibuster Derails Supreme Court Appointment." In an interview, Senate historian Donald Ritchie said that the term "filibuster is a matter of definition, and Boyden Gray, as an attorney, was defining it to suit the purposes of his client. Historians and political scientists would define it differently." Let's return to Toobin's statement. We'll acknowledge that there's some debate about whether Fortas' opponents in 1968 officially launched a filibuster. But as CRS points out, there's no magic test to determine whether a filibuster has actually occurred. Meanwhile, news accounts from the time describe it as a filibuster, and a variety of scholars agree that Fortas' opponents at the very least used the implied threat of a filibuster as leverage. So we rate Toobin's statement False.	None	Jeffrey Toobin	None	None	None	2010-04-14T19:55:41	2010-04-12	['None']
pomt-04025	Says that 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/01/texas-federation-republican-women/republican-group-says-9-million-50-million-illegal/	A Texas group urging congressional action on immigration also says the number of illegal U.S. residents might vary more than five-fold. The Texas Federation of Republican Women, which describes itself as the state’s most powerful women’s political group, said in its Jan. 17, 2013, resolution: "Within the United States, there currently reside between nine (9) and fifty (50) million undocumented residents from all cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities." That’s some range. The 9 million figure undershoots a widely bandied estimate of 11 million, most recently included in December 2012 news accounts from USA Today and the Associated Press. The 50 million figure seems off the charts. And the full statement indicates that 3 percent to 16 percent of more than 315 million U.S. residents are here illegally. To our inquiries, a federation spokeswoman, Laura Sorrell of Austin, said the group drew its figures from different sources. She said by email that the group had no source to provide for the 9 million figure, while the 50 million figure was provided by a former fellow with Rice University’s James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan. The 50 million methodology By phone, Schaan told us she reached her estimate, which she said she has not laid out in a research presentation, by assuming that annual apprehensions of border crossers represent about 10 percent of actual crossers, an assumption she said she based on years of speaking engagements, including many in the Texas-Mexico border region. Border region "landowners, local law enforcement, those living the reality of human migration, would say that maybe 3 percent of those people that crossed were being apprehended," Schaan said. "In some cases, thousands of people a week are crossing properties with virtually no apprehensions." Schaan was referring to apprehensions by the Border Patrol, part of the Department of Homeland Security, which reported in July 2011 that the number of apprehensions declined 61 percent from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, with the vast majority of them occurring along the southwest border near Mexico. The 2010 total was the lowest level since 1972; peaks in apprehensions, of early 1.7 million, were reached in 1986 and 2000, it says. Yet the report cautions against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. "Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals," it says. "The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown." Other estimates To take our own look, we turned to several oft-quoted sources, each one lately suggesting there are 11 million to 13 million illegal U.S. residents. According to a March 2012 Department of Homeland Security report, there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, about the same number as in 2010, and a little more than half of the 22 million legal foreign-born residents in the country. Some history: The United States was home to up to 4 million illegal residents in 1980, the report says, with the number peaking at 11.8 million in 2007. The report, drawing from U.S. Census Bureau household surveys and Homeland Security figures, says some 55 percent of the unauthorized residents entered the country between 1995 and 2004, with entrants since 2005 accounting for 14 percent of the illegal 2011 residents. "It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007," the report says, "given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement." The report says 59 percent of the country’s unauthorized immigrants in 2011, some 6.8 million, were from Mexico, with 2.8 million living in California, 1.8 million in Texas. More recently, the Pew Hispanic Center said in December 2012 that 11.1 million unauthorized residents lived in the country as of March 2011, "unchanged from the previous two years and a continuation of the sharp decline in this population since its peak in 2007," the center said, when the number of illegal immigrants in the United States peaked at 12 million. Both Homeland Security and the Pew center devised their estimates by drawing on the census surveys and applying a "residual" method of calculation. "Under this methodology," Pew wrote, "a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population — naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, temporary legal residents and refugees — is subtracted from the total foreign-born population. The remainder, or residual, is the source of population estimates and characteristics of unauthorized immigrants." The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said it took a similar approach to conclude in an August 2012 report that there were 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010, though it said that after adjustments of undercounting of the population by the U.S, Census Bureau the total could have been 11.5 million or more. Most "research indicates that roughly 10 percent of illegals are not counted in Census Bureau surveys," the report says, meaning the "true size of the illegal population could be 11.5 million. If the undercount is larger, then the total illegal alien population is larger." By email, the center’s research director, Steve Camarota, said there could be 13 million illegal residents in the country. He said, though, that he doesn’t see how administrative records such as births or school enrollments would justify any conclusion that such estimates are off by huge margins. "There is uncertainty in the numbers," Camarota said. "But not that big." We also touched base with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says its mission is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. A spokesman, Jack Martin, said by phone that the group has taken up the estimates by Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies and made adjustments for what it believes to be some untallied residents. He said FAIR believes there are 11.9 million illegal residents. Weaknesses in 50 million figure We asked Martin for his thoughts on the topmost figure in the Texas group’s resolution, 50 million. He said there is no logical basis for such an elevated estimate, though similar errors were made in the past when observers incorrectly counted each government apprehension of an illegal immigrant as an immigrant — even if the same person was apprehended by authorities a dozen times in a matter of weeks or over a year. Worse, he said, some observers erred by adding each year’s apprehensions to the tally for each subsequent year, inaccurately describing the ballooning total as a count of illegal immigrants in the country at that time. Similarly, Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, said it’s a mistake to convert the number of Border Patrol apprehensions into a count of individuals living in the country. Aside from noting the same weakness identified by Martin, Passel said by phone that given that most apprehensions involve men, relating total apprehensions to the number of illegal residents in the country would erroneously signal that Mexico is overrun with women alone. Also not factored in, Passel said, is the fact that many illegal residents travel, staying in the U.S. for a few months at a time or less. Schaan’s methodology "has no validity," Passel said. Finally, Martin also sounded a general cautionary note about pinning down the number of illegal residents. "Any estimate is simply an estimate," he said. Schaan stuck by her figure, emailing: "Clearly we have a difference of opinion on the approximate number, and any research group will be compelled to support their own positions and downplay anything different. There is no question in my mind the 11 million to 13 million figure is low, but there is no way to prove it one way or the other." Sorrell, of the federation, told us by email that the point of its resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are. Our ruling The federation said there are 9 million to 50 million illegal U.S. residents. At a glance, that’s almost certainly right, though one could similarly say there are zero to 100 million. Too vast a range is misleading. It’s also fair to concede that no one knows the precise number of illegal residents. However, accepted estimates, tied to household surveys and other research, suggest that the likely range tops out at 12 million or so, only one quarter of the federation’s unsupported top-end 50 million figure. We rate this claim as Mostly False.	None	Texas Federation of Republican Women	None	None	None	2013-02-01T15:25:36	2013-01-17	['United_States']
pomt-15178	"There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/23/se-cupp/se-cupp-only-about-30-other-countries-offer-birthr/	The country’s 150-year-old right of citizenship to every person upon birth on U.S. soil has become the latest test question for GOP presidential candidates, with Donald Trump and Ben Carson coming out strongly in favor of ending the practice. In an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, conservative pundit S.E. Cupp suggested the United States’ law makes it an outlier on the issue compared to the rest of the world. "There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship," she said on the Aug. 23, 2015, show, "making the U.S. kind of an anomaly." We wanted to see if the United States is one of 30 countries in the world to offer automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. We reached out to Cupp through her publicist but did not hear back. Around the world The legal term for birthright citizenship is jus soli, or "right of the soil." It’s different from the term jus sanguinis, or "right of blood," referring to laws which rely on a person’s heritage to determine his or her citizenship status. Birthright citizenship in the United States was first made law by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, primarily to grant legal status to emancipated slaves. The amendment stipulates that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." The Supreme Court solidified the Constitution’s authority on this issue in 1898 by ruling that citizenship is a right offered unconditionally to all born on U.S. soil. How many other countries share this guarantee? NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, compiled a list that shows 33 nations grant citizenship to anyone born within their borders. The United States is joined by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, along with nearly every country in Central and South America. The United States and Canada are the only two "developed" countries, as defined by the International Monetary Fund, that still have unrestricted birthright citizenship laws. A closer look at the list shows an interesting trend: Countries that offer birthright citizenship are located almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar citizenship policy. So why does birthright citizenship literally divide the world? One explanation may be colonialism, said John Skrentny, a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego. As European countries colonized the Americas, Skrentny said, many created lenient naturalization laws in order to grow and overpower native populations. "Getting people to move in was a good way to establish authority," he said. This method of citizenship hasn’t changed that much in the centuries since. Many of the birthright laws in South America have remained due to low immigration numbers, he said. The United States, however, has retained its birthright citizenship laws, even as it admits around 1 million people every year through its legal immigration system. Canada, which also has a birthright citizenship law, still takes in around 250,000 legal immigrants a year. Conversely, in Europe, many countries have modified their requirements for citizenship in recent years. Ireland got rid of its birthright citizenship law in 2005, and France did away with its own in 1993. Many European countries still maintain a version of birthright citizenship, however. In Germany and the United Kingdom, citizenship is now automatically granted to a person if at least one of his or her parents is a citizen or permanent resident. Our ruling Cupp said, "There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship, making the U.S. kind of an anomaly." The United States is one of 33 countries around the world that offer citizenship to every person born on their soil. Among those 33, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. In contrast, most other developed countries have added more requirements for citizenship. This makes the United States somewhat of an outlier on the issue. We rate Cupp’s statement True. Clarification: Among the 33 countries with birthright citizenship, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. An earlier version of this story was unclear.	None	S.E.

pomt-01968	All 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/19/paul-ryan/only-3-natos-28-members-spend-what-they-promised-d/	Two days before President Barack Obama announced he would consider military options for halting a violent Islamic insurgency in Iraq, former vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan gave a speech on foreign policy. The Wisconsin Republican and House Budget Committee chairman, known primarily for his work on domestic issues, argued for a buildup of the U.S. military. And he suggested that America’s allies need to do more. Speaking June 11, 2014 at a Center for a New American Security conference in Washington, D.C., Ryan said that "the fight against terrorism is global in scope. And we can’t fight it alone. We need partners." He added: "We have to work better with all of our allies, all around the world. In Western Europe, we have to strike a balance. Our friends can’t depend on us for all of their defense needs and we can’t dictate to them all of their defense policies. Every member of NATO has pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us." NATO has 28 members. With tensions rising in Iraq, the Ukraine and elsewhere, is it true that only three NATO countries spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense? NATO's evolution The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949, largely to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. There were 12 founding members, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The new allies agreed that "an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all" and that following such an attack, each would take "such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force." From 2004 through 2011, NATO provided training in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a focus on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO's top official said the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine's armed forces following Russia's annexation of the ex-Soviet republic's Crimea territory. The alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO’s latest annual report, for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures: United States -- 73 percent United Kingdom -- 6.6 percent France -- 4.9 percent Germany -- 4.7 percent Since 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased. Ryan’s claim To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members "have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities." One of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members "should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense." Only the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says. But newer NATO figures, released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark: NATO member Amount spent on defense Percentage of gross domestic product spent on defense United States $735.2 billion 4.4 United Kingdom $60.3 billion 2.4 Greece $5.67 billion 2.3 Estonia $479 million 2 The day before Ryan gave his speech, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called for European allies to increase their defense spending, noting that since Estonia had met the 2 percent goal, he expected other nations could also do so. The fact that only four NATO members had met that mark had also been noted previously by news media including the New York Times and Reuters. Our rating Ryan said all 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us." Ryan neglected to count a fourth member, Estonia. But that oversight doesn’t negate his larger point, which is that few NATO countries meet the 2 percent benchmark. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06119	"And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-fewer-state-e/	Private-sector jobs in New Jersey may be on the rise, but the number of state government employees is lower than it was nearly 11 years ago. During a Dec. 20 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pointed to that statistic and other achievements as examples of what he’s been able to accomplish in the face of a Democratic-controlled Legislature. "And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001," Christie told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. "So, we’ve made government smaller. We’ve made it smarter. We’ve made it less expensive for people. And we’ve done that with a Democratic Legislature." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s numbers are solid. Based on the latest preliminary statistics from state and federal officials, the number of "state government" workers dropped to 137,800 in November, which represents 600 fewer employees than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001. Let’s break down the figures. When Whitman stepped down to become head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there were 138,400 state workers, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the time Christie took office in January 2010, the number of state government employees had increased to 151,900, marking a jump of nearly 10 percent since January 2001. As of November of this year, the number of state workers had fallen during Christie’s tenure by 14,100, or about 9.3 percent. When compared to Whitman’s final month in office, the decline is a more modest 0.4 percent, or 600 workers, but nevertheless, it’s still a reduction. Those statistics include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. But these figures don’t account for public employees in municipal and county governments, and local school districts. Between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the number of state employees has dropped by about 4,738 from when Christie took office to November, state officials said. Most of the staff reductions have been due to retirements, with only 743 positions eliminated through layoffs, officials said. "As to attrition, there has been a concerted effort by the administration to shrink the size of state government, which had grown too large and costly. At the same time, the Governor has insisted that departments be efficient and effective in the delivery of services," Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an email. "As we all know as well by now, fiscal realities have required painful budgeting decisions at the same time." The wave of retirements comes at a time when state officials have been demanding greater contributions from public-sector workers toward their benefits. Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers, attributed the retirements to employees’ concerns over benefits and the age of the workforce The reduction began with hiring freezes under former Gov. Jon Corzine, Rosenstein said. "It is an aging workforce," Rosenstein said. "This is essentially attrition....This is all to be expected." Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe also said a "great deal of anxiety about benefits" is driving the retirements. When Christie took office, most public workers got the message that the state was facing significant long-term fiscal problems, Keefe said. Our ruling In a television interview, Christie claimed "New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001." The governor’s right, according to the latest preliminary labor statistics. By November, there were 600 fewer state workers than when Whitman stepped down in January 2001. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12784	Recent immigration raids "are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/17/robert-menendez/sen-bob-menendez-says-immigration-raids-not-busine/	Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez says recent sweeps by federal authorities of immigrants living in the country illegally are "striking fear" in immigrant communities because they have not been limited to criminals, a category President Donald Trump labeled as his top priority. "The raids are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens," the senator from New Jersey said in a video posted on his Twitter account Feb. 13. "And because the administration eliminated the Obama administration’s enforcement priorities — where the first and top enforcement were criminal aliens to be deported, then secondly recent border crossers, and then the third and final tier was anybody else — because they did away with that enforcement priority list, now anyone who they come upon who may be undocumented ultimately gets picked up and sent away." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump campaigned on promises to deport immigrants illegally in the country, prioritizing the removal of those who have been convicted of crimes or pose threats to national security, such as drug dealers and murderers. Is Menendez accurate in claiming that recent immigration sweeps are not business as usual and include people without criminal convictions? We found that recent operations are routine, but they also included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Trump’s executive order prioritizing removals Less than a week after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that directed the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize for removal a broad range of people, including individuals convicted of crimes "involving moral turpitude" (such as murder); engaged in terrorist activities; convicted of any criminal offense; charged with any criminal offense, even if the charge has not been resolved; with final orders of removal; and individuals who commit acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense. Trump’s priorities "sweep far more broadly," and "do not set up an internal hierarchy to indicate which categories should be emphasized when resources are short — as they always are," said David A. Martin, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Virginia and immigration expert, in an analysis for Vox. The executive order basically takes the broadest possible definition of "criminal alien," said Martin, a former principal deputy general counsel at DHS, in an interview with PolitiFact. In the later years of Obama’s administration, the top priority for removal were threats to national security, border security, and public safety; ranked as a second priority were individuals convicted of misdemeanors, recent immigration law violators and individuals who had "significantly abused" visa programs; the lowest priority were individuals who had been issued a final order for removal on or after Jan. 1, 2014. Prior to outlining those priorities in November 2014, Obama was labeled by immigrants’ rights activists as "Deporter-in-Chief" because his administration had deported more than 2 million people. ICE targeted operations across the country In the early days of the Trump administration, elected officials and media outlets have reported that hundreds of immigrants were arrested in cities across America, including people who immigrant rights advocates say don’t fit Trump’s prominent descriptions of public safety threats. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement Feb. 13 that said an agency within his department, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, last week conducted a series of targeted enforcement operations in multiple cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, which led to the arrest of more than 680 people. About 75 percent of them had been convicted of crimes that included but were not limited to homicide, aggravated sexual abuse and drug trafficking, the statement said. The operations also targeted "individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges," Kelly said. The targeted operations have been common practice for many years, he said. An ICE spokeswoman provided PolitiFact fact sheets for targeted operations in recent days and also highlighted previous operations under the Obama administration that focused on arresting criminals living in the country illegally. A December 2012 Congressional Research Service report on interior immigration enforcement said ICE’s National Fugitive Operations Program targets included at-large criminal aliens and "fugitive aliens who have not been convicted of a crime." As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted, fugitive operations in fiscal year 2010 (Obama’s first full fiscal year) led to 35,774 arrests. In fiscal 2011, there were 39,466 arrests. Still, Menendez’s office pointed to parts of Kelly’s statement that said 75 percent -- not 100 percent -- of those arrested were criminal aliens and to the line saying that among the arrested were individuals who had violated immigration laws. To further contrast Trump and Obama’s policies, the senator’s team also referenced a recent deportee, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. The 35-year-old woman had been living in Arizona and had a deportation order, but instead of removing her from the country, the Obama administration required her to check in periodically as they focused on deporting violent criminals, the New York Times reported. She was arrested during her last check-in with ICE and deported Feb. 9. ICE said they removed Garcia de Rayos because she had a felony conviction and a deportation order. The Mexican national had used a fake Social Security number for employment and pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, according to the Washington Post. A day after Menendez’s claim that recent immigration sweeps "are not business as usual," Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in an MSNBC interview Feb. 14 said he had been told by ICE that there were people arrested who had no other violation besides being in the country unlawfully. "But some of them were caught up wrong place, wrong time. They're going after somebody, somebody else was in the apartment and they got taken up," Garcetti said. On Feb. 15, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old Mexican man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, who had been granted deferred deportation protection during the Obama administration was detained by immigration authorities Feb. 10 in Washington state. ICE told Reuters that Ramirez was arrested "based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety." Ramirez’s lawyers told the news agency he had been pressured by ICE agents "to falsely admit affiliation." Ramirez’s detention was not connected to the recent targeted enforcement actions, ICE said. He was arrested when officers went to a home to take into custody another person, a previously deported convicted felon. Our ruling Menendez said that recent immigration raids "are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens." Deportations are being conducted on a broader basis than before. But his statement gives the impression that there are widespread deportations of law-abiding people. For the most part, deportations are still focused on people who committed other crimes. Menendez’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. Overall, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bebb6ca-9052-404a-a8b1-fd006c70c1cb	None	Robert Menendez	None	None	None	2017-02-17T15:41:37	2017-02-13	['None']
pomt-03680	"Women in Ohio earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/24/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-cites-wage-gap-between-ohio-women/	Wedged between April Fools Day and the April 15 tax filing deadline is a lesser- known April milestone that feminist and labor groups, the U.S. Department of Labor and the White House are eager to publicize. By their reckoning, April 9 is the day when female wage earners catch up to the amount of money their higher-earning male counterparts collected during the previous year. They refer to it as Equal Pay Day. Numerous politicians noted the occasion this year by issuing press releases. President Obama issued a presidential proclamation. Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge decried earnings disparities on her Facebook page, where she cited an analysis of the wage gap produced by the National Partnership on Women and Families and a study by the American Association of University Women in saying: "Women in Ohio earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man." Fudge accurately relayed the data released by those groups, but how accurate was their material? Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which the groups relied on, show the 77 percent pay gap percent figure they cited, but an October 2012 report on women’s earnings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated a smaller wage gap for Ohio: 83.6 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the varied pay gap assessments are due to differences in how each agency conducts its measurements. The Census Bureau and women’s groups look at differences in annual earnings, while the BLS examines earnings on a weekly basis. "Analyzing the weekly figures can be more precise in certain ways, like accounting for work hours that vary over the course of the year, and less accurate in others, like certain forms of compensation that don’t get paid as weekly wages," the Labor Department said last year in a blog entry on the pay gap. "No matter which number you start with, the differences in pay for women and men really add up. " The National Partnership for Women and Families decided to use Census Bureau material in examining the annual median earnings for full-time, year-round workers because "it has the longest history and it is the most frequently cited data," according to the group‘s director of workplace fairness, Sarah Crawford. Crawford said BLS’ weekly earnings data includes some workers who work full-time, but not all year, excludes the self-employed, and also underestimates earnings from yearly bonuses. PolitiFact has made several examinations of the claim that women earn 76 to 77 percent as much as men, and found that they lacked context because they failed to account for factors like education, type of job, age of employee and experience level. For example, an October study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equality for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s salaries a year after graduation from college. It found a wage gap in almost all occupations, but concluded it was a smaller 6.6 percent when qualifiers like education, training, age, and parental status were taken into account. That gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’ ability to negotiate salaries, the report found .An AAAU researcher noted the wage gap can grow as careers progress. Fudge is right that there’s a gap in pay between men and women, though the size of that gap depends on the statistics one consults. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-05579	Says Ohio Treasurer Josh "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his (Republican) Senate campaign."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/03/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-josh-mandel-accused-ban/	Ohio Democrats have turned state Treasurer Josh Mandel into their favorite punching bag. They question the GOP Senate candidate’s ambition, his work ethic and his truthfulness. Now the Ohio Democratic Party and Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign are questioning Mandel’s integrity. Mandel announced last month that his office was cutting ties with two banks he suspects of fraud. His opponents pounced. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown and former state party press secretary, emailed that Mandel had raised questions about fraud while campaigning for the treasurer’s post nearly two years ago. "Why," Barasky wondered, "did Mandel not lead the way by acting against the banks as soon as he took office?" An email from the state party had similar language but was much more direct. The missive was loaded with pointed accusations that Mandel allowed "alleged fraud" to occur and suggestions that he acted only when it became politically convenient to do so. PolitiFact Ohio decided to home in on the overarching theme of the party’s news release, which was conveyed in the document’s subtitle: "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign." Of interest are the two core contentions -- that Mandel claimed bank fraud in June 2010 and did nothing until now. But before we go any further, let’s dispense with some helpful background. The two banks in question are Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp. Combined, they hold more than $41 billion in international assets owned by four of Ohio’s five pension funds. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued BNY Mellon in March 2012, accusing the bank of overcharging two pension funds on foreign currency transactions. DeWine was still reviewing the foreign currency practices of State Street, his spokeswoman said at the time. Mandel announced his decision to dump both banks on March 19, days after DeWine filed the suit. In a news release, the treasurer’s office noted that BNY Mellon and State Street "have been accused of defrauding pension funds in Ohio and numerous other states." PolitiFact Ohio is not about to referee these court disputes. Instead, we set out to determine whether the Ohio Democratic Party was correct in its criticism of Mandel’s actions. The party’s March 20 news release offered three supporting statements in bullet-point fashion and under the heading "Here’s what we know." The three points, as they appeared: 21 months ago in June 2010, Mandel first alleged fraud by Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Nine months ago in June 2011, he asked Attorney General Mike DeWine to investigate "foreign currency exchange practices of the custodial banks" such as BNY and State Street. Despite turning it into a campaign issue, only yesterday did he actually take action. The state party has cited three news articles as key sources for these claims: a June 2010 Columbus Dispatch story, a September 2010 Cincinnati Enquirer story and a Crain’s Cleveland Business report from 2011. Let’s dig into the party’s timeline. The "21 months ago" claim is based on the Dispatch article. Mandel at the time was running against Boyce, the Democratic incumbent. Other Ohio newspapers first reported issues about State Street around that time. Although the Democrats cite The Dispatch piece as the first utterance of fraud, the story led with Mandel attacking Boyce for "cronyism and corruption." His main beef was that Boyce, his opponent, had awarded work to State Street, which had hired his top deputy’s friend as a lobbyist. A paragraph in The Dispatch story noted that State Street was "under investigation in California for possible fraud involving $56 million in state pension funds there." But nowhere in the article did Mandel directly address that State Street probe. And he did not mention BNY Mellon at all. It would be wrong to say that the State Street accusations were not on his radar screen. Ten days before The Dispatch ran its story, Plain Dealer reporter Joe Guillen wrote a detailed piece on Boyce’s decision to award the contract to State Street despite the issues in California. Mandel is not quoted, but three days later he referenced the story in a letter demanding answers from State Street officials. The letter, a copy of which was provided to Guillen, alluded to the California lawsuit but mainly inquired about State Street’s hiring of Noure Alo, the lobbyist tied to Boyce’s deputy. For his part, Boyce always has maintained he did nothing improper. Between news coverage and the letter, three things are apparent. One, Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering, an explicit accusation his spokesman made to the Dayton Daily News on May 23, 2010. Two, the fraud accusation did not originate with Mandel; it originated in California. Three, Mandel never raised concerns about BNY Mellon. PolitiFact Ohio scoured a LexisNexis database of news articles and found the first mention of Mandel and BNY Mellon in an Associated Press story that ran a few days before the Crain’s report, six months after Mandel took office. It also is important to note that Mandel did not accuse State Street of fraud in Ohio. If you’re keeping score at home, so far the Ohio Democratic Party’s timeline is correct on one count. Mandel did ask DeWine to investigate both banks nine months ago, in June 2011. Yet it is that fact that contradicts the remaining half of the state party’s claim -- that Mandel did not "actually take action" until last month. The sentiment here is that Mandel allowed fraud to occur for more than a year after taking office. There is no dispute that Mandel asked for an investigation six months into his term. PolitiFact Ohio asked Mandel’s staff for more background on the process and learned an internal review began even sooner. The findings turned up enough abnormalities involving both BNY Mellon and State Street to warrant DeWine’s outside investigation, officials said. Mandel spokesman Seth Unger told PolitiFact Ohio that pension fund managers were alerted to the treasurer’s suspicions and reminded to be vigilant on matters of foreign currency exchanges. Dumping BNY Mellon and State Street on Day One would have been impossible, Unger said. Mandel wanted to be certain there were grounds for replacing them before pulling the trigger. "We really did our due diligence," Unger said. The Ohio Democratic Party’s claim -- "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign" -- collapses under scrutiny. It is incorrect and misleading to say Mandel "claimed bank fraud" against BNY Mellon and State Street when he focused his public statements solely on State Street and clearly attributed them to the investigation in California. It also is misleading to strip those statements of the full context: that Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering and cronyism. Furthermore, it is ridiculous for the Ohio Democratic Party to charge Mandel with more than a year of neglect when it acknowledges the DeWine investigation began last June. That leaves the party without a sturdy leg of truthfulness to stand on. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05890	"Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/07/kathleen-clyde/kathleen-clyde-says-ohio-among-leaders-provisional/	Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said last month that the state’s legislators should repeal House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of election laws that Republicans pushed through the General Assembly last spring. Senate Republicans began working on a new voting plan. Democrats, who had led the effort to put HB 194 on next November's ballot as a referendum, said they were prepared to introduce election legislation that would lead to more voter participation and more ballots being counted. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent said at a news conference that the Democrats' measures would reduce the number of reasons for making voters cast provisional ballots, make election officials and not voters responsible for mistakes with ballots and require provisional ballots to be counted unless there was clear evidence of wrongdoing. "Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election," she said. Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at the polling station. That could include not having the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter or a question about whether they voted absentee. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check to see if Ohio was really among the national leaders. We asked Rep. Clyde for her numbers and source. "Ohio had 204,651 provisional ballots in 2008, the last presidential election year," she responded via email. Of that total, "roughly 40,000 were not counted. Forty-thousand is indeed many." Clyde said her numbers came from the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We checked the report. It said that three states — California, New York, and Ohio — reported the highest numbers of provisional ballots cast, accounting for 59.4 percent of the nation’s total. PolitiFact Ohio found that the numbers also coincided with a report on provisional voting by the nonpartisan Pew Center on the States. We also looked at the commission’s report for the 2010 midterm election. That year, too, it said, California and Ohio were the states with the largest number of provisional ballots, accounting for almost two-thirds of all provisional ballots cast nationwide. In Ohio there were 105,015 provisional ballots cast and 11,753 -- or more than 10 percent -- were rejected. Clyde’s claim had two components. The first part was that "Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country." Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and from the Pew Center on the States backs that claim. Ohio was among the leaders for number of provisional ballots for both the 2008 and 2010 general elections. The second part of her claim was that "many of them go uncounted each election." How many is many? We think tens of thousands of ballots can be classified as "many." In 2008, nearly 40,000 provisional ballots, just under 20 percent, were rejected in Ohio. In the 2010 election, More than 11,000, slightly more than 11 percent, were rejected. Only three states rejected more ballots. Among states larger than Ohio, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania all had fewer provisional ballots and fewer rejections. On the Truth-O-Meter, Clyde’s statement rates True.

pomt-03864	The Georgia Senate ethics resolution "doesn't define cap."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/11/david-ralston/georgia-ethics-resolution-lacks-key-detail-house-s/	PolitiFact wasn’t created to make elected officials more careful about what they say in public, but we like being on their mind. Georgia House Speaker David Ralston was about to relay a statistic he was told that Georgia is the second-busiest state in terms of movie production. Then he qualified his remarks. "I haven’t checked this yet, but I’m sure PolitiFact, if they’re here, will," Ralston told the Atlanta Press Club, drawing some laughter. Don’t worry, Mr. Speaker. We’re more interested in something else you said about a piece of ethics legislation. In the past year, the Georgia Legislature has debated how it can improve its ethics guidelines to counter criticism that it is too beholden to lobbyists. On the first day of the 2013 legislative session, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a much-publicized resolution aimed at limiting gifts from lobbyists to the Senate. Ralston, though, made an interesting claim about Senate Resolution 1, which passed in January. "It doesn’t define a cap," Ralston, a Republican from Blue Ridge, said during a question-and-answer session with the audience. "I don’t know if it means $100 a day or if it’s $100 a minute." PolitiFact Georgia was in the audience, and we wondered whether the speaker was correct about whether the resolution defines a cap. Going into the current legislative session, Georgia was one of just three states that did not restrict lobbyists’ gifts to legislators. For years, lobbyists could make unlimited gifts to elected officials, provided they disclosed all spending. Lobbyists spent about $1.6 million a year, mostly on food, trips and event tickets for lawmakers, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Georgians were not happy with the rules, or lack thereof. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly voted in favor of a cap on lobbyist gifts during a nonbinding referendum July 31. Ralston has chided the Senate about its resolution, at one point famously calling it a "visor" instead of a "cap." The speaker introduced his own ethics legislation, House Bill 142, which the House passed Feb. 25. Ralston believes his legislation fits the bill of a cap. Others say break out the sun screen. The Senate is now reviewing the House bill. So back to the Senate resolution. We reviewed the resolution’s language about gifts and here’s what it says: "No senator shall accept any gift, other than those specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, with a value in excess of $100.00 from a registered lobbyist or a single gift from a group of registered lobbyists with a value in excess of $100.00." Subparagraph 3 outlined the types of items that could be accepted without regard to the $100 limit. Ralston’s spokesman, Marshall Guest, thought the claim was straightforward. We ran the speaker’s claim by Steve Anthony, who worked 14 years as chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who was Georgia’s House speaker for nearly 30 years. "He’s right," said Anthony, who teaches political science at Georgia State University. "It doesn’t give a time period." Anthony added, "I think the assumption is $100 per event." William Perry, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, has pushed state lawmakers to enact tougher ethics legislation for years. The organization’s goals include working to strengthen public participation and transparency in state and local government. He called the Senate resolution a "great first step" but acknowledged it takes a few reads to understand what it means. Like Anthony, Perry said the bill puts a $100 limit per event from lobbyists and said lobbyists and lawmakers understand the resolution’s intent. Perry is critical of the House bill, saying it allows the bigger lobbying firms to still give large sums of money by giving it to an entire county delegation -- which could be as small as two legislators -- or to the entire Georgia General Assembly. So where does this leave us? We think Ralston has a point. The resolution doesn’t clearly define how often a lobbyist can give up to $100 to a state senator. Lawmakers and lobbyists understand the resolution’s intent, others say. We rate the speaker’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Ralston	None	None	None	2013-03-11T06:00:00	2013-02-26	['None']
pomt-12471	"When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/may/05/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosas-mostly-true-claim-about-rise-school-/	Early in his campaign for California governor, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly touted his accomplishments as an education reformer. At a candidates’ forum in Sacramento in late March, Villaraigosa had this to say about his involvement with the Los Angeles Unified School District: "When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72." This wasn’t his first reference to graduation rates. Villaraigosa also cited it in his campaign press release announcing his run for governor in November 2016. It’s safe to say he'll talk a lot about this between now and the 2018 election. We wanted to know whether the district’s graduation rate really had improved that much and whether Villaraigosa was directly involved in these gains. We set out on a fact check. First, some background Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Villaraigosa was mayor of Los Angeles from July 2005 through July 2013. Soon after taking office, he made a failed bid to take control of the school district. His office did eventually, however, take over the administration of several of the district’s lowest performing schools. Now, the numbers Asked for evidence about the graduation rate numbers, Villaraigosa’s campaign spokeswoman Michelle Jeung cited two studies conducted in the mid 2000s, and detailed in news reports from the time, that found the district’s graduation rate hovering at about 44 percent. As reported by the LA Daily News in June 2006, "Just 44 percent of Los Angeles Unified students receive a high school diploma, making the 727,000-student district's graduation rate among the lowest of large urban school districts," according to a national study by the nonpartisan publication Education Week. The report relied on enrollment data from the 2002-2003 school year, according to a Los Angeles Times article. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman also cited a March 2005 Harvard University study, Confronting the Graduation Rate Crisis in California. It put the district’s graduation rate at 45.3 percent, based on enrollment data from the early 2000s. At the time, L.A. Unified officials strongly criticized the Education Week report, saying in the Daily News article that the district’s graduation rate, by that time, was "closer to 64 percent." The district’s chief instructional officer called the Education Week study "horrifically flawed" and "unfair" because of the methodology used, according to a Los Angeles Times article from the same year. They questioned the use of the data from 2002-2003 and said the school district had made graduation rate strides. District officials added that the studies did not take into account students who move during the year. "We're making real gains in this. We're keeping kids in longer, but we're also getting more accurate information," LA Unified Superintendent Roy Romer said. Graduation rate as Villaraigosa left There’s less contention over the school district’s graduation rate at the end of Villaraigosa’s time as mayor. For the 2013-2014 school year, which immediately followed Villaraigosa’s final term, the district had a 70.2 percent graduation rate, according to California Department of Education data. The following two school years, the rate increased to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent. Peter Tira, a spokesman for the state Department of Education, noted there’s been a change in how graduation rates are calculated. Before the 2009-2010 school year, the state included students who had transferred to adult schools or been sent to juvenile hall when it calculated graduation rates. Tira said it no longer includes these and other categories of students. Villaraigosa’s role There’s disagreement over just how low the school district’s graduation rates were in the early-to-mid 2000s. But there’s little doubt Villaraigosa charged head-first into education reforms as mayor. Some informed observers of Los Angeles politics and education told us the former mayor does deserve credit for improvements at the school district, though they say it wasn’t his doing alone. One of them is Ben Austin, who served as deputy mayor under former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. He said Villaraigosa endorsed and helped elect a majority of the district’s school board. "He exercised a tremendous amount of influence over the school board to the point of installing his own superintendent" through the board, added Austin, who serves on an advisory board for Students Matter, a nonprofit that promotes access to quality public education. Austin said he supported Villaraigosa in his runs for mayor. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman cited the former mayor’s creation in 2007 of the nonprofit Partnership for Los Angeles schools as one of his biggest education reforms. Through the Partnership, Villaraigosa took over 16 of the district’s worst-performing schools. Citing data released by the school district, the Partnership reported a 41 percent graduation rate increase at its schools from 2008 to 2015. During his time as mayor, Villaraigosa repeatedly clashed with the city’s teachers union over school reforms. In a statement, United Teachers Los Angeles Alex Caputo-Pearl said it was "a stretch at best" to say Villaraigosa was responsible for the district’s improved graduation rates. Dan Schnur is director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. He is a former Republican consultant. Schnur said he has no reason to dispute the graduation rate numbers cited by Villaraigosa. "The question is: Who deserves the credit for that happening? (Villaraigosa) did prioritize the issue in his campaign and in his administration," Schnur said. "The case can be made that his use of the bully pulpit (as mayor) was a contributing factor." Schnur’s wife, Cecile Ablack, served as Villaraigosa's deputy mayor for communications. Experts told us much of the credit goes to the district’s students and the school board Villaraigosa helped form. "He elected a (school board) majority of pretty bold reformers," Austin noted. Our ruling California gubernatorial candidate and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed about the Los Angeles Unified School District: "When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72." A 2006 study by the nonpartisan Education Week placed the district’s graduation rate at 44 percent, while a Harvard study the year before placed the rate at 45.3 percent. They both used enrollment data from the early 2000s. School district officials in 2006 disputed the findings, saying improvements had been made and the rate was closer to 64 percent. District data shows that rate had climbed to 70.2 percent immediately after Villaraigosa’s term ended. It rose to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent in the following two years. Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn’t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district’s worst performing schools. The dispute over the district’s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa’s statement. As is the fact that the studies used data from the early 2000s, a few years before Villaraigosa took office. But there’s certainly evidence to back up the former mayor’s claim about graduation rate improvements and his influence. In the end, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12381	"Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/are-nicaragua-and-syria-only-countries-not-sign-pa/	Just a few hours before President Donald Trump was set to announce whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz questioned the president’s reported intent to walk away from the accord. "Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?" the representative from Florida tweeted June 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s promise to "cancel" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter. News outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Wasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement "wasn’t tough enough." Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement. The Paris Agreement The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua. The UNFCCC’s ultimate goal is "preventing ‘dangerous’ human interference with the climate system," that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC’s website. Parties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking "to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change." One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19. Overall total signatories: 195. The only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua. The Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement. So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement. Wasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants. Reuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement "saying it did not do enough to protect ‘Mother Earth,’ in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted." The news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were "not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change," Reuters reported. "We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure," Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: "It’s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it’s a matter of the developing countries surviving." In September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation’s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue. "Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient," and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016. Nicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua’s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change. Amid a civil war since 2011, Syria’s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz tweeted, "Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough." A total 195 of the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change signed the Paris Agreement. That includes all the countries in the world, except Syria and Nicaragua. Nicaraguan representatives have said the Paris Agreement is "not sufficient" and believe rich nations should do more to reduce their emissions. We rate Wasserman Schultz’ claim True.

Kay Bailey Hutchison “has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.”	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/27/rick-perry/us-sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-us-sen-kay-bailey-hutc/	Gov. Rick Perry casts his leading Republican challenger, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, as a fiscally irresponsible lawmaker who’d bring a free-spending approach to state government. Amplifying that theme, Perry’s campaign said Nov. 30: “Hutchison has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.” We wondered if that was so. Perry’s camp compiled votes — undisputed by Hutchison — showing that since joining the Senate in 1993, Hutchison has voted nine times to raise the ceiling. But she’s also voted five times against raising the ceiling. Our request for an explanation of Hutchison’s votes didn’t generate an immediate reply from her. If she does pipe up, we’ll update this item. UPDATE: Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky offered a statement Jan. 28 suggesting that Hutchison's "aye" votes while George W. Bush was president reflected her support for his across-the-board tax cuts and spending initiatives including commitments to fight terrorism, provide prescription drugs to senior citizens and rebuild after 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike. Sadosky said: "She has voted against efforts to increase the debt ceiling when it is necessitated by wasteful spending like that seen in the stimulus bill and in the annual discretionary appropriations bills proposed by the Democratic-led Congress and presidency." We wondered anyway what any vote on the debt ceiling really means. Josh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which was founded by the late Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass) to advocate for long-term fiscal responsibility, advised that votes to raise the ceiling might be portrayed as big deals to score political points. In reality, they’re not, he said, though they are necessary. “If they didn’t do it, the (U.S.) Treasury would no longer be able to borrow money,” Gordon said. “Everything from savings bonds to Treasury bills to very short-term financial instruments of the Federal Reserve would cease to be worth anything. It would basically destroy the economy.” Unlike congressional votes on taxes or spending, Gordon said, lawmakers' votes to increase the debt limit aren't necessarily indicators of members' fiscal philosophies. Gordon said the fact all but two of Hutchison’s votes to raise the ceiling occurred with Republicans in charge of the Senate was probably not a coincidence. Typically in Congress, the majority party bears responsibility for attending to essential business, including hikes in the debt ceiling if necessary. When the ceiling issue comes up, members of the minority party can vote "no" knowing the other side will muster the votes to do it. Hutchison’s five “no” votes occurred when Democrats controlled the Senate. With Democrats holding the Senate majority, she voted for raising the ceiling as part of the Wall Street rescue plan approved in October 2008 and earlier voted for raising the ceiling in June 2002. Perry got all of Hutchison’s “yes” votes right. We rate his claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-01-27T06:22:32	2009-11-30	['United_States']
pomt-11748	"In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/06/doug-jones/jones-ad-wrongly-attacks-moore-sex-crime-case/	In the Alabama Senate race, Democrat Doug Jones launched an ad to suggest Republican Roy Moore goes easy on sex offenders. Moore called on stations airing the ad to pull it, saying it "blatantly misrepresents the facts and my judicial record." The ad speaks of three cases from Moore’s days on the Alabama State Supreme Court. Here’s the full text from the ad, although this fact-check focuses only on the first case from 2014. "Alabama, there's a pattern. In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion. In a 2015 case involving a man who pleaded guilty to raping an underage girl, Roy Moore dissented again. And Roy Moore was the only Supreme Court justice who sided with a felon convicted of sexual abuse of a child at a daycare center. Court documents, real facts. Roy Moore's disturbing conduct." On television, the visuals are important. Here’s what viewers saw. In one of the most reliably Republican states, Moore has been fighting headwinds after multiple reports that he made sexual advances on young women under 18 when he was in his 30s. The Jones attack ad plays to that issue. In the 2014 case, Jones misappropriated technical elements of the legal saga to leave voters with the wrong idea. The 2014 case In 2010, Sherman Fitzgerald Tate, then in his mid 30s, worked as a mentor with the Youth Advocate Program at Pointe Academy in Mobile, Ala. The court-funded program aimed to help troubled teens. A security camera recorded Tate bringing two 15-year-old girls into a conference room. He was not their assigned mentor. There was no tape of what took place inside the room. The two girls accused him of coercing them to touch him and each other sexually. Tate was convicted on two counts of second-degree sodomy. His lawyer wanted to bring in testimony that the two girls had a romantic relationship with each other and that Tate had told one of the girls’ mother about it. That information would, the lawyer said, give the girls a reason to invent a charge against Tate. But under Alabama law, victims of sexual assault are shielded from any exploration of their past sexual activity, because it could bias a jury against them. This is a fundamental principle that holds in many states. The trial judge blocked the testimony and an appeals court agreed. Tate’s lawyer brought the issue to the state supreme court. The majority of the justices, five, declined to hear the case. Moore and two other justices disagreed. In his dissent, Moore basically argued that courts in Massachusetts, Mississippi, Colorado and elsewhere had allowed similar evidence in certain cases and there was a reasonable argument that the facts in Tate’s case "would make the proposed cross-examination relevant to show that the victims had possibly fabricated the charges against Tate." The key line in Moore’s dissent, however, is the last one: "I believe that we should resolve this material question of first impression." In other words, Moore's dissent was about resolving the legal question for future cases. A matter of law We reached several experts in appellate law and all of them agreed that Moore was only arguing that the court should hear the case. "He was saying there’s a decent legal issue in the case that the court ought to resolve," David Moran at the University of Michigan Law School. "It read like a perfectly reasonable dissent, and it would be grossly unfair to attribute anything to him based on a dissent from a denial of review." Peter Smith at George Washington University Law School agreed, saying that at that point in the process, Moore was not challenging the case itself against Tate, but the legal issue of what testimony was admissible. "In theory, if the court had heard the case, he could have ruled against the guy," Smith said. Smith said Moore was telegraphing some sympathy for Tate’s position, but again, this dissent alone did not amount to disagreeing with Tate’s conviction. The other two cases The ad raises two other cases to show Moore’s "disturbing conduct." The 2015 case involved second-degree rape and like the charges against Tate, the issue was whether the sexual activity of the victim should have been presented at the trial. Moore and two other justices joined in saying the court should decide the matter. In the ad’s final example, Moore was the lone dissenter. The case involved a 17-year-old boy who performed a sexual act on a 4-year-old boy at a daycare center. The teen was convicted on two counts -- first-degree sodomy of a child under 12 and first-degree sodomy by forcible compulsion. Moore took issue with the second count, arguing that there was no evidence of an implied threat of serious physical injury or death in the case. The matter was made more complicated because the offender was under 18, which put him in a gray zone under state law. Moore argued that the court was going beyond what lawmakers had written. Our ruling An ad from the Jones campaign said that Moore disagreed and dissented in a case involving the abuse of two underage girls. There is no question that Moore dissented, but the ad provides no context for what Moore disagreed with. The glaring lack of detail leaves reasonable viewers with the impression that Moore disagreed with the conviction. That’s not what he said. He disagreed with the court’s decision not to consider a legal question of admissible evidence. Several independent law professors told us that Moore raised a valid point that was legally separate from the underlying conviction in the case. The ad leaves out critical context that gives a highly misleading impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07943	"The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-white-house-promised-sti/	In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., repeated an oft-used attack on the economic stimulus -- that the White House promised it would keep unemployment under 8 percent (and failed). "Unfortunately, the president's strategy for recovery was to spend a trillion dollars on a failed stimulus program, fueled by borrowed money," Bachmann said. "The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 percent. Not only did that plan fail to deliver, but within three months, the national jobless rate spiked to 9.4 percent. It hasn't been lower for 20 straight months. While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs." The claim that the White House "promised" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been a popular attack line, cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and other conservative pundits. And we have fact-checked it twice, first in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)" and again when columnist George Will said something similar in July 2010. On several occasions as the stimulus was being considered, President Obama warned that if "dramatic action" were not taken, the recession could linger for years, and "the unemployment rate could reach double digits." But we could find no instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of "if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent." Rather, the claim has its roots in a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. As we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. In a blog posting for the New York Times, economist Paul Krugman explained, "There’s a baseline, which is the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus, and there’s the predicted change from that baseline that is the effect of the stimulus. Clearly, the baseline was way too optimistic. But the question under discussion was how much effect relative to the baseline the stimulus was supposed to have had by now." That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010. "Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job," Obama said. "It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15." Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Bachmann's comment is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Most economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other. The White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. As Krugman said, the baseline projection turned out to be way off (most economists at the time underestimated the severity of rising unemployment). Bachmann's claim suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. So we find Bachmann's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03481	Says "Having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/13/earl-blumenauer/did-1913-revenue-act-prohibit-political-organizati/	Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., finds himself in the crosshairs of the web-o-sphere after he condemned political organizations "parading" as social welfare groups, which don’t have to disclose donors. Here’s what the congressman said at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing into allegations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups for scrutiny, including the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. We offer the relevant portion it in its entirety. "It's everybody's right to participate in politics, and well you should. But I think having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited and why I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Mr. Doggett, saying that we ought to stop this regulation interpretation from 1959 that invites people to raise vast sums of money and keep it secret and to engage in political activity -- and some of it, I think, not necessarily promoting the social welfare of our country." (our emphasis) Our question was a simple one: Was there a tax statute 100 years ago that specifically prohibited political groups from claiming tax exempt status under a social welfare provision? We checked with the Internal Revenue Service, thinking this was a pretty straightforward question. Alas, the spokesman was of no help. "I must decline to comment since an IRS opinion would appear to be a statement on the accuracy (of) what the Member of Congress said. The language of the 1913 act can be researched," wrote Richard Panick, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. So away we went. Thanks, federal government. (Not.) We learned that in 1862, President Lincoln approved a revenue-raising measure to help pay for Civil War expenses, creating the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In 1913, states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, giving Congress the ability to levy and collect income taxes. The Revenue Act of 1913, also called the Underwood Tariff Act, established what we consider the modern income tax system. Much of it dealt with lowering tariffs on goods. It included a tax exemption for organizations devoted to social welfare, the precursor to today’s Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4). (And the Form 1040 was born.) The language of Section II, G(a)states that the tax shall not apply to: "labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, or to mutual savings banks ... nor to cemetery companies, organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of their members, nor to any corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes … nor to business leagues, nor to chambers of commerce or boards of trade, not organized for profit or no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of the private stockholder or individual; nor to any civic league or organization not organized for profit, but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare:" (our emphasis) We’re truncating here, but you get the picture: Groups dedicated to civic benevolence did not have to pay federal tax, so long as private individuals did not profit. There is no mention of political activity, whether it’s prohibited or not. There is little explanation for why this exemption existed. Patrick Malone, spokesman for Rep. Blumenauer, said that the 1913 Act placed a prohibition on political organizations by not including such activity as being eligible for exemption as social welfare. "We think it is extremely accurate to say that there is a distinction between social welfare groups and political groups, since the former is included and the latter is not, and to say that there is clearly no exemption for political groups," Malone wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. But is not including the same as prohibiting? We turned to Richard Schmalbeck, a law professor at Duke University and an expert on nonprofit tax issues. He understands what Blumenauer is getting at -- groups that engage in political activity should claim tax exemption under another part of the tax code rather than hide out under "social welfare" -- but figuring out legislative intent from 100 years ago isn’t so clear-cut. "I can’t entirely endorse what he’s said, because we just don’t know," Schmalbeck said. "They didn’t bother to explain. They just didn’t have staff to do it, and it wasn’t the habit." Roberta Mann, a law professor at the University of Oregon, agreed with Schmalbeck that the law was silent on the issue, but clarified that the law implicitly prohibited political activity. "The tax-exempt rules were developed when election laws prohibited corporations (including tax-exempt corporations) from using their funds for political contributions," she wrote in an email. In any case, the Treasury Department has since tweaked the definition to say that "an organization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community." (our emphasis) Specifically, the Treasury interpreted the code so that political activity did not count as "social welfare" but also did not disqualify a group from claiming a social welfare exemption. In other words, political activity must not be the group’s primary activity. We went back to Malone. He said two things signal to him that political groups are prohibited. One, Congress meant the list to be inclusive, because they were so detailed in the organizations included. Two, had Congress meant to include other unlisted activities, they could have used the phrase "include, but are not limited to." Congress has moved in recent years toward separating political activity from social welfare activity. Political groups and parties can claim tax-exempt status under the 527 section of the tax code. Since 2000, parties and political organizations have had to register as such, and disclose donors, Schmalbeck said. Of course, there are political groups on both the right and the left that probably should be categorized as a 527 but claim 501(c)(4) status. Why? "Social welfare" groups do not have to disclose donors -- a bonus for people keen to keep their political work private. PolitiFact Oregon is impressed by the lawyerly analysis from Blumenauer’s office. However, we have two professors who say the law is silent on political activity -- even if one of them sees an implicit prohibition -- and a plain reading of the law that states no explicit ban. Blumenauer said that "the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited." There was no prohibition in the 1913 Act. The 1913 Act was silent on political activity, for whatever reasons.

pomt-11413	"California is 49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production."	true	/california/statements/2018/mar/21/gavin-newsom/true-california-ranks-49th-capita-housing-supply/	Runaway rents and out-of-reach home prices typify California’s housing landscape. To ease extreme costs, there are politicians who say they’re increasingly focused on boosting supply. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is one. At a forum on March 8, 2018 in Sacramento, Newsom said California must break down barriers to building because it ranks "49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production." We know building homes in California can be a long, expensive process. But does the state really have the second lowest per capita housing supply in the nation? We opened the door on a fact check. Our research Newsom is the frontrunner in a crowded race for California governor. His campaign spokesman told us the statement is supported by an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute: "A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025." We found the report — which Newsom cited later in his discussion at the forum — confirms the lieutenant governor’s claim. "California ranks 49th among the 50 US states for housing units per capita," the report said. "Benchmarked against other states on a housing units per capita basis, California is short about two million units. To satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025." Johnathan Woetzel, a director at the McKinsey Global Institute, said researchers used 2014 data from the U.S. Census Bureau in their analysis. He said the ranking cited by Newsom compares the ratio of people to housing units in each state. That specific ranking does not measure the pace of housing production over time, as the second part of Newsom’s statement might imply. Woetzel noted, however, that California’s pace of home building has significantly lagged behind other states. The institute is the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, a worldwide consulting firm. Its report found California had 358 housing units per 1,000 people, much lower than the U.S. average of 419 but slightly ahead of Utah’s 347. SOURCE: McKinsey Global Institute, "A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025" Not a new phenomenon California has long failed to meet its housing needs, according to the report. "Since the 1970s, the state has added 6.7 million households and 19 million people, but only 6.2 million homes. This means that over a 40-year period, the state added only 325 homes for every 1,000 additional people." Two outside experts told us the McKinsey report is credible. Carol Galante, professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley, said California’s low ranking "doesn’t surprise me." She said California’s housing production is stymied by the state’s complex regulatory system, including the land-use discretion of local governments, combined with the high fees developers must pay and then pass on to buyers. "The cost of building new housing in California is very expensive," Galante said. "New development has to pay for all of its new infrastructure. That didn’t use to be the case. In the 50s and the 60s and even through the 70s, we had a state system and a federal system that paid for the suburbs to be built through a public infrastructure." There’s also a problem on the demand side, Galante said, noting that wages aren’t keeping up with the ability to buy new homes. Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, added that Newsom’s statement "sounds accurate," and that the McKinsey report is credible. Michael cited California’s regulatory climate as the biggest factor is slowing housing production. More recent data? The McKinsey report examined figures from 2014. We couldn’t find more recent data comparing per capita housing units by state. But we did find the total number of housing units produced in California in each year from 2014 through 2016. And based on the totals, it appears California’s rank near the bottom of per capita housing supply is accurate given the relatively slow building pace, at least compared with pre-Great Recession levels. For example, California added 69,000 units in 2014; 68,000 in 2015; and 89,000 in 2016, according to the most recent data available from the California Department of Finance, all while the state’s population increased by roughly 300,000 per year. Those numbers are far less than California’s home building peak of 2005, when 205,000 units were added. "Before the housing bust, the lowest year on record was 1995, during which just shy of 75,000 units were built," notes a report from the California State Association of Counties. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed California ranks "49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production." Findings from an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, using census data from 2014, support Newsom’s statement. Two independent policy experts affirmed the report and its findings showing the wide gap between California’s housing demand and supply. There’s nothing significant missing from Newsom’s statement.

pomt-09962	"Our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/15/mark-sanford/gov-sanford-cites-bloomberg-statistic-us-has-spent/	South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has been highly critical of the Obama administration for spending too much on the economic stimulus. Recently, Sanford cited a statistic compiled by the Bloomberg news service that "our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession." It's a figure Sanford used in a commentary for Human Events , a conservative publication, and again in a letter to the editor of the State Journal-Register in Springfield, Ill. It is taken from a March 31, 2009, Bloomberg story that begins, "The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent, lent or committed $12.8 trillion, an amount that approaches the value of everything produced in the country last year, to stem the longest recession since the 1930s." At the bottom of the story is a chart breaking down how the number was derived. The lion's share — $7.7 trillion — comes from money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve for such things as credit discounts, debt purchases and bailouts of several financial institutions. Another $2 trillion relates to the FDIC, including liquidity guarantees and the purchase of risky bank assets. And lastly is the money the federal government is spending through the two stimulus packages (the $168 billion stimulus under President George W. Bush and the $787 billion stimulus under President Barack Obama), as well as the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, used to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. Economists caution that the government is not necessarily "out" all of that money. In the case of TARP money, for example, "the estimates are that we will get most of the money back," said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And in the case of collateral extended to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, "that's basically pledging to back up the operations of those organizations. We're pledging this money as collateral for that organization." It doesn't mean the money will ever be spent. And in the case of things like auto company bailouts, for example, the federal government got company stock and it's too early to know how much the government will get back on that. But presumably some. "At the end of the day, a large portion of that won't end up getting spent," Horney said. We had initially set out to fact-check Sanford for comment he made in a May 13, 2009, Fox Business Network interview when he said, "This stimulus package, this federal effort ... at some point you know we spent about 20 percent of world GDP on this thing. You look at about $13 trillion last year and it's almost like you know Soviet-era grain quotas are saying you will produce this amount of grain in Kazakhstan, never mind the realities of what is going on, on the ground." He's right that $13 trillion represents about 20 percent of the world GDP, but he left out the all-important qualifiers for the $13 trillion number, that it is money "spent, lent or committed," instead characterizing all of it as money the federal government "spent." Economists hopped all over him for that one. "If you are talking about an FDIC line of credit, there's a huge difference between that and spending X amount of dollars," Horney said. "Calling it spending is just wrong." The comment even drew rebuke from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Saying $13 trillion has been spent is definitely misleading," said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. "It's not fair to combine all that with the word 'spent.'" The actual amount spent by the federal government to slow the recession is closer to $2 trillion, he said. Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer acknowledged that Sanford left out the "spent, lent or committed" qualifiers in the Fox interview. In TV interviews, he said via e-mail, "questions come fast and furious and it's easy to leave out some words." But, he said, it'd be unfair to judge Sanford on that lone response when he had twice cited the statistic correctly, in writing. We agree, although we'll be watching carefully to make sure Sanford includes the proper caveats. Economists may disagree with this $13 trillion figure. There are many ways to calculate the amount the United States has pledged to stem the recession. But we think the Bloomberg calculation is one legitimate way. And we think it was certainly fair for Sanford to cite it, so long as he includes those all-important qualifiers. And on two occasions at least, he did. So we rate his comment True.

pomt-01241	"China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/17/xi-jinping/chinese-president-world-agrees-china-had-made-enor/	During a trip to Beijing this week, President Barack Obama announced major agreements with China, one to reduce carbon emissions and another to increase travel between the two countries. But the visit was not without controversy. During a press conference on Wednesday with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mark Landler, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, questioned China’s record on human rights and noted that some American media outlets, including his own organization, have experienced difficulty getting residency permits in China. "I’m wondering in the spirit of these reciprocal visa arrangements that you’ve agreed to this week with business people and students, isn’t it time to extend that sort of right to foreign correspondents who seek to cover your country?" Landler asked. Xi replied with a rare, unscripted response, telling foreign reporters they need to "obey China's laws and regulations." He went on to defend the country’s human rights record. "Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and especially over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights," Xi said, according to a translation provided by the White House. "That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world." When we put the Chinese leader’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter, we found that human rights organizations were not as glowing in their assessments of China’s record on this issue. "It’s very standard Chinese political rhetoric," said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch in an interview with PolitiFact. "It may be very nice that President Xi wishes his statement is true, but to suggest among other things people in China and around the world uniformly agree is ludicrous." Attempts to reach a spokesperson with the Chinese embassy were unsuccessful. Some improvements There is some good news. Experts and human rights advocates we spoke with say that improving economic conditions have indeed produced better living conditions for many Chinese citizens. As it is, when Chinese leaders claim progress in human rights, they are mostly referring to "human welfare," said Patrick Keenan, an expert in human rights and international law at the University of Illinois. "They're thinking about China's incredible economic growth and the ways that that economic growth has improved the lives of poor people in China," Keenan said. "China's growth hasn't helped everyone, of course, but it is true that poor people, on average, are better off than they were a generation ago." The reform era of the 1970s that opened China’s doors to a degree to the rest of the world resulted in a vast economic expansion, especially in the urban centers. Some social freedoms followed, such as the ability to move or take different jobs. However, such gains only accrued to certain sectors of the population. For example, according to Human Rights Watch, millions of farmers and herders who are Tibetan — an ethnic minority in China — have been subjected to a mass rehousing-and-relocation policy that forced them into socialist villages. And more generally, outside China’s rapidly growing cities, the economic gains have been less significant. There are two other notable areas of progress, each with limits. First, China has signed several international conventions and treaties pertaining to human rights. While there are clear examples of these agreements being ignored, the simple fact that China has agreed to them "is important because it creates an opportunity to make claims against the state," said Richardson of Human Rights Watch. All told, China has signed 10 of the 16 United Nations agreements pertaining to human rights. However, in most cases, China has attached a stated "reservation" that says they won’t abide by parts of the agreement that interfere with state laws. For example, while China agreed to an anti-torture convention, it added that it would not recognize a clause that allows the United Nations to investigate suspected torture, thus eliminating the enforcement mechanism. Second, Human Rights Watch notes some growth in civil society within China, such as new legal-aid services to victims of domestic violence, disabled children and other at-risk groups. These services often do not enjoy recognition from the state, though, and their leaders face imprisonment. Still, they represent seeds of change. "That degree of organization, participation and serving as a counter to the state is incredibly important," Richardson said. A long way to go Any acknowledgement that China has made gains on some issues comes with the caveat that the country is "starting off a much lower base than most," said Joshua Castellino, a law professor at Middlesex University in London and at the Irish Center for Human Rights. "Against (progress), there remain major issues on political participation, freedom of religion, and the use of the death penalty," Castellino said. On the death penalty, Human Rights Watch says China "leads the world in executions." While the exact number isn’t known, it’s estimated at about 4,000 a year. Additionally, Amnesty International estimates 500,000 people are "currently enduring punitive detention without charge or trial, and millions are unable to access the legal system to seek redress for their grievances." Many detained people are activists and political dissidents. China retains a one-party system, meaning citizens have no real choice or say in their government, and the Chinese Communist Party has authority over all judicial and legal proceedings in the country. The Internet has created opportunities for activists to engage, communicate and inform. However, China has aggressively moved to rein in these efforts through widespread censorship and blocking outside content from reaching Internet users in China. (This is known as the "Great Firewall.") Additionally, the Chinese Communist Party has recently moved to make it easier to charge activists and Internet critics as part of a crackdown on free expression. "Use of torture to extract confessions is prevalent, and miscarriages of justice are frequent due to weak courts and tight limits on the right to defense," according to Human Rights Watch. Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo is serving an 11-year sentence for non-violent protest against the state, while his wife remains under house arrest. Liu’s trial lasted 20 minutes, according to Amnesty International. These types of human rights abuses are deemed necessary by the state to preserve "social stability," Human Rights Watch says. Historically, China has used "re-education through labor" — forced labor camps — as a means of punishment. Officials have said they plan to abolish these camps, but so far it appears they have been replaced with other types of detention without trial. In addition, the disabled face discrimination in employment and education opportunities, workplace safety is a major concern, migrant workers cannot get residence permits that allow them access to education and other social services, and women can be punished, including being forced to have abortions, for violating government family planning laws. "In the U.S., Europe, and many other parts of the world, the idea of human ‘rights’ means things like freedom of religion, assembly, voting rights, anti-discrimination provisions to protect minorities and people with disabilities, and the like. On these measures, China is not doing well," Keenan said. "There is endemic local corruption, abuses of political opponents, restrictions on free expression and assembly, abuses of property rights, discrimination against people who are out of favor with the government, no real voting rights as that idea is understood in the West, and so on." Our ruling Chinese President Xi Jinping said, "China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world." There is a grain of truth here: China’s rapid economic growth has lifted millions of its residents, though hardly all of them, out of extreme poverty. Still, China remains an authoritarian state without truly free expression and democratic choice, and where political dissidents and those who practice civil disobedience face harsh penalties. Meanwhile, China executes thousands of people a year and imprisons or forces labor on hundreds of thousands of others with scant due process. Finally, many groups — ethnic minorities, the disabled, and migrant workers, to name a few — remain marginalized by the state. It’s tough to claim "all the people in the world" recognize China has made "enormous gains" in human rights when groups that monitor human rights and other outside observers continue to find problems with China’s record.

pomt-13121	Says Chris Koster "opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken $8 million from ‘union bosses.’"	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/03/eric-greitens/greitens-connects-unrelated-facts-koster-right-wor/	Missouri is the scene of the most expensive governor’s race in the nation. On Sept. 30, Democrat Chris Koster and Republican Eric Greitens faced off in a debate in Branson. Greitens challenged Koster on several of his policies and political history, claiming that Koster is a "career politician" who opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken "$8 million from union bosses." This number seemed high, so we decided to check out the claim. We also wondered if Koster, as Greitens said, opposed right-to-work efforts because of union campaign donations. Following the money The Greitens campaign directed us to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s "Money Trail" page. According to this page, as of Oct. 30, Koster had received $12.2 million from what the Chamber says falls under the "unions" category. Koster's top three union contributors each gave his campaign more than $1 million. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a public services employees union, was Koster's top contributor, topping out at $1,250,000. AFSCME was followed closely by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' Educational & Benevolent Fund at $1,091,739 and Jobs and Opportunity, a democratic leadership PAC, coming in at $1,001,432. By far, Koster has received more contributions from unions over all other candidates running for any Missouri offices this year. The next highest total of union donations for any Missouri candidate is Democratic candidate for attorney general Teresa Hensley, with $692,849.00. Greitens doesn't even appear on the union donations list. On right-to-work Greitens also claimed Koster opposes right-to-work legislation. Right-to-work has been a hot-button topic for Missouri. Right-to-work laws essentially make it illegal to require employees to pay annual dues to a union. The decision to pass right-to-work laws are made on a state-by-state basis. So far, 26 states have passed right-to-work legislation. Missouri's Republican-majority legislature has passed right-to-work laws in the past, only to see them vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, who leaves office in January. Greitens supports right-to-work legislation. His website states, "I believe we must have 'right-to-work' legislation to improve Missouri’s job climate." Opposing right-to-work legislation is an important part of Koster's campaign. Koster and other Democrats have used the term "right-to-work for less" to support their argument that a right-to-work law in Missouri would lead to lower pay for workers due to weakened collective bargaining efforts — efforts they say are made possible by those required fees. On the other hand, it's Greitens' belief that "right to work laws help the economy as a whole and union workers." The Greitens campaign directed us toward some statistics from the Labor Bureau of Statistics and pointed us specifically to Indiana. According to our email correspondence with the Greitens campaign, "Since Indiana passed Right to Work, it has gained 37,000 union jobs, while Missouri gained only 6,000." Taking a look at this information alone would suggest a correlation between right-to-work and increased union employment. As of 2015, 10 percent of Indiana's employed workers were members of unions, and 11.3 percent of workers were represented by unions. In Missouri, those numbers were 8.8 percent and 9.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, statistics for the median income growth from 2014-2015 comparing Missouri versus right-to-work states suggests support for Koster’s claim that right-to-work laws lead to lower salaries. According to the U.S. Census, growth in Missouri was 3.8 percent, while the average growth in right-to-work states was 3.2 percent. Because jobless rates vary so much from state to state, the role of right-to-work legislation in these numbers is difficult to assess. So Koster has received millions of dollars from unions, and he opposes right-to-work legislation. But Greitens' claim goes further and claims that Koster opposes that legislation because of the union donations. So is there any evidence that the donations affected Koster’s position on right-to-work? When we reached out to the Koster campaign, we received this response from David Turner, his campaign's communications director: "I reject the premise of the question and the assertion that the Attorney General's policy positions are at all influenced by campaign donations. Going back to the start of his career, Attorney General Koster has long record of advocating for working people, even when he was a Republican." Turner provided us with examples of Koster's advocacy "for working people" dating back to 2004. Included was a link to a Springfield News-Leader story published after Koster broke with the GOP and became a Democrat. The story states: "The Republican Party's disregard of workers rights, Koster said, is one reason he left the party." Our ruling Greitens said Koster received $8 million from unions and opposes right-to-work legislation. There is no doubt Koster opposes right-to-work laws. And Greitens actually understates the total amount of Koster’s labor donations. He has received more than $12 million from unions, according to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. But there is no evidence his position against right-to-work is influenced by these donations. Greitens is taking two accurate talking points and putting them together in a misleading way. We rate this claim to be Half True.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2016-11-03T12:21:01	2016-09-30	['None']
pomt-11566	"Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase."	false	/california/statements/2018/feb/05/phil-ting/false-claim-gop-tax-plan-nothing-more-middle-class/	Like many California Democrats, Assemblyman Phil Ting is no fan of the Republican tax plan signed by President Donald Trump. He has likened it to a tax giveaway for big corporations. The San Francisco lawmaker has proposed a surcharge on large companies in California, to claw back some of the billions of tax dollars that would be lost to the state under the plan. Such a bill, Ting said, would "help blunt the impact of the federal tax plan on everyday Californians." We wondered, however, whether Ting accurately described the GOP tax plan in the statement he provided to the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 21, 2018. "Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase," Ting, who formerly served as San Francisco's Assessor-Recorder, said in the statement. "It is unconscionable to force working families to pay the price for tax breaks and loopholes benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals." We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the first part of Ting’s claim that the tax plan "was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase." His words could be considered a burst of political rhetoric, but they also make an assertion about how millions of Americans would be impacted by the GOP plan. Our research We spoke with experts at the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative-leaning Tax Foundation to assess Ting’s claim. Both said it was off the mark. "What we found is most taxpayers would be getting a tax cut," Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us. That includes most middle-income taxpayers, at least in the short-run, he said. The Tax Policy Center center estimates 91 percent of those who earn between $50,000 and $85,000 would receive a tax cut averaging about $900 in 2018, Sammartino said. Seven percent in this group would see their taxes go up, he said, while the rest would see their taxes remain the same. Additionally, 93 percent of Americans who earn between $85,000 and $150,000 would experience a tax cut in 2018, an amount averaging $1,800. "We’re just not seeing that in the data," Sammartino said of Ting’s statement that the plan results in "nothing more" than middle class tax increase. "We’re not seeing that it’s a tax increase for most people." "A fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class" Scott Greenberg is a senior analyst at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. He described the GOP tax plan as "a fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class in the short term. And in the long-term, after many of the provisions in the bill expire (at the end of 2025), the net effect of the tax bill on middle income households will be more or less zero." The Tax Foundation concluded it will amount to tax cut of about 1.7 percent of one’s after-tax income, on average, for the middle quintile of taxpayers, Greenberg said. Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center found it will amount to nearly the same amount, a tax cut of about 1.6 percent of one’s after-tax income for middle income earners. Greenberg said the plan accomplishes this by lowering rates for several tax brackets, expanding the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Assemblyman Phil Ting / Capital Public Radio file photo Response from Ting When asked about the statement, Ting’s spokeswoman Jessica Duong pointed to news articles that show some in the middle class will see higher taxes under the GOP bill. She did not counter the estimate that most would see a tax cut. "The quote was intended to counter Trump’s claim that "this is going to be one of the great gifts to the middle income people of this country that they’ve ever gotten for Christmas" – it is being sold as a middle-class tax cut but the benefits for such families will expire in 2025 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent," the spokeswoman told us in an email. "Assemblymember Ting’s use of "nothing more" is intended to counter that misleading billing and highlight the fact that the plan currently and purposefully relies on the middle class paying for future tax cut deficits," she added. "Little if anything" We also examined the California Budget and Policy Center’s assessment of the tax plan. The group, considered more liberal leaning, painted a dire picture of the plan’s impact on most taxpayers. It warned in a recent post the plan "would do little if anything for middle- and low-income families across the nation, and especially in California." By scaling back the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT deduction, the plan would "harm many middle-income families." It added that the plan is "clearly tilted to wealthy households and major corporations, while providing very little if any benefit for most middle- and low-income families." National tax experts don’t dispute the wealthy would see larger tax cuts. The top one percent of households by income, for example, would see a tax cut of 3.4 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s about twice the rate of savings compared with middle class households. The plan cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. California hardships? In California, which has high state and local taxes, the GOP plan is expected to create more financial hardships compared with lower-tax states because it caps state and local income tax deductions. Here’s how Forbes.com explained the changes: "Under the old tax law all property taxes paid to state and local governments could be claimed as an itemized deduction. It was also possible to deduct state and local income or sales taxes. The new law bundles all these so-called "SALT" taxes together and limits the deduction, in total, to $10,000 for both individuals and married couples." "For some homeowners in high-tax areas such as California, $10,000 does not come close to covering their combined property and income tax bills." There’s also a change that affects mortgage interest deductions for homeowners. Under the previous law, homeowners could write off any interest they pay on mortgages up to $1 million. The new law will limit these deductions to mortgages of $750,000 or less. Given the Golden State’s high housing costs, some Californians will be impacted by the new cap. The change, however, impacts new mortgages, not existing ones. Sammartino of the Tax Policy Center told us those factors will would hurt some Californians. Even so, he said, the vast majority of middle class taxpayers in the state will still see a tax cut. "The overall tax cuts might be a little bit less," Sammartino said. "But in general, probably upwards of 85 percent of the middle class or so should see a tax cut in California," for 2018. What happens when the tax cuts expire? While the plan’s corporate tax cuts are permanent, the individual reductions are temporary. The national PolitiFact took a closer look at who would be paying more once the individual tax cuts expire. It found all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. Some of those are middle-class households. "Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027," according to the PolitiFact analysis. "That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average." Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting recently claimed the GOP tax plan is "nothing more than a middle class tax increase." That doesn’t match up with estimates from the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative leaning Tax Foundation. They project the plan will result in a tax cut for about 90 percent of middle-income households nationwide in 2018. Those cuts would range from about $900 to $1,800. The remaining middle-income households would see their taxes stay the same or go up. The California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal leaning group, warns the plan will provide little if any help to middle- and low-income earners in high-tax California, given new limits placed on state and local tax deductions. But even with those new caps, plus a change to the mortgage interest deduction, national tax experts told us the vast majority of middle-class Californians -- up to 85 percent -- will still experience a tax cut in the plan’s first year. That could change by 2027 after the individual tax cuts expire, when households who make $75,000 or less are expected to see a tax hike. Congress could extend those cuts, though nothing is guaranteed. There might have been some truth to Ting’s statement had he said the plan was "nothing more than a middle class tax increase" — by 2027, after the cuts expire. But his statement ignores the fact that the vast majority in America’s, and California’s, middle class are expected to get a tax break between now and then. We rate Ting’s claim False.

pomt-14469	Says "Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-wrongly-says-senate-democratic-leader-har/	In an urgent quest to keep his presidential hopes alive, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attacked GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from several directions in the run-up to Super Tuesday primary balloting. ABC News This Week host George Stephanopoulos prodded Cruz about his charge that Trump has forsaken conservative principles by expressing a willingness to work with congressional Democrats. "You've been making that point about Donald Trump supporting Democrats for several weeks right now," Stephanopoulos asked Cruz on Feb. 28. "It doesn't seem to be sticking. Why not?" Cruz responded that he’s seen positive movement in the polls during that time, and he charged that Trump would be too quick to compromise on such issues as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Supreme Court nominations and religious liberty. Then he added, "There's a reason (Senate Democratic Leader) Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals. We've had too many deals in Washington." We wondered: Did Reid, one of the fiercest Democratic partisans in Congress, really give his blessing to Trump? The short answer is that he did, but only jokingly. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. On Jan. 27 — one day after Trump said he got along well with Reid and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC’s Morning Joe — Reid told reporters at an impromptu media availability, "Look, we've gotten along fine," referring to Trump. "With that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for him," Reid said. Reid also said, "Oh, I remember the good old days when he did a fundraiser or two for me." Apparently realizing that his words could be misconstrued, Reid took to the Senate floor in short order, seeking to clarify that he had only been joking about "pulling for" Trump in the presidential race. "There are some things I shouldn’t joke about," Reid said on the floor. "I tried to be funny an hour ago at my weekly stakeout and I guess it wasn’t very funny, at least I don’t think so. The danger Donald Trump’s candidacy poses to our country is not a joke. Since he launched his bid for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a hateful demagogue who would do immeasurable damage to our country if elected. I have come to the Senate floor many times to decry his hateful comments. Donald Trump threatens to diminish the integrity of our democracy around the whole world. If he wins the nomination of the Republican Party to run for president of the United States, the Republican Party will never recover from the damage he will inflict on conservatism." This public clarification of Reid’s position isn’t something that Cruz reflected when he made his comments on This Week. (We viewed the video of Cruz’s remarks here and conclude that he seems to be making a serious point about what Reid said, not saying it in a tongue-in-cheek manner.) Cruz also glossed over the fact that Reid said he is "pulling for him," which is not exactly the same as Reid saying Trump is the Republican he "likes best." And Cruz amplified these inaccuracies by saying that the reason for Reid’s seeming warmth to Trump was that Reid felt he could cut deals with him. None of the news accounts we found said that Reid cited a willingness to strike deals as the reason for his purported support of Trump. Deal-making was brought up by Trump, not by Reid. When we checked with Reid’s office, spokesman Adam Jentleson reiterated that the comments Cruz cited on This Week were just a joke. Reid, Jentleson said, "has repeatedly denounced Trump for stoking the fires of racism and resentment and spoken out repeatedly on the floor, including before he said the quote" that Cruz referenced. Indeed, there is ample evidence from both before and after Reid’s comments that the Democratic leader is strongly opposed to Trump’s candidacy. For instance, during a Dec. 8, 2015, floor speech, Reid said, "Donald Trump is standing on the platform of hate," and on Jan. 20, 2016, Reid tweeted that by advancing a bill on refugees, the GOP "is catering to (the) hateful agenda of Donald Trump." Reid added in that tweet that Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim travel to the United States is "reprehensible." Then, in late February, Reid tweeted that "Republicans should think about this: If they follow (Senate Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell's lead, they'll be as responsible as Trump/Cruz for debasement of their Party." When we contacted Cruz’s campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said, "I'll leave it to Sen. Reid to speak the sincerity of his comment, but the takeaway still stands — the Washington establishment recognizes Trump will cut deals with them to further their agenda. That is the very thing Americans are fed up with." Our ruling Cruz said, "Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals." Reid did tell reporters that "with that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for" Trump, but he quickly went to the Senate floor to clarify that he had been joking. Indeed, Reid has spoken out forcefully and repeatedly against Trump’s candidacy, both before and after the comments Cruz referenced. And importantly, Reid said nothing about Trump’s willingness to cut deals. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

Ford, a California professor, went public with her accusations against Kavanaugh earlier this week, saying he sexually assaulted her at a party while the two were in high school in the early 1980s. "I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation," Kavanaugh said in a statement. "I did not do this back in high school or at any time." YourNewsWire.com points to Ralph Blasey’s time at the law firm BakerHostetler from 1989 to 2004 as evidence that Ford is somehow linked to the Russia investigation. The blog post was cited in a news release from the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel as a "disturbing fact" that "undermine(s) her story." "Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation," the release states, linking to YourNewsWire.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This theory that somehow Ford is linked to the Russia investigation through her brother’s old job comes from the fact that in 2013, nine years after Blasey left BakerHostetler, the firm hired Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, to assist with a Russian money-laundering investigation. In 2015, Fusion GPS subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer to produce the Russian dossier. Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers said she had "been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats." They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford’s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online. Our ruling Ford’s brother, Ralph Blasey, worked for a law firm that worked with Fusion GPS nine years after he left the company. Fusion GPS’s work on the Russian dossier began more than a decade after Blasey left BakerHostetler. While it’s accurate to say Blasey worked for BakerHostetler — he says that clearly on his LinkedIn — it is ridiculously wrong to somehow link her brother’s past employment to Fusion GPS’s work in investigating Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.

pomt-12497	"Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/28/blog-posting/reports-trump-offered-asylum-russian-jehovahs-witn/	Fake Internet posts said President Donald Trump offered to give refuge to Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses after that country banned followers of the religion, but there is no record he made any such comments. "Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.," reads the headline on an undated story on States-TV.com. The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, HoustonChronicle-TV.com and Fox-News24.com. Facebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds. The post is keyed to a real event: Russia’s Supreme Court banned the religious organization on April 20, labeling the group as a danger for "extremist activities." The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned. From there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move "is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation." "I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you," Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah’s Witness could find freedom in this country. "As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated," he said, according to the post. The problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn’t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all. We reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn’t receive a response. State Department spokesman Mark Toner did release a statement on April 20 saying that the United States was "extremely concerned by the Russian government's actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah's Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism." Toner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society. "All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation's constitution," he said. But there’s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn’t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country’s 175,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses being harassed by Russian police since the ruling. Fox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper’s name but doesn’t look to have affiliation. All three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites. But even though this story appears to be bogus, it’s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles. Fox-News24.com, for example, features one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying she wouldn’t mind shutting down the Education Department. It’s copied practically word-for-word from a Feb. 17 story from U.S. News & World Report. Fox-News24.com administrators have hidden the registration of the website, which was only registered on March 20. There is no contact information available. The same goes for the other two websites we’ve noted. The story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah’s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America. The State Department did decry Russia’s ruling, but there’s no evidence Trump weighed in. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-08310	Says four Democratic state senators voted to "raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/30/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/group-says-four-wisconsin-senators-voted-raise-tax/	Before the federal law derided by critics as "ObamaCare" overshadowed earlier attempts at health care reform, a proposal for universal health care in Wisconsin gained national attention. "Perhaps the boldest move on health care reform ever in a state," declared the Progressive States Network, a left-leaning public policy organization, after the state Senate approved "Healthy Wisconsin" in 2007. "Wow, is ‘free’ health care expensive," countered a Wall Street Journal editorial headlined "Cheese Headcases." "Healthy Wisconsin" did not become law, but it has returned to the spotlight in the 2010 elections for the state Senate in TV ads produced by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. The state’s largest business group is targeting four Democratic senators in key districts: Jim Sullivan of Wauwatosa, John Lehman of Racine, Pat Kreitlow of Chippewa Falls and Robert Jauch of Poplar. The ads vary a bit, sometimes doubling up the targets, but all follow the same theme. "Do you refuse to get a job? Looking for a free ride?" a narrator asks in one of the ads. "Well, Jim Sullivan says, Come to Wisconsin. No job? No problem! Don’t pay taxes? Don’t worry about it!" Then comes the punch line: "Jim Sullivan’s been working hard to raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care." Whoa. For some workers, that’s a car payment or two worth of higher taxes every month. And "freeloaders" is, well, a pretty loaded word. So, let’s see what Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is talking about. The ads cite votes by the four Democrats for Senate Bill 40, which was the Senate version of the 2007-’09 state budget and included "Healthy Wisconsin." The proposal would have provided health coverage to nearly all state residents. Senate Bill 40 died after being approved by the Senate. It faced opposition from Assembly Republicans and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who said at the time he had to live in the "real world" of ideas that could become law. Let’s examine the two parts of the major claim in the ads: The Senate Democrat’s plan would have raised "taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month ..." The proposal was to be funded through a payroll tax. The average monthly cost would have been $370 for employers and $140 for employees, or a total of $510, according to the Senate Democrats’ summary of the plan. When asked why the ads claim the full tax would have been picked up by workers, WMC policy analyst R.J. Pirlot told PolitiFact Wisconsin: "It ultimately comes out of the worker’s pocket." That’s one view of it. But clearly $510 per month would not have been deducted from paychecks, as the ads suggest. Now the second part. " ... so freeloaders can get free state-run health care." "Freeloaders" means people who don’t work, said WMC spokesman Jim Pugh. Indeed, WMC’s ad against Jauch -- unlike the ones against Sullivan, Lehman and Kreitlow -- is explicit on that point. That ad says "Healthy Wisconsin" was "like ObamaCare, only worse. It would cost us $510 a month, but it’s free for people who move here and refuse to work." Is that right? Only to a point. "Healthy Wisconsin" would have covered state residents and out-of-state residents working in Wisconsin, except those already covered by plans such as Medicare, Medicaid and BadgerCare, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Unemployed people would have been eligible for health care under the proposal. So would new unemployed residents, after living in Wisconsin for one year -- although that waiting period would have been waived for pregnant women. Let’s punch the clock on this item. With a focus on key state Senate seats, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is airing ads against four Democrats for their votes on a failed universal health care plan. Citing a $510 a month cost, the ads overstate how much the plan would have raised payroll taxes on workers. As for the second half of the charge -- that "freeloaders" would get free care -- unemployed Wisconsin residents would have qualified, as long as they’d been state residents for at least a year. We rate the claim as Half True.	None	Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce	None	None	None	2010-10-30T09:01:00	2010-10-29	['Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01768	"97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/29/facebook-posts/are-97-nations-100-poorest-counties-red-states/	A meme circulating on Twitter and other social media recently caught our eye. Created by the liberal group Occupy Democrats, it said, "97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states. But tell me again how Republican policies grow the economy?" This was a variation on a few memes we’ve checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True). While the meme’s suggestion that "Republican policies" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that "97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states." First, we’ll explain our methodology. To determine the nation’s 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty. As for determining whether a state is "red" or "blue," we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.) So how did the data turn out? For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states: 1. Owsley County, Ky. 2. Jefferson County, Miss. 3. Wolfe County, Ky. 4. Brooks County, Texas 5. McCreary County, Ky. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Hancock County, Tenn. 8. Jackson County, Ky. 9. Clay County, Ky. 10. Holmes County, Miss. For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states. Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states: 1. Shannon County, S.D. 2. Clay County, Ga. 3. East Carroll Parish, La. 4. Sioux County, N.D. 5. Todd County, S.D. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Holmes County, Miss. 8. Corson County, S.D. 9. Wolfe County, Ky. 10. Humphreys County, Miss. So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don’t have much to quibble with. Our bigger question concerns whether it’s significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There’s reason for at least a bit of skepticism. For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas. Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states. It’s also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That’s a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices. In Appalachia, "it’s clear there’s a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education," said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. Finally, there’s an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties. Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120. This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed. Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14. Our ruling The meme said that "97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states." According to the most recent data, that’s a few percentage points high, but not by much. However, measuring a county’s lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme’s political message. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06339	"The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn’t ballast water."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/09/steve-latourette/ballast-water-no-longer-key-invasive-species-great/	For the past several months, GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette has been weighted down in a congressional dispute over ballast water on the Great Lakes. Invasive species, like zebra mussels, round gobies and bloody red shrimp, have hitchhiked in ballast water that ships take on for stability in one body of water, and discharge elsewhere. The stowaways crowd out native species, cause structural damage, and spread disease. Everyone wants to crack down on invasive species, but LaTourette says the state of New York has gone too far by imposing new ballast water regulations on shippers that are so strict they can’t be met by current technology. "The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn’t ballast water," LaTourette said. He said he has talked with many people about the issue, including longshoremen, Canadian officials and others on the St. Lawrence Seaway, and noted that the U.S., Canadian and state governments have worked hard to improve ballast water treatment practices. At the moment, he said the Asian Carp is the lakes’ biggest invasive species threat. An electric barrier has been built to keep them from spreading into the lakes from the Mississippi River system. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out LaTourette’s claim. LaTourette, from Bainbridge Township in Northeast Ohio, and other foes of the new rules argue the scheduled imposition of the New York regulations in 2013 will effectively shut down the St. Lawrence Seaway, which allows ships from the Atlantic Ocean to reach the Great Lakes, costing thousands of shipping jobs. This summer, LaTourette tried to pressure New York to change its rules by securing language in a spending bill that would block the state from getting any Environmental Protection Agency money until its ballast water policy is altered. He and GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs, a fellow Ohioan from Holmes County, also co-sponsored a measure, which is now part of a Coast Guard funding bill, that would set a nationwide ballast water policy instead of letting states do it themselves. "Vessels involved in interstate and foreign commerce are mobile and cannot be expected to comply with potentially scores of inconsistent state requirements as they navigate from one jurisdiction to the next," Gibbs argued on the House of Representatives floor. "These inconsistent state requirements will impose serious economic burdens on interstate and foreign commerce." Not everyone shares the views of LaTourette and Gibbs. Several legislators stuck up for New York, arguing that states should be permitted to establish more stringent standards in their own waters. The amendments they suggested were defeated when the House voted. PolitiFact Ohio checked with LaTourette’s staff about his claim. They referred us to a study produced by the Canadian government’s fisheries and oceans division, which says that since current ballast water regulations were introduced in 2006, "no new invasive species attributed to ballast water release and transoceanic shipping in general have been recorded in the Great Lakes." Because invasive plants and animals from foreign freshwater ports are most likely to thrive in the Great Lakes, ships that from abroad that travel to the Great Lakes must exchange fresh water in their ballast tanks with salt water while they are still in the ocean. That kills off any freshwater species that sneak into the ballast tanks. Marine organisms that enter the ballast tanks in the ocean don’t survive when they’re released into the Great Lakes’ fresh water. Canadian regulations also require ships to rinse out their empty ballast tanks with salt water in the middle of the ocean to kill any lingering freshwater organisms. Jordan Lubetkin, a spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation, is fighting LaTourette’s efforts to relax New York’s ballast water rules, contending the bill is a sop to the shipping industry that would leave the Great Lakes vulnerable to future invasions. But he does not dispute the study’s findings. While progress has been made to prevent ballast water from spreading invasive species between water bodies, Lubetkin says more should be done. He noted that more than 65 percent of the aquatic invasive species which got into the Great Lakes since the St. Lawrence Seaway’s 1959 opening arrived in ballast water. "One must only look at how one single invader—the zebra mussel—entered the Great Lakes through ballast water and disrupted the Lakes from top to bottom to understand that we need a zero tolerance policy toward new invaders," Lubetkin said. "The people, communities and businesses that have picked up the tab for the biological pollution dumped into the Great Lakes deserve a solution that offers the strongest water quality protections to protect our Lakes, jobs, health and quality of life." Although invasive species are a serious problem in the Great Lakes, LaTourette does have research to back his assertion that they haven’t been spreading through ballast water. On the Truth-O-Meter, LaTourette’s claim rates True.	None	Steve LaTourette	None	None	None	2011-11-09T06:00:00	2011-11-04	['None']
pomt-03985	Says, "Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/11/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-domestic-abuse-against-women-has/	Violence - or the potential for violence - is everywhere. It’s the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses. It’s the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence. The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldn’t reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.) Now it’s back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have been talking about the law’s benefits. Here’s what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: "Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent." That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate it’s something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate. But is it true? First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden. It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence. When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking. Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence. Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance. According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference. Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent. Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds. It’s also unambiguous. "From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000," the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012. The report notes that over that same period "4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female." A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion. "The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent," between 1994 and 2010. The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law "has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking." Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings. That’s a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results don’t perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkley’s statement. We rate this claim: True.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2013-02-11T16:06:42	2013-02-07	['None']

pomt-12701	"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/12/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-medicaid-costs/	A hot-button topic in Missouri this year has been the state budget, a large part of which goes to social services, primarily Medicaid. With more budget cuts looming, funding these services may be hard to maintain. That’s what state Sen. Caleb Rowden suggested in mid-January before Gov. Eric Greitens unveiled his proposed state budget. At a legislative breakfast Jan. 20, Rowden said, "This would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget." Rowden then said maintaining this current level of spending for social services is not an option given the revenue shortfalls officials expect. Ten billion dollars is a massive amount of money, and the figure piqued our interest. We wanted to know if this level of Medicaid spending could be correct. Where does the state gets its money for Medicaid? Before diving deeper into Rowden’s claim, it’s important to get some background on the Medicaid program. Medicaid is designed to provide health coverage for lower-income families, people with disabilities, senior citizens, pregnant women and newborns, blind and visually impaired, uninsured women, families, kids, and women with breast or cervical cancer. As of November 2016, 69 million people nationwide were covered through Medicaid. Missouri disperses Medicaid to participating residents through its MO HealthNet program under the Department of Social Services. A document by the Missouri Budget Project explains how Missouri funds Medicaid. The majority of funding for Medicaid — 83 percent — comes from the federal government through two programs. One program called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, matches federal government dollars to state dollars spent on health care services based on a percentage rate. Missouri's FMAP rate for fiscal year 2018 is 63.21 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. This means that for every dollar Missouri spends on health care — not just Medicaid — the federal government gives $1.72. Of the total money Missouri receives from the FMAP program, only a certain amount goes to Medicaid. The rest goes toward other health care services the state provides. Fifty-one percent of Missouri's Medicaid spending is funded through FMAP. The other program — Federal Reimbursement Allowance — along with other capital reserves, covers another 32 percent of Missouri’s spending on Medicaid. Missouri has been participating in this program for 25 years. So this leaves Missouri picking up only 17 percent of its own Medicaid bill. This money comes from collected state revenue. Dan Haug, acting budget director for the state, told us in a phone call that he expects Medicaid to cost the state $10.21 billion in the coming fiscal year. This would make Rowden’s statement true, but we wanted to check the budget to see where all the Medicaid money went. Figuring out Medicaid Finding Medicaid spending in the state budget is complicated. The bulk of Medicaid spending falls under the Department of Social Services. In the last fiscal year, the state approved $9.2 billion for the DSS, $7.7 billion of which went toward Medicaid. At first glance, this seems like this is the total budget for Medicaid in the state. There are really no other places in the budget where Medicaid is clearly defined as an expense. So Rowden’s claim about the Medicaid budget is false, right? Not so fast. In fact, Medicaid money is spent by more agencies than just the DSS. It is used for other services spread throughout the state budget, most notably in the Department of Mental Health. Traci Gleason, the director of communications and public engagement at the Missouri Budget Project, confirmed that nearly 20 percent, or $2 billion, of the Medicaid budget goes toward mental health services, driving the total budget of Medicaid closer to that $10 billion figure. Where does the rest of Medicaid spending go? Even an expert such as Gleason said that’s very tricky to determine. Part of the reason for this is because portions of the Medicaid budget are listed as MO HealthNet, which is the health care system Missouri switched to in 2007. Through the MO HealthNet name, a series of supplemental appropriations sections are added at the bottom of the state budget document. Some of the services funded through supplemental appropriations, such as pharmacies, physicians and premium services, fall under the Medicaid budget. When you add all the supplemental appropriations together for services that fall under Medicaid, it comes out to $10,023,904,918. While this falls short of Haug’s estimate, it does make Rowden’s statement about the Medicaid budget correct. "It’s really hard to drill down (the Medicaid spending) because it’s spread over all sorts of different departments and programs," Gleason said. "Overall, though, Sen. Rowden is correct with his totals." Nevertheless, because the state is responsible for funding only 17 percent of the total on Medicaid, the total amount Missouri will spend is $1.7 billion from state revenue. Our ruling Rowden was trying to illustrate that Medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels. According to Greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018, the budget for Medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget. Despite the growing concern from Republicans on the cost of Medicaid spending, Greitens has recommended $10.7 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018, an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017. However, it’s important to note that "we" — as in the state of Missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion. Because of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and the Federal Reimbursement Allowance programs, the state only has to spend approximately $1.7 billion of state revenue on Medicaid. So while Medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget, not all of the money is coming directly from the state. Rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification.

pomt-07280	"Unions don’t have to comply with Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/23/crossroads-gps/unions-dont-have-comply-obamacare-says-crossroads-/	An ad from the Republican controlled campaign group Crossroads GPS asserts that unions are exempt from the new health care law as a political favor from President Barack Obama. The ad shows union leaders and Obama speaking in favor of health care reform, then shows a Fox News anchor asking, "Is the Obama administration exempting some from complying with the new health care law as a political favor?" Video shows Obama at a political rally, shouting, "Because we fought together, we had worked together, they walked doors (door-to-door) for me, they made phone calls for me, they turned out the vote for me." Text on the screen then says, "Over 185 union waivers. All exempt from Obamacare mandate. If unions don’t have to comply with Obamacare, why should we?" We spent a good bit of time looking into this claim, because it’s based on some very wonky details of the new health care law, things like annual benefit limits, phase-ins to 2014 and rules advertised in the Federal Register. We’re going to explain all those details momentarily, but we’ll start by giving you the bottom line: Unions do have to obey the mandates of the health care law like any other organization. And if there’s concrete evidence that they’re getting special treatment, we didn’t find it. For simplicity’s sake, we’re going to start at the very beginning, before the passage of the health care law. Insurance limits and the new law Prior to passage of the health care law, insurance companies could place limits on what they would be willing to pay for a person’s health care per year. A typical annual limit for someone with pretty good insurance might be $1 million, but it could be lower, sometimes much lower. If you were never sick, you might not be aware that the limit existed. But it would be a different story if you were sick, particularly if you suffered from something that was expensive to treat, like cancer. One in 10 cancer patients, for example, exhaust benefit limits and have to find more insurance or pay for treatment themselves, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Low-wage workers were particularly vulnerable to plans with low annual limits. In some cases, annual payouts would be as low as $2,000. Those types of plans are often called "mini-meds," and consumer advocates say they’re almost always a bad deal. The health care law phases out annual benefit limits so that people wouldn’t be caught without coverage, according to the HHS. The phase-out started this year, with new rules saying that all insurance plans must offer at least $750,000 in payouts per year. The number goes up every year so that by 2014 no caps at all will be allowed. Last year, though, companies started complaining, saying that if they had to meet the new requirements, they would either have to increase premiums paid by their employees or end coverage altogether. The Obama administration didn’t want that to happen, so they started granting waivers to the new rule. The waivers would be granted to health plans annually until 2014, according to the HHS, when people will be able to buy standard health insurance policies using new state-based "exchanges." That same year, low-wage workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them buy insurance. "It is essential that we make sure that Americans who have insurance today – even if that insurance is highly limited – can keep that coverage until reforms take effect that will increase their ability to choose among comprehensive, affordable insurance options in 2014," said Steven Larsen, who oversees the waiver process, in testimony before Congress in March. So far, employers like McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cracker Barrel and O’Reilly Auto Parts have successfully applied for waivers for their health plans. Other approved applicants include Sunview Vineyards of California, Securitas Security Services USA, Mesa Air Group and Dish Network. (See all the approved applications here.) There are also several union health plans, which are the basis for the claims in the Crossroads ad. We contacted the HHS and asked for the number of waivers they’ve granted so far. A spokeswoman told us that they have approved 1,372 applications and denied 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. To be clear, though, the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law. They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits until 2014. We should note that some Republicans are firm in their opposition to the waivers. Two congressional hearings have been held on why waivers are being offered and if the process is transparent. A law firm for Crossroads GPS has filed a federal lawsuit against HHS, claiming that the agency has not responded quickly enough to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for information about how the waivers are being awarded. The lawsuit says it's seeking "the criteria to be applied by HHS in deciding whether to grant or deny applications for waiver of the annual limit requirements." On its website, though, HHS said it approves waivers if "a premium increase is large or if a significant number of enrollees would lose access to their current plan because the coverage would not be offered in the absence of a waiver." Special treatment? Consumer advocates, we should note, have mixed feelings about the waivers. "Our concern with the waiver process in general is that they’re targeted at the very type of health policy that health care reform was meant to get rid of -- extremely low-benefit policies that cost consumers more than they’re worth," said Carmen Balber, the Washington director of the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog. In fact, we wondered why unions would need waivers, because unions have a reputation for offering good health care benefits. The experts we spoke with said it could be one of two scenarios. In some cases, unions, like companies, may offer policies that come in just under the $750,000 limit. In other cases, union workers get limited benefits while their private counterparts get none. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) offered the example of janitors in Houston who are covered by a health plan with an exemption. "It’s important to remember that the coverage we are talking about are low-cost plans that cover low-wage workers, some of whom have never had health care coverage in their lives," said the union in a statement, after we asked about the matter. But we can’t say for sure which plans might fit which category, because HHS hasn’t released every detail about the plans that are getting these waivers. The agency releases information about the company offering the plan, how many workers are covered, and the dates of application and approval. But it doesn’t list what the annual limits are or other details of the health plans. When we asked Crossroads GPS about the ad, a spokesman cited a lack of transparency in the approval process and claimed that a disproportionate number of waivers were going to unions, because only 11.9 percent of the country is unionized. The Obama administration "is in the very least giving the appearance that waivers are going to those with political connections," said spokesman Jonathan Collegio. But Balber said she saw no evidence that unions were receiving special treatment. "Pretty much anyone who applied, received them," she said. "The claim that this was special treatment falls a little flat. As a consumer organization, we think the waivers were granted too broadly, but HHS was being consistent." We also reviewed the most recent congressional testimony on how the waivers were granted. None of the witnesses provided evidence that there was special treatment. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the administrator of the waivers on the point, specifically asking about complaints from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Cummings: "Now some critics have suggested that the process by which annual limit waivers have been issued is biased and favors certain groups such as unions. For example, the February 10th, 2010, letter to the secretary, Chairman Issa made this statement, and I quote, ‘The current process gives credence to the perception that bureaucrats are picking winners and losers in a politicized environment where the winners are favored constituencies of the administration.’ Is that accurate?" Larsen: "That's not true. We do not favor any particular type of applicant, or any applicant from a particular sector, and we've applied the standards that we set out fairly across all the applicants." Cummings: "Is political support for the Obama administration or health care reform a factor your office uses in evaluating applications for annual limit waivers?" Larsen: "It is not." Cummings: "And you understand you're under oath?" Larsen: "I do, sir." Our ruling In ruling on this statement, we understand that the Obama administration would hardly admit to it if it were giving unions special treatment. But looking at the numbers of waivers that have been given to both union and non-union groups, we don’t see any pattern that would support a case for special treatment. The number of waivers are a small sample of all health plans, and many more waivers were given to big companies and corporations. We looked for additional information or evidence on this point and didn’t find it. But there are additional problems with the ad. The ad doesn’t mention that the waivers only apply to annual coverage limits, that they’re intended to be in place only until 2014 and that many for-profit companies have received the same waivers. It gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law, which they are not. Because the ad gives the impression that unions are exempt from the entire law, and because it’s evidence for special treatment is so thin, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06805	Says Democratic state Sen. Jim Holperin "voted against a property tax freeze" in 2009 and then voted for a "$1.5 billion property tax hike."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/kim-simac/recall-challenger-kim-simac-says-state-sen-jim-hol/	When Democrats controlled the Wisconsin Legislature in 2009, state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) joined a one-vote majority in favor of the two-year state budget. Now that vote is providing fodder for Republican challenger Kim Simac as she tries to knock off Holperin in the Aug. 16, 2011, recall election. Holperin was among the Democrats who faced recalls over their quorum-blocking flight to Illinois to protest Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed changes to collective bargaining. Simac and conservatives in the other recalls have sought to contrast Walker’s austere increases in taxes and fees ($88 million) with then-Gov. Jim Doyle’s bill two years earlier ($1.9 billion in net tax and fee increases). Simac put her own twist on it, going beyond those tax and fee increases when she criticized Holperin for raising local property taxes as part of the same budget vote in 2009. "In 2009, (Holperin) voted against a property tax freeze. That same year he also voted for a $1.5 billion property tax hike," Simac said in a July letter on her website. "The consequences of Jim Holperin’s reckless votes have been devastating to our economy and our seniors." Did Holperin really vote to kill a freeze and raise the burden on property taxpayers by that hefty figure? It’s an interesting claim, because politicians at the state level take credit when they have an impact on holding down local taxes, and they get some blame for increases. In reality, state lawmakers don’t set local property taxes; they’re voted on at the local level. But state budget decisions -- in part through limits or "freezes" on local taxes -- can greatly influence to what extent local schools and governments have to rely on local taxes. The first blow in the one-two punch from Simac said Holperin opposed a tax freeze. Her campaign, though, could not provide any evidence of a bill or budget amendment related to a tax freeze. Nor could we turn up any evidence after checking news stories and Senate amendments. Holperin did, of course, vote against the Walker budget in 2011 that included a property tax freeze. So that gets her off to a false start. Now let’s look at the number. Simac spokesman Matt Capristo pointed us to an April 2009 Legislative Fiscal Bureau report as backup for the $1.5 billion figure. Every two years after lawmakers pass a budget, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates how much local governments might raise property taxes given the changes lawmakers made to state aid, limits on local taxes and tax credits. Property-value growth and many other variables factor in as well. But we couldn’t find the $1.5 billion figure in the report. The section cited by the campaign estimates an increase of $478 million for 2010 over 2009 and another $528 million on top of that in 2011 over 2010. The report offers no sum for the two-year total increase. Adding the two yearly increases means taxes in 2011 would be about $1 billion higher than in 2009. That’s not $1.5 billion. Simac argues it’s more accurate to compare each year’s tax total to the base year of 2009. Here’s the math: The first year is a $478 million boost, and the second-year increase is more than $1 billion if you compare taxes in 2011 to what they were two years earlier ($478 million plus $528 million). Add the $1 billion-plus to the $478 million and that would reach $1.5 billion. Who’s right? It depends on what question you want to answer. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the average taxpayer looks at it year-to-year and would probably say it’s up $1 billion in two years. But it’s true, he added, that compared to the base year, $1.5 billion more was to be collected. So in making the claim, Simac picked a way to look at it that generated the highest possible number. There are other issues to consider -- with either number. The number from two years ago was a prediction. So we now know how much local governments and schools actually raised property taxes. The figure, according to the fiscal bureau, is about 40 percent lower than the initial projections. That calculation comes from numbers that were publicly available in June 2011 -- a month before Simac made her statement. Of course when Holperin voted on the budget, the estimate was much higher. So, we think it’s fair to use the original estimate as a benchmark for what Holperin was willing to support. Let’s see what we have: Simac said Holperin voted against a property tax freeze and voted for "a $1.5 billion property tax hike." She offers no evidence there was any vote on a freeze. And we could find none ourselves. On the second part of her claim, Simac cites a report that on its face does not back up the $1.5 billion figure. She uses math that an average taxpayer probably would not, but officials say it’s one way to tally up the impact. We think it’s somewhat misleading, but not totally out of bounds, to say Holperin "voted" for a property tax increase. After all, state actions have a big factor in local tax levies and lawmakers know the estimated impact on local levies when they approve a budget. And Holperin voted for the 2009-11 budget, the one in question. We rate Simac’s claim Mostly False.	None	Kim Simac	None	None	None	2011-08-12T14:56:57	2011-07-21	['Jim_Holperin']

pomt-03638	The U.S. Army had a training program that put "evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/03/randy-forbes/forbes-says-army-training-program-listed-evangelic/	During a recent budget hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, accused the Obama administration of waging war against religious expression in the military. "I believe the impact of this administration’s fiscal cuts to our national security are unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions," he told U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on April 11. "But I also believe this administration’s attacks on faith, religious freedom and religious liberty in the military are also unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions," the congressman said. Forbes, who is founder and chairman of the 94-member Congressional Prayer Caucus, cited several examples that have convinced him religious expression by service members is being suppressed. One, in particular, stood out. "We’ve had a training program, which I have given you a copy of, where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida," Forbes told Hagel. The statement gained Forbes interviews on WAVY-TV10 in Norfolk and on Fox News, which put up a screen headline saying, "Military calls evangelicals ‘terrorists.’" So we decided to check whether the armed forces had such a training program. Sergio Gor, Forbes’ spokesman, sent us news stories that ran around April 5 in The Washington Times, The Daily Mail in London, The Navy News and the Catholic News Agency. They concerned an offensive computer slide on Page 24 of a U.S. Army Reserve training presentation titled "Extremism and Extremist Organizations." Gor also sent us a picture of the slide, which in blue capital letters at the top, is titled "Religious Extremism." Seventeen groups are listed underneath. Evangelical Christianity topped the list, followed by Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful political group in Egypt. Beside each listing, the slide notes the nation and the religion that spawns the supposedly extremist group. The list includes Catholicism, ultra-orthodox Judaism and Sunni Islam in addition to the Ku Klux Klan and several groups that are recognized as terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department: al-Qaida, Hamas in Palestine, Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines and the Kahane movement in Israel. Contrary to Forbes’ statement, mainstream Mormons are not cited for extremism. But a split-off polygamist sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, is. Forbes, at the hearing and in TV interviews, gave the impression that the training materials were widely used and sanctioned by the Army. He told Fox News, "They’re training troops before the go to Afghanistan, and they were training them that evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons were in the same category with Hamas, al-Qaida and the Ku Klux Klan, and that’s just appalling." But there’s another side to this story that Forbes didn’t mention, a part that was well-documented in the news stories his office sent to us. The offending slide was used a year ago at a briefing held for an Army Reserves Unit in Pennsylvania. An Army spokesman said the person who created and presented the slideshow, whom the service will not identify by name, was not a "subject matter expert." The Army said the presenter, upon receiving a single complaint, apologized and deleted the slide. "The slide was not produced by the Army and certainly does not reflect our policy or doctrine," the Army said in a statement. "It was produced without anyone in the chain of command’s knowledge or permission." The Archdiocese for the Military Services released a statement April 4 saying it was "astounded that Catholics were listed alongside groups that are, by their very mission and nature, violent and extremist." The Archdiocese also said the training "appears to be an isolated incident not condoned by the Department of the Army." It called on the Defense Department to "ensure that taxpayer funds are never again used to present blatantly anti-religious material to the men and women in uniform." Our ruling Forbes, at a military budget hearing, said "We’ve had a training program ... where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida." This did happen in at least one briefing at a reserve center in Pennsylvania. The Army says it was a mistake -- made by an individual, not the command -- that was corrected upon the first complaint. Forbes, while offering no contrary information, made sweeping statements that suggest the training program was widespread and officially sanctioned. He also misread one entry on the list as Mormons, when, in fact, it named a small sect that practices polygamy. Forbes’ statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False.

pomt-05933	"Martin Luther King was a Republican."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/29/travis-rowley/republican-travis-rowley-says-martin-luther-king-j/	When you're famous and admired, everyone wants to claim you as their own. Take the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In a column that appeared on GoLocalProv.com the week of the slain civil rights leader's birthday, Travis Rowley, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, complained that liberals and Democrats consistently try to paint conservatives, Republicans and, in fact, all of America, as racist. Rowley said the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Dick Harpootlian, criticized Republicans for holding a presidential debate in the state on King's birthday, even though Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus held a debate among the Democratic presidential candidates on King's birthday in 2008. "It seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that Martin Luther King was a Republican and, if alive, would probably have come to his own party's defense by telling Harpootlian to stop being such a whiny, hyper-sensitive, little weasel," wrote Rowley. In recent history, blacks have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. So was King, who was assassinated in 1968 at the age of 39, really a Republican? Some historical context might be illuminating. The parties of King's era are not necessarily the parties we have today. King's father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., was a longtime Republican, not surprising at a time when most Southern Democrats supported segregation. And when the landmark Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, it was approved on the basis of geography, not party. It became law only after Republicans and Democrats outside the South joined forces to overturn a filibuster by Southern senators. Of the 22 Southern senators, 21 voted against it. All but one of the opponents were Democrats. Outside the South, only 1 of the 46 Democrats and 5 of the 32 Republicans in the U.S. Senate opposed it. But here we're focusing on the very narrow question of whether it's accurate to call the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a Republican. Rowley's claim has been made before by other Republicans. When our PolitiFact colleagues in Tennessee and Texas checked the claim, both ruled it to be False. We'll repeat some of their points. Perhaps the best argument in Rowley's favor comes from King's niece, Alveda C. King, who said in 2008 that "during his lifetime, [King] was a Republican." But in 2008, King's son, Martin Luther King III, said it was "disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states." PolitiFact found that King scholars agree with King's son. "I've not seen any evidence that MLK Jr. was a Republican but if he registered to vote it would have been as a Republican in Alabama simply because the Dems. would not allow black voters. Throughout the [Civil Rights] movement he worked with the northern Dem. Party," said Dr. Kenneth W. Goings, professor and past chairman of the Department of African American and African Studies at Ohio State University, in an e-mail to PolitiFact Tennessee. Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, told PolitiFact that blacks began turning toward the Democratic party during the New Deal. He called King a " 'tax and spend' democratic socialist." "He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums," said Jackson. (His proposal to spend $50 billion over 10 years -- $357 billion at today's prices -- to help the disadvantaged of all races was outlined in a 1965 Playboy interview.) And King reported in his autobiography that he wrote to one supporter in 1956 saying, "In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket." King's refusal to endorse one particular party also suggests that he had more important matters to deal with than partisan politics -- he wanted an end to racial discrimination, no matter which party delivered it. In an e-mail response, Rowley highlighted the comments of Alveda King and King's father's Republican roots. And he cited other sources who suggested why King should have been a Republican. But they didn’t prove that he was. When we asked Rowley whether he thought King's plan to spend billions to help minorities would be embraced by today's Republican party or attacked as socialism, he said it would depend on how the money would be spent. "There are 'spending' methods that don't result in socialist practices," he said, citing two examples: urban law enforcement to provide "the safety needed for a prosperous community" and school vouchers to "give parents the option to rescue their children from failing public school systems that have been destroyed by the Democrat-Teachers Union alliance." "The argument over which party MLK would affiliate with today is another story. And admittedly debatable," he added in a subsequent e-mail. Our ruling We can certainly envision King being willing to vote against the Southern Democrats who furiously promoted segregation and voting for Northern Republicans who worked to make equal rights a reality. But neither automatically make King a Republican, especially when, as a civil rights leader, he apparently wouldn't let himself be pigeon-holed into either political party. In short, Rowley and other advocates for the King-was-really-a-Republican theory haven't proven their case. So we will follow the lead of the two previous PolitiFact analyses and rule that Rowley's claim is False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-15051	The racial and ethnic makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office mirrors the community it serves.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/29/butch-conway/conways-claim-diverse-department-true/	Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway recently said publicly that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors the large and diverse north metro county it serves. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. But first a little context. The shooting of black teen Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 prompted protests that roiled the Ferguson-St. Louis area for weeks. Anti-police rhetoric has been on the rise since Brown’s death and other highly publicized police-involved shootings. Conway, who has been Gwinnett’s sheriff for 19 years, weighed in on what some have labeled a "war on police" earlier this month, penning an op-ed piece for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that denounced senseless violence against police officers. It also described those making allegations of police racism as ‘hate groups’ and "domestic terrorists with an agenda." At a press conference on Sept. 16, Conway responded to critics of the piece and said he planned to meet with some who disagreed with his viewpoint or accused him of "burying his head in the sand" to racism in policing today. It was at that time that Conway also said that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors Gwinnett, the state’s second largest county. So what do the numbers show? We contacted Shannon Volkodav, a spokeswoman for the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, to request supporting data on all department staff, as well as its leadership. She provided a racial/ethnic breakdown of the department’s current staff, which we compared with estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau on the population of Gwinnett County in 2014, the latest year for which information is available. The Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, with a 706-member staff, is 55.81 percent white, 35.55 percent African-American, 5.95 percent Hispanic, 2.27 percent Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.42 percent Native American/Alaskan. And the department serves an estimated 877,922 Gwinnett County residents, 58.1 percent of whom are white, 27 percent of whom are African-American, 20.5 percent of whom are Hispanic, 11.6 percent of whom are Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.8 percent of whom are Native American/Alaskan, according to the data we reviewed. Conway said in a telephone interview that a diverse department has been something he’s worked to achieve since first being elected sheriff in 1996. He said the administration is not as racially and ethnically diverse as he would like. But he said that’s a byproduct of the department and county having been predominately white well into the 1990s and senior administrators, most of whom have 20 to 25 years of experience, having risen through the ranks. (Whites make up 74 percent of front-line supervisors -- lieutenants, sergeants and corporals, according to department data.) Ronald Weitzer, a professor of sociology at George Washington University who specializes in police and minority relations, said the situation is not unusual. "It takes time for minority officers to move up through the hierarchy," Weitzer said. "It is also important that -- from the perspective of citizens who have contact with officers -- what matters is how diverse the department is on the ground." "Average residents may never encounter the top leadership or know what their demographics are," he said. The exception would be the chief of police, whose racial background would be known to the public, Weitzer said. We wondered how the Sheriff’s Office compared with Gwinnett County government as a whole. Joe Sorenson, the communications director for the county, provided data showing that 73.96 percent of the county’s workforce is white, 18.69 percent is black; 4.6 percent is Hispanic and 2.43 percent is Asian or Pacific Islander. The county is working to increase its diversity, but it’s not a quick process, Sorenson said. Some of its efforts include recruiting police officers at historically black colleges and universities, including Florida A&M University, Bethune-Cookman and Albany State, Sorenson said. Our ruling. Conway said his department mirrors the community it serves in racial and ethnic diversity. Data we reviewed show the department is more diverse than Gwinnett County government as a whole. African-Americans and other major ethnic and racial groups are represented in the department -- some groups are more proportionally represented in the department than others. But Conway’s overarching point stands up. We rate his statement as True.	None	Butch Conway	None	None	None	2015-09-29T00:00:00	2015-09-16	['None']
pomt-01334	Jason Carter never passed a bill in his tenure in the state Senate.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/24/nathan-deal/deal-correct-carter-hasnt-passed-bill/	Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has accused Democratic challenger Jason Carter of lacking the political chops for the job. During two recent debates, Deal asked Carter why he never assumed even minor leadership roles as a state senator or sponsored a successful bill in his tenure under the Gold Dome. "You’ve been in the (state) Senate since I’ve been governor, and you’ve never passed a bill," Deal said in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. "Why would anybody decide you have the leadership skills needed to lead this state?" PolitiFact decided to delve deeper into Deal’s claim that Carter never passed a bill. Carter, an attorney and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, was elected in May 2010 to replace state Sen. David Adelman of Atlanta, who resigned to become the U.S. ambassador to Singapore. A few months later, Deal, a longtime congressman, was elected to succeed Sonny Perdue, Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Now, Carter, 39, is hoping to unseat Deal, 72, in the Nov. 4 general election. A loss for Deal would be a major upset for Republicans who have been solidly in control at the Capitol for about a decade. But what about the governor’s claim? A search of the Georgia General Assembly’s records shows Deal is correct. In four years in the state Senate, Carter was primary sponsor of 11 bills, more than half dealing with the popular HOPE scholarship or other education issues. None of the bills became law and only one cleared the state Senate. But is it a sign that he was an ineffective lawmaker? There’s no proof of that. Democrats are in the minority in the General Assembly and so are rarely able to pass legislation. (The same was true for Republicans until, starting with Perdue, the state took a 180-degree turn politically.) Steve Anthony, a lecturer in the political science department at Georgia State University, said it’s "common" that the party with an absolute majority banishes the minority to near irrelevance. He should know. He was the longtime chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was the nation’s longest-serving state House speaker. "Many Republicans would say they are doing just what Tom Murphy used to do to them," Anthony said. "It’s a game. It’s what’s done in politics, at least on the state level." There’s one more point to consider: getting a bill passed and signed is not all that easy, regardless of party. In the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, members of the House and Senate introduced 2,514 bills. Of those, only 774 passed, and 757 became law. Most of the successful bills emerge from the leadership, Anthony said. That leaves the bulk of rank-and-file lawmakers, including Carter, to end up as co-sponsors to legislation. Co-sponsoring is the act of a lawmaker attaching his or her name to a pending proposal to show support or backing. And in that capacity, Carter found some success. The Atlanta Democrat co-sponsored 21 bills that became law, records show. In some cases, members of the minority party co-sponsor bills that are their idea but require a member from the party in charge to be the official sponsor to get the measure passed. Whether a lawmaker has been a bill’s co-sponsor can be a serious question for voters. But, to Deal’s point, snagging co-sponsors often has little to no impact on whether a bill gets passed. Case in point: State Rep. Mark Hatfield got 93 of the 180 members in the House to co-sponsor his 2011 proposal that would force presidential and vice presidential candidates to prove their citizenship before landing on the Georgia ballot. The bill, inspired by the "birther" movement, which believes President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, ultimately lost more than 25 of those backers and failed to move to a floor vote. There have recently been high-profile exceptions to the significance of co-sponsors, such as Deal’s effort to revamp the HOPE scholarship program with House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat. Few Democrats are able to earn that sort of recognition. More common, Anthony said, would be a tactic long used when a good idea surfaces. If the proposal is from the opposition, the majority hijacks the idea and makes some changes to qualify it as a new bill – and takes the credit. Carter, a staunch critic of changes Deal made to the HOPE scholarship program, says that happened to him in 2013. He was concerned that tech school students were being hurt by a decision to raise the GPA requirement for HOPE recipients from a 2.0 to a 3.0. He and a House Democrat introduced separate bills to return to the lower GPA requirement. Their bills went nowhere. But their idea caught on and emerged in an almost identical and successful bill with a Republican as chief sponsor. "It's definitely harder to pass a bill in the minority. It takes time and it takes working with the opposition -- something that younger legislators probably haven't accomplished yet," said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Deal, he said, is trying to say something about Carter’s relative youth and inexperience."You just got here, and already you want to be governor?" Our conclusion: Deal is right. Jason Carter hasn’t been the chief author of a bill that’s made it through the General Assembly. But that’s a fate most out-of-power Democrats face, as did Republicans in the decades they were in the same boat. That’s context the reader needs. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-15254	Under President Barack Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African-Americans.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-black-income-unemployment-worse-now-j/	Just days before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, billionaire real-estate developer and current polling leader Donald Trump criticized President Barack Obama’s record on ABC’s This Week. At one point, Trump zeroed in on Obama’s status as the country’s first black president, arguing that he had failed his black constituents. The topic came up when ABC’s Jonathan Karl referred to a tweet by Trump that said, "Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!" Karl asked Trump why he thought the country wouldn’t see another black president for "generations." Trump replied: "I think that he has set a very low bar, and I think it's a shame for the African-American people. And by the way, he has done nothing for African-Americans. You look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African-American citizens of this country. He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever. ... They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers. Look at their unemployment numbers. … Here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African-Americans of this country." We wondered whether Trump was right that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African Americans. We looked at historical data trends for four specific measurements for African-Americans: Overall unemployment rates, youth unemployment rates (since Trump mentioned "youth"), poverty rates, and median income. We’ll take these one by one. Overall unemployment rates for African Americans The African-American unemployment rate when Obama entered office was 12.7 percent. By June 2015, it had fallen to 9.5 percent, a drop of about one-quarter. And compared to its Obama-era peak of 16.8 percent in March 2010, the unemployment rate has fallen by about 43 percent. But what about a longer historical look? The black unemployment rate was higher than its current rate between May 1974 and June 1997, and between November 2001 and June 2005. In all, since May 1974, black unemployment was higher than today’s rate in 328 months, and lower than today’s rate in 87 months. So it’s been higher than today 79 percent of the time since May 1974. So Trump's point here is wrong. Youth unemployment rates for African Americans For this category, we looked at the historical unemployment rate data for African-Americans age 16 to 24. Because this data is not seasonally adjusted (which makes a month-to-month comparison imprecise), we looked at the most recent month of June 2015 and all previous June data going back to the oldest, which is from 1972. In June 2015, the unemployment rate for black youth was 23.4 percent. That was down from 31 percent in June 2009. That’s a drop of about one-quarter. More important, in the previous 43 Junes, the rate has been lower than that in only seven of those months, and higher than that in 36 of those months. So it’s been higher than its current rate 84 percent of the time, meaning Trump isn’t correct by this statistic, either. African-American poverty rate The black poverty rate is one of Obama’s weaker statistics. The poverty rate rose from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 27.2 percent in 2013, the most recent year available. That’s about 5 percent higher than it was when Obama took office. It’s also higher than at any time prior to the Obama presidency going back to 1996. Still, even today’s higher black poverty rate is hardly unprecedented: It was higher than it is now between 1959 and 1996 -- a 38-year period. So Trump isn’t correct by this measurement, either. African-American median income We looked at household median income for African-Americans and found a similar pattern to the poverty rate: Inflation-adjusted incomes have worsened during Obama’s tenure, but they are hardly the worst rates in history. In 2013, the median income for black households was $34,598. That’s lower than 2009 in inflation-adjusted dollars, though it’s up slightly compared to 2010. This could certainly be considered stagnation, if not shrinkage. Median income in 2013 was also lower than it was between 1996 and 2009 -- not a stellar accomplishment. On the other hand, inflation-adjusted median household income was below today’s level between 1967 and 1995. So it was worse than today two-thirds of the time between 1967 and the year Obama became president. So Trump’s wrong using this measurement as well. Our ruling Trump said that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African-Americans. Some key statistics for African-Americans, such as unemployment, improved significantly during Obama’s tenure. The ones that stagnated or worsened under Obama are still relatively positive compared to recent history. Trump is wrong by several important measures. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12681	"2009-2010, let's remember, hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted in the ACA."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/16/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-hundreds-republican-amendments-/	Republicans continue to sell their health care plan in an effort to deliver on a party-wide campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Yet during a roundtable discussion on State of the Union, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., pushed back on charges of Democratic obstructionism regarding health care legislation. Anchor Jake Tapper asked if Gutierrez was involved, or if Democrats were "just sitting by the sidelines opposing everything." "Very different process," Gutierrez replied. "2009-2010, let's remember, hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted in the ACA." We decided to look into Gutierrez’s claim that the final version of the Affordable Care Act incorporated hundreds of Republican amendments. When the ACA was making its way through Congress, former President Barack Obama made a similar statement in September 2009. During a joint address to Congress, he said that his plan incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats. We rated that claim Mostly False, because many of the amendments Republicans introduced were technical in nature. Republicans had several opportunities to introduce amendments to the Affordable Care Act, in both the Senate and House bills. Ultimately, for procedural reasons tied to the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., the Senate version was the only one that moved forward. But Republicans offered changes in the committees that considered the bills before the whole chambers voted on them. For example, 788 amendments were submitted during the ACA’s markup in the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee (HELP). Three quarters of them were filed by the committee’s Republican members, according to John McDonough in his book Inside National Health Reform. Of those, 161 were adopted in whole or revised form. Yet as we reported at the time, those amendments were mostly technical. Only two of those Republican amendments were passed via roll-call vote. One of these amendments required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option and the other involved biologics medication. The Senate Finance Committee took up another version of the bill. Senators initially offered 564 amendments. During that markup, about six Republican amendments were adopted via roll call vote, and others were adopted by unanimous consent, without objection, and via voice vote, according to coverage by Congressional Quarterly. Parts of this bill merged with the bill the HELP committee marked up to become the final law. Gutierrez’s office pointed us toward a fact sheet from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s, D-Calif., office that said 147 Republican amendments were incorporated in the final Senate bill, though the sheet did not expand on the nature of those amendments. On the House side, some Republican amendments to the Affordable Care Act were accepted in committee; 24 Republican amendments were incorporated in the Energy and Commerce Committee, and six were incorporated in the Education and Workforce committee. Republicans sponsored 38 amendments in the Ways and Means committee, and each one was rejected. Timothy Jost, emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University School of Law, told us that "the basic statement that hundreds were adopted is wrong." But Jost added that "there was very significant Republican participation early on on the Senate side. There were dozens of hours of debate, and Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee were very engaged." Jost said by September 2009 that period was over and from then on, the bill was strictly a Democratic piece of legislation. It’s worth noting that many facets of the Republican’s health care agenda at the time made it into the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act was a private market plan, and it dropped a long-held Democratic priority to include a public option. In the end, no Senate or House Republicans voted for the Affordable Care Act in its final version. Our ruling Gutierrez said that "hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted" during the drafting of the 2010 health care law. His statement has some basis, because Republican amendments were adopted in both the House and the Senate during the legislative process. Most of these amendments were not particularly meaningful, though, so calling it a bipartisan enactment effort remains a stretch. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11074	On separating families at the border.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/20/leah-vukmir/has-trump-backer-and-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-/	Amid a growing uproar, has Republican U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir -- a consistently hardline supporter of President Donald Trump -- changed her position on separating children from their parents at the border? Read our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race We turn to the Flip-O-Meter, which examines an official's consistency on an issue. It does not pass a judgment on a politician who changes positions, or determine if any shift is good policy or good politics. Vukmir is running against Kevin Nicholson in the August 2018 GOP primary. The winner takes on first-term Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the November 2018 general election. News reports indicated a change on Vukmir’s part. So, let’s take a closer look. What’s been happening As PolitiFact National has reported: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April 2018 announced a "zero-tolerance" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian. Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31, 2018, as a result of border-crossing prosecutions. Now to what Vukmir has said. ‘Process has to be upheld’ Vukmir had this exchange with Milwaukee-based TV show host Mike Gousha during a June 8, 2018 interview (broadcast June 10, 2018): Gousha: "Do you have any concerns about some of the reports coming from along the border that say that people who are either seeking asylum or are trying to cross into the country illegally -- that parents and children are being separated? Do you have concerns about that?" Vukmir: "Obviously, and I am going to have to watch that very closely. But people are taking advantage of our generosity in this country and I believe we are a nation of laws, and we have to stand up and uphold those laws ….There is a process that has to be upheld." Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc So, Vukmir states concern about separating children from their parents at the border. But she does not express opposition to the practice and says laws must be upheld. Vukmir had a different take 11 days later. ‘Shouldn’t be separated’ Vukmir made this statement to the Associated Press on June 19, 2018: "Of course families shouldn’t be separated. I was discussing this with" U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., "and he told me they’d be having a hearing as soon as next week to move on a fix to address this problem right away." This is a shift. Vukmir is saying the practice of separating children from their parents should not happen. The next day, Trump himself changed positions. As USA Today reported: "President Trump, facing a national outcry, said Wednesday he would sign an executive order to keep migrant families together at the border, abandoning his earlier claim that the crisis was caused by an iron-clad law and not a policy that he could reverse." On that, Vukmir’s campaign told us Vukmir is "glad" about Trump’s decision and "now we need to focus on fixing our broken immigration system, and that begins with securing our borders." Our rating Our ratings on the Flip-O-Meter are: No Flip – No significant change in position. Half Flip – A partial change in position. Full Flop – A complete change in position. Vukmir never explicitly declared support for separating children from their parents at the border. But she went from stating no opposition to the practice, and saying laws must be upheld, to saying it shouldn’t happen. For a partial change in position, we give Vukmir a Half Flip.

Ron Johnson wants President Barack Obama to seek Congress’ approval before finalizing a deal with Iran, an agreement that would halt the country’s nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanction relief. Obama has argued that since the agreement is not a treaty, Congress’ approval isn’t needed. But Johnson, R-Wis., one of 47 GOP senators who signed a controversial letter to Iran critical of the negotiations, isn’t buying it. "The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no on this deal," Johnson said March 8, "and I think the United States Congress should have the exact same input into the process." It’s a curious comparison, but is it accurate? We decided to check. You can look at this through two lenses: What does Iran’s Constitution literally say about the duties of the parliament, called the Islamic Consultative Assembly or the Majles? And in practice, what responsibilities does the parliament actually have in an authoritarian regime heavily controlled by the Supreme Leader and the unelected 12-member Guardian Council? The Iran Constitution The Iranian parliament is made up of 290 elected officials. Their duties are outlined in the country’s Constitution. There are some strict limitations on the body’s power. For example, it "cannot enact laws contrary to the usual and ahkam (the Islamic commandments) of the official religion of the country or to the Constitution." The Guardian Council determines if a law is in violation and it often overturns legislation in the name of Islam or the constitution. But the Constitution does bestow some broad powers on the assembly. Article 77 says, "International treaties, protocols, contracts, and agreements must be approved by the Islamic Consultative Assembly." That would seem to be a point for Johnson, right? Not necessarily. Just as the White House contends that the agreement is not a treaty and therefore not subject to congressional approval, Obama’s National Security Council says the deal would not fall under "international treaties, protocols, contracts and agreements" in the Iranian Constitution. Experts agreed. "The Iranian parliament has the authority to ratify treaties, but a possible nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 will be a political agreement, not a treaty," said Alireza Nader, a senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation. "The Majles can debate the agreement, but it is unlikely to vote yes or no on it. The political establishment, including the Supreme Leader, president, etc., will have the critical voice." There is one aspect of the agreement that may need approval from Iran’s parliament. The Joint Plan of Action for reaching an agreement says that the final step to a comprehensive solution is contingent on Iran ratifying and implementing the "additional protocol." What’s that? Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Iran signed, member countries must abide to standards set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 2003, the agency approved additional protocols for Iran so the agency could monitor Iran’s nuclear sites. While Iran temporarily abided by the additional protocol, it has since stopped, and it never ratified the agreement. If Iran wants the United States to lift its economic sanctions, it must ratify that agreement, which would require action by Iran’s parliament. A 'dead letter'? Johnson’s staff pointed us to a report on Iran’s parliament from the United States Institute of Peace. It noted that the Islamic Consultative Assembly has "forced a degree of accountability on the executive branch through its powers over the budget, confirmation or impeachment of ministers, and interpellation," and that "has long served as the one public outlet for political differences." "By Middle East standards, the persistence and vitality of Iran’s Majles has been somewhat remarkable," the report said, especially as a vehicle for local cultural and economic debate. But the same report also noted how toothless the body is, particularly on foreign policy. Every candidate that runs for parliament is vetted by the Guardian Council. As it is, turnover is constant, and dissenters don’t last long. And unelected leaders often get around the body’s legislative role or strong arm the assembly, particularly on nuclear issues, the report said. Put bluntly, any power the Constitution grants the parliament is a "dead letter," said Matthew Kroenig, co-author of The Handbook of National Legislatures: A Global Survey. "It is inconceivable that the Iranian parliament would stand in the way of an agreement that had the support of the government and the Supreme Leader," said Kroenig, professor of international relations at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. Johnson’s office noted that already Iran’s parliament voted on the nuclear negotiations. That came on Jan. 6, when the Islamic Consultative Assembly held a vote on the government’s handling of the nuclear negotiations. But the assembly ultimately sided with the regime and the vote had no repercussions tied to it anyway. The parliament is under "heavy influence of the Supreme Leader, and in recent years has not acted against his interests," Nader said. Our ruling Johnson said, "The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no" on the nuclear deal. This is incorrect on two accounts. Experts said the nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran won’t require ratification by Iran’s parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly. It’s possible the deal will be contingent on Iran’s ratification of a previous international nuclear agreement, which might require the assembly’s approval, but the body won’t weigh in on the deal currently being worked on. And even if it did, it would be entirely symbolic, as the assembly is heavily influenced by the Supreme Leader on foreign policy matters. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06645	"170,000 of the jobs" created in Texas under Gov. Rick Perry "were government jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-under-rick-perry-government-jobs-gre/	With the polls now showing Rick Perry ahead for the Republican nomination, his opponents are trying to undercut his claims of soaring job growth while he's been governor of Texas. During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought to put some blemishes on Perry’s record by noting that many of the new jobs were in the government. CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, the debate moderator, began the exchange by asking Paul about Perry’s claims of economic success in the Lone Star State. "You’re from Texas," Blitzer said. "Does your governor deserve all that credit?" Paul answered, "Not quite. I’m a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he’s been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple. So, no. And 170,000 of the jobs were government jobs. So I would put a little damper on this, but I don’t want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something." For this item, we’re looking exclusively at Paul’s claim that "170,000 of the jobs" created in Texas under Perry "were government jobs." We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal source of employment data for the nation, states and localities. We looked at government job growth during Perry’s tenure, from January 2001 to July 2011: State government jobs: Increase of 49,100, or about 4,600 per year of Perry’s tenure Local government jobs: Increase of 217,600, or about 20,700 per year Federal government jobs: Increase of 19,700, or about 1,900 per year Total government jobs: Increase of 286,400, or about 27,300 per year Meanwhile, Texas employment overall increased over this period by 1,078,600, or about 102,700 per year. Looking at it a different way, the number of local government jobs has increased by 21 percent during Perry’s tenure, while state government jobs have expanded at a 15 percent clip. Let's put all of this in perspective. The increase in state government jobs represented about 4 percent of Texas’ total jobs increase; for local government jobs, it was 20 percent; for federal jobs, it was less than 2 percent. We see a few different ways to analyze these numbers. First, in critiquing Perry, not all government jobs are created equal. Perry has the most direct influence over the growth in state jobs. His influence on local government jobs is weaker. And he has relatively little influence in securing federal job increases. (Indeed, given his theme that the feds are overreaching, he might very well want fewer federal employees.) How big is Perry’s sway over local government jobs? We checked with representatives of cities and counties, and they agreed that it is pretty limited. Cities get about 36 percent of their funds from property taxes, 29 percent from sales taxes and much of the rest from items such as fines, right-of-way rentals and user fees, said Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, which represents 1,100 Texas cities. Those sorts of income streams are not affected by the governor to any significant degree. Counties, similarly, are "highly reliant on the property tax," said Elna Christopher, a spokeswoman for the Texas Association of Counties. She said that state mandates can affect county employment numbers, particularly because a jail standards commission sets required ratios between prison inmates and correctional-officers. But while the governor appoints the commissioners, he doesn’t directly influence their deliberations. This leaves one major area: the public schools. The state government does have significant influence over education budgets -- and most recently, this impact has been to shrink rather than increase. Earlier this year, Perry and the legislature decided to fund school districts by $4 billion less in 2012-13 than existing formulas would have provided. And during Perry’s tenure, local education jobs -- which Perry would have the most influence over -- have increased at a slower rate than local government jobs as a whole. Local education jobs have risen at about 11 percent, while non-educational local government jobs have risen by 37 percent. So with the government jobs Perry can affect the most -- state jobs -- the raw-number increase was well below what Paul claimed. Only if you use a more expansive definition of government jobs -- including jobs Perry doesn’t have much of an impact on -- is the increase bigger than what Paul claimed. Having said that, the increase in total government jobs under Perry is not trivial. State government jobs represented 4 percent of the overall increase for all types of jobs, but the combination of all government jobs accounted for nearly 27 percent. And if you look at government jobs as a percentage of all jobs in Texas, the share has risen from 16.4 percent at the start of Perry’s tenure to 17.5 percent today. And here’s one more factor to consider: As state and local government jobs were increasing, so was the state's population -- more rapidly than anywhere in the nation. Between mid 2001 and mid 2010, Texas’ population increased by a whopping 20 percent. The growth in local government jobs -- 21 percent -- roughly kept pace with that growth, while state government jobs increased at a somewhat slower pace, 15 percent. Both growth rates were faster than the national average. Nationally, local and state government jobs both grew by slightly under 6 percent during the same period. Our ruling We can’t find an exact match for Paul’s 170,000 figure in the official statistics, and getting to that number requires not just state jobs, but also local government jobs that Perry would have had difficulty influencing. Still, there's some truth in Paul’s underlying claim that a notable share of the job growth Perry touts on the campaign trail came from government jobs. Even leaving out federal jobs, about one out of every four new jobs in Texas during Perry’s tenure has been a new state or local government job. So while Paul is wrong on the specific numbers, he makes a larger point with some merit. We’ll call it Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-09-14T15:53:46	2011-09-12	['Texas', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-09516	During "the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/17/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-pelosi-and-others-cost-/	In an e-mail blast, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, told supporters that spending in Washington is out of control. Dewhurst spiced his Tuesday e-mail with a reference to the Democratic House speaker, stating that "during the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person." The House speaker living large in Denmark? We checked into that. Dewhurst’s campaign pointed us to a USA Today post online reflecting on a report by CBS News, which reviewed travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office after the international climate summit in December. A summary of the travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office states that air fare, food and lodging costs for 57 people including Pelosi added up to $553,564. That works out to $9,711 per person. CBS found that a factor in the travel costs was that the host hotel, a five-star Marriott, required guests to pay for six nights’ stay even if they were staying two nights, as Pelosi did. CBS also said that in fairness, "many attendees told us they did a lot of hard work, and laid the groundwork for a future global treaty." Pelosi's food and lodging expenses totaled $4,406 (she, like many, took a military jet to the summit). She declined to discuss the trip costs, CBS said. Pelosi personally accounted for less than 10 percent of the costs reported by her office for dozens of individuals. Still, Dewhurst correctly summarized the overall per-person travel costs.

pomt-00830	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is "about the size of the one" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat Doyle’s cut as so dire.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/25/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-walker-cut-uw-budget-similar-doyles/	When Gov. Scott Walker proposed a $300 million cut to the state’s university system over two years, Democrats called it a "massive" and "destructive" blow. That stuck in the craw Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, even though he thought Walker’s plan cut too much. "Let’s remember that the cut that’s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle)," Vos said March 12, 2015 in an interview on Wisconsin Eye. Vos added: "I didn’t hear Democrats then complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end." Vos was responding to a prediction from Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, that the university system would fall from the top ranks nationally for a generation under Walker’s plan. (We rated Mostly True a Barca claim from the interview that "the average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year" in grant money). The largest cut to higher education during Doyle’s eight-year tenure came in his 2003-’05 budget, his first. That’s the budget Vos was referring to said aide Kit Beyer. First, the numbers. Walker’s cut in state support, depending on how you tally it up, amounts to between $278 million and $297 million in the 2015-’17 budget. The Doyle cut, approved by Republican lawmakers, was $250 million from 2003 to 2005. The best comparison is the percentage view: Walker’s cut amounts to between 12 percent and 13 percent of state general-fund aid to the university system; Doyle’s was 12 percent. So, as Vos said, the reductions were quite comparable. But Vos’ analysis skips past an important point. In 2003, Doyle and legislative Republicans allowed tuition to rise by 18 percent, or $150 million. That took a lot of the sting out of the budget cuts. In contrast, Walker has again proposed a tuition freeze, blocking the university from turning to students or their families to backfill the budget. Now to the second part of Vos’ claim, that Democrats didn’t see the 2003 cut in the apocalyptic way they describe Walker’s. We reviewed news releases posted on WisPolitics.com and looked at news stories from that time. Democrats did appear to lay off of Doyle’s UW cuts, at least publicly. One Milwaukee-area Democrat, state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman said: "We're in a fiscal crisis. The truth is, I think the whole situation is not fair. At this point, although the university is being hit, when you're dealing with life and death (matters), it's a basic triage." The same can’t be said of UW administrators and student groups, both of whom pushed back pretty hard on the cuts and the tuition increase. "We don't have too many friends in the Legislature, and I'd like to know why because we're not bad people doing bad things to the state," Linda Weimer, the UW System's vice president for university relations, was quoted as saying in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Vos focused on Democratic Party legislators in his claim, though, not on students or UW officials. And lawmakers and Doyle defended the cut, in part, by pointing out UW tuition rates were among the lowest in the Big 10 at the time. There’s one other piece of context worth noting when comparing Democratic reaction in 2003 and 2015. Doyle’s 2003 cut was the first significant reduction in state support in years. The previous budget, under Gov. Scott McCallum, cut $12 million; the one before that actually increased state support. The fact that UW had been spared deep cuts in the years leading up to 2003 seemed to mute reaction from both parties to the big Doyle cut. By contrast, under Walker, his proposed 2015-’17 reduction comes four years after cuts of $250 million to universities in his first budget (2011-’13). Our rating Vos said Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is "about the size of the one that happened" under Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat that cut as so dire. The one cut Vos referred to, in 2003 under Doyle and legislators, was very similar in size to Walker’s current proposal. It’s worth pointing out though that Doyle, unlike Walker, allowed big tuition hikes to ease the 2003 budget cuts, and that Walker has proposed deeper cuts in the UW System than Doyle in less time. We rate the Vos claim Mostly True.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2015-03-25T13:58:11	2015-03-12	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Jim_Doyle']
pomt-13609	"In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/15/afscme/union-backed-ad-repeats-inaccurate-claim-joe-heck-/	A well-worn Democratic attack line is being repeated in Nevada’s Senate race, with a major union dropping seven figures on a new television ad attacking Republican candidate Joe Heck. The political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is running several ads warning viewers that Heck would be a "threat" to the future of the entitlement program. "In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing it, turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market." the ad says. "Heck's plan means billions more for Wall Street, and they've donated over half a million dollars to his campaign." The donations aspect of the ad is relatively straightforward, as the securities and investment industry has donated $525,569 to Heck throughout his congressional career, according to an OpenSecrets.com tally (roughly 73 percent of that sum coming during his current Senate run). But the main claim of the ad, that Heck would "privatize" Social Security and subsequently jeopardize the program’s fiscal stability, is one that PolitiFact and other Nevada journalists have called inaccurate on multiple occasions. Democrats have used the specter of Republican-led efforts to privatize Social Security as a political boogeyman since at least 2005, when then-President George W. Bush unsuccessfully proposed a plan to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers. Many Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034 and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries. Here’s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program: Indexing the retirement age from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years; Allowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets; Possibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies ($118,500 in 2015). It’s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to "privatize" Social Security. (Heck calls it a "diversified investment.") This is somewhat of an argument over semantics: Is Heck’s proposal privatization or not? PolitiFact has generally found that support for voluntary private Social Security accounts for younger workers doesn’t merit the sort of concerns or consequences implied by a "full privatization" of the program. The vast majority of Republicans, including Heck, say they’re adamantly opposed to making any changes that would affect those already receiving benefits or about to enter the program. It’s misleading of the ad to suggest that Nevada senior citizens could lose "our savings" given that Heck has never called for changes to be made for current beneficiaries. AFSCME did point to several reports on the potential fiscal cost of a quasi-privatized option, most of which were published nearly a decade ago when the Bush administration was pushing for changes to the entitlement program. Heck was elected to Congress in 2010. As the ad points out, Bush’s plan to shift to a partially privatized version of Social Security would likely lead to billions of dollars in fees for the brokerages and mutual fund businesses who would oversee the new individual accounts. Heck has previously said he’s more concerned about securing retirement for individuals than ensuring the future solvency of the program. "It’s not about making Social Security solvent," Heck said to the Las Vegas Sun in 2010. "It’s about securing people’s retirement." In 2011, Heck did join House Republicans in a vote against an amendment that would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to cut or "privatize" Social Security and other entitlements. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta said in an email that private investments could potentially entail anything from U.S. Treasury securities, annuities, CDs, money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts or employer-matched retirement savings account. "But all this is moot, because it’s a theoretical discussion about how to address the long-range insolvency of (Social Security)," Baluta said in an email. "There is no Joe Heck plan to privatize Social Security." This isn’t the first time AFSCME has gone after Heck on this particular issue — the union was sharply criticized over a similar ad in 2010 by journalists including Jon Ralston, who accused the union of "blatant fear mongering." Our ruling A new AFSCME ad claims that Heck "supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market." Heck has stated an openness to supporting optional, private retirement accounts for people under a certain age as an alternative to the existing Social Security program, but AFSCME is bending the truth. Despite what the ad implies, Heck has never suggested a mandatory privatization of the entitlement system that would forcibly "turn our savings over to Wall Street." Because this ad is partially accurate but takes things way out of context, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e5621fe-e15c-4d76-97bf-10e670c5c320	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2016-08-15T12:02:25	2016-08-10	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Joe_Heck', 'New_York_Stock_Exchange']

pomt-06094	Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it couldn’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-says-labor-board-tried-block-boeing/	With the South Carolina presidential primary fast approaching, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad blasting President Barack Obama over a union dispute involving an airplane factory in North Charleston, S.C. In the ad, Romney stands in front of workers on a factory floor and says that "the National Labor Relations Board, now stacked with union stooges selected by the president, says to a free enterprise like Boeing, ‘you can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.’ "That is simply un-American. It’s political payback of the worst kind. It is wrong for America, and it is something that will stop under my administration." Romney made this same basic claim during an October 2011 debate. Its stems from a complaint filed by the NLRB against Boeing over its decision to build a jet factory in South Carolina, instead of ramping up production at its existing union facility in Washington state. PolitiFact looked into it then and found that Romney distorted the facts. The background The Romney campaign told us previously that the source of his October statement was an April New York Times story about the NLRB complaint, which sought "to force Boeing to bring an airplane production line back to its unionized facilities in Washington state instead of moving the work to a non-union plant in South Carolina." About six years ago, Boeing was making plans for production of its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C., would produce three a month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel, Lafe Solomon, tried to bring the parties together but failed. In April 2011, Solomon formally issued a complaint on the grounds that Boeing built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union. Top Boeing officials had been open about the connection between the machinists union and the new factory. According to the filing, one executive told a newspaper that "the overriding factor (in transferring the line) was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years." Solomon considered this retaliation against the union for having conducted strikes in the past. As such, he argued Boeing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike. Problems with Romney’s portrayal Solomon’s complaint initiated a process that sent the case to an administrative law judge. The judge’s ruling would then go to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed. In short, the law provides a process with checks and balances -- an important point Romney ignored. (As it turned out, the case ended without a hearing. The NLRB dropped its complaint in December 2011, at the urging of the machinists union after it reached a deal on wages with Boeing.) In addition, the complaint against Boeing is not based on the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. We spoke to lawyers who think the complaint is well-founded and lawyers who think it’s misguided, but they agree on this point. Stanford law professor William Gould, a former chair of the NLRB, thinks the general counsel was wrong to move this complaint forward. By his reading of federal law, employers have the legal right to minimize exposure to strikes, and deciding to locate a plant in a place where unions are weak can be a strategy that passes legal muster. But Gould said Romney did "make an error of fact." "He’s wrong in suggesting that the general counsel’s reasoning applies … to union or non-union states," Gould said. Another labor lawyer, Jeffrey Hirsch at the University of North Carolina Law School, concurred. "This has nothing to do with geography," Hirsch said. "You could switch the states, and the case would be identical." Both lawyers also said that if Romney is suggesting that the NLRB has done anything unusual, he’s completely wrong. "The NLRB has held in countless cases that employers can’t move to another facility for prohibited reasons," Gould said. A prohibited reason would be to punish the union. Even the spokesman for the National Right to Work Committee, Patrick Semmens, said the issue isn’t that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. "The more fundamental point is that it was a non-union facility," said Semmens, who maintained that Romney’s claim has merit. Our ruling The Romney ad claimed that the NLRB told Boeing that it "can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state." The NLRB’s complaint started a legal process that could ultimately have resulted in a factory closure, but the NLRB as a whole didn’t tell Boeing anything. What’s more, the legal basis for the action centered on whether Boeing was punishing the union for staging strikes, not that Boeing had opened a factory in a right-to-work state. We rate the statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-05T15:59:00	2012-01-05	['South_Carolina', 'Boeing']
pomt-12422	Says there are thousands of registered voters over 110 years old in North Carolina, including one who is 219 years old.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/18/chain-email/no-thousands-dead-people-are-not-registered-vote-n/	A chain email has begun circulating in North Carolina that claims widespread irregularities in the state’s voter rolls. The email caught our attention with its subject line, "PROOF !! North Carolina has the world's oldest voters !" It says there are thousands of registered voters in North Carolina who are 110 or more years old, including one person who is a whopping 219 years old. Though tongue-in-cheek, the implication is clear – that many dead people are still actively registered, perhaps allowing others to commit voter fraud by casting ballots in their names. "Perhaps it is something in the (North) Carolina water," the email begins. "I doubt there is another state in the Union who could claim, as NC does, to have 5,376 voters 110 years old, or older. One current voter was born in 1798, making him a rather hefty 219 years old, thereby nearly doubling the age of the oldest person on earth." If all this is true, it would clearly indicate some concerning irregularities. The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the oldest living people, has been able to verify only 43 people in the entire world age 110 or older as of May 3. The email concludes that this is "more evidence that when you think of questionable elections, (North) Carolina should be the FIRST state that comes to mind." So we wanted to get to the bottom of which is fraudulent – this email, or the state’s voter rolls. Following the president’s lead? The chain email began making the rounds, it appears, shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new committee on May 11 to look into voter fraud around the country. Trump has consistently spread false claims about voter fraud, both during his presidential campaign and after winning the election. He said "millions" of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton and that he should’ve won the popular vote, which PolitiFact ruled Pants On Fire. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare. Trump has also made unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud against several individual states – all of which have been rated Pants On Fire – including North Carolina, California, New Hampshire and Virginia. Those claims are either vague about the type of fraud or refer specifically to immigrants voting illegally. None have claimed what this new chain email alleges, that dead people are somehow voting. In years past, versions of this claim have been popular on conservative and right-wing websites, internet forums and blogs – including Breitbart and the North Carolina-based Civitas Institute. Why so many ancient voters? The chain email’s most eye-popping claim is about that 219-year-old voter. It’s also the first mistake the email makes. It refers to that person as a male, but a list of voters included in the email clearly shows he is really a she. There’s more intrigue: In 2012, when Breitbart wrote about super-old voters in North Carolina, it didn’t mention anyone over 200. We wondered if this woman only recently decided – nearly a century since being eligible to vote – that now was the time to finally register. So we asked Pat Gannon, the spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He said the state database does appear to show 5,391 people over 110 – a few more than the email mentioned, even – but that there are several honest explanations. For the 219-year-old, he said, it amounts to just plain human error when a clerk was entering the person’s information. "The ‘219-year-old’ voter was inadvertently given a birth date of 1797 instead of 1979, according to our research," Gannon wrote in an email. "We’ve also determined that the voters that show up as 118, 120 and 154 years old do so because of data entry errors. Their dates of birth will soon be corrected in our database." But that only covers four out of 5,391. What about the rest? Nearly all of them – 97.5 percent – are what the state calls "legacy voters." Until the 1990s, people who registered to vote in North Carolina didn't have to list their date of birth. They only had to promise they were at least 18. Then, in the late 2000s, the state digitized its voter records. Gannon said anyone who was in the system with no date of birth was automatically listed as being born Jan. 1 in either 1900 or 1901. Of the 5,391 voters who appear over 110 in the database, he said, 5,257 fall into that category. As for the other 130 questionable voters (2.4 percent of the total), Gannon said, some could still be alive, could be dead, or could be listed due to clerical errors like the four they’ve already identified. Most North Carolina voters who die are automatically removed from voter rolls, since they die in North Carolina or another state that shares its records with North Carolina. But Gannon said some states don’t share their records, including South Carolina and Virginia, the two states with the longest borders with North Carolina. Any North Carolina voters who die in one of those states won’t have their registrations revoked until either a family member notifies the state or eight years go by without that person voting. And while it’s possible there are dead people on the voter rolls, people committing fraud by voting in their names is almost unheard of. In the 2016 general election, two people in North Carolina were caught voting for dead family members, out of 4.8 million voters statewide who cast a ballot, according to a previous audit by the elections board. Our ruling After President Donald Trump announced a new commission on voter fraud, a chain email has been making the rounds in North Carolina suggesting voter fraud and "questionable elections." It cites thousands of people registered to vote who couldn’t possibly be alive. However, nearly 98 percent of those people are actually voters who the state lists as being born in 1900 or 1901 since they didn’t have to give their date of birth when registering to vote. Others are on the list simply due to clerical errors. Of these nearly 5,400 voters who appear 110 or older, no more than 130 are dead. And it could be less. A 2016 audit found only two cases of people voting in the name of a dead person, out of more than 4.8 million votes cast. The email reaches a faulty conclusion based on a dishonest premise, and we rate its claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: An earlier version of this article said inactive voters have their registrations automatically revoked after 16 years. It's actually after eight years. This did not affect our ruling.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2017-05-18T16:17:38	2017-05-11	['North_Carolina']

pomt-06692	"(U.S. Reps.) Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are … shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/06/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-republican-represe/	For members of Congress, the "town hall" meeting with constituents has taken on a new dynamic. The once-routine chats with the folks back home have, at times, become highly charged sessions with large crowds. They’ve become a barometer of sorts of public sentiment -- or the ability of opponents to organize. Democrats faced hostile crowds during the summer of 2009 when the hot topic was the federal health care reform bill. Some of the meetings drew hundreds and saw shouting, pushing and shoving. President Barack Obama decried what he called "scare tactics" from opponents. And one left leaning blog ran a list of dozens of town hall meetings believed to be targeted for disruption. Congressional Republicans got a similar reception in the spring and summer of 2011. The frequent topic: Proposals by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to alter Medicare. Tempers flared and meetings were disrupted, including one in April in Racine where Ryan asked police to remove a protester. So as Congress settled into its August break, the Wisconsin Democratic Party took a shot at some of the state’s GOP members of Congress -- Ryan, and freshmen Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble. In an Aug. 17, 2011 email to supporters, state Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate said: "Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records that they are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them." Buried amid the heated, and opinionated, rhetoric -- "so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records" -- there’s a powerful factual claim: Are the three "shutting down" town hall meetings or "making constituents pay" to see them? A Democratic Party spokesman did not respond to an email request for evidence backing up the statement. So we were left to search the public record and to make our own calls. The genesis of the claim appears to be a Politico article from the day before the party’s release that began this way: "The House Budget Committee chairman isn’t holding any face-to-face open-to-the-public town hall meetings during the recess, but like several of his colleagues he will speak only for residents willing to open their wallets." Now, what about the party’s claim? The claim starts off on a wrong track: Ribble participated in a forum in Appleton on Aug. 8, 2011, and Duffy held a town hall meeting in Wausau on Aug. 15, 2011. Ryan, meanwhile, held an Aug. 8, 2011 "telephone town hall meeting" with residents of Rock County. So, all three had meetings of some variety -- in person or the newfangled phone-in approach -- before the party’s claim was even made. Indeed, members of Congress don’t always have town hall meetings during a recess. And by at least one measure, Republicans were more likely to do so this time than Democrats. A nonpartisan group called No Labels released a survey Aug. 22, 2011 that found "67.9% of Democrats and 50.8% of Republicans stating they had no town hall meetings scheduled for the recess period." So what about the second thrust of the Democratic claim: Are the Republicans hiding behind a pay wall? We found three events where money was involved. The events were not fund-raisers for the congressmen, but lunch meetings open to the public that carried a cost. The most highly publicized -- and politicized -- one is an appearance by Ryan on Sept. 6, 2011 sponsored by the Whitnall Park Rotary Club. The club’s website says: "This is NOT a town hall meeting format, and the $15 fee covers only the lunch and other costs incurred in enabling an open public invitation." Club officer Gilbert Freen told us the group routinely charges guests to cover the cost of the lunch served at its meetings. The Democrats, some union groups and others view this as outrageous. Citizen Action of Wisconsin says it is organizing buses to bring people to protest Ryan’s appearance. But politicians of all stripes regularly appear at such luncheons. For instance, on Aug. 23, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis) spoke to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. That event was not open to the public -- just to members and their guests, who paid $17.50 each. Numerous other politicians (including Ryan and Moore together in 2009) have appeared at Newsmaker Luncheons sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club. At those events, which are open to the public, a fee is charged -- for the lunch. Ryan’s office said the Whitnall club meeting was the only event the congressman had scheduled during the August break that involved a charge. We found two other paid events, one each from Ribble and Duffy. Ribble’s office said he participated in the Aug. 8 forum addressing regulation with two other local civic groups. "I believe it was at lunchtime and there was a cost for the lunch," said Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson. Duffy participated in one event -- an Aug. 18, 2011 small business forum at the University of Wisconsin-Superior -- where participants were charged $15 for lunch and materials. So, each of the three GOP congressmen singled out had at least one event where a fee was charged. But such appearances are routine tor politicians of both parties, the fee covered lunch and did not go to the congressman. The thrust of the statement, though, was broader still -- that the three were "shutting down" town hall meetings and thus the ability to talk to the elected official. Here’s what we found about the summer recess schedule for each when we asked aides, checked public schedules and looked at news accounts: Ryan: Toured various local businesses, held "multiple hour-long meetings" with small business owners, Realtors and home builders. In addition to the "telephone town hall meeting," attended the Walworth County Fair, a Boy Scout lunch and a 75th anniversary lunch for Kenosha Beef. Constituents could contact Ryan’s office for an appointment to meet with him in his office, said spokesman Conor Sweeney. Ryan was on vacation in Colorado for part of the month. Ribble: Held a three-hour "Conversations with your Congressman" on Aug. 13, 2011 -- 10 minute one-on-one meetings; attended an Aug. 12, 2011 forum on transportation; an Alzheimers Association public input session, and a forum with seniors about Medicare. Duffy: Like many House members with large districts, Duffy maintains a mobile office, and its schedule is listed prominently on the congressman’s web page. Duffy himself is on the bus some, but not all, of the time, said Brandon Moody, chief of staff. Moody said Duffy has spent the entire August break in his northern Wisconsin district. Including the town meeting in Wausau, he held a half dozen coffees and, yes, community town hall meetings. He also visited county fairs and toured area businesses. No fee was charged for any of these events, or for access to the congressman. Our conclusion: The state Democrats say that three Republican congressmen from Wisconsin are shutting down town hall meetings or making constituents pay to attend them. Yet all three had town hall meetings or participated in a forum -- in person, or by phone -- before the statement was made. And one, Duffy, participated in several town hall meetings. In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. What’s more, the party provided no evidence Ryan or the others were not available to constituents during the break. Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is "charging constituents" for access is far off the mark. The party’s claim is not only false, but ridiculously so.

pomt-10810	"When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent. Abortions went down 16 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/28/rudy-giuliani/thats-one-way-to-slice-the-numbers-there-are-other/	In early August, 2007, Rudy Giuliani announced he was making "12 Commitments to the American People," including a pledge to "increase adoptions, decrease abortions and protect the quality of life for our children." It's a point he has made before. During the May 3, 2007, Republican debate, he said this: "When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent; abortions went down 16 percent." Indeed, abortions in Gotham declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But his claims about adoptions are far less clear-cut. The campaign didn't offer any research showing that rising adoption rates cause lower abortion rates, and we couldn't find any, either. Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003. Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996. The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002. Giuliani arrives at his 65 to 70 percent increase by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after. That's one way to look at it, but it conceals some things. For instance, the chart shows that if you simply compare adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point made by our friends at FactCheck.org. Averaging the rates over two six-year blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces, campaign aides said. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. Then, the numbers leveled off. It's true, the aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins. More recently, Giuliani has used a much more flattering number than the one he started with. His staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions. So which number is it? Something's wrong if voters have to ask. When a statistic seems to go in so many directions, the best approach is an apples to apples one. For its abortion statistic, the Guiliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. So, he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, but he has inflated the adoption figures by getting too fancy with his math. We find his overall claim half-true. UPDATE: We've corrected the launch date for the Administration for Children's Services. We mistakenly said 2006 when we should have said 1996.

pomt-01052	"America is No. 1 in wind power."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/america-no-1-wind-power-obama-says/	President Barack Obama devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to talking up America’s energy trends, including being a leader in our own energy production. "We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet," he said. "And today, America is No. 1 in oil and gas. America is No. 1 in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008." We’ve covered oil and gas and solar power before, but the wind energy claim was new to us. Is the United States the global leader in producing that, as well, or is Obama just being a blowhard? Let’s get on the grid and find out. Clearing the air Obama has made renewable power sources a focus of his administration, and has effectively doubled the use of many "clean energy" methods, a large portion of which has been from wind. The U.S. Energy Department says that the nation’s capacity for generating energy from wind, in which wind moves a turbine to generate electricity to be used on the power grid, has increased from 25,410 megawatts in 2008 to 62,300 megawatts as of September 2014. This capacity growth was fueled in part to a federal production tax credit that expired at the end of 2014. There are still projects being built using the tax credit, so capacity is expected to keep growing. Many energy reports, however, generally say the United States trails China in its total wind energy capacity. The Global Wind Energy Council said in 2013 that China has the capacity to generate 91,412 megawatts. China also has outpaced the United States for wind-driven power installations. But that’s where we run into a headwind on the stats, because there’s a difference between capacity (what can be produced) and generation (what actually is produced). A Jan. 15, 2015, report by the American Wind Energy Association said the electrical energy actually being produced was currently greater in the United States than it was in China, and has been since 2008. The report said in 2013 the United States generated 167 billion kilowatt hours (a measure utility companies use to bill companies; a megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts), while China generated 138 billion kilowatt hours. Simon Mahan, renewable energy manager for the pro-renewable Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said there a many factors in determining the two different measurements, leading to discrepancies depending on how they’re recorded. A wind farm in America may be more efficient than one in China because the wind is better, for example, making more power even if the one in China has more turbines. The focus on installations is due in part to the fixed capital costs of building a wind farm, and full-year generation data isn’t available if, say, an installation opens in April, Mahan said. He compared capacity and generation to how a hybrid car’s gasoline tank is smaller than a truck’s, but both can go about the same distance because the hybrid is more efficient. Whether this difference lasts is up in the air. China has plans to build 150 gigawatts (that’s 150,000 megawatts) of capacity by 2017. in the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. had an additional 13,600 megawatts of capacity under construction, which would bump the States up to around 75,000 megawatts of capacity next year, with potential projects in the future. Determining if either country maxes out that capacity depends on factors that can only be predicted and not confirmed, Mahan said, although China has issues with how much its power grid can safely hold at one time. The International Energy Agency has predicted the demand for wind power in China is slowing, while the United States faces "policy uncertainty" that may affect wind power’s future here. Our ruling Obama said "America is No. 1 in wind power." China is actually the leader in the overall capacity for generating wind power. But the United States has overtaken China in terms of the actual amount of electricity wind power it generates. Both countries plan to continue to expand wind capacity -- China more than the United States -- but they also both face challenges to expanding capacity and generation. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12795	"The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/feb/16/travis-allen/examining-claim-about-oroville-dam-spillway/	Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed the Oroville Dam emergency in Northern California "was entirely avoidable." The Orange County lawmaker also blamed Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for the crisis. "The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville," Allen said in a press release on Feb. 13, 2017. Allen posted similar claims on Twitter and Facebook the same day. The problems at the Oroville dam are complex. And so is Allen’s claim. We’ll break his statement into parts and assess its overall accuracy. 1) The Oroville dam failure was "entirely avoidable." Let’s be clear: The dam itself hasn’t failed. But its main concrete spillway developed a gaping hole in early February 2017 that led officials to dial back water flows to avoid further damage. As stormwater and runoff continued to flow in, however, the reservoir overtopped its emergency spillway for the first time in its 48-year history. The emergency spillway includes a concrete lip at the top and wooded hillside below without concrete fortification. Rapid erosion took place on Feb. 12, 2017 as water rushed down that unprotected hillside, leading to fears of a major dam breach and forcing the evacuation of nearly 200,000 residents downriver. Authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation orders two days later, though concerns over the dam’s safety are expected to continue for months. Environmental groups warned in October 2005, when the dam was up for a federal license renewal before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that the emergency spillway needed to be armored with concrete to avoid a crisis such as the one that played out this week. And a November 2005 Sacramento Bee article quoted state water officials as saying "Our facilities, including the (emergency) spillway, are safe during any conceivable flood event." The issue of fortifying that hillside "was brought up in the FERC proceeding," Lester Snow, who was director of the state Department of Water Resources from 2004 through 2009, told PolitiFact California this week. "And I believe FERC, as well as DWR engineers, looked at that and did not consider it to be the kind of threat that it has turned out to be." "I guess (there’s) some credence," to the idea that the crisis was avoidable, Snow said. "(But) again, we would not have gotten there had it not had the surprising and dramatic failure of the (main) concrete gated spillway." The main spillway had passed federal and state inspections and those who manage it "saw nothing that would have predicted such a failure in the concrete chute," said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the Brown Administration’s Natural Resources Agency. 2) "California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014" California voters did, indeed, pass a $7.5 billion water bond known as Proposition 1 in 2014. It was approved at the height of the state’s severe drought with the goal of expanding California’s water storage capacity and improving water quality. It included $2.7 billion for new surface and groundwater storage projects. 3) "But Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 (from the bond) on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville." Again, there’s some truth in this part of Allen’s statement. But there’s also a lot of context missing. State officials said Oroville and other existing State Water Projects are not eligible for Proposition 1 money. Upkeep on the massive system of state reservoirs, dams and aqueducts is paid for by the 29 state water contractors who consume the water, including urban and agricultural water districts. Asked about using Proposition 1 money for Oroville, H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, said: "You couldn’t have done it if you wanted to." Allen’s additional claim that Brown hasn’t spent any of that bond money on new water storage is also problematic. A spokeswoman for Allen pointed to a state website that tracks Proposition 1 funding and shows none has been allocated for water storage projects. Brown Administration officials countered that Proposition 1 was not intended to pay for projects overnight. It was a forward-looking measure that aimed to expand and strengthen the state’s water system for future droughts. Vogel, of the state’s Natural Resources Agency, said Allen ignores the fact that "the storage funding section of the bond precluded any money being spent until December 15, 2016. Travis Allen should remember this since he voted for the water bond," in the Legislature. The bond passed the Assembly with support from all but two members. Voters then approved it during the November 2014 election. The state expects applications for new water storage projects to be submitted later this year. The California Water Commission plans to award early funding for storage projects in 2018, Vogel said. Our ruling Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed: "The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville." State officials say there was no indication of problems with the dam’s main spillway, which developed a huge hole this week as officials released large amounts of water from the dam. Officials did, however, have warnings about the integrity of the dam’s emergency spillway, which experienced rapid erosion this week, triggering mass evacuations below the dam. Environmental groups warned in 2005 that the emergency spillway needed to be reinforced. Given those warnings, there’s some truth to Allen’s claim that the crisis could have been avoided. But there’s no evidence, at this point, that state officials knew the dam’s main spillway was in jeopardy, something Allen does not point out. Allen’s other assertion that Gov. Jerry Brown hasn't spent a single dollar from the state’s recent $7.5 billion water bond on Oroville also doesn’t tell the whole story. That dam, and all others along the State Water Project, are ineligible for those funds. Allen's additional claim that the state has yet to spend bond money on new water storage projects, ignores the fact that that money was precluded from being spent until December 2016. There’s no doubt there’s been a massive failure at Oroville. But Allen doesn’t prove the emergency was "entirely avoidable," particularly given the restrictions on state water bond money. Allen’s statement includes some aspect of truth. Overall, however, it overflows with misleading claims, ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression.

pomt-14228	About "1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/about-1-gun-sellers-responsible-more-half-guns-use/	When Hillary Clinton brought her presidential campaign to Milwaukee’s Tabernacle Community Baptist Church on March 29, 2016, she participated in a forum on gun violence with U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, and others. The Democratic front runner spoke softly as she recounted a number of fatal firearms encounters, in Milwaukee and across the country. Then she raised her voice as she presented some of her gun control policy proposals. And she made a claim that we want to check about guns used in crimes. "The availability of guns has gone way too far. And the fact that gun-makers and -sellers are immune from liability …. Gwen will talk about what we need to do to stop some of these gun sellers," Clinton said. "About, what, 1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes. So, we've got our work cut out for us. But let's not grow weary doing good, because in due time we will harvest if we stay focused." We found there is some truth in Clinton’s 1 percent claim, but several significant caveats. Old data Experts told us the latest federal report that gets at Clinton’s claim, from 2000, is from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Relying on gun tracing data, the report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. So, Clinton’s claim might generally appear correct in terms of the figures. But there are a few things to tease out. 1. Clinton made her claim in the present tense and is relying on the latest, best data available -- but that data is 18 years old. The experts told us that ever since federal law was changed in 2003, tracing data has essentially dried up. That was when Congress approved the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, named for its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan. It forbids the ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with state and local police agencies except in the course of a criminal investigation. The change "greatly restricted" the release of crime gun trace data by the ATF, restricted access by researchers and plaintiff trial attorneys, and restricted what reports the ATF could issue themselves, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 2. Clinton’s claim was about "guns used in crimes," while the 2000 report referred to "crime guns." There’s a slight difference. Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway, who does research on firearms, told us that most any gun seized by police is considered a crime gun. That would include, of course, seized guns that were used in crimes, but also guns found by police that couldn’t be traced to particular crimes. 3. In referring to the 1 percent of gun dealers, Clinton said they were "responsible" for more than half of the guns used in crimes. But that doesn’t mean a gun used in a crime came directly from the dealer. Hemenway said that authorities trace crime guns to their original seller, but can’t necessarily determine whether other transactions of the gun were made prior to it being used in a crime. In other words, it’s possible to trace a crime gun to the store that originally sold it, but that gun might have changed hands any number of times -- legally or illegally -- before it was used in a crime. On the other hand, said Webster, gun dealers "are one of the most important, if not the most important, conduit for guns into the underground market." So, there is rationale for targeting gun sellers linked to crime guns to prevent, for example, purchases by a straw buyer -- a person who legally purchases a gun in order to turns it over to someone who cannot legally purchase one. (Tracing helped establish that a suburban Milwaukee gun store was a top seller of crime guns locally for more than a decade.) Our rating Clinton said about "1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes." The best data essentially backs up the claim, but it is from 1998. It’s also worth noting that the traces go back to the original seller of a crime gun and don’t take into account whether there were other transactions before a particular gun was used in a crime. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information -- our definition of Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-15T10:00:00	2016-03-29	['None']

pomt-06411	On using Gov. Scott Walker’s collective-bargaining limits to help balance the city of Milwaukee budget	no flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/27/tom-barrett/using-gov-scott-walkers-collective-bargaining-limi/	When Republican Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his controversial curbs on collective bargaining, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett blasted away. Milwaukee, Barrett said, could get health and pension concessions from public employees at the bargaining table without "attacking" workers’ rights and trying to "obliterate" people. The mayor, who ran against Walker in the 2010 election, backed the decision by Senate Democrats to flee to Illinois to block a quorum on Walker’s bill. Eight months later, the Democratic mayor took advantage of a key plank in Walker’s bill to help save millions on health insurance costs and balance the city budget without having to negotiate with city unions. In the past, the city would have had to negotiate such a change. Not after Walker’s move. As the Milwaukee Common Council considers Barrett’s budget proposal, and some in labor launch barbs at him, it seems like a good time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. First, our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter measures whether a political figure has changed positions. It does not evaluate whether any move is good politics or good policy. Some will see a change as being open to new ideas, others as political pandering. Now, a brief history lesson: On Feb. 11, 2011, Walker introduced what became Act 10, the historic budget-repair bill that required state employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions, as part of his move to take away most collective bargaining rights from most public workers. Protesters flocked to Madison and occupied the Capitol rotunda for weeks. The bill also extended the state-employee benefit cuts to local municipalities and schools by taking health and pension out of bargaining for most unions at the local level as well. The law requires local communities whose employees are in the state health plan for local governments to move to start charging employees 12 percent toward health care premiums. Milwaukee is not in that plan, so it was free to set whatever level of cost sharing it wanted. These "tools," Walker said, would help local governments make up for the big cuts in local education and municipal aid he proposed March 1, 2011, to close a $3 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget. So, did Barrett change his position by using one of the "tools" that the bill handed to local governments? We reviewed Barrett’s public statements and actions as recorded in dozens of news stories, speeches and press conferences in 2011. Barrett immediately started a nuanced two-step dance in his public statements -- objecting to some parts of the proposal while saying other parts were necessary. Let’s start with whether Barrett’s rhetoric was consistent, before comparing his deeds to his words. The approach toward unions: Barrett, who was supported by nearly all public unions except police and fire in the 2010 governor’s race, made clear he thought Walker overreached with some of Act 10 in ways that Barrett saw as union busting. Walker wanted to make it harder for unions to collect dues and remain certified, as well as eliminate nearly all collective bargaining -- moves that some said would shrink unions into irrelevance or put them out of business. Walker was messing with "the fundamental right to organize," Barrett said within days of Walker’s February announcement. "It’s an ideological war to try to crush labor," Barrett said a few weeks later when interviewed on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show on March 7, 2011. Barrett didn’t specify which of the bill’s provisions he felt crossed the line into union busting. But he made clear he believed he could have used the "rough and tumble" of collective bargaining with unions to get concessions similar to what Walker wanted. Impact on city budget: Barrett predicted that Milwaukee’s budget would come out a big loser due to the aid cuts in Walker’s two-year budget. He said in March that the combination of aid cuts, rising expenses, a levy freeze and exempting public safety workers from benefit changes "just makes our structural deficit explode." Walker said just the opposite, and he was right: By August, city estimates showed a potential gain of at least $11 million from the two separate state budget bills. Most of the savings, the Journal Sentinel reported in August, could come from health care benefit changes that Barrett didn't have to negotiate with unions -- thanks to Walker’s changes. So we saw Barrett criticizing the bill in pretty stark terms -- inaccurately in one case. But he liked some of it, and even wanted more. Here’s where this gets interesting. Paying more: The mayor -- early and often -- said public employees would have to pay more, needed to pay more, and the public wanted them to pay more. It’s notable that Barrett said that even before the big public unions publicly said they would swallow Walker’s financial demands if he dropped the limits on bargaining. With an eye on solving his own budget problems, Barrett said Feb. 22, 2011, that he’d support city employees paying the same higher contributions as state workers. He even credited Walker for paving the way by getting a "mandate" in his election win for raising state pension and health contributions. And the mayor sought to push state lawmakers to go even further than Walker, who had proposed exempting public safety unions from the collective bargaining limits. He called on lawmakers to subject police and fire unions to the same bargaining limits as other public employee unions so the sacrifice could be shared among all workers. Barrett minced no words. He said the law enforcement retirement and health benefits were "Cadillac." The mayor went further. As the standoff with AWOL Democrats continued over Walker’s bill, Barrett called Feb. 24, 2011, for an "alternative" to Walker’s bill. Specifically, he said the GOP should set aside the sharp limits on union bargaining and just vote on requiring the benefits changes. As the Journal Sentinel reported, Barrett would "impose the health care and pension changes and extend those changes to all public employees, leaving the rest of the budget-repair bill's provisions for separate debate later." He also asked Republican lawmakers to require city of Milwaukee workers to pay 12 percent of their health premiums -- just as Walker was proposing for state employees and some municipal workers not in Milwaukee. Mandate the benefits changes at a specific level? That would mean having the state dictate what amount Milwaukee workers should pay. That’s a far cry from local collective bargaining and would have taken away some flexibility on letting some communities decide what to impose. Was Barrett sending out mixed signals -- criticizing excessive excessive limits on collective bargaining, while he endorsed scrapping them for health care, one of the biggest-ticket items? Barrett told us his statements were not meant to endorse limits on health care bargaining. When we asked how else his proposal would have imposed greater health contributions on local workers, he said he was only trying to goad GOP legislators and Walker into a separate vote on the limits. Enough with the words. Now let’s look at Barrett’s deeds in summer and fall of 2011, when it came time to decide whether to use the "tools." In September 2011, as he prepared his budget proposal, Barrett was free to impose more health-care cost sharing because the GOP had removed it as a mandatory subject of bargaining by the budget-repair bill. He did so, at basically the same level as the bill required for state employees (12 percent). It was a big key to balancing his budget while avoiding major cuts. He also followed through on his promise to get the police and fire unions -- with whom he still has to bargain -- to agree or to consider paying more towards health insurance. He also offered them a wage increase for 2012. Police supervisors and firefighters ratified the deal; rank and file police rejected it. Barrett shied away from crediting Walker, citing the city’s past success getting employee unions to agree to pay more. This sequence of events rubbed the city’s biggest labor union the wrong way. Barrett gave "lip service" to opposing Walker’s bill but then exploited it," says Rich Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48. And Marty Beil, head of the biggest state employee union, said labor would not back Barrett in a possible recall election because there’s no difference between Barrett and the governor. Said Abelson: "If you don’t want to screw your employees, don’t screw your employees." Barrett told us he was just dealing with reality. He felt it was either eliminate 300-400 city jobs and trim key services due to the state budget’s cuts -- or use the help Walker provided. "It’s a real world issue," he said. So where does it land on the Flip-O-Meter? Abelson calls Barrett’s actions opportunistic. We see some irony here, and a heavy does of Realpolitik. But Barrett made very clear early on that he wanted the same concessions Walker was seeking -- and applied to a broader group. So it’s not really a surprise that ultimately he grabbed the chance once he and other Dems lost the battle over the union-power items. And while his messages on the union power issues crossed wires at times, his statements from the start signalled he was willing to be seen as ready to impose benefits changes. The union’s disgust over Barrett’s position underscores that. The Flip-O-Meter defines a No Flip as "no substantial change in position." That fits the bill here.

pomt-00786	Seventy percent of Americans "don't have a college degree."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/08/rick-santorum/70-americans-dont-have-college-degree-rick-santoru/	Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republican Party is not offering enough for America’s workers. The former senator from Pennsylvania said Republicans need to improve in reaching out to these voters on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. "I think people are looking for someone to bring us together. And I put a book out last year called Blue Collar Conservatives, and it's the whole idea that we have to start bringing those who are being left behind by this economy. We have to give them an opportunity to be able to reach that American dream again. And I think Republicans, frankly, have been very weak on that," Santorum said. After mentioning that Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, did not do a great job in reaching out to the working class, Santorum added: "I think there's a lot of folks who are very disenchanted with both political parties because neither party is really talking about them and really saying what's the way forward for the 70 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree but, you know, want economic opportunity like everybody else and nobody's talking about that." We wondered whether Santorum is correct that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We checked with Santorum’s staff of his organization Patriot Voices, and they sent us an article from Vox about Scott Walker’s lack of a college diploma. The reporter argues that not having a college degree does not really matter since "most Americans — nearly 70 percent — don't have a bachelor's degree, either." The article doesn’t give a source for its number. We decided to look for data about educational attainment from the U.S. Census Bureau; we found 2014 data (the most recent available) on the U.S. population by age, race and gender. We focused on the age group of 25 years and over, because most American students graduate by the time they turn 25. According to census data, 209.3 million people in the United States are 25 years old or older, and 66.9 million have a bachelor’s degree or higher (such as a master’s, professional or doctoral degree). That means about 68 percent of them do not have a bachelor’s degree. If we include people who have an academic associate degree -- about 11.7 million people -- the percentage of people without a degree declines slightly, to 62 percent. The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics looked at the same question in a 2014 longitudinal study that followed young people to age 27. It found that by that age, 72 percent of respondents did not have bachelor's degrees. Our ruling In making the point that Republicans need to reach out to the working class more, Santorum said that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We found several measures that are close to the number Santorum cited. Overall, we rate his claim True. Correction, Apr. 14, 2015: We rated this statement True, but due to a production error, we initially published our fact-check with a logo that mistakenly indicated that we had rated it Mostly True. We have fixed that logo. In addition, we have updated the math from our original version to include people who have a higher degree above a bachelor’s. The new data doesn’t change the rating, which remains True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2015-04-08T10:00:00	2015-04-05	['United_States']
pomt-04126	Says a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jan/08/rick-scott/rick-scott-ignores-flaws-state-study-says-medicaid/	Gov. Rick Scott is using a questionable state "study" as evidence that the federal health care law will cost the state billions of additional dollars. In an guest editorial written for the Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, and again on Monday during a Washington, D.C., press conference, Scott cited a state analysis that says the health care law would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over the next 10 years. The money would be needed, Scott says, to pay for expanding Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor. "As you know Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration put out their estimate of what the expansion would cost just for Florida taxpayers and it's over $26 billion," Scott told Washington reporters after meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Don’t believe that number. In this case, the Agency for Health Care Administration -- an agency Scott directs -- did indeed release a presentation that concluded that Florida taxpayers would be asked to pay $25.8 billion over 10 years to implement an expansion of the Medicaid system. But the state study relies on questionable or downright misleading assumptions to reach its eye-popping figure. We can’t say what the cost will be to the state -- and if there will even be one. Outside groups such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, have estimated the additional cost to the state would be a little more than $1 billion between 2013 and 2022. The state figure, however, ignores a fundamental component of the health care law -- namely that the federal government will pay for most of the expansion. This requires a little bit of explanation, so bear with us. One of the key components of the new federal law, and one of the components that Scott and Republicans particularly dislike, is that most Americans will be required to have some form of health insurance or pay a penalty. As a result, the federal government wants to expand Medicaid coverage to cover more Americans who are poor. States, which manage Medicaid, can decide whether to expand the program or not, but to make the option enticing, the federal government offered to pick up most of the costs to cover more people. Over the past 20 years, the federal government has paid for about 58 percent of the costs for current Medicaid recipients. Under the expansion, the government would pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years (2014-16). In 2017, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. Why is this breakdown so important? Because the state study ignores it completely. The state study calculates the cost of the expansion based on the federal government paying for only about 58 percent of the costs. Also, the most recent cost estimate from the state -- which was published in December -- includes revisions that only add to the theoretical state bill, according to our analysis. Among them: • In a January 2012 report, the state assumed people who are now eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled would slowly transition into the health care program over a period of three years. In the most recent report, the state said they would all enter Medicaid immediately. • Similarly, the January 2012 report concluded that just 40 percent of newly eligible Medicaid recipients would enter the system in 2014. By December 2012, the number had been revised up to 60 percent. It’s hard to quantify the dollar impact on any one change based on the information provided by the state in its estimates. When we asked for details on these assumptions, Michelle Dahnke, a spokesperson for the Agency for Health Care Administration, said the state simply wanted to be as cautious as possible with its estimates. But state officials were aware that the estimates were off even as Scott repeated the numbers in Washington, according to emails obtained by Carol Gentry of Health News Florida, part of WUSF Media. The Health News Florida report noted that J. Eric Pridgeon, on the staff of the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned the study almost immediately. On Dec. 20, three days after the study was released, Pridgeon wrote state agency officials saying that the federal revenues for Medicaid expansion are part of the Affordable Care Act and cannot be omitted. In response to criticism of the estimates, Scott spokesperson Melissa Sellers issued a statement defending them but noting, "Others have asked AHCA to use different assumptions to calculate different cost estimates. We look forward to reviewing those cost estimates as well." The inflated estimates seem to be part of a pattern. Last summer, Scott claimed a Medicaid expansion would cost $1.9 billion a year. PolitiFact Florida looked into that number at the time and concluded that the estimate "appears to be wildly high." We rated his statement False. Our ruling There is no doubt that Medicaid represents a significant part of the state’s budget, and that any plan to expand the system -- no matter how much the federal government pays for -- could include additional costs to the state. But rather than have a fact-based discussion about the state’s responsibilities when it comes to health care, it appears that Scott and his staff are making strange assumptions to make the estimates higher than they actually will be. This is also a case where Scott cannot simply hide behind the fact that he is accurately citing a "study." His office directed the analysis, and it was notified that the assumptions were questionable. Scott gets a pass on one thing: The cost to expand Medicaid is largely unknown. But using a study to say that the expansion of Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers "over $26 billion" is False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-01-08T18:09:22	2013-01-07	['None']

pomt-10716	"If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-number-crunchers-crunch-hillary-accurately/	Attempting to portray Hillary Clinton as a big spender, the Republican National Committee recently unveiled a "Spend-O-Meter" to tally up Clinton's policy proposals. "If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term," the RNC says on its Web site, where the meter is prominently featured. Putting the RNC's Spend-O-Meter to the Truth-O-Meter test, we find the Republicans are doing a reasonably good job of accounting for Clinton's spending proposals. In 19 out of 24 examples cited by the RNC, the Spend-O-Meter correctly explained Clinton's proposals. However, in one case, the RNC includes $80-billion baby bond proposal that Clinton quickly dropped after talking about it. Since Clinton never formally proposed the idea, you can subtract $80-billion from the $777.6-billion. We realize the RNC had to make some assumptions to keep the arithmetic simple. For instance, their calculations assume that each program becomes law at the very start of Clinton's first term, allowing the Spend-O-Meter to add things up over four full years. Of course, it can't really happen that way, but for purposes of keeping tabs on the cost of Clinton's proposals it's within reason. It's also true that the RNC doesn't note that some of Clinton's proposals, already in legislation in Congress, have drawn the support of some Republicans. Still, as gimmicks go, this one stays close enough to the facts to rate a Mostly True.

pomt-08513	"Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-tones-down-rhetoric-not-attacks-new-a/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is continuing his pointed attacks against Republican opponent Daniel Webster, and Webster's stance on women's issues. Only this time, he's ditching the lines about religious fanaticism and the comparisons to the Taliban. Grayson, a Democrat from Orlando, caught flak for airing an ad that compared Webster's beliefs to those of the Taliban, and for distorting Webster's words in a speech Webster gave to a Christian group. Grayson played clips in a 30-second ad called "Taliban Dan Webster" that showed Webster saying wives should submit to their husbands. But an unedited clip of the speech showed that Webster was in fact telling husbands to love their wives. The distortion, which earned a False rating from PolitiFact Florida, gave Webster's campaign national attention (including tweets of support from Sarah Palin) and helped him raise more than $100,000 in 48 hours, his campaign said. In response, Grayson released a toned-down version of the "Taliban Dan" ad on Oct. 6, 2010, called "The Facts." Gone are the terrorists holding machine guns, the people burning American flags and the women wearing burqas. Also gone are references to religious fanaticism, Iran and the Bible. (Gone, too, we found, is the "Taliban Dan Webster" ad from Grayson's YouTube website. The video is now marked private.) Here's a transcript of the new ad: Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record: Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child. Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. In another item, we're analyzing the claim that Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. In this fact check, we'll focus on the first "Fact" -- that Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. It's a slightly different take on a claim in the first ad when Grayson claimed that Webster "wants to make divorce illegal," even for abused women. Both claims track back to a piece of legislation Webster introduced as a member of the state House in 1990. That year, Webster authored HB 1585, a bill that "creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery." Florida law then and now allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is "irretrievably broken." It's a common standard throughout the country, often called no-fault divorce. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Webster's legislation sought to make getting a divorce more difficult, at least for couples that voluntarily entered the covenant marriage. Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring: "I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me." Once a couple agreed to a covenant marriage, the only way they could get a divorce is for adultery. That means physical or sexual abuse was not grounds for a divorce. Webster's legislation went nowhere in Florida -- Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote -- but it did help launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide. Three states -- Louisiana, Arkansas and Arizona -- adopted a version of Webster's law, though the laws on the books in those states were all less restrictive than what Webster proposed in Florida, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. In his first ad, "Taliban Dan Webster," Grayson said that Webster "wants to make divorce illegal," even for abused women. But as our research proves, Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. Rather it would make divorce more difficult, but not impossible, for couples who chose to form a covenant marriage. Even couples who chose Webster's form of covenant marriage had a small window out for adultery. We rated Grayson's original claim Half True. It appears the Grayson campaign listened. In his new ad, "The Facts," Grayson says "Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships." In 1990, Webster sponsored HB 1585, which would create a new form of marriage called covenant marriage. If women agreed to form a covenant marriage, they would not be allowed to divorce because of physical or sexual abuse. The only out under Webster's legislation was adultery.

pomt-09568	"President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' but on his watch, non-defense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-spending-has-grown-67-percent-obamas-/	One of the most reliable Republican attacks on President Barack Obama has been that he and his allies in Congress are spending too much of the taxpayers' money. In his live-blogging response to Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, criticized Obama's handling of the federal budget by playing off Obama's proposed freeze on domestic spending. "President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' " Boehner wrote, "but on his watch, nondefense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone." Analyzing the accuracy of this comment requires an immersion in budget wonkery. Specifically, determining whether Boehner is right depends heavily on whether you are talking about "budget authority" or "outlays." When Congress approves budget authority, it confers the right to spend money for a certain purpose. But for various reasons, that money may not be spent during the fiscal year when it is authorized. For instance, a given program may take longer than expected to get up and running, employees may not be hired immediately, or, most commonly, lawmakers may intend for the spending to be made in subsequent years. The actual money spent in a given year is referred to as "outlays." Let's look at the the various ways to calculate the numbers that Boehner cited. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in fiscal year 2008 -- the last year under President George W. Bush -- was $494 billion. (Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated on an annual basis by Congress, while mandatory spending -- a separate category -- includes required programs such as Social Security, as well as interest on the federal debt.) The budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in 2009 -- including budget authority from the 2009 stimulus bill -- was $803 billion. That's an increase of about 63 percent -- quite close to what Boehner's blog post suggested. But not all the budget authority conveyed by the stimulus bill was exercised in 2009. In fact, of the $268 billion in budget authority conveyed for 2009, only about $35 billion was actually spent in 2009, or roughly 13 percent of the total budget authority. So if you remove from the calculations the unspent budget authority from the stimulus -- sticking instead to the nondefense discretionary outlays in both the regular budget and the stimulus -- the increase from 2008 to 2009 was 11.3 percent. That's quite a bit less than what was suggested by Boehner's blog post. "It's very misleading," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He said Boehner essentially took more than one year's expenditures and counted them in a single year. We talked to Boehner's office, and staffers acknowledged that the congressman's phrasing could have been more accurate. But they maintained that their larger point holds. "Congressional Democrats voted to increase spending by 67 percent," Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. "That’s the way the American people understand it. You can quibble about the arcana of budget wonk terminology, but they voted to spend the money, and we’re very comfortable using that figure." Boehner gets some outside backup. Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that calculating budget authority is not totally out of left field. It's a "measure of congressional intent," he said. But because Boehner wrote that nondefense spending "has spiraled out of control," to use numbers that refer to budget authority are, at best, misleading. In this case, the difference between those two methods isn't trivial, thanks to the unusual circumstances of a massive, multiyear spending bill being passed in 2009. In essence, calculating it Boehner's way turns a comparatively modest spending increase into a whopping one. For that reason, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10476	"He's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security..."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/barack-obama/not-the-same-old-bush-plan/	In remarks at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 14, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama took a shot at Sen. John McCain's plans for Social Security. "He's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security — a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush." The truth is, so far McCain isn't promising much of anything concrete when it comes to Social Security. While on the campaign trail, he has hammered at the need for "straight talk" about a system that is going broke, but he has been short on details about what he would do, except to say that with bipartisan negotiations he thinks he can fix the program's projected bankruptcy in 2041 without raising taxes. McCain's campaign Web site states that McCain supports "supplementing" the current Social Security system with personal investment accounts — "but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept." This approach appears to rule out a plan like the previous Bush plan, which would have diverted some Social Security payroll taxes to fund private investment accounts controlled by individual workers. That's a bit of a change for McCain, who in his presidential bid in 2000 proposed an option for workers to invest at least 20 percent of their Social Security payroll taxes in private accounts. In 2005, McCain stumped alongside President Bush when Bush pitched a plan to let workers born after 1950 to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds. In exchange, workers would have had to accept a cut in the traditional Social Security benefit. This time around, McCain is staying fairly vague about details of his plans. In a Q&A; with the Wall Street Journal , published on March 3, 2008, McCain was asked why he had changed his plan from one that would use some payroll taxes to create Social Security private accounts to one that talks about accounts as "supplements" to Social Security. "Actually," McCain responded, "I'm totally in favor of personal savings accounts and I think they are an important opportunity for young workers." McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told the Wall Street Journal in March 2008 that "McCain intends to keep Social Security solvent by reducing the growth in benefits over the coming decades to match projected growth in payroll tax revenues. Among the options are extending the retirement age to 68 and reducing cost-of-living adjustments, but the campaign hasn't made any final decisions yet." John Rother, policy director at AARP, said he, too, has spoken with Holtz-Eakin and understands McCain's plan to be "sort of an in-between system" compared to his earlier efforts. "I think there's a lot of unresolved questions," Rother said. "It's not clear how he plans to fund the 401(k) program or how everyone would take advantage of it. I am hoping Sen. McCain will have a chance to define things better going forward." There's a lot we don't know about how McCain would deal with the financial problems in Social Security, but we know enough to say that Obama's statement that McCain's plan is the same as the Bush plan isn't accurate. Obama's statement suggests that McCain would entirely supplant the Social Security system with private investment accounts, but the Republican's campaign statements so far talk about using private accounts to "supplement" Social Security benefits. For these reasons, we rate Obama's characterization of McCain's plans to reform Social Security as False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-16T00:00:00	2008-04-14	['None']
pomt-06393	Says state Senate President Stephen "Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/31/americans-prosperity-new-jersey/conservative-group-claims-steve-sweeney-gave-new-j/	A conservative organization’s ad campaign paints a group of New Jersey Democrats as President Barack Obama’s minions -- and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney is among them. The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched last week a series of radio and television spots targeting incumbent legislators battling for re-election on Nov. 8. An ad criticizing Sweeney claims the South Jersey Democrat’s "Obama-style policies" are responsible for high unemployment in the state. "How? Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs. Sweeney backs cap and trade and raising electric rates, which will drive out more jobs. And Sweeney backs Obama’s job-destroying government health care plan and Obama's failed stimulus schemes," the ad says. High taxes. Fewer jobs. We’ve heard -- and checked -- similar claims before, but never specifically on income tax rates. So, did Sweeney give New Jersey the nation's highest income tax rate, driving jobs out of state? Sweeney took office as a state Senator in 2002. Since then, New Jersey has never had the the highest income tax rate in the nation. The state Legislature increased the top income tax rate in 2004 and 2009. Sweeney voted for both measures, but he’s just one vote among many and the governor signed both bills. In 2004, New Jersey’s top income tax rate went from 6.37 percent on those making more than $75,000 to 8.97 percent on those making more than $500,000 with the so-called "millionaires’ tax." Several other states, including California, Montana and Vermont, all had higher income tax rates that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. In 2009, the state’s top income tax rate increased to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million. Even then, Hawaii and Oregon had slightly larger top income tax rates of 11 percent. The tax expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year. He has tried twice since then to reinstate the "millionaires’ tax," but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed both measures. Steve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, argued that all taxes, whether they are sales taxes or property taxes, "conspire to be a tax of everyone’s income." But the ad clearly says New Jersey has the "nation's highest income tax rate," while showing a photo of a New Jersey residential income tax form. So, on that point, the ad is wrong. But are New Jersey’s income tax rates responsible for job loss? Lonegan referred to a Tax Foundation study that ranked New Jersey as the worst in the nation for state and local tax burdens. And according to the tax research group, the Garden State ranks number one in that category. But when it comes to the destruction of jobs, taxes may be one factor, but they aren’t the only factor. "Everything matters," said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. "But taxes also matter." Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the argument that increasing the top income tax rates discourages people from taking risks and starting businesses "really overstates the effect of the tax rates. There are a lot of other factors that come into play." Those factors, according to Alt, include: the level of education in the state, how close the business is to its market and suppliers, who the business is selling to and the overall cost of doing business in the state. Our ruling The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic incumbents running for re-election. One television spot said, "Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs." During Sweeney’s tenure the top income tax rate in New Jersey increased twice. Neither of those tax hikes bumped New Jersey into the top spot in the nation for income taxes -- and you can’t solely blame Sweeney for either increase. And the ad’s larger point that high incomes tax rates decreased jobs is overstated. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12943	"In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, 'Hey, we should get all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' "	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/08/cory-booker/booker-mcconnell-full-ethics-review-obama-nominees/	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advocated for thorough vetting of President Barack Obama’s cabinet nominees, but he seems to have a different standard for President-elect Donald Trump’s, suggested New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on CBS’ Face the Nation. The Republican-controlled Senate will hold several confirmation hearings for the week of Jan. 10, frustrating Democrats like Booker who say the jam-packed schedule was a move to deflect public attention from Trump’s more controversial nominees. But back "in 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, ‘Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.’ I just was reviewing his letter this morning," Booker said Jan. 8, emphasizing that rigorous review is perhaps more important for Trump’s nominees given their wealth, international business ties and potential conflicts of interest. Is Booker right that McConnell advocated for complete ethical review for Obama’s appointees before holding confirmation hearings? Booker’s claim is accurate, though it may be a bit premature to charge McConnell with hypocrisy. The confirmation process All cabinet-level positions as well as scores of senior-level personnel for executive branch agencies must be confirmed by the Senate. (Those who don’t have to be confirmed are positions that solely advise the president.) First, the president or president-elect selects, vets and submits nominations to the appropriate Senate committees. Then the committees typically hold investigations (using information provided by the White House and their own research) and hearings (for public debate over the nomination). Finally, after review, they report the nominations to the full Senate for a vote on the floor. According to the Congressional Research Service, the clearance stage includes submitting financial disclosure forms, completing background checks and signing ethics agreements that identify and outline ways to mitigate conflicts of interest, reviewed and certified by the Office of Government Ethic. This typically occurs before the nominations are submitted to the Senate. The rules for confirmation vary by committee. All review a nominee’s biographical resume and some set of disclosure forms. Some also consult FBI background checks. Again, this information gathering often happens before a hearing, but is more often required before a vote. In a letter released by Senate Democrats, the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, expressed concern that several of Trump’s nominees with scheduled hearings have yet to complete the ethics review process as of Jan. 6, 2017. "I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review," Shaub wrote. "In fact, OGE has not received even the initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings." Out of the Trump picks with confirmation hearings scheduled, ethics forms have been submitted for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, defense secretary nominee James Mattis and transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao, according to the Associated Press. It’s unclear if forms have been submitted for CIA director nominee Rep. Mike Pompeo, homeland security secretary nominee Gen. John Kelly, and housing secretary nominee Ben Carson. Forms have not been submitted for education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos or commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. McConnell’s letter Experts agreed with Booker’s characterization of McConnell’s letter, sent to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dated Feb. 12, 2009. "Prior to considering any time agreements on the floor on any nominee," McConnell wrote, ranking members expect eight ethical standards to be met. Among them: a completed FBI background check, a completed Office of Government Ethics letter, completed financial disclosure statements (and tax returns where they apply) and a completed committee questionnaires submitted to the respective Senate committees "prior to a hearing being noticed." In layman’s terms, McConnell not only required for "completion of disclosures but also review prior to floor consideration," said Wayne Steger, a political science professor at DePaul University and the author of A Citizen’s Guide to Presidential Nominations. "The ethics review process had to be complete before he would agree to set aside the right to filibuster nominations," said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert on Senate procedure. Booker’s office also referred us to a 2009 Roll Call article on McConnell’s letter. "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday threatened to filibuster any of President Barack Obama’s executive branch nominations if they do not meet what he deemed a series of ‘standards’ for installment," the article reads (full version here). McConnell’s office, meanwhile, argued that Booker mischaracterized the letter. McConnell’s communications director David Popp pointed out that by the time McConnell sent letter on Feb. 12, the Senate had already held hearings for everyone Obama nominated. This is accurate, and all but one of the 13 nominees was confirmed before Feb. 12. "If you read the letter, it simply calls for continuing the best practices and precedents of the Senate — it does not ask for new preconditions the way Sen. Booker and other Democrats are now doing, such as calling for the tax returns of all nominees, rather than only in those committees that regularly request returns," he said. Appearing right before Booker on Face the Nation, McConnell dismissed concerns from Democrats as sour grapes disguised as "little procedural complaints" and emphasized the need to get Trump’s national security team up and running on day one. He suggested his ethical standards hadn’t changed and said there is still time to comply. After all, "we are still in the process of getting the papers in. I think at least five of the nominees have all of their papers in," he said. "The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor." The ruling Booker said, "In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, 'Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' " McConnell wrote a letter on Feb. 12, 2009 that advocated for completion of disclosure forms before hearings and as a condition of floor consideration. But most of the the people Obama nominated by the time of McConnell's letter had already been approved. We rate Booker’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08263	"We're the only system of federalism in the world."	false	/florida/statements/2010/nov/10/pam-bondi/defending-health-care-suit-new-florida-ag-says-uni/	Pam Bondi, Florida's next attorney general, already is delivering on a campaign promise to keep fighting the new federal health care law. Bondi, a Republican elected with almost 55 percent of the vote, appeared on On The Record with Greta Van Susteren on Nov. 9, 2010, to discuss how she was taking over the suit from outgoing Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum. Bondi said she was prepared to argue the case and that she attended the first round of oral arguments in Pensacola. Van Susteren then asked Bondi if she had examined election results across the country to target other states that might now be willing to join the legal challenge. Nineteen states already have signed onto Florida's suit, and Van Susteren wanted to know whether it would matter if a majority of states could be roped in as well. "Well, and it does (matter)," Bondi said. "And I mean, we're the only system of federalism in the world. And I think what this does, if we -- and we are going to have a majority of the states joining in. And I think it's going to vindicate our Constitution and what our Founding Fathers believed that our system should be made of." Bondi went on to say that she hopes the states of Oklahoma, Ohio and Kansas will join the lawsuit, as could Wisconsin, Wyoming, Maine, and maybe even California. "If you look at the whole board game, we could have a total of 28 states joining in this lawsuit," Bondi said. The lawsuit filed in Florida argues that the federal government cannot impose taxes or financial penalties on someone who fails to have health insurance. In this fact check, we're not going to analyze how many states will join the challenge to the health care law. Instead, we want to examine Bondi's statement that the United States is the only country in the world with a federalist system -- a system where sovereignty is constitutionally split between at least two levels of government. And, put another way, where states can have greater power than the national government. The basic principle of federalism originates in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791, which says: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." James Madison helped explain the delegation of powers between the states and the federal government in The Federalist Papers. "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined," Madison wrote in 1788 in The Federalist No. 45 under the pseudonym Publius. "Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite." Is the United States the only country in the world where the power to govern is shared between a central government and provinces or states? Hardly, experts we talked to said. "Our neighbors Canada and Mexico would find this declaration rather surprising, given that both systems are federal systems of government, with states or provinces sharing specific and separate authority over different areas of policy," said Christopher Reenock, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. Reenock pointed to at least 19 other countries that have a federalist form of government, including Germany, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Russia, Brazil, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. "Given that there are around 195 countries in the world, it is certainly true that federalist systems are in the minority, comprising only about 10 percent of those countries," Reenock said. "But one would have to stretch (the) data quite a bit to declare that the U.S. is the only system of federalism in the world." Carl Steiren, an expert with the Forum of Federations, said that his organization considers 25 countries around the world to have a federalist system, and that nearly 40 percent of the world's population lives in a federal country. You can see the list here. Steiren described the Forum of Federations, which is based in Canada, as an international organization that brings together people from different federal countries to share best practices and horror stories, in order to emulate the former and avoid the latter. Its board of directors includes policy makers and diplomats from Canada, Europe and Africa. "Pam Bondi is not correct in saying 'We're the only system of federalism in the world,' unless she qualifies it by adding something else, such as 'that has 50 states,' " Steiren said. Steiren said the United States is widely considered to have created the first federal system, but it's far from the only. Switzerland, for instance, decentralizes many of the functions of government among its 26 cantons. And Australia copied much of its federal system from the United States. "We must not lose sight of the essential condition that this is to be a federation of States and not a single government," said Australian founding father Samuel Griffith in 1891. Sounds a bit like Madison, huh? Griffith continued: "The separate States are to continue as autonomous bodies, surrendering only so much of their power as is necessary to the establishment of a general government to do for them collectively what they cannot do individually for themselves, and which they cannot do as a collective body for themselves." We reached out to Bondi, who acknowledged the mistake. "Pam intended to say that we have the 'oldest' system of federalism, not that ours is the 'only' one," said Carlos Muniz, the executive director of Bondi's transition team. "For her, the relevance of this point is that federalism -- the U.S. Constitution's clear delineation of powers between the federal and state governments -- has always been a fundamental aspect of our Constitution and of our national heritage. Completely apart from any policy-based disagreements with the federal healthcare law, Pam is committed to Florida's lawsuit precisely because she sees it as necessary to preserve our federalist system of government." Appearing on Fox News, Bondi got off track in discussing a legal challenge to the federal health care law by saying the United States has the "only system of federalism in the world." The United States may have been the first, but it's far from the only. We rate this statement False.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-11-10T15:56:39	2010-11-09	['None']

pomt-13298	Says a tweet he sent out "wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just ‘take a look at" the background of Alicia Machado.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-early-morning-sex-tape-tweet/	During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump took issue with moderator Anderson Cooper’s description of an early morning tweet he had sent out about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Machado emerged up as an issue in the campaign during the first debate, when Hillary Clinton cited Machado’s allegations that Trump had called the Venezuela-born contestant "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeping" after she’d gained weight as Miss Universe. At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant. The next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview. And Trump eventually brought the feud to Twitter. In the second debate on Oct. 9, Cooper cited the tweet in a question about whether Trump has the right temperament to be president. "In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape," Cooper said. "Is that the discipline of a good president?" Trump responded, "No, it wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just ‘take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout.’ " Maybe that’s what Trump wanted people to read into it. But he did, in fact, direct his followers to check out a sex tape. In the tweet -- sent at 5:30 a.m. ET on Sept. 30 -- Trump wrote, "Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?" (For the record, no one has turned up a sex tape.) Our ruling Trump said the tweet he sent out "wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape’" but rather to "just take a look at" Machado’s background. That’s ridiculous. While Trump did urge his Twitter followers to check out Machado’s "past," he literally wrote "check out sex tape" in the tweet.

The narrator of a Steve Adler TV ad says that as an Austin City Council member, Mike Martinez "has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors." That statement is made against this visual backdrop: Source: TV ad from Steve Adler, Austin mayoral candidate, "Mike Martinez Record on City Council," posted online Dec. 2, 2014. Martinez has been a council member since June 2006. So it’s no surprise he would have had a say on taxes and rates charged by the city-owned utilities, though unsaid here is that no single council member controls any such decisions; it’s been a seven-member body, including the mayor. Martinez also chairs the eight-person board overseeing Capital Metro, which provides local bus and limited rail service. So he could have voted on fares charged the elderly. Let’s recap Martinez’s actions on fares, city taxes and utility rates. Bus fares To our inquiries, Adler’s campaign didn’t provide comprehensive backup for his ad claim. But by email, spokesman Jim Wick pointed out a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news story stating the Cap Metro board voted to require bus riders 65 and older to pay 50 cents a ride or $15 for a 31-day bus pass, starting in 2011. The story also said the board was deciding to charge seniors and people with disabilities to ride buses for the first time since 1989. For Capital Metro, spokeswoman Francine Pares told us by email Martinez has been a board member since June 2007 and chairman since January 2010. Pares also confirmed the board’s decision to charge the 50-cent fares, though she said that change was adopted at the board’s November 2010 gathering, which Martinez didn’t attend, she said. According to minutes of the Nov. 10, 2010, board meeting, the six members who were there unanimously approved a resolution authorizing higher fares in part, the resolution said, to generate additional operating revenues "while striving to meet growing demand for transportation options." Martinez and another board member were recorded as absent. Pares told us the board in September 2013 approved another increase in senior fares, to 60 cents, effective in 2015. Generally, she said, senior citizens receive 50 percent off regular fares. By phone, Martinez agreed he and fellow board members agreed to charge the fares for elderly residents. But that happened, he said, only after a state panel issued "marching orders" including a recommendation calling for Capital Metro to raise more money from fares. In a 2010 report, the staff of the Sunset Advisory Commission recommended the authority charge a bus fare of 50 cents for groups currently riding free. The commission had said 30 percent of Capital Metro’s passengers were riding for free and, it noted, the board had rejected proposed fares in 2008 and 2009. In its final July 2011 report on Capital Metro, the commission said: "While fare increases are difficult, requiring only a portion of its ridership to bear the burden of these increases is not equitable or sustainable, especially in bad financial times." Martinez pointed out the sunset review occurred in keeping with legislation passed into law by the 2009 Legislature, which wanted Capital Metro to get its finances in order. City taxes On taxes, Wick of Adler’s camp offered as backup news stories indicating that in 2009, Martinez said taxpayers would have to pay "a little more" in taxes and fees through 2010 to maintain services and in 2010, the council acting to raise the city’s property tax rate from 42.09 cents per $100 of property value to 45.71 cents; the city tax on a median value home was expected to increase $52 to $843. Wick followed up by emailing us a chart made by Adler’s campaign indicating city property taxes on a median-valued home going up on Martinez’s watch. For a non-campaign analysis, we turned to the Travis Central Appraisal District; the chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, emailed us a chart indicating city property taxes on a median-value homestead in 2007 were $715; in 2014, the comparable figure was $1,014. We converted the 2007 figure to 2014 dollars, using a federal inflation calculator. Upshot: Adjusted for inflation, city taxes on a median-value Austin homestead went up $278, or 34 percent, from 2007 through 2014, Martinez’s council years. Over those years, according to the district, the median taxable value of an Austin homestead went from $177,257 to $228,032. Adjusting for inflation suggests there was a nearly $18,800, 9 percent, increase. Martinez agreed property owners paid more in taxes in his council tenure, results influenced by surging property values, he said. Still, he said, in five of eight years, council members voted to keep the city’s property tax rate the same or to lower it. When the rate was raised, he said, the economy was in recession. For another fact check, the city provided this chart of tax rates, which shows the council raised the rate three times in Martinez’s tenure, most recently for 2013, but cut the rate four times, most recently for 2014. In September 2014, the council left the 2014 rate intact for 2015. Utility rates In 2011, we found Mostly True a claim that Austin Energy, the city electric utility, was considering its first hike in rates since 1994. The base electric rate, covering staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, hadn’t changed since 1994. Meantime, residential customers were paying less for electricity than they once had, taking inflation into account. On June 7, 2012, the council unanimously voted to raise the base rate, the American-Statesman reported. The news story said: "The complicated new rate structure will hit customers in different ways; generally speaking, the larger and more energy-hungry the home, the higher the percentage increase," effective October 2012. "A typical home, which uses an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month over the course of a year, will see its monthly bill rise by $8, to $113, according to Austin Energy calculations. A home that uses a lot of electricity would see its monthly bill increase by $59, to $332," the story said. How would Adler have voted? We asked Wick how Adler would have voted on the bus fares, tax and utility rate hikes we confirmed. There’s no simple answer, Wick said by email, but Adler favors free fares for senior citizens. Our ruling Mike "Martinez has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors." Austin residents pay more in taxes and could be paying more for electricity thanks to council actions Martinez supported. He also backed a decision by the Capital Metro board to charge half fares to elderly bus riders who had previously not been charged, though Martinez hardly did this by himself; it’s worth clarifying, too, that Capital Metro was under pressure to improve its finances and that Martinez missed the vote creating the then-50-cent fare.

pomt-09552	"Thomas Jefferson created the Marines for the Islamic pirates that were happening."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/03/glenn-beck/beck-claims-marines-were-created-thomas-jefferson-/	On his Fox News program on Jan. 29, 2010, Glenn Beck was providing a history lesson on progressives in U.S. politics when he made the point that the difference between progressives and the Founding Fathers is that the founders thought the United States "should be Switzerland. We should stay out of everybody's business, be friends with everybody." "I mean, if you're going to mess with us, we're going to pound you," Beck said. "Thomas Jefferson created the Marines for the Islamic pirates that were happening, right?" One of the panelists on the show agreed with him, and Beck continued: "And so they didn't take any guff. But they weren't spreading democracy. Progressives spread democracy and gooey goodness." We wondered, was the U.S. Marines Corps really created by Jefferson to combat the Islamic terrorists of yesteryear? Our first call was to Charles P. Neimeyer, director of the History Division, U.S. Marine Corps in Quantico, Va. The Marine Corps annually marks its birthday on Nov. 10, to commemorate the day in 1775 that the Continental Congress formally adopted a resolution founding the Continental Marines, Neimeyer said. During the Revolutionary War, Marines fought with distinction. On March 3, 1776, 200 Marines spearheaded the first American landing on foreign soil, an assault in the Bahamas. So that's why, if you go the Marine Corps' History Web site, you'll see the banner, "Since 1775, the Marine Corps has been winning battles and defending our nation." Obviously, that predates Thomas Jefferson's presidency. It also happens to predate the United States of America. After the Revolutionary War, the Navy and Marines disbanded. The country essentially did without a Navy (and Marines) until the Naval Act of 1794, which called for the construction of six frigates, which were to include a force of Marines. Why was the Navy re-established? A couple reasons. According to Marine Corps scholars, one of the principal reasons was that Barbary "corsairs" were harassing and attacking American ships doing trade at Mediterranean ports. The corsairs were essentially North African pirates, and they were Muslims. The Washington Post wrote an interesting story about some of the historical parallels between then and now. So Beck is correct about that. But Beck is wrong on one important detail. The Marines weren't created by Jefferson. And as it turned out, the conflict with Barbary pirates wasn't the impetus behind finally getting the Marine Corps established. A temporary lull in the Barbary conflict delayed implementation of the Naval Act. But in 1797, a new conflict arose on the high seas -- with France. Tensions with France rose during the naval war between France and Britain, with France interfering with a number of American merchant ships. And on July 11, 1798, President John Adams (not Jefferson) signed legislation formally creating the U.S. Marine Corps to help deal with the French. And, in fact, the Marine Corps did participate prominently in the short-lived undeclared "Quasi-War" with France. After the fighting with France, the conflict with Barbary pirates flared up again. Under Jefferson, the Marine Corps was employed in numerous operations against the pirates and the north African countries that sponsored them. Famously, Marines led an overland assault and captured the city of Derna in Tripoli in 1805 (hence the line in the Marines' Hymn, "the shores of Tripoli"). We think the spirit of Beck's claim is largely accurate, that the threat of Barbary corsairs -- or as Beck accurately calls them, Islamic pirates -- inspired Congress to move toward re-establishing a Marine Corps. It turned out that a conflict with France actually kicked that proposal into gear, and Beck named the wrong president (though he was only off by one administration). And so we give his statement a Half True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-02-03T18:21:32	2010-01-29	['Islam']

pomt-07060	"The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/29/michael-doherty/sen-mike-doherty-says-minority-new-jersey-income-e/	It’s a statistic long touted in New Jersey to demonstrate the tax-paying discrepancy among residents: A very small percentage of New Jersey’s top income earners pay about 40 percent of New Jersey’s income taxes. In recent months the statistic has been cited in arguments about whether to reinstate the so-called millionaire’s tax, and state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) mentioned it in a May 24 guest editorial in The Star-Ledger. In explaining New Jersey’s progressive income tax, Doherty described how he wants an equal amount of money spent on educating every New Jersey child, regardless of need. HIs column came in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling that New Jersey must give an additional $500 million to the state’s 31 low-income – or Abbott – districts. "In 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax to provide sufficient funding for our public schools," Doherty wrote. "After the income tax is collected, it is distributed to towns as school aid. New Jersey’s income tax rate is very progressive. The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing." Doherty added in his column that New Jersey’s progressive tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents: those who earn more pay more, those who earn less pay less – one reason why those at the lower end of the income scale aren’t paying as much in income taxes. PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statistic and found Doherty’s claim to be true. Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, confirmed Doherty’s math for us. "The senator’s statement is indeed accurate," Pratt said in a June 2 email. "In some years the number is a little higher than 40 percent, in others a bit lower. But historically, it’s been around 40 percent." Pratt pointed to 2009 as a good example of Doherty’s statistic. "The total take from the gross income tax was $9.135 billion," Pratt wrote. "The take from the top 1 percent of filers (both resident and non-resident) was $3.715 billion or about 40.7 percent. Note that, historically, half of the top 1 percent make more than a million (dollars)." Steve Lonegan, state director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans For Prosperity, which leans conservative, also backs up Doherty’s numbers. He blasts the state’s progressive income tax structure as making New Jersey bad for business and a reason why the state has highest tax burden in the country. "It’s worse than not a good thing," Lonegan said of the state’s progressive tax structure. "It’s a destructive thing. It’s based on the whole concept of the people who have the votes can take from those who can’t." A flat, or flatter tax in New Jersey, would improve the economic scales for all, said Lonegan, also a former mayor of Bogota in Bergen County. Mark Robyn, an economist with the pro-business Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, told PolitiFact New Jersey that there are other states that have even higher progressive tax rate structures than New Jersey: Hawaii, California and Oregon, among them. "There are states with higher marginal tax rates, but whether that relates to a greater reliance on the top 1 percent (of income earners), it’s hard to say," Robyn told us. Robyn also noted that New Jersey ranks number one in total state and local tax burden by percentage of income for 2009, the most recent year that data is available. Returning to Doherty’s statement, let’s review. The senator said the top 1 percent of income earners in New Jersey pay 40 percent of all state income taxes and those at the bottom pay little or nothing. The state Treasury Department and two conservative-leaning organizations back up that claim, noting that the Garden State’s progressive income tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents by requiring those who earn more to pay more. A liberal-leaning organization notes that looking at all taxes, not just income tax, would show the impact of New Jersey’s tax structure on its residents. We rate Doherty’s statement True.

pomt-15055	On the main GOP presidential debate: "Not one candidate on the debate stage has military experience … "	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/28/jim-gilmore/gilmore-says-gop-prime-time-presidential-debators-/	Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was not in a charitable mood Sept. 16 when he watched from afar as his 15 major rivals for the Republican presidential nomination debated on CNN. Gilmore was excluded because his polling numbers did not meet the 1 percent threshold for participation. He viewed the action from his campaign office in Alexandria -- first, the 90-minute "undercard" debate between the bottom four candidates, and then the three-hour main event among the top 11 that drew about 22.9 million viewers. Gilmore live-tweeted through it all, accusing his colleagues of misunderstanding issues, ducking questions and exhibiting facial expressions that were unpresidential. And then, there was this tweet, made during the 11-candidate debate: "Not one candidate on the stage has military experience, and it shows," Gilmore wrote. We decided to check whether any of the prime-time debaters ever wore the uniform. Gilmore, it should be noted, has served in the military. Faced with a low draft number when he graduated from the University of Virginia in 1971, he enlisted in the Army for three years and served in the intelligence corps at NATO headquarters in Germany -- an experience he usually mentions in citing his qualifications for the White House. He rose to the rank of sergeant. As for the 11 debaters, we pored through biographies on their campaign websites and a variety of other authoritative sources for their resumes and backgrounds. No evidence of military service turned up for any of them. Three were old enough to be drafted during the Vietnam War -- Donald Trump, Ben Carson and John Kasich -- but managed to avoid conscription during an era when many college students received deferments from military service and draft numbers were determined by lottery drawings of birth dates. The draft effectively ended in December 1972, and the U.S. shifted to an all-volunteer military, but none of the candidates claims to have stepped forward either in the active military or the reserves. Participating in the main debate -- in addition to three candidates mentioned above -- were Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker (who since has dropped out of the race). The B Team What about the four Republicans who participated in the undercard debate? Although they were not included in Gilmore’s statement, we thought it would be interesting also to look at their records. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., served as an Air Force prosecutor from 1982 to 1988 and then spent 27 years as a reservist, first in the South Carolina Air National Guard and then transferring to the Air Reserve. Graham, who was not deployed for combat, retired as a colonel in June. His three debate partners -- Bobby Jindal, George Pataki and Rick Santorum -- list no military service in their resumes. The Democrats While we’re on the subject, let’s look at the military records of the five most prominent Democratic candidates. Nothing is listed for four of them: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee. Former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia served in the Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, including a 13-month stint as a rifle platoon and company commander in Vietnam. Webb, a recipient of the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts, achieved the rank of captain. Our ruling While watching the main GOP presidential debate, Gilmore tweeted, "Not one candidate on the stage has military experience … " We rate his statement True.

pomt-14926	"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/30/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-has-cheapest-public-college-/	During a discussion about student debt at the CNBC Republican presidential debate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich talked about bringing down college costs, prompting Jeb Bush to chime in about the low cost of tuition in Florida. "We don't need the federal government to be involved in this, because when they do, we create a $1.2 trillion debt," said the former Florida governor during the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. "In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John (Kasich) said. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't indebt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs." We wanted to know: Does Florida hold the No. 1 spot for lowest in-state college tuition? Comparison of in-state tuition Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said that when Bush left office in 2007, Florida had the lowest in-state tuition for a public four-year university among the 50 states. The data from the College Board bears that out: It was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-07. But during the debate, Bush didn’t say he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor — he made it sound like he was talking in the present tense, so we looked at that data, too. The College Board publishes an annual comparison of in-state tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide, comprised of survey data from almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions. The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment. For 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the sixth-lowest, although four of the states were only between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida. "Florida is one of the most affordable states for public university tuition," said Ralph Aiello, who supervises college counselors for Broward County public schools in Florida. The College Board produces a similar report comparing tuition for two-year degrees which showed that Florida was again on the low end but not at the cheapest spot in 2014-15. "There are a number of reasons for the wide variation in published tuition and fees by state — state tuition philosophy, aid policy, economic conditions, and funding for higher education," said Jennifer Ma, the College Board’s policy research scientist. "For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest published tuition and fees for the public four-year sector in 2014-15, does not have a state grant aid program and has the lowest state appropriations on a per-student basis." Bush specifically mentioned "tuition," but we’ll note that there are a lot of factors than influence the ultimate price tag for students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid and room and board. Our ruling Bush said, "In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state." That’s not accurate if we look at 2014-15 tuition for four-year public universities compiled by the College Board. That data shows Wyoming had the lowest tuition followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth-lowest. Bush’s campaign said he was referring to Florida’s ranking as the lowest in 2006-07 when he left office, but he didn’t specify that timeframe during the debate. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-02397	Every child in Colorado who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/11/allen-peake/lawmaker-studies-show-medical-marijuana-reduces-se/	An important debate is ongoing in the Georgia Legislature concerning the use of a form of medical marijuana to treat certain forms of seizures. The state’s House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Bill 885, which would allow for the use of medical research cannabis in specific cases. The bill’s supporters are anxiously hoping the Georgia Senate will adopt the legislation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s new Legislative Navigator gives it a 27 percent chance of passing this session. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, offered what appeared to be a persuasive argument to support the legislation. "(In Colorado), 100 percent of children have seen diminished seizure activity," Peake told fellow House members in the discussion before the bill was passed. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Peake’s statement was correct. Peake and other leading House Republicans did not plan to advocate this session on legislation that involves medical marijuana, particularly in an election year. Peake said he was persuaded to get involved after meeting a 4-year-old girl from his area named Haleigh Cox who suffers from a severe seizure disorder. Peake said he received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that has attempted to provide care to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions through the use of medicinal cannabis oil. Some Georgians have moved to Colorado to seek treatment for their children. Peake clarified his statement, saying that it was actually 98 percent of patients who had diminished seizure activity. Marijuana contains about 60 chemical components called cannabinoids. The cannabinoid that the bill’s proponents are considering is cannabidiol. It would be ingested and not smoked, the bill’s supporters say. It would not include THC, which is the element in cannabis that causes smokers to get high. The form of cannabidiol used at the Realm of Caring is named Charlotte’s Web, after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition is credited to the substance. Charlotte’s Web is a rich amber and as thick as cold honey. It smells like marijuana and tastes like raw plants. A month’s supply of the oil can cost $150 to $250, and some families say they receive financial help from nonprofit groups. Heather Jackson, the executive director of the Realm of Caring Foundation, said Peake was correct that every patient studied in the first set of tests, "harvests" is the term she used, had a reduction in seizures. The Realm of Caring is in its second harvest and has seen less than a handful of nonresponders, which accounts for Peake’s revised 98 percent total. The New York Times, though, reported in December that there is "scattered medical research" to substantiate claims cannabis oils helped reduce seizures, citing a 2012 study on the American Epilepsy Society’s website. Other researchers have also cautioned there is not enough research on its medicinal benefits. The American Epilepsy Society wants "well-controlled studies" it believes will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of cannabidiol and other forms of medical marijuana on epilepsy patients. Amy Brooks-Kayal, a Colorado-based neurology physician who is first vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, said there’s not enough information to determine what the dosage should be or how it interacts with other medicines. The AES, which claims about 3,500 members, said although cannabidiol offers hope, these are only anecdotal reports. Robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana, it said, is lacking. "There haven’t been good studies with cannabidiol with children with epilepsy," Brooks-Kayal said. The federal Food and Drug Administration has authorized trials of an established British drug, Epidolex, that comes from marijuana. Some experts who believe Epidolex is a better option say it’s unclear whether Charlotte’s Web is free of potentially harmful impurities. Jackson offered us two studies in defense of the treatment. In one study, all 11 children studied showed a reduction in weekly motor-type seizures, the study concluded. After three months, five of the 11 children were seizure-free, the study found. The paper, introduced at the American Epilepsy Society’s annual meeting in December, acknowledged the sample size was small. In the other study, two Stanford University researchers asked parents whose children were using cannabidiol to fill out a survey detailing its impact on their children. Sixteen of the 19 parents reported reduced seizure frequency. Three parents said their children were free of seizures. The most often reported side effects were better mood, increased alertness, better sleep and drowsiness. Common side effects with other forms of treatment were not found, the parents said. Jackson said 13 of those 19 parents had children who were using Charlotte’s Web. Jackson said they are doing more research. Jackson, whose son has used the treatment, said in the cases in which Charlotte’s Web did not result in fewer seizures for the patient, "there is less than a 1 percent chance that a child in this intractable epilepsy population will find one that will work." Charlotte’s Web, she said, has performed better than other forms of treatment. "There is not a treatment in the world that will work for all," Jackson told us. "However, it is important to note that there is not a pharmaceutical in the world that works for even 5 percent of the epilepsy population. So the numbers are quite staggering actually." Peake said he was not deterred by questions or concerns about the research. "The anecdotal evidence is so strong that a parent, in conjunction with their doctor, should have the personal choice to make that decision," Peake said. To sum up, Peake said "every child in Colorado" who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity. Peake then said it’s actually 98 percent, citing newer data. There are very few studies out there. They do show medical marijuana has a positive impact on seizure activity. But not at the levels Peake said. His statement is partially accurate. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate it Half True.

pomt-13187	"Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-exaggerates-saying-donald-trump-pl/	Donald Trump may be the highest-profile tweeter in political history, but Hillary Clinton isn’t averse to attacking her opponent via Twitter, either. On Oct. 23, Clinton's campaign account tweeted, "Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people. How do you even begin to quantify that?" Attached to the tweet was a short video that offered a comparison of how many sports stadiums would be needed to accommodate 16 million people. (Spoiler alert: It’s larger than the number of pro sports stadiums in the United States -- by a lot.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But how accurate is Clinton’s statement that Trump "says he'd deport 16 million people"? That’s less clear. For starters, we’ll note that Trump has not used the 16 million figure himself in referring to the number of deportations he would oversee as president. Indeed, the Trump campaign tells PolitiFact that they consider the 16 million number to be incorrect. "Mr. Trump’s plan does not call for deporting 16 million," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. "It says we will deal with those who are not priorities at a later date." So where does it come from? We’ve looked at this issue in an earlier fact-check of a statement by Tim Kaine. The 16 million tally includes two groups of people: those who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center). Combined, that’s not quite 16 million, but it’s reasonably close. However, even Trump in recent months has backed away from policies that would make the 11 million figure accurate -- and the evidence for the additional 4.5 million figure is in question, too. Let’s take a closer look. The 11 million figure Complicating this fact-check is that Trump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign. Leading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but "they have to go." In a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. "If they've done well, they're going out, and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way," Trump said. In November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, "How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?" "You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it," Trump responded. In that same interview, he said, "you’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely." All of this suggests that Trump did want to deport 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. But that was the old version of Trump’s plan. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump refined his immigration plan a year later, in a major speech on Aug. 31 in Arizona. In that 10-point speech, he reiterated get tough measures, but he also suggested not everyone would be deported. Trump started by talking about criminals, saying there would be "zero tolerance for criminal aliens." He said his administration would begin moving them out "Day One," working especially with police and law enforcement who "know who these people are." His fifth point centered on the enforcement of all immigration laws. The Clinton campaign highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton’s debate comments. "In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country." But Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech. He said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported ("subject to deportation"), they won’t all be deported. Put it all together and you have evidence from a year ago that Trump would deport the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally, but less support for that conclusion in his more recent comments. That’s a problem for Clinton’s tweet, which said that Trump "says" -- present tense -- that "he'd deport 16 million people" The 4.5 million figure It’s only possible to get near 16 million if you include the deportation of people who were born in the United States to parents who were in the country illegally. What has Trump said about that? Some background: The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship says "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." That clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents’ immigration status. Trump hasn’t talked about birthright citizenship and "anchor babies" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November 2015, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents. "You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment," Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. "But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years." Trump also said several times in 2015 that he does not think citizenship should have been granted to people with undocumented parents. The Clinton campaign points to an August 2015 exchange between Trump and host Bill O'Reilly, who asked, "Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here. If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?" Trump answered, "We have no choice. I'm sorry, Bill. We have to bring them out." Trump's responses to similar questions were also vague. In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he said undocumented parents would have to leave and unless they were "bad" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them. And in a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Aug. 25, 2016, Trump was asked, "No birthright citizenship, correct?" Trump replied, "Right." Trump’s campaign has not clarified his current position on birthright citizenship. His call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump’s campaign website. But even if it were accurate to say that Trump supports a change in birthright citizenship -- something he has not been consistent about -- he would still need to to strip citizenship from those who already have it, and then deport them. And that would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment. "Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively," David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law, previously told PolitiFact. So, getting to 16 million requires believing that, first, Trump supports revoking birthright citizenship for those who already have it; second, that he could enact it despite substantial constitutional hurdles; and third, that he would then proceed to deport all 4.5 people who fall into that category. That’s a lot of what-ifs. Our ruling Clinton tweeted, "Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people." While Trump has certainly offered his share of hard-line stances on immigration, Clinton’s comment exaggerates his position in several ways. First, Trump didn’t use the 16 million figure himself. Second, while Clinton phrases her tweet in the present tense, her case is weaker now than it would have been a year ago, based on what Trump has said and posted on his website in recent months. Finally, counting the last 4.5 million people needed to get within shouting distance of Clinton’s 16 million figure requires an unlikely cascade of events that Trump’s campaign today says he isn’t seeking to set off.

pomt-11403	Says Michael Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/23/rebecca-dallet/rebecca-dallet-says-michael-screnock-imposed-8-mon/	Less than two weeks before the April 3, 2018, election for Wisconsin Supreme Court, the candidate backed by liberals attacked the candidate backed by conservatives in something of an unexpected way: As being lenient in two sex crime cases. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet made the attack against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock in a TV ad released March 19, 2018. Dallet alleges in the ad that Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence." Let’s review both cases. Child predator claim The first case referenced in the ad involves Axel R. Conrad of Wisconsin Dells. He was charged in February 2015 with felony repeated sexual assault of the same child, according to online court records. The incidents occurred over roughly a two-year period starting when Conrad was 17 and the victim was 14. Conrad pleaded no contest to the charge and Screnock sentenced him to five years of probation. In a written statement, the girl told Screnock before the sentencing that she agreed with the probation sentence and said: "I knew what I was doing. I was a willing participant." An important point to note is that the prosecutor and the defense attorney agreed with the probation recommendation of the probation department, although judges are not bound by such recommendations. We’ll also note that the use of the "predator" in the ad can be understood as an older person preying on a younger person, but this was not a case involving a violent sex offender, according to state law. So, it’s correct to say Screnock didn’t sentence Conrad to any "time" -- as in, time behind bars -- though Conrad was put on probation. Rapist claim The other case involved Aldo Eder Ruiz-Velazquez of Sauk City. He was initially charged in March 2016 with third-degree sexual assault, a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 10 years; and with sex with a child age 16 or older, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. In a plea bargain, Ruiz-Velazquez, who was 24 at the time he was charged, pleaded no contest to fourth-degree sexual assault of a child, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. That charge is defined as having sexual contact with a person without the consent of that person. Screnock sentenced Ruiz-Velazquez to two years of probation, including eight months in jail, nearly the maximum time of nine months in jail allowed on the reduced charge. According to a Baraboo News-Republic news article, two underage females said Ruiz-Velazquez bought alcohol for them and took them to a house where they drank together. One of the girls, who was 16, told police that when she went to the bathroom, Ruiz-Velazquez followed her inside and locked the door and had sex with her, even though she repeatedly told him no. The article said the prosecutor agreed to reduce the felony to the misdemeanor in exchange for Ruiz-Velazquez pleading no contest to that charge. The prosecutor and the defense attorney recommended the sentence that Screnock ultimately imposed, the article said. It was unclear whether the victim would have been willing to testify in a trial. According to the news article, the prosecutor said the sentence balanced the victim’s wishes with the needs of society. Screnock, the article said, said that while the charge was serious, the need to protect the public was minimal because Ruiz-Velazquez did not have a history of prior criminal activity. So, the sentence in this case was eight months, but that was nearly the maximum allowed by law under the plea bargain that had been made. Our rating Dallet says Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence." In the first case, an older male teen repeatedly had sex with a younger female teen, who told authorities the relationship was consensual. He was sentenced to five years of probation, but no time behind bars. In the second case, a 16-year-old said a 24-year-old man forced her to have intercourse and he was sentenced two years of probation, including eight months in jail, after pleading no contest to a reduced sexual assault charge. The maximum possible jail sentence for the misdemeanor, the result of a plea bargain, was nine months. We rate Dallet’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-04538	Says it will cost $220 per square foot in hard construction costs to rebuild Portland Public high schools.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/29/our-portland-our-schools/what-estimated-square-foot-cost-rebuild-portland-h/	In May 2011, Portland voters narrowly rejected a $548 million construction bond measure for Portland Public Schools. Voters said they felt shut out of the process; they wanted more say and oversight. Also, a news analysis by The Oregonian at the time reported that the school rebuilds would be among the costliest in Oregon. The analysis showed the district had budgeted $325 a square foot to renovate six urban schools. The school board tried again. This time, members said they had heard the people’s cry for greater transparency and fiscal diligence. So they put a $482 million bond measureon the November ballot. The overall size is smaller, at $1.10 a year for every $1,000 of assessed property value for the early years, versus $2 in 2011. This bond will pay to modernize three high schools and build one K-8 school, plus improve science classrooms and add seismic and roof upgrades at dozens more. School construction costs are $278 million of the $482 million, for four schools; last time costs were about $330 million of $548 million, for nine schools. In an attempt to assure voters that the district is on the up and up, supporters of Measure 26-144 have posted on their website the answers to two questions that every voter wants to know. How much will this measure cost me? And how do I know the district will spend my money wisely to rebuild these schools? Question: How much will the rebuilds cost per square foot? Answer: The district estimates $208 per square foot in hard costs to rebuild elementary grade schools and $220 per square foot for the high schools. This is the mid-range for Portland Metro hard costs.Read the project estimating method for yourself. A school campaign opponent asked us to check out the claim. We obliged, thinking voters would want to know as well. Because, really, what the heck is a hard cost? The campaign openly links to the sheet we’ll be referencing to give you the skinny on costs. The "project estimating method" link on the website states that mid-point "hard construction" costs are indeed $208 a square foot for K-8 and $220 a square foot for high schools. (The calculations are by Rider Levett Bucknall, an international firm that estimates costs.) But hard construction costs, you see, are only a portion of the picture. There’s also on-site improvement "hard" costs estimated at $8 a square foot. That’s money to demolish and mitigate for hazardous materials, and to build walkways, outdoor learning space, storm drains, lighting, etc. There are "soft" costs for architecture work, engineering, planning, design, permitting and project management. These are estimated at an added 20 percent of hard costs. Let’s not forget contingency costs, which the district estimates at an added 15 percent of both "hard" and "soft" costs for complete renovations and 10 percent for new construction. And, finally, you can’t really run a school without "furniture, fixtures and equipment." Those costs are estimated at $12 a square foot, although the model warns us that numbers can vary. So what does this mean, as applied to these schools? Because as much as we’d like for the chief campaign backers to do the math for us, they haven’t. We requested and received school lot and building sizes from the district, because those aren’t posted either. We’ll skip the K-8 school and stick to the three high schools. (Roosevelt, by the way, is calculated at $190 a square foot for capacity reasons we won’t get into.) Here are the basics: Grant High School is 275,000 square feet, lot size is 444,000 square feet, estimated $95 million. Franklin is 240,000 square feet, lot size 797,000 square feet, estimated at $85 million. Roosevelt is 229,000 square feet, lot size 745,000 square feet, estimated at $70 million. And here are the numbers: school hard ($$) hard onsite soft contingency FFE cost/SF Grant $ 60.5 M $3.6 M $12.8 M $11.5 M $3.3 M $333 Franklin $ 52.8 M $6.4 M $11.8 M $10.7 M $2.9 M $353 Roosevelt $ 43.5 M $6 M $9.9 M $8.9 M $2.7 M $310 Those numbers are markedly different from $220. In fact, we’ll do more math for you. Grant’s $333 a square foot is 51 percent more than the stated $220 per square foot of "hard" construction costs. We asked the "Our Portland, Our Schools" campaign why not include an overall -- and higher -- figure as well. Spokeswoman Lindsey O’Brien said "hard costs" were closest to estimated construction costs so that’s what they posted. "The most important thing to us is the link to the full document, which goes through everything in detail," she said. It’s great that the campaign posted relevant information on its website. And apparently, it’s perfectly acceptable to compare "hard" construction costs within the industry. But breaking it down like that does little to help the average voter understand what it would cost per square foot to rebuild these historic high schools. And that was the question the campaign purportedly tried to answer. As we finished our reporting, we noticed that the campaign had added language to its website after our initial inquiry regarding hard costs: "Total project costs include hard costs (bricks, mortar, labor), soft costs (plans, permits), a contingency factor based on standard practice, and the contents needed to make a new building usable by students and staff." It would have been shorter -- and clearer -- to write that the total square footage price for Roosevelt High School is $310, for Grant $333, and for Franklin $353. Again, we turned to the campaign spokeswoman. Didn’t the school district say that this time, the construction bond measure would be leaner, meaner, more cost efficient and disciplined? It is, O’Brien said via email. Overall spending is lower, as well as the assessed rate for property owners. In other words, the district is not doing as much as in 2011. "We have not been arguing that the costs per square foot are different," she wrote. (By the way, Jim Owens with Portland Public Schools, who is in charge of the projects and has extensive experience in public construction and finance and who helped us with the details, said total square footage costs are reasonable and he didn’t think the square footage costs were too high in 2011 either.) Well, then. To our ruling: The campaign diligently uses the term "hard costs" to relay that square footage costs are estimated by the district at $220 per square foot. The campaign states repeatedly that these are "hard" costs, links to a way to get a more complete estimate, and now spells out to voters that other costs are required to make the new building "usable by students and staff." A statement can be accurate, but miss the mark on communicating the complete picture. In this case, total square footage price is estimated to be between $310 to $353 for the three high schools. Those numbers are a significant upgrade from the stated $220, and, guess what -- they are in the ballpark of the original square footage costs in the district’s first attempt at a bond. We decline for the time being to weigh in on the "reasonableness" of the hard costs or final costs. What we can say is that the difference amounts to a pretty important detail missing from the statement. We rule the statement Half True.

pomt-09900	The Obama administration offered "$900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/14/republican-national-committee-republican/RNC-poll-Hamas-Gaza/	The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the "2009 Obama Agenda Survey" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions. But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions. We decided to fact-check two "questions" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean. One is an allegation that the Obama administration has ordered a new initiative that requires FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield. We deal with that one in another Truth-O-Meter ruling . Here, we address the GOP question, "Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?" As you can see, built into the "question" is a statement of fact, that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza. During a trip to Egypt in early March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States intends to provide $900 million for humanitarian, economic and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people. Here's how that money would be split: $200 million to the Palestinian Authority to address part of its 2009 budget shortfall; $400 million "to help the Palestinian Authority solidify economic and institutional reforms in the West Bank"; and $300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza following January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas. The humanitarian aid to Gaza would be distributed primarily through U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The strategy, according to State Department officials, was to specifically make sure the money did not go to Hamas. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 30, Clinton assured that disbursement of the money "will be implemented with stringent requirements to prevent aid from being diverted into the wrong hands." Translation: Hamas. Some have argued, however, that the aid, while not going directly to Hamas, would still benefit them. "Whatever officials in Washington might intend, the Obama administration's new Gaza aid package is likely to turn out to be a financial boon for Hamas, which wields actual physical control over the places the aid is destined to go," wrote Ilan Berman, vice president for foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, in an April commentary distributed by Tribune Media Services. Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in U.S.-Middle East policy, said there are legitimate concerns about aid ending up in the hands of Hamas. The problem, he said, is that supposed nongovernmental groups that purport not to have ties with Hamas sometimes do. "We have yet to devise a foolproof system to ensure that money doesn't bleed out," Cook said. Still, he said, it's a wild distortion to claim that the United States has offered Hamas $900 million. First of all, most of the $900 million is going to the West Bank, not Gaza. And while some of the humanitarian aid disbursed through U.N. and other nongovernmental agencies could "bleed out" to Hamas unintentionally, that's far different from giving money directly to Hamas. Not only that, but the claim that the money would be used to "rebuild" Gaza after January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas is also misleading. The money to Gaza is for humanitarian aid — food, medicine, repairing damaged infrastructure, removing rubble, etc. It is specifically not for reconstruction, he said, as Israel was concerned that reconstruction money might be used to build tunnels, weapons factories or the like. "I'd give this one a D-minus," Cook said of the GOP claim. We agree that it's possible that even with safeguards, some of the humanitarian money could wind up in the hands of Hamas. But when you read the GOP survey, you are left with the impression that the U.S. government intends to write a big, fat $900 million check that says "Pay to the order of Hamas." To the contrary, Washington is taking steps to try to specifically make sure none of that money winds up in the hands of Hamas. We also note that only $300 million of the $900 million is even going to Gaza, for humanitarian aid. And the money is specifically not to be used for reconstruction. It is limited to humanitarian aid — food, medicine, that kind of thing. So the GOP is wrong on that point too. We rule the RNC's Hamas claim to be False.

pomt-02790	"Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/dec/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-closing-embassy-vatican/	‘Tis the season to make claims about holy matters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is Catholic, tweeted on the day before Thanksgiving, "Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare." Did President Barack Obama close the embassy to the Vatican as a way of sticking it to them over Obamacare? That sounds like some un-divine intervention. But is it the truth? (It would be a venial sin to omit a hat-tip to the Washington Post Fact Checker, which ran a check on this earlier today. CNN also did a fact check earlier.) The Holy See The Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with more than 175 countries. In 1984, the United States and the Vatican established full diplomatic relations, and the Senate confirmed the first ambassador. (Prior to that the United States had diplomatic relations on and off.) No country has an embassy to the Holy See within the Vatican City proper -- all of them are located within the city of Rome, according to the State Department. The current United States embassy is in a converted residential property in Rome, about 1.9 miles from the Vatican. The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See has seven U.S. diplomatic personnel, plus support staff. Its budget is just over $3.5 million, not counting costs associated with the local guard force, state department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told PolitiFact. "The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is, and will remain, among the largest foreign missions to the Holy See," she said. While discussions about embassy security have increased in the wake of the deadly attack on a United States facility in Benghazi, Libya, the idea of relocating the embassy to the Vatican had been considered as long ago as 2005, after the addition to a building at the U.S. embassy compound in Rome, according to an Inspector General report in 2008, when George W. Bush was president. Currently, the embassy to the Vatican isn’t at the same spot as our embassy to Italy. One of the report recommendations for the embassy to the Vatican was to "relocate as soon as possible, with an eye towards cost savings, improved security, and maintaining as much as possible its separate identity to include a separate street address." Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy signed a memo approving the move in March 2013, but news about it swelled suddenly in November as some conservative news outlets criticized the plan. The National Republican Senatorial Committee created a petition to tell "President Obama to leave the American embassy at the Vatican." (NRSC took down the petition about five days later. That drew some fire from liberals, but NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said that’s a normal amount of time for the group to leave up such a petition.) An article in the National Catholic Reporter quoted several envoys who objected to the state department’s plan, including former U.S. Ambassador James Nicholson, a former secretary of Veterans Affairs in the Bush administration and a former chair of the Republican National Committee. He described the move as a "massive downgrade" in United States-Vatican ties. "It's turning this embassy into a stepchild of the embassy to Italy," Nicholson said. "The Holy See is a pivot point for international affairs and a major listening post for the United States," he said, "and to shoehorn (the U.S. delegation) into an office annex inside another embassy is an insult to American Catholics and to the Vatican." Other envoys who served under the first or second President Bush, along with one Clinton administration ambassador -- also objected, the National Catholic Reporter wrote. Current and former ambassadors under Obama supported the move. "I see no diminishing in the importance of the relationship at all," said current U.S. Ambassador Ken Hackett. And Miguel H. Diaz, a former ambassador under Obama, defended the move, saying, "This was done for security and financial reasons, not in any way to undermine and diminish the importance of the Holy See," CNN reported. The embassy shift Two days before Bush’s tweet, the State Department held a conference call with reporters to respond to the news reports. (The State Department didn’t name the official on the conference call.) The official stated that a few years ago, the government purchased land to expand an existing government compound in Rome and now plans to move the embassy there. The compound will have three separate buildings, each with their own entrances on different streets: the Embassy to the Holy See, the Embassy to the Republic of Italy and a U.S. Mission to the United Nations offices in Rome. The physical separation of the entrances is key because the Vatican requires embassies be separate from a country’s mission to Italy. The move was made due to cost and security, the State Department official told reporters. By consolidating operations at one compound, the state department expects to save about $1.4 million a year. The current embassy to the Vatican lacks "the kind of physical security protection that we would like it to have," the official said. "It doesn’t have the setback from the street that is available in its new compound, and … it does not have the level of other security protections, including Marine security guards that are available at the combined U.S. Government compound." The State Department official emphasized that the move does not represent any downsizing of the United States diplomatic assets. "There is no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission," he said. "There is simply a reduction in overhead." Shaun Casey, the special adviser for faith-based community initiatives at the State Department, described security as the No. 1 reason for the move. "The United States is moving the location of the embassy to a building that is safer, bigger, and architecturally more appealing," Casey wrote. "It also is slightly closer to Vatican City. Let me repeat that point: It's closer to Vatican City than the current location." To be precise, the new site will be located 1.78 miles from Vatican City, about one-tenth of a mile closer than the current site. It is expected to open in 2015. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for the Vatican were unsuccessful, but a spokesman for the Vatican told CNN that "the move was well within the Holy See's requirements for embassies and that relations with the United States are far from strained. ... Another Vatican official, not authorized to speak on the record about diplomatic relations, told CNN the Holy See understands security concerns are an issue for some countries and this move is "an exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world." Meanwhile, we found no evidence to support Bush’s speculation that the relocation might have had something to do with the battle between Catholic bishops and the federal government about contraception requirements in Obamacare. (Despite the contraception fight, the bishops have long backed the broader concept of universal health care.) "The Vatican itself said closing this location is not ideal," Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told PolitiFact. "Governor Bush does not believe this move reflects appropriate respect for the U.S. relationship with the Holy See." So what to make of the conflicting accounts about whether the move is a slight to the Vatican? "I think it’s not a big deal," Stephen F. Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America, told PolitiFact. Schneck, who has been to the embassy, called it an "ugly, modernistic residential structure." (Schneck told us he is close to the current ambassador and a couple of past ambassadors, including those that served under Obama and Bush.) "While I wouldn’t actually call it unworkable, it's on a corner so it’s very accessible to street traffic," Schneck said. "I certainly understand the security concerns." Schneck emphasized that the roots of the move predate Obama, since it stems from an inspector general recommendation during Bush’s tenure. And he was dubious of the suggestion that the embassy move is retaliation for the Catholic bishops opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare. "I stand with my Catholic bishops in support of the lawsuits on the contraception mandate," Schneck said. However, the embassy-Obamacare connection is "a ridiculous effort, one of those crazy conspiracy theories to connect dots that make no sense at all." Our ruling Bush said, "Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare." For starters, the United States is not going to "close" its embassy -- it’s relocating it to a place that’s closer to the Vatican and that is more secure, less expensive and more architecturally distinctive. In addition, the move didn’t originate with Obama. It has been in the works since George W. Bush -- Jeb Bush’s brother -- was president. Finally, we found no evidence to support the idea that the relocation was related to battles over Obamacare. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05272	In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed legislation allowing non-citizens who are legal residents to vote in state and local elections.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/27/anastasia-williams/ri-rep-anastasia-williams-says-two-states-alabama-/	Rep. Anastasia Williams went before the House Judiciary Committee May 16 to propose that Rhode Island voters be asked to approve an amendment to the state Constitution that would give voting rights to non-citizens who are legal residents. She said the Ocean State wouldn't be the first to do so. "In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation," she told the committee. That statement surprised us. If non-citizens in Massachusetts were eligible to vote in state and local elections, we thought we would have heard about it. We decided to investigate. In her testimony, Williams said the intent of the proposal "is to give every legal resident of the state of Rhode Island the opportunity to be properly represented" when they are abiding by the law and paying taxes. She asserted that some elected officials won't help residents who aren't registered voters. (She reported that her Cuban mother was a legal resident who declined to seek citizenship out of fear of losing her ties to her country of origin.) Currently, only U.S. citizens can vote in federal, state and local elections in Rhode Island. Under the bill Williams supports, if voters amended the Constitution, legal permanent residents -- holders of the so-called "green card" -- would also be allowed to vote, after 30 days of residency. When we called Williams, she said the information came from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which aids in drafting and researching legislation. House spokesman Larry Berman said the legislative research department made a mistake in a memo to Williams, with the wording suggesting that the proposals had become law in those states. They had not. In the meantime, we spoke with Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Massachusetts secretary of state's office and Julie Sinclair, a lawyer with the elections division of the Alabama secretary of state's office. Both confirmed that only citizens can vote in their states and both said an amendment to the state Constitution would be required to change that. Berman said the research that Williams relied upon from the General Assembly staff had been based on two bills, H-3430 in Massachusetts and SB-256 in Alabama. We tracked them down. The Massachusetts bill never got out of committee and called for permanent resident voting only in the town of Brookline. The reference to the Alabama legislation, a broad immigration bill, is even less relevant. As introduced, it specifically said that only citizens should be allowed to vote, the opposite of how Williams represented it. It did not make any reference to giving voting rights to permanent legal residents. And when it passed the Senate, the reference to who should be allowed to vote had been removed. So not only did the two pieces of legislation not become law, neither sought to give green-card holders the right to vote in statewide elections. Our ruling Rep. Anastasia Williams, advocating for her proposal to extend state and local voting rights to non-citizens who are permanent legal residents, told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, "In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation." Williams said, and House spokesman Larry Berman confirmed, that she was relying on information from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which should be a reliable source. In fact, the information Williams received was inaccurate. Neither state took such action. "At the time I made this statement, I relied on the inaccurate information that was provided to me," Williams said in a comment released Thursday. "This statement was not made intentionally." Said House Speaker Gordon Fox, "It is unfortunate that Representative Williams was quoting inaccurate information provided to her by a staff person and I am addressing this issue internally.". One last thought: we were surprised that a veteran legislator wasn't suspicious about the claim, given that Massachusetts is a neighbor and Alabama is known for having one of the nation's harshest laws against illegal immigrants. We rate her statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-05687	"In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/13/hank-johnson/congressman-roughly-half-super-pac-money-coming-su/	This year’s primary elections are getting so nasty that Lithonia Congressman Hank Johnson has taken to calling them "slimary" elections. In an op-ed on liberal website "The Huffington Post," Johnson, a Democrat, blamed the viciousness on super PACs, political fundraising organizations that can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions alike. "In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations," Johnson wrote in the Feb. 24 article. Those are some big bucks, wealthy people, and generous businesses. We wondered if Johnson got his numbers right. Super PACs became legal after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision. They are an object of ire for those who think they can be used to buy elections and help donors obscure their identities. A Johnson spokesman said the congressman got his data from articles in Politico and Roll Call. The stories, which ran Feb. 8, lay out the findings of "Auctioning Democracy: The Rise of Super PACs & the 2012 Election." The report was authored by left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. It argued that super PACs skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors who hold views that do not represent those held by the broader public. Johnson’s account matched both news accounts’ descriptions of the "Auctioning Democracy" report. One of these descriptions could have been more precise, but they were not unreasonable. From the advent of super PACs to the end of 2011, donors have contributed a total of $181 million in what are called "itemized individual contributions" to super PACs, the report states. These are contributions from donors who give more than $200. Super PACs must report donor names once their contributions pass this threshold. The report did not tally contributions by small donors, said Adam Lioz, a Demos official and an author of the report. Demos and U.S. PIRG found that 196 people donated $100,000 or more to super PACs, which is just shy of 200 individuals. Calling them "super-rich" is polarizing, but it’s reasonable to assume that people who can afford to make a $100,000 donation have unusually high incomes. We used the report’s findings to calculate that donations of the "super-rich" amounted to about 43 percent of total contributions. This is some 7 percentage points lower than the "roughly half" figure that Johnson used. For-profit businesses contributed 17 percent of itemized donations, the report states. This is just shy of the 20 percent Johnson cited. We checked with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparency in government. It is the source of much of the data used in the report, so we wanted to get the organization’s take on the numbers. A spokesman said they found no problems with the conclusions of "Auctioning Democracy." But for the sake of due diligence, we compared the report’s numbers to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics, which keeps a rolling tally of super PAC contributions on its website OpenSecrets.org. The data from the CRP and the "Auctioning Democracy" report are not easy to compare. They track contributions over different time periods, and the CRP tallies a broader pool of contributions. However, we felt an analysis of the CRP data would give us a rough sense of whether Demos and U.S. PIRG overstated their results to make their case. First, we looked at the CRP’s count of total super PAC donations. From 2010 to late February, about $215 million had been donated to super PACs, according to the CRP data. This is about $35 million -- or 20 percent -- more than the data published in "Auctioning Democracy," but this difference did not signal major flaws. The CRP’s number should be significantly higher than the figures in "Auctioning Democracy." The report excludes donations of $200 or less as well as contributions for the 2012 calendar year. The CRP includes them. Next, we looked at whether "roughly half" of super PAC donations came from 200 "super-rich" people. The CRP publishes a list of the top 100 super PAC donors for the 2012 election cycle on its website. We found they donated about $74 million so far, or 57 percent of the cycle’s $130 million total. The count in "Auctioning Democracy" was lower, which suggests that Demos and U.S. PIRG did not overstate the significance of donations from the "super-rich." We had difficulty using the CRP’s data to check corporate or business donations. The CRP’s Web page lists too few organizations, and does not distinguish between for-profit businesses and groups such as labor unions or advocacy organizations. Our ruling Johnson wrote that "[i]n the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations." On balance, Johnson’s claim reflects the findings of a report by two advocacy groups that are critical of super PACs. The statistics Johnson uses also make sense in light of data published by a separate group. We give Johnson a True.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2012-03-13T06:00:00	2012-02-24	['None']
pomt-06694	Rail "doesn’t do a great job in lessening traffic."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/06/chip-rogers/does-commuter-rail-ease-traffic/	The vote may be a year away, but politicians are already taking sides on a bid to raise taxes for more roads and rail in metro Atlanta. If it passes, the 2012 transportation referendum would bring more than $6 billion for a regional project list for the gridlocked area, possibly including a new rail line between Cobb County and Midtown. So far, though, political leaders in car-centric Cobb are less than thrilled, according to an Aug. 23 article in The Marietta Daily Journal. State Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers is thinking about voting "no" on the 1-percent, 10-year sales tax. "We know that rail offers some things that you can't get from just building roads, but we also know that rail doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic," Rogers said. "And at a time when we need traffic to be lessened significantly, I don't know that we would put 55 percent of all our resources into that alone." Rogerswas referring to the 55 percent-45 percent split for mass transit -- which includes rail and buses -- to roads in the metro Atlanta project list for the 2012 transportation referendum. The list is a draft that faces further approval. Rogers, whose Woodstock district also includes portions of Cobb County, expanded on his remarks in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. He cited a number of studies to make his point. "While I readily admit that transit may have a number of benefits that should be considered for infrastructure investment, relieving traffic congestion is not one of the major benefits," he wrote. Rail doesn’t do a great job of reducing traffic? Doesn’t rail get cars off the roads? Transportation experts said that rail’s impact is difficult to suss out. Congestion is influenced by so many variables, including population growth, the economy and geography, that researchers differ on rail’s exact impact. On its face, the problem seems simple. If a person who commutes alone by car takes the train instead, then that’s one less car on the road. But multiple experts told PolitiFact Georgia that even if thousands of drivers take the train rather than a major road, congestion on that road doesn’t end. It might drop initially, but travelers soon notice the better traffic. Commuters who once avoided the road return. Others take additional trips, or start using it during peak traffic times. People who carpooled start commuting alone. Eventually, congestion returns, said Anthony Downs, a Brookings Institution fellow who has studied traffic congestion for decades. He thinks congestion is extremely hard to avoid, and will likely grow worse. Brookings is a liberal-leaning think tank. Rogershas a point, he said. "He is correct, but he is stating it very simply," Downs said. For instance, a 2009 University of Toronto study that analyzed interstate highway and vehicle travel data across the U.S. found there is little evidence that additional public transit reduces traffic. Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. But there’s another important side to the traffic conundrum, and Rogers didn’t address it. Decades of research shows that additional highway lanes don’t end gridlock, either. As with rail, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, they’re stuck in traffic. "Nothing solves the congestion problem. Neither option [cars or rail] takes precedent," said Catherine Ross, director of Georgia Tech’s Center for Quality Growth. A past board member of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, she thinks rail can create better commutes and improve a region’s overall quality of life. Some experts told PolitiFact Georgia that this does not mean rail has no chance of impacting traffic. Downs noted that if a city built a rail line alongside a major roadway with stops at busy exits, it could have a shot. And University of California at Berkeley Professor Robert Cervero said that such a line can have an especially big impact on congestion during rush hour because research shows rail carries a large share of travelers during those times. Indeed, a 2003 report published by the World Bank on 14 cities suggests that transit, including rail, does have a modest impact on congestion. People drive even less if a city has many characteristics that make using transit more attractive, such as high density and easy access. One expert argued that rail could have a major impact on traffic. Professor Vukan Vuchic, a University of Pennsylvania professor of city and regional planning, said that a long-term transportation and development plan that encourages drivers to use transit and makes it inconvenient to drive could reduce congestion. And speaking of inconvenient places to drive -- consider New York City. Experts noted that its rail helps the city accommodate far more travelers than the roads could. This avoids gridlock that those travelers would create. In the end, though, the bulk of the experts we interviewed agreed that the one tested way to cut down on gridlock is "congestion pricing." That’s when drivers pay a surcharge to use roads during peak traffic hours. Cities such as London and Singapore have used the strategy and eased downtown traffic. How do we rule? Rogers’ claim was that rail "doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic," and there is a great deal of truth to this. A rail line can do many things. It can take drivers off the road. A well-designed line has a shot at impacting congestion. And if a city or neighborhood is especially dense and designed around rail, it can’t prosper without it. But rail alone cannot end congestion. A few experts argue that it does little to nothing. That said, Rogers left out an important fact that might have opened his take on the transportation tax to obvious criticism: No increase in capacity -- not even the construction of new road lanes -- can end congestion. Roads and rail have similar effects. Rogers’ statement is accurate, but could have used a little more context. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-12266	Spicer: "Trump has the legal right to cancel SCOTUS because they serve at his pleasure"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/blog-posting/its-fake-news-president-can-disband-supreme-court/	A June 21 fake news story on USPOLN.com reported that White house press secretary Sean Spicer declared that the president holds the power to disband the U.S. Supreme Court. "President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision," Spicer is quoted as saying in the story. The story claims Spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing, in which he also announced Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a U.S. Navy ship wreckage and of a terrorist attack in London. The press conference the post references indeed took place, on June 19. While it was not televised, a transcript was shared on the White House website. Spicer did offer the White House’s condolences to the victims and said Mueller’s fate was in Trump’s hands, but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the Supreme Court. In fact, the Supreme Court was not mentioned during the briefing. The story manipulated Spicer’s quote that "everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the President," referring to the fact that Mueller’s superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, ultimately answers to the president. The Supreme Court, however, does not. The checks and balances put in place by the U.S. Constitution are designed to ensure equilibrium of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches — that means one branch can’t just shut down another. The Constitution prohibits the president from firing a justice, much less all nine of them, or disbanding the institution they represent. It also hands power over to the courts to decide on the legality of an executive action. The president may nominate Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges, although these must be vetted by the Senate. Neil Gorsuch is the only Supreme Court justice Trump has appointed so far. The website that published the story did not respond to a request for comment, but it does contain a disclaimer published in the "about us" tab. "USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist," the disclaimer reads. "These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." While some of the details about the press conference are correct, Spicer’s comments about the presidential ability to disband the courts is complete and total baloney.

The money, it turns out, was tucked into the Department of Corrections budget. Here's the exact language: "From the funds in Specific Appropriations 595 through 688A, $250,000 in recurring general revenue funds is provided to the Department of Corrections to issue a request for proposal, as defined in section 287.057(1)(b), Florida Statutes, for the development of a water savings plan that creates performance standards for rain water harvesting and water reuse to achieve annual cost savings of at least 25 percent from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 calendar years. By no later than September 30, 2011, the department shall identify a vendor to conduct and inventory the water consumption of all department facilities consuming water for irrigation, gray water or drinking water purposes, including an inventory of each facility’s roof surface area. To achieve these cost savings objectives, the vendor shall submit a plan to the department by February 1, 2012, which identifies the most cost-effective plan for the procurement of services and cistern products and establishes performance standards for the efficient and effective use of water resources and estimates of future potential savings and other related benefits." In short, the $250,000 was to be spent to develop a plan to catch and collect rain water so that it could lower prison water costs by 25 percent. So while developing the plan would have cost the state $250,000, the idea was to save the state some money on water costs -- we don't know how much (and asked the Department of Corrections, for the record, but did not hear back). "I'm sure most Floridians believe as I do that spending $250,000 on education materials for our kids is more important that spending a quarter of a million dollars to learn how to catch rainwater," Scott said in announcing the veto. Where did the request for the money come from? Not the Department of Corrections, said spokeswoman Gretl Plesinger. Plesinger said the money was not included in the department's legislative budget request. And the money was not included in the version of the budget that initially passed the House. In fact, it seems the idea came from someone in the Senate. The water savings plan was included in the original Senate budget proposal, and remained in the budget that the Senate initially passed. Actually, the Senate proposed spending $500,000 on the creation of the water savings plan. The amount was lowered to $250,000 as part of negotiations between the House and Senate. There's no doubt, then, that Scott was right, that included in the 2011-12 budget was a $250,000 appropriation to develop a plan to catch and collect water (he said "learn"). But there's an important note that he left out in announcing his budget vetoes. The budget language that included the appropriation said the water savings plan was supposed to reduce prison water costs by 25 percent. The savings could have offset or at least cut into the upfront investment. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-05-27T15:46:55	2011-05-26	['None']

pomt-03650	Long-term federal investment in U.S. airports is urgent because "there was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-no-airports-ranked-top-25/	During a press conference on April 30, 2013, President Barack Obama addressed a number of high-profile issues, including the fighting in Syria, the Boston Marathon attack, immigration legislation and the across-the-board cuts to federal spending known as the sequester. On the sequester, Obama expressed his ambivalence about signing a bill that passed Congress a few days earlier. The bill, which would ease the sequester’s hit on the Federal Aviation Administration, moved quickly through the House and Senate amid public frustration. The flight delays stemmed from cuts to air traffic control staffing; the bill shifted $253 million from an airport improvement fund to the air traffic control system. Obama said the pressure on air travelers left him with little choice but to sign the bill, but he also decried the piecemeal approach to solving the nation’s budget and infrastructure challenges. If lawmakers were "seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety," Obama said, "then they shouldn't just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that. They should be thinking about what's going to be happening five years from now, 10 years from now or 15 years from now. … How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education?" Obama added: "There was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future?" We wondered whether this survey really showed U.S. airports to be such a dismal lot. As it turns out, Obama got the numbers right. He was referring to the World Airport Awards, an independent, annual survey of 12 million travelers that ranks nearly 400 airports. The survey has been conducted by a British-based firm called Skytrax since 1999. The top-ranked U.S. airport in the group’s 2013 survey was indeed Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in the 30th spot. The airports ranking higher than that include a dozen in Asia (including the top two, Singapore Changi Airport and Incheon International Airport), seven in Europe, three in Africa, two in Australia, and just one in North America (Vancouver International Airport, at No. 8). In all, 17 U.S. airports cracked the top 100, with Denver 36th, San Francisco 40th, Atlanta 48th and none of the rest ending up higher than 50th. The 2013 results were not a fluke: We checked the 2012 and 2011 surveys as well and found that the top U.S. airport in both years was also Cincinnati, ranking 24th. We checked with Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, a trade group for airports, to see what she thought of the rankings. She began by expressing skepticism about the survey’s rigor. (The firm says it surveys passengers online and by phone and uses systems to detect fraudulent submissions.) She added that the U.S. faces some stiff challenges competing in a global comparison of this sort. "Major international hubs in the U.S. are sometimes hampered by long immigration and security queues, which would hurt their rankings in comparison to an airport with primarily domestic service, such as Cincinnati," Gittens said. Cincinnati, which outperformed no fewer than 50 U.S. airports that have larger traffic, is hardly an international hub on the scale of New York’s JFK, Los Angeles or Miami. Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax, agreed. He said the U.S. may be suffering in the survey because of the importance of security processing and immigration to many passengers -- "not just actual waiting times, but also traveler treatment in these areas." Gittens added that U.S. airports have a hard time competing with newer airports in Asia. In many countries, she said, "the national governments see their airports as key assets for their economic vitality and strive to make the visitors’ journey through the airport as smooth as possible." So the rankings Obama cited should be taken with a grain of salt. More important, the rankings don’t entirely support the president’s argument that the federal government needs to spend more money "rebuilding our airports" and providing for "passenger convenience and safety." Of the 39 factors that went into the survey’s rankings, we count only 13 that address airport capital improvements -- projects like terminal and waiting-area design, signage, public transit access, ease of navigation, and baggage-handling systems. Another five factors in the survey involve security. This leaves a slight majority of factors that concern amenities and hospitality -- factors such as choice of bars, shopping options, restaurant prices, entertainment facilities, washroom cleanliness, availability of luggage trolleys, and "friendliness of airport staff." "The survey covers a wide cross-section of amenities and facilities at every airport, but it is true to say that one of the most prominent sections is the focus on service, staff, convenience, and waiting times," said Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax. "These are the issues that are of prime importance to travelers, and which cause the biggest distinction between airports worldwide." Our ruling Obama said the United States needs to invest more in its airports over the long term in part because "there was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25." He is spot-on about the rankings, but the survey in question offers only imperfect support for the argument that the federal government should invest more in its airports, since the survey measures not just major infrastructure aspects of airports (which the federal government would help fund) but also passenger amenities (something the government would not get directly involved in). We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-05-01T11:50:30	2013-04-30	['United_States']

pomt-03789	The national debt is "larger than our entire annual economy."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/28/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-says-national-debt-larger-our-entir/	Budget-cutting is a favorite theme for Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan, a former Republican Study Committee chairman with the most conservative voting record of any Ohio Congress member. Jordan has frequently opined that the controversial sequester budget cuts implemented on March 1 are a positive step toward reining in out-of-control government spending. On March 19, the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending that Jordan chairs held a hearing on how several government departments decided where to make cuts required by the sequester. At the hearing, Republicans and Democrats blamed each other for the $85 billion in cuts to government programs that were implemented after Congress failed to agree on an alternative. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's representative to Congress, rattled off the list of cuts to agencies testifying before the hearing: $2 billion to the Agriculture Department, $551 million to the Commerce Department, and $17 million to the Federal Communication Commission and concluded: "This hearing really should be entitled: 'Sequestration Oversight; What Were House Republicans Thinking.'" Jordan responded to her speech by saying: "The reason we support reducing spending in sequestration is because we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy. We do have to cut some spending around this place and we’re finally taking some modest first steps." Jordan’s point about the national debt being larger than the entire U.S. annual economy is becoming a familiar GOP talking point. A few days before Jordan spoke at the hearing, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan made a virtually identical statement in a speech at Washington, D.C.’s Conservative Political Action Conference, saying "Our debt is already bigger than our economy." PolitiFact has examined that statement and several other similar ones, noting that the politicians’ government debt tally included IOUs between government agencies, which don’t affect the wider economy and credit markets as much as publicly held debt, which totals 75 percent of GDP. To find the size of the economy, PolitifFact national cited a Feb. 28, 2013 news release from The Bureau of Economic Analysis that put the GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. As for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt was $16,708,225,460,175.14. That’s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Here are those dollar figures: Debt held by the public: $11.9 trillion Intragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion To explain the difference, we’ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues’ handiwork. Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters. "Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and international saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans’ income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability," Van de Water wrote in a memo. So, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- which is not larger than the entire economy, as Ryan and Jordan stated. But the pair aren’t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings. "When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They’re both right," said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. When we asked Jordan’s press secretary if there was additional information that PolitiFact Ohio should consider in evaluating her boss’ assertion, she replied: "The facts are correct behind Rep. Jordan’s statement: economy - $15.8 trillion, debt - $16.7 trillion." Jordan claimed "we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy." If you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy, which makes his statement accurate. But the debt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending and the economy. With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13751	Says unlike Tim Kaine, who "invested" in education, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "slashed education funding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-mike-pence-slashed-education-/	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both picked men with executive experience as their running mates. Mike Pence, Trump’s vice presidential pick, is the governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine, running alongside Clinton, served as Virginia’s governor from 2006 to 2010. Clinton compared their gubernatorial records at a July 23 rally in Miami. "While Mike Pence slashed education funding in Indiana and gave more tax cuts to the wealthiest, Tim Kaine cut his own salary and invested in education from pre-K through college and beyond," she said. There’s a lot to unpack in there. We were especially curious, though, about Clinton’s comparison of their education records. At the Republican National Convention, Pence said that as Indiana’s governor, he has made "record investments in education," and we rated that claim Half True. We found that Clinton’s claim that Kaine "invested" in education while Pence "slashed education funding" is an exaggeration at best. Pence Indiana has not "slashed" education funding under Pence’s leadership. In fact, it’s been on the rise every year since Pence took office in 2013. Not adjusting for inflation, Indiana state spending for K-12 and higher education combined hit record highs in 2014 through the current year, according to data compiled by Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University. When adjusted for inflation, the rise isn’t so dramatic, but it’s still there. (For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.) Create your own infographics The Clinton campaign pointed out that Pence asked universities to cut their state spending by 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to account for a revenue shortfall. And the 2015 state budget took money from some urban school districts and redistributed them to suburban districts, which some commentators saw as disproportionately benefiting wealthier students. Pence did, though, successfully push for $15 million to fund a preschool program for poor families. Kaine Education spending in Virginia actually went down under Kaine, who served as governor from 2006 through 2010. However, Kaine took office in a relatively healthy economy that soon gave way to the recession in 2007, which squeezed state budgets across the country. In raw dollars, state spending on K-12 and higher education under Kaine increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009, to a high of $7.5 billion, according to figures compiled by Chris Duncombe, a policy analyst at the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal Virginia think tank. There was a very slight dip in 2008 when adjusting the figures for inflation. Then in 2010, it fell to $6.8 billion, and that includes $365 million from the federal government to support the economic recovery. Create line charts The Clinton campaign said Kaine expanded pre-kindergarten programs, and he signed a 2006 bond bill that set out to provide $1.5 billion for construction projects at Virginia colleges and universities. The campaign also noted that in 2006, Kaine signed a bill to establish a framework for bringing Virginia teacher salaries up to the national average. However, the state ended up having to rescind a 2 percent raise for state employees and teachers before it went into effect in 2008 in the wake of the recession. "Sen. Kaine was dealt a poor hand to fund public education, or anything else for that matter," said Richard Salmon, a professor emeritus and expert in public education at Virginia Tech. "However, the funding reductions that befell public schools have not been attributed to Sen. Kaine by supporters of public education, and most feel that the reductions would have been even more severe if someone else had been governor," Salmon said. Salmon noted that public school funding still hasn’t fully recovered from the recession cuts. Our ruling Clinton said that unlike Tim Kaine, who "invested" in education in Virginia, Mike Pence "slashed education funding" in Indiana. The clear implication from Clinton’s statement is that Pence cut education in Indiana while Kaine grew it in Virginia. That sends voters an inaccurate message. Pence made various individual cuts and investments in education, but overall state spending has increased every year in his term so far. Kaine made notable investments in certain educational projects as Virginia’s governor, but state education spending shrunk overall throughout his term. However, this was primarily because the recession caused massive budget shortfalls.
